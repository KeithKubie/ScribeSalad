1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600
Let me,
let me sort of try to frame this a different way.
Um,

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.520
alcohol reduces blood pressure.
Okay.
Alcohol in,
you know,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
generally tends to reduce cardiovascular events for people.
Um,

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.040
and during prohibition you could actually get a doctor's note for alcohol as a

5
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.300
medicine,
but alcohol is not a medicine.
Okay.
It's a recreational intoxicant.

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.920
It has some positive biological qualities and some negative biological
qualities.

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.370
And you know,
there was an argument I think you intend to 20 years ago.

8
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:33.630
Should we recommend that people drink moderately one to two drinks a day.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.220
And I think for the most part,
uh,

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.180
the medical profession has calmed down on the side of saying,
let's not do that.

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.070
There's too many noncardiac uh,
negative side effects with alcohol.

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.410
Just on that note though,
Alex in Canada right now,

13
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:51.411
I know the safe alcohol drinking guidelines or 14 drinks week nine drinks a week

14
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.400
for,
for women say,
you know,
basically to sue a day for men,
one for women.

15
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.590
So you're saying,
okay,
like there's,

16
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:03.240
we don't see huge negative consequences at that level.
Okay.
That's,

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.740
that's fine.
That's a totally reasonable way to think about alcohol.

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.650
But what we're not saying to people is this is a medicine.

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.090
And I think that's where the confusion around really around high THC,

20
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.250
cannabis lies.
And I,
and again,

21
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.170
I don't mean to say that your friend's child is not benefiting.
I if you say,

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.210
uh,
he or she's benefiting.
I believe you.

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.390
What I'm saying is that that's not good enough for science.

24
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.820
We need randomized controlled trials.

25
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
And when those trials have been done and a lot of them have been done,
Joe,

26
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.230
a lot of them have been done.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
They've almost unequivocally shown that cannabis doesn't work as a medicine,

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.480
the only actual place where beyond these sort of very limited conditions like

29
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.280
chemotherapy associated nausea,

30
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:48.180
which obviously is terrible for people who have it,
but isn't,
isn't that common?

31
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.350
Fortunately,
um,
cannabis has been shown to work as a pain reliever,
right?

32
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.530
Probably for the same reasons that alcohol works as a pain reliever sort of

33
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:57.150
dulls your awareness of your pain.

34
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.550
But even in that study or in those,
even in those studies,

35
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.350
they're mostly done against placebo,

36
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.490
not against opioids or against and ceds like Ibuprofen.

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And there was a very big study for cannabis use in chronic pain over a multi

38
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.680
year period,
uh,

39
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.760
in Australia that came out last year that showed that people who used cannabis

40
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.190
had a,
uh,

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.160
had more pain and use more opiates at the end of four years,

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.510
then people who didn't.
So the,
so I,
I,

43
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.020
we're almost arguing about what medicine is.
Yeah.

44
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.590
That study though had a lot of flaws in it.

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.940
And the other thing is that you need to look at someone who is already using

46
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:42.000
cannabis versus someone who is just using opioids.

47
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.620
So if someone is just using opioids and they want to come off cannabis,

48
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.080
um,
you know,
there's mole come off opiates,
sorry,
sorry,

49
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.210
come off of opiates with cannabis use.

50
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.750
Multiple studies have shown that that that can be,
uh,
effective.

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.500
And that's not what was done in the Australian study that you're referring to.

52
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.850
It's a more approach.
Right.
And,
and also too,
you know,
they,

53
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.550
they didn't have access to medical marijuana during that whole,

54
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.840
during that whole time.
Right.

55
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.970
So those are all self reported and they were getting it from,
you know,

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.470
recreational sources.
They weren't getting it from.
That's a big,

57
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.210
that's a big distinction though Alex.

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:19.210
Like they weren't getting it from a doctor who prescribed it.
Two of them.

59
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.020
They were,
they were,

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.460
this is a self report it study and people were getting cannabis that you know,

61
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.180
they didn't really know what they were getting.
It wasn't a,

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.850
they weren't given any information from a doctor and that's why it's a medicine

63
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.280
Alex,
because you can tell someone,

64
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:38.230
you can tell a patient to take a certain amount of CBD every single day and when

65
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.880
you take a certain amount every single day,

66
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.270
it can reduce your symptoms and sometimes you need to increase that and

67
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.260
sometimes you need to decrease that.
We do that with all medicines.

68
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.870
Should be really clear about the distinction though,
between CBD and marijuana.

69
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.790
I mean we're really talking about the psychoactive version of it,
right?

70
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.480
This is where,
where you're saying it's negative,
you're not,

71
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
you're not really arguing that
dr hardest talking about,

72
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.370
he's talking about using this as a medicine.
Certainly using the CVD.

73
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.880
He's titrating his patients,
he's monitoring,

74
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.180
he's not writing them an authorization and st come back in a year when it,

75
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.480
when it's up,
he's,
he's,
he's being a physician and you know,

76
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:18.130
and I think to the extent that marijuana is medicine,
we want people like him.

77
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.250
So you are admitted to medicine?
No,
no,
no.
I don't admit that,

78
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.310
but he just said that.
I don't think I just said that

79
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.440
cause I think I said to the extent,
I'm trying to stop doing that.
Um,

80
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.763
uh,
but you know,

81
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.140
I think you said something else that was really interesting to me.

82
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.260
And this came up in the book too.
So you're a clinician,

83
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.310
you see sick people and you know,
it's funny,
my wife's a doctor too.

84
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:44.260
She's a psychiatrist.
That's how I sort of got hidden this.

85
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.070
But my wife is a forensic psychiatrist less than a clinician these days.

86
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Her job is to evaluate people,
not so much to treat people.

87
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.100
Your job is to treat people.
You see sick people.

88
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.210
You want to help them feel better and you don't want to tell them,

89
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.130
there's nothing I can do for you.
There's nothing there.

90
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.770
There's no hope for your pain.
There's no hope for your PTSD.

91
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.590
You want to help them.
And I totally get that.

92
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.850
But if you're an epidemiologist or a researcher who's,

93
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.590
who's trying to guide the,
you know,

94
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.250
the views and the medical practice of hundreds of thousands of doctors,

95
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.210
that's not good enough.
So you need to step back.
And I think,

96
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.200
I think you know this,
this epidemiologist in in Britain who I talked to,

97
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.550
he said to me,
he said,
you know,

98
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.780
I try not to draw conclusions because so often when I try to draw them,

99
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.160
I'm wrong.
Yeah.
And we need to be careful about that.
Right.

100
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:37.570
And Alex,
you know,
you know,
one thing that was mentioned in your book,
um,

101
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.460
you know,
it was that,
you know,
you often,

102
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.060
you often cite at the national academies of Science and Engineering,
right?
But,

103
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.810
you know,
Ziva Cooper,
you know,
she's a member of that committee.
I mean,

104
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.720
she put out on our Twitter,
I mean,
you can go to it.

105
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.721
It's from January 9th of 2019 she says in response in the recent year times

106
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.040
editorial on cannabis and as a committee,
which can,

107
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 1>which by the way that,
let me finish,</v>

108
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.280
let me finish people context of where it came from.
Right.

109
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.740
But this is someone you site.
Yep.
No,
I didn't cite her.

110
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:11.540
I cited you cited that the report and she's a member of that,
of that.
Okay.

111
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.860
So she said in response to the recent New York Times editorial on canvas and as

112
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.120
a committee member on NASA,
which is that committee and can adenoids report,

113
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.990
we did not conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia.

114
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.060
Then the drug alliance policy also said the report did not reach that

115
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.760
conclusion.
So you know,
those are pretty too authoritative,
uh,
you know,

116
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.950
sources that they're saying that,
you know,

117
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.770
in your book you didn't cite the research properly.
Right.

118
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.160
And then also they're saying that you left a lot out,
right?

119
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:47.780
They said that they have found an association between marijuana use and improved

120
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.190
cognitive outcomes in individuals with psychotic disorders that straight from

121
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.970
the same report.
And you know,
you failed to mention that.
Right?

122
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.650
So I think that,
you know,

123
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.850
when we're writing books or when we're giving out information,
you know,

124
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.760
you want to do it from a balanced approach and you don't want to just select,

125
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.360
you know,
the small amount of,

126
00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:09.590
of material that's just going to support your study.
You know,

127
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:13.040
we want to be truthful here.
You know,
Joe's show is all had been very,

128
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.470
very truthful.
I mean,
Joe said,
right,
right at the beginning,

129
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:16.910
he doesn't think that,
uh,
that,

130
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:20.510
that cannabis is perfect for everyone and I don't think that either.

131
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:24.950
And in Canada,
you know,
we have really strict guidelines to follow.
Um,
you know,

132
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.270
basically no one prescribes to seed anyone under the age of,
uh,

133
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.970
of 25 and,
you know,
all the conferences and stuff that I go to,
you know,

134
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.200
we don't really have too many discussions about that.

135
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.130
Like the doctors don't really have many,
you know,
much of a backlash about that.

136
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.300
Um,
so why,
why is the distinction the age of 25 whether they decide that age?

137
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.440
So 25,

138
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.580
basically is when your brain is fully developed.

139
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.380
And when you do look at the studies that do show you an association between,

140
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:59.120
between cannabis and psychosis,
it's almost all in adolescence.
You know,

141
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.830
I think that Alex only has one study,
um,
and,

142
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.400
and his and his book that shows an extremely weak correlation between,
um,

143
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.170
an adult using cannabis and then developing any type of mental illness later.
So,

144
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.920
you know,
25,
um,
is,
is a,
is a good age,

145
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:20.870
but it's definitely a kind of a conservative ish,
ish age.
But,

146
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.530
you know,
it's something that we fall and I think that,
you know,

147
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.050
we've done well with that in Canada.
So Alex,
why did you leave those conclusions?

148
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.310
<v 0>I need to push back here.
Okay.
Um,
so the National Academy of Medicine Report,</v>

149
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.360
uh,
was,
uh,
drawn up by committee of 16 researchers.
Uh,

150
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.490
Ziva Cooper is the one who's publicly said the report said this.

151
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.540
Uh,
but I think that we should have,
uh,

152
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.080
emphasize that it also said this.
Okay.
What I,

153
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.690
what I wrote in that New York Times op Ed.
Uh,

154
00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:55.680
what I wrote in the book is the plain language of the report and the plain

155
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.660
language is this cannabis use is associated with a risk of developing

156
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:04.770
schizophrenia and other psychosis.
The higher the use,
the greater the risk.

157
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.230
I may have a word or two wrong in that cause I'm doing it from memory,

158
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:11.520
but that's what it said.
And by the way,
the committee was very clear.

159
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.460
They separated a depression.

160
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:18.510
They said there we don't see as nearly as high risk for depression and
psychosis.

161
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.010
Uh,
even though by the way today,
just today,
uh,
Gemma Psychiatry,

162
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:26.280
the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry,
uh,

163
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.310
put out a Meta analysis showing that cannabis is associated with depression and

164
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:34.170
suicidal thinking,
uh,

165
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.710
and actually suicide attempts at a three and a half to one rate.
This,

166
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:41.250
this literally was released today.
Um,
but to,
but to go back,

167
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.030
Ziva is one of 16 members of that committee.
So if you're going to talk,

168
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.350
you're going to say that I misquoted the report,
which I did,

169
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:50.160
and I quoted entirely accurately.
You need to say,
well,

170
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.760
why aren't the other 15 members of that committee saying that I misquoted.

171
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:58.230
Why is one person who works for the cannabis research initiative at Ucla,

172
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.140
which takes money from cannabis investors and users?

173
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.680
She's the one who said that I misquoted it.
Maybe she,

174
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.400
maybe we should ask why the other members of the committee are not speaking out

175
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.360
against my book.

176
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.730
<v 1>Well,
I think that she was just one of the 16 members that that came out.</v>

177
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:17.510
But you know,
you can't really expect all the other members to,
to potentially,

178
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.560
you know,
come out with that.

179
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.790
<v 0>It's not,
why not?
Well,
some people did something wrong if I misquoted them.</v>

180
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.760
<v 1>Well some people will and some people won't.
You know,
some people have,
you know,</v>

181
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.380
the personality.
Some people have the platform like,
you know what,

182
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.390
Ziva has a bunch of followers on our Twitter.
People know who she is.
You know,

183
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:36.260
a lot of people who do research actually are not into social media at all.

184
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.500
Like I don't think you were at all before you,
you had your book.
Where are you?

185
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.720
Right.
Okay.
So,
so you weren't into social media at all.
So,
you know,

186
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:48.500
I don't think that most people on that committee are,
are into social media.

187
00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:52.700
You know,
Ziva just,
just happens to be,
and I even spoke to Ziva,
uh,

188
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.650
on the phone about this and you know,
and she said that,
yeah,
you know,
I don't,

189
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.770
uh,
that she agrees with everything that was in the report,

190
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.290
but she doesn't agree with your conclusions.

191
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.140
And to go back to what's our quoted from the report,

192
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:10.320
but you're only quoting there,
but you're only quoting the parts that,

193
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.600
that site or sorry that back,
your,
uh,
your opinions,

194
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.720
you're not quoting the entire part like you left.

195
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.620
Like why did you leave out the part that said they have found an association

196
00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:24.950
between marijuana use and improve cognitive outcomes and individuals with

197
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.070
psychotic disorders.
Right.
So you're leaving out that person.

198
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.110
Why did you leave that by that you leave out that part

199
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.670
<v 0>if you can find me a psychiatrist who thinks that it's a good idea for somebody</v>

200
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:37.600
with an active psychotic disorder to that part.
Why did you leave out that part?

201
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.200
Well,
my book presents,
it makes a case,
right?

202
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.560
It makes a case that this is a big issue that we have not heard about at all and

203
00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:49.360
the reasons that we haven't heard about it have a lot to do with the advocacy

204
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.450
community and the way they've presented this data for 25 years.

205
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.470
I a book that is trying to break through a lot of noise,

206
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.720
so but still like to get a balanced approach.

207
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.760
Did you decide that you were only going to say you're only going to write about

208
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:11.761
things that confirm your belief that you held when you were writing this and

209
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:16.360
what you were trying to push in the title of the book and then in the conclusion

210
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.950
of the book?
I think that's a really great question.

211
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.190
I say in the introduction to the book,
this book is not balanced.

212
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.720
There's not a lot of evidence in there.
If you want a fair,

213
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.960
if you want to read about how indican sativa strains are different and you know,

214
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.870
you're not going to read that in this book,
this and,
but I will also,

215
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.100
I also want to say this,

216
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.950
I didn't come at this and I say this in the introduction in the book too,

217
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.430
as an anti cannabis crusader.
In fact,
when my wife said to me,

218
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.240
as she said to me over and over again in 2014 and 15 and 16,

219
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.890
these are the cases that I'm seeing.

220
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.100
These are the terrible things that people are doing after cannabis use.

221
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.260
I sort of said to her,
first of all,

222
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.230
why do I always have to hear about this at the dinner table?

223
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.370
But more importantly,
um,
you know,
why?

224
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.530
Why is it that maybe these people were using other drugs?
Maybe,

225
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.310
maybe you're seeing a slice of the population that that's not representative.

226
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.880
Why is it that I should believe this?
This sounds like reefer madness to me.
And,

227
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:12.760
you know,
ultimately my wife,
who's the one who went to,
you know,
she actually,

228
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.480
as I was talking to doctor heart about this,
she grew up in,
uh,

229
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.090
in Newfoundland to,
uh,

230
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.880
she went to the Memorial University of Newfoundland Medical School and she went

231
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:25.240
to Harvard and Columbia for her postgraduate training.
Uh,
you know,

232
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:28.270
eventually she got tired of me yapping back at her and she said,

233
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:32.080
why don't you go read the studies yourself?
And it was that,
that led me to read,

234
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.450
to write this book because when I read the studies,

235
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.910
I could not believe the strength of the evidence,
Joe.

236
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.300
But you're still even in saying that you're still seeing positive results that

237
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:46.420
you're,
you're excluding.
Again,
there's,
there's this one,

238
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.030
there's this one sentence that means not just one sense,
but,

239
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:54.150
but there are a few sentences about how it may be that cannabis helps people's

240
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.940
positive because it helps,
it helps cognition in people with psychosis.
Maybe,

241
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:05.500
maybe not.
Wouldn't that qualify as medicine?
Uh,
not if it's,
no,

242
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.730
it wouldn't be approved as medicine.

243
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:08.620
If it's causing to have other psychotic episodes.

244
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:13.390
You've got these people have psychotic breaks and improves cognitive function

245
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:15.400
and people with psychotic breaks.
So,

246
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.390
so wouldn't that be something that you would see some prescribed to snow him?
No.

247
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.090
Again,
you need to think about how the FDA is looking at medicine.
No,

248
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:25.870
I understand the FDA's position.
Sure.
But I mean looking at it as medicine,

249
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:29.620
I mean if we could prove this through studies and through some sort of clinical

250
00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:34.540
trials,
if it is improving your Iq two points on a test.
And was that all it is?

251
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.290
I'm not.
I think
I'd have to look at that.
I'm not sure.

252
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.280
But at the same time it's making you literally map.
No,
it's too,

253
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.690
but at the same time it's making you floridly psychotic.
You're not,

254
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.150
that's not medicine.
Well,
it's not necessarily the same time.

255
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:52.150
One of the things that I read about schizophrenia and was that there's people

256
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.010
who are trying to make a correlation between marijuana use in schizophrenia.

257
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:57.500
But the problem with that correlation in what I read,

258
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:58.520
and maybe you could help me on this,

259
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.580
was that it's the exact same number that you find.

260
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.900
The general population is essentially 1% of the general population has

261
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:08.000
schizophrenia,
which is one out of a hundred people.

262
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.250
And when you have marijuana users,

263
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.400
you see is essentially that same number mirrored.

264
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:16.220
And so they're saying that a small number of people hold on,

265
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.310
but it wasn't getting in a small number of people.

266
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.540
What they were saying essentially in what I read was that marijuana use was

267
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.690
associated with the onset of schizophrenia.

268
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.270
But they were disputing this in this study because they were saying,

269
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.110
but because then same number is mirrored in the general population.
Again,

270
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.390
correlation does not equal causation.
Right?
Doctor,

271
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.830
I think you got to tell them that's not true.
So tell me truly what that means.

272
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.510
Traditionally,
yes,
we look at the stats.
You'll see that,
you know,

273
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.130
the people who use cannabis versus the people who don't use cannabis have very

274
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:49.580
similar rates,
but you're getting to the exact rates,
you know.

275
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.920
So in the u s they say that,
uh,

276
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.870
the range if for schizophrenia is between 0.25 to 0.64%.

277
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.490
Globally.
They say it's 0.33 to 0.75%.
So,
you know,

278
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:06.350
right there,
it's,
you know,
apparently lower in in the u s and the u s is,

279
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.400
is,
has the highest percentage of cannabis consumption in the world.

280
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.590
And the US also has a lot of people that are using high potency THC.
So,

281
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.320
you know,
I think that,
you know,
we really need to be,

282
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.500
be careful about throwing out stats like that because you know,

283
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:26.000
when you do look at the stats that we have,
it shows that even though,
uh,

284
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.360
you know,
that there's a lot of cannabis use in the United States,

285
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.070
schizophrenia rates have remained the same.
So I have to push back really hardly.

286
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.080
This is one of the great myths of legalization.
Okay.
Um,

287
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.490
no one knows what the schizophrenia or psychosis rate in the is in the u s

288
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.220
because a lot of people aren't treated.
Oh,
people aren't treated.

289
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:46.550
People get different diagnoses at different times.
And we have,

290
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.450
we have bad health care in this country and we have a lot of protections around

291
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:51.680
mental health.
In fact,

292
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:56.681
in 2017 the national institutes of mental health suddenly changed its estimate

293
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:03.131
for the percentage of people with schizophrenia in the US from 1.1% to 0.3% they

294
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.590
did it with no public notice.
And then this researcher said,
hey,

295
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:10.490
this is a miracle.
They just cured 2 million people with schizophrenia and the,

296
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:13.920
and then in response to that,
the director of the NIH said,
um,

297
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.030
well we actually don't know how many people have schizophrenia in the United

298
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.700
States.
Nobody knows,
nobody knows if the rate is increasing.

299
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.960
Nobody knows if it's decreasing.

300
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.940
The only countries where they can count noses on this with any accuracy.

301
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:26.840
Our northern Europe,

302
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.380
because they have good healthcare because I have slightly less protections

303
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:33.950
around so or individual privacy and mental health privacy.

304
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.570
And so they are able to count cases and in Denmark and Finland,

305
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.830
which are,

306
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.100
which are the two places where they've actually done this research in the last

307
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:43.820
20 years,

308
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.620
they've shown increasing rates of schizophrenia between about 1995 and about

309
00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:53.621
2010 and that goes side by side with increasing rates of cannabis use in the 90s

310
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.630
so the people who are saying that there's no evidence of population wide

311
00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:59.700
increases in psychosis are just wrong.

312
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.430
That's just possible that there's other facts.
Oh,
absolutely.

313
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.660
Environmental factors is a bunch of other different things that,
let me,

314
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.780
let me sit here on this.

315
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:11.640
We absolutely don't have the evidence at this point to say that cannabis use in

316
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:16.140
the u s is causing a population level increase in psychosis and schizophrenia,

317
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:19.200
which are,
by the way,
those are sort of different illnesses and we can,

318
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.490
we can talk about that too.

319
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.460
So we don't have the evidence to say there's a definite increase.

320
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.620
But what I'm saying is that what you have been told that there is no increase in

321
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:32.370
schizophrenia or psychosis rates in the u s that's,

322
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.310
we don't know if that's true or not.
We just don't me ask you this,

323
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:38.970
there has been proven that there's an increase in marijuana use.
Is that correct?

324
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.330
Correct,
absolutely.
How,
when,
when did the increase begin and how,
what,
how,

325
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.400
what percentage increase?
So there was a,

326
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600
there was an increase in the 90s and increase in use and in potency you sort of

327
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:55.761
bottomed out around 1991 and then there was sort of a flat bottomed out mean it

328
00:18:55.891 --> 00:19:00.840
hasn't increased since [inaudible] 91 or [inaudible] 50% since 92 so that's a

329
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:01.920
lot.
That's a lot.

330
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.400
It wouldn't you expect a corresponding increase in schizophrenia if there was

331
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:08.330
any sort of correlation,
hold on,
let me just,
let me walk you through.
Okay.

332
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.610
It bottomed out in the early nineties increased again,

333
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:16.260
increased in the 90s flattened out between about 2000 2006 and since then has

334
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:19.200
been going up again,
especially in let's say the last three,
four years.

335
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.740
And the other thing is that potency in the last 15 years has gone way up.

336
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:26.190
I don't think anybody would dispute that,
but okay.
Has Schizophrenia,
Ghana.

337
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.330
So what I'm saying to you is we don't know,
there is evidence there is,

338
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.680
there is now evidence on a population level basis in those other countries that

339
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:37.380
schizophrenia and psychosis has gone up.

340
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.440
And there's for the first time in 2017,

341
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.840
there's data showing that serious mental illness,

342
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.380
which is not the same as psychosis or schizophrenia in the US,

343
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.560
doubled between 2008 and 2017 in the and the in people aged 18 to 25 and those

344
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:57.390
are the people who are most likely to be using.
So for the first time,

345
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:59.550
there's actually evidence of what you're talking about,

346
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:03.720
which is a population wide increase.
Now again,
I'm not going to say,

347
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.960
can I get you to clarify,
it shouldn't say serious mental health.

348
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.500
So serious mental illness.
So this was defined.
Uh,

349
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.380
there's a study called the national survey on drug use and health.

350
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.860
It's done every year,
cover 70,000 people.
Federal government funds it.

351
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.850
It's sort of the best data source we have on all this stuff.
Um,

352
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.480
it showed that,
and they're not counting cases either.
No.

353
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.970
Let me just be as clear as I can on this.

354
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.840
Nobody's counting schizophrenia in cases on a national or even state level basis

355
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:33.240
in the u s but you say to people,

356
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.790
did you have depression so bad that you couldn't get out of bed?
Did you,

357
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.910
you know,
were you hospitalized this year for a psycho,
for,

358
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.950
for any inpatient psychiatric reason?
And,

359
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.110
and if you look at those numbers in 2008,

360
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.080
3.7%,
I remember it maybe was 3.8% of Americans,

361
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.340
18 to 25 reported,
uh,
at least one symptom.

362
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.550
So they were categorized as having serious mental illness that year in 2017 that

363
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:08.950
number was 7.5%.
So that's a doubling.
So again,

364
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.390
I am not going to say that proves that the increase in cannabis use has caused

365
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:17.470
this,
this population something things.
But something bad has happened.

366
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.570
And if you look at kids 12 to 17,
interestingly,
they,

367
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.470
over that time where we didn't have a big increase in cannabis use in general,

368
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.080
teenagers are actually are pretty healthy now.

369
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:33.520
Although jewel and vaping maybe undoing that and those kids didn't have a

370
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:36.070
population level increase in serious mental illness.

371
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.740
<v 2>Can I stop you for a second there because there's other factors.</v>

372
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.890
One of the big one is,
you've all know Herati has a great book,

373
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:45.160
a 21 lessons for the 21st century.
I read that.
It's great.

374
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:48.410
So one of the things they talk about is the onset of social media.
Uh,

375
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.780
Jonathan Haidt talked about that as well and uh,
that the onset of social media,

376
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:57.340
oh,
he's actually more hate.
And then,
uh,
you've all Herati but the,
uh,

377
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.690
Jonathan Haidt talks about it with young people.
Yeah,
that's American mind.
Yeah.

378
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.040
I think that social media and the pressures of social media have led an

379
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.630
incredible amount of young people to,
uh,
serious mental distress and,
you know,

380
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:11.560
serious anxiety,

381
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:16.561
serious depression and suicide amongst young girls has increased some 50%

382
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:21.850
according to hate.
Um,
over the period of 2007,
two,

383
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:25.000
I think 2000 and whenever his book was written.
Uh,

384
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.140
and I think they're directly correlating that to the pressures of social media

385
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.340
and to,
you know,

386
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:33.370
anonymous online bullying and all these different factors that are affecting

387
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:34.031
kids.
Yeah.

388
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:39.031
So I think that that could be considered a far more significant new,

389
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.290
uh,
form of,
of,

390
00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:46.150
of distress to children and young people then even marijuana.

391
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.250
<v 1>I think it does it twofold because I think that,
you know,</v>

392
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.760
what makes people really depressed maybe more so than,
than anxious,

393
00:22:52.761 --> 00:22:57.070
but definitely both.
Is that when you compare yourself to someone else and yes,

394
00:22:57.071 --> 00:23:00.590
you know,
people,
you know,
obviously that we've done that,
you know,
all,

395
00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:03.680
all humans have done that,
you know,
since since history began.

396
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.650
But now everything is online.

397
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.040
You can compare your life to everyone and that people are doing all the time.

398
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.740
And even worse than that,
and you know when we should talk about this too,

399
00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:15.920
is that the income gap is getting,
is getting water.

400
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.600
So it's like people's lives,
not only are they getting,
you know,
better than,
than,

401
00:23:20.601 --> 00:23:22.940
than other people's lives,
but it's what it now it's on,

402
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.240
it's on display so everyone can see it.
Whereas before,
you know,

403
00:23:26.241 --> 00:23:29.090
maybe you wouldn't have seen it because it wasn't on social media,

404
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.920
but now it's on social media.

405
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.220
So you had this huge income gap that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and

406
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:36.120
bigger.
And then you have people going,

407
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.410
going on social media and they're comparing themselves and you're absolutely

408
00:23:39.411 --> 00:23:43.190
right,
especially in that,
in that age population when people under,

409
00:23:43.191 --> 00:23:47.750
under the age of 30,
you know,
they're,
um,
you know,
they're being bullied online.

410
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:49.460
Like I see it everyday in my office,

411
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:52.520
like literally every day people are being bullied online.

412
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:57.260
And that's something that I never had to deal with,
uh,
growing up.
Um,

413
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.740
and you know,
a lot of kids do have,
do,
have to,
to deal with that.

414
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.180
Just one more note to on,
on the,
uh,
since Colorado has,
has,

415
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:08.510
has legalized cannabis,
is this important for,
for this,
uh,
this,

416
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:10.670
this subject in this topic?
Um,

417
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.880
they've actually seen marijuana rates decrease.

418
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.970
So it's important for people to know that,
you know,
just

419
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.010
to study or overall use or I use has gone up.

420
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.300
Teen years is flat overall uses up.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm talking about teen use that,

421
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:29.870
that,
that,
that's the category that we're talking about under under 30.
Right.

422
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.920
So teen use,
you know,
would,
would classify as part of that category.
So,
you know,

423
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.110
in Colorado we have seen a decrease.

424
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.400
Do you think that's because of the lack of the,
because it's not illegal,

425
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:44.060
it's not as exciting to them?
Part of it for sure.
You know,
and I mean,

426
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.880
part of it like one worry I had,
you know,

427
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:50.400
I haven't looked into the statistics yet was you know,
when,

428
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.890
when you're growing up and,
uh,
when you're in high school,
you know,

429
00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:57.810
if you want to be part of the cool crowd,
so to say,
you know,

430
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.360
you usually drink or you smoke pot,
you know,
that's,
that's what people do.

431
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.350
Um,

432
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:08.120
I hope that that doesn't change because pot scene as medicine,

433
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.790
I hope that,
you know,
people don't,
you know,
move on to or,

434
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.370
or do something you'll harsher because they don't see pot as as cool anymore.

435
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.980
Right.
That is attached to it because it's legal.

436
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.390
<v 0>Yeah.
So I got to push back on it please.</v>

437
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.790
So everything you say about social media is down.
You know,

438
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:26.950
it's sort of intuitively sounds correct.
Right.

439
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.620
The problem is the data doesn't support this at all.

440
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.770
The data shows that teenagers another 12 to 17 those kids are healthier than

441
00:25:36.521 --> 00:25:40.540
they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.
They drink less,
they smoke less,

442
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.410
they have sex later.
The fewer abortions they are healthier.
Okay.

443
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.720
And their mental health doesn't seem to have changed that much based on the NSD

444
00:25:49.721 --> 00:25:50.860
ewh data.
Okay.

445
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:56.070
The data shows a big change in kids 18 to 25 they go to college.

446
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.660
Something goes wrong for a lot of those kids,
at least in the last few years now.

447
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.950
<v 1>But what do you mean when you're talking about suicide rates?</v>

448
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.290
Suicide rates are there.
The,

449
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.460
especially with young girls who are apparently more effected by social media,

450
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.850
they have gone up significantly since the rise of social media.

451
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:17.600
That is the big fan of people who are most likely the second more so than

452
00:26:17.601 --> 00:26:21.020
cannabis use.
And then that's a fact.
So,
so you're,
so you're talking about a tiny,

453
00:26:21.021 --> 00:26:24.050
tiny number of people who know.
No,
it's not a tiny number of people.

454
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:26.540
50% increase of people that commit suicide.

455
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:29.330
They're young girls that people who commit suicide in the United States are

456
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:32.510
middle aged white men.
And that's as a fat girl.
But wait a minute,

457
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:35.720
you're discounting these young girls that are committing suicide to fit your

458
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:39.410
statistics or to fit your conclusions?
No,
what I'm saying is that's a tiny,

459
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:43.380
tiny number,
but it's a 50% increase is not a tiny amount.

460
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:44.010
This is something that we

461
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.590
<v 2>can look up.
Well,
let's find out what the numbers are.
Right?</v>

462
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.430
Because like when Jonathan Haidt was on the podcast and you discussed it,

463
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.690
I mean he showed this chart and it's an alarming increase directly correlating

464
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:58.920
with the increase in use of social media.
Sure.
I am,
by the way,

465
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.810
I'm going to let you push back against that.
So it seems to be a factor.
What I'm,

466
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.330
when I'm pushing back against is the idea that kids 12 to 17 generally are less

467
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:12.090
healthy than they were 10 or 20 years.
If no one's saying they're less healthy,

468
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.390
you just said they're more healthy.
You,
I'm saying they're more healthy,
right?

469
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:15.620
I'm all,

470
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.420
we're saying that Kid's health has nothing to do with cardiovascular and Phil,

471
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.700
I'm answering mentally healthy.

472
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.330
I mean they're less likely to use drugs that are less likely to have sex with

473
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:27.510
them,
more likely to commit suicide.
That is a tiny,
tiny number.

474
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.930
What are you talking about?
If it's 50% increase,
that's a huge difference.

475
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.210
We should look up the number if we're gonna.

476
00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:37.260
If we're gonna just Jonathan hates work is like very well respected.

477
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.070
What I'm saying to you is that there's a clear increase in psychological

478
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:44.850
distress in kids and young adults,
18 to 25 okay.

479
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.530
There's a clear increase and those are the people who are most likely to be

480
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:53.010
using cannabis and people that are most likely on social media as well,

481
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.170
and that's a stressful period of [inaudible] 17 are usually living at home like

482
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.570
18 to 25 then you've got to go to university,

483
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:03.300
you got to deal with all these core sees mood.
You can see the,

484
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:05.790
and I've said it at the beginning of the program that I think the marijuana with

485
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:09.060
some people is not beneficial and in fact could be negative,

486
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:14.330
but I don't understand why you're not willing to admit that social media has a

487
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:19.380
significant and unprecedented impact on young people that we've never seen

488
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:20.910
before.
I would totally agree with that,

489
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:24.900
but I don't think that you can say based on the population level data that the

490
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:26.880
impact is all negative.
It may be,

491
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.280
listen it who's saying that the impact is all negative.

492
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:32.240
What we're saying is it a 50% increase in suicide with young girls?
Right,

493
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.410
but that's huge.
Let me hear here.
Let me give you an example.

494
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:38.460
When you were 15 or I was 15 maybe you got really drunk,
right,

495
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:39.690
and wound up in a bathtub.

496
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.100
Like maybe kids today are less likely to do that because of social media because

497
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.430
they know it's going to be on Instagram forever.
I don't think that's true.

498
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.750
I don't think that's proven.

499
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.820
I don't think there's anything that would point to that.
Well,

500
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.120
what I can tell you is proven is that kids,
today I'm talking about teens,

501
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:02.420
12 to 17 have less psychological distress by all these measures I'm talking

502
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:06.240
about.
Their actual behaviors are better or a better or worse.

503
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:06.991
That's a moral judgment,

504
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:10.500
but they're healthier than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.

505
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:11.820
They're less likely to have sex.

506
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.910
They're less when they're 14 which I think most people say is a good thing.

507
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.300
They're less likely to be drinking.
They're less likely to be smoking.

508
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.170
Those are good things.
Well,
less likely to be drinking,
less likely to be smoking,

509
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:26.670
less likely to have sex does not correlate to positive mental outlook and less

510
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:31.380
suicide.
Well,
yes,
there's,
I agree there we look,
let's look at the numbers.

511
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.460
But depression and suicide at the very difficult things to measure,
right?

512
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.870
Depression,
well,
suicides,
actually suicides [inaudible] it's a hard number.

513
00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:40.740
Depression is a,

514
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:45.730
is at this spike located bottom numbers in females,

515
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.240
so,
okay.
I mean this is what I'm saying.
The death rate,
first of all,
this is,

516
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.440
this is,
okay.

517
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.440
The death rate for girls age 15 to 19 is four per 100,000 jokes at 40 it's at a

518
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.020
40 year high.
Right.
So I mean you'd be hard put to say that's a huge spike.

519
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:06.970
It was three per hundred thousand in 1975 and it's a little bit over four in

520
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:11.860
2015 that's not,
that's one case per 100,000 girls.

521
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.060
Yeah.
I don't know what,
I don't know what the actual facts are.

522
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:19.180
I'm looking at this right now.
The suicide rates for teens,
15 to 19 years.

523
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.840
This is something that we'd have to study.
Sure.
People have this discussion.

524
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:26.950
I'm telling you,
giant spike for boys in the 1990s what the fuck is that?
About?

525
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:31.330
95 one no surprise.
If you put middle aged men on this chart,
you'd have to,

526
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.000
you'd have to blow out the ceiling.
Like people,

527
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:38.350
the suicide crisis is unfortunately a crisis of age.
Okay.

528
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.490
I would agree with that.

529
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:43.450
I think we actually talked about that yesterday with Andrew Yang that a suicide

530
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:46.890
amongst men in their 50s,
and then they start to feel useless.
Yeah.
Yeah.

531
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.150
And especially if they lose their jobs.
Um,

532
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.500
but what Jonathan Haidt is pointing to is a direct correlation between social

533
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:57.160
media use,
depression and suicide amongst young girls.
Um,

534
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.780
thank you for finding out.
What is it?
This is the article.
It's from his,
uh,

535
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.560
from this suicide rate for teen girls.

536
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:07.210
The highest it's been in 40 years is social media to blame.
Right.
So,
okay.

537
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.160
Um,

538
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.420
new data prevented a release Thursday by the Atlanta based Centers for Disease

539
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.960
Control and prevention suicide rates amongst 15 to 19 year old girls doubled

540
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:21.640
between 2007 and 2015 reaching a 40 year high.
I would say that significant.

541
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.620
Again,
I would add,

542
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.270
and it's obviously a terrible thing when anybody commits suicide,

543
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.860
but we're talking about two per 100,000 I understand they actually,
it's,

544
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.240
it's five,
well went from two to four.
Okay.

545
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.500
That means for every 100,000 American girls in 2015 five committed suicide.

546
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.600
That's not a very high number.

547
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:41.890
But I mean that's also someone who pushed to the extreme of taking their life.

548
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.900
How many girls are experiencing severe depression but don't commit suicide.

549
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:52.090
That's the real factor because this is what hate directly connects to social

550
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:54.340
media.
Again,
the 50% increase,

551
00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:57.940
you're talking about a relatively small number because not as many girls commit

552
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:01.570
suicide as men,
but still this could,
you're talking about,

553
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:03.220
you were talking about depression,
right?

554
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.530
And you were talking about the significant factors that would lead people to be,

555
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.620
to have poor mental health.
This could be a huge factor in this.

556
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:14.200
Right,
and I think that too,
it leads people to,
you know,

557
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:17.680
suicidal ideations and depression and anxiety.
Me Right here,

558
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:22.160
we're just looking at seaside,
which is the worst possible,

559
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.210
which is very rare amongst girls periods or less common or just yes,

560
00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:30.840
men,
men do commit suicide more than women do.
But you know,

561
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:35.650
we really have to be careful about that because you know,
again,
suicide is,

562
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:40.100
is the aim.
That's the worst thing that could possibly happen.
So what about,
you

563
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.190
<v 1>know,
all,
all the,
uh,
all the things leading up to it,
you know,</v>

564
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:46.090
are there people who are,
who don't commit suicide but you know,

565
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.250
suffer from terrible depression,
suffer from terrible anxiety,

566
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:51.320
suffer from terrible insomnia,
you know,

567
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.380
those people are not accounted for in that graph.

568
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.660
<v 0>I,
I agree.</v>

569
00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.610
And when I'm saying is that cannabis use has spiked in the United States in the

570
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:04.080
last 15 years and teens not withstanding,

571
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.200
we've seen a large degradation in a number of these social outcomes.
And now,

572
00:33:08.201 --> 00:33:12.430
just today we have a Jama Psychiatry paper that looked at a bunch of other

573
00:33:12.431 --> 00:33:17.431
studies that said cannabis use in teenagers is associated with depression,

574
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.030
suicidal ideation,

575
00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:23.650
and suicide attempts in people once they get to 18 to 30.
Okay.

576
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.070
<v 1>So again,
to last may be a factor.
What's that?
It could possibly be a fat.
Sure,</v>

577
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.090
yes.
But it might,

578
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.050
it might also be that these kids are depressed because of social media and

579
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:36.530
they're using cannabis or they're depressed because their friends died from

580
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:39.200
opioid overdoses.
A lot of potentials,
lifestyle,
the fact,
you know,

581
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.650
we are conceding the fact that,
you know,
you just said again,

582
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.650
that study was done on adolescents.
You know,

583
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.240
Joe and I have both conceited at multiple times that,
you know,
we do not think,

584
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.320
hi,
cheat.
See Cannabis is good for people in that age category.

585
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.760
But you know,
just to,
just to back up just a little bit again,
you know,
I don't,

586
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.320
like I said earlier that,
you know,

587
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:04.160
I don't prescribe Cisi generally to anyone under the age of 25 and most of the

588
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:05.180
doctors in Canada don't.

589
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.810
But I think that we should be prescribing CBD to these kids.

590
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:13.430
Like a lot of those kids who have a suicidal ideations,
depression,
I mean,

591
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.100
you know,
you could never do a study on it,
but you know,

592
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.180
how many of those kids wouldn't have committed suicide or wouldn't be feeling

593
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:24.710
this way if they were using CBD because we know Ssri,

594
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.880
selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
you know,

595
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.170
which are the most commonly prescribed a medication for depression and anxiety

596
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:33.600
even in,
in a,
in adolescence.
Um,
we know that they,
they,

597
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:37.670
they can't increase a suicidal ideations that's been shown.
I mean,

598
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:42.200
it's written right on,
right on the package.
So again,
like as a clinician,

599
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.170
you have to treat your patients.

600
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.940
If you're just treating people with something that's not effective or the there

601
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.620
that has horrible side effects,

602
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:56.170
you're going to look at other alternative treatments.
A lot of people have,
have,

603
00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:01.130
have shown our story,
have had excellent results with CBD in that age category.

604
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:05.400
You know,
I've had had it done in my practice and lots of other,
you know,

605
00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.460
physicians have had done in their practice.

606
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:11.450
So it's really important that when we're talking about teenagers and we were

607
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:12.710
talking about that study,

608
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.510
you're talking about high potency THC in adolescence.

609
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.180
That's where Joe and I both can see that,
you know,

610
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.260
THC is not a good medicine.

611
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.530
<v 0>Well look,
if Gw Pharma or somebody else can,
can do it,</v>

612
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.820
a study with CBD and depression or some other cannabinoids and non intoxicating

613
00:35:32.821 --> 00:35:36.120
Canambra in depression and get it approved for that,
that'd be great.
We need,

614
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.210
we need the treatments for depression and for,

615
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.990
and boy do we need treatments for psychosis that we can get.
Um,

616
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.050
I totally agree with that and I'm really glad to hear you say you don't think

617
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:50.890
that adolescents should be using high potency or drugs or any hardware,

618
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.490
especially alcohol.
No.
And they,

619
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:57.430
and they should try to also stay away from the other medications.
I want to push.
