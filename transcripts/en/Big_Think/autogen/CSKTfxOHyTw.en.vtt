you didn't need the capital the fact
 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.620
you didn't need the capital the fact
that you had to pay a very high interest

that you had to pay a very high interest

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.010
I think the long-term consequences are

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020
I think the long-term consequences are
 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.930
I think the long-term consequences are
very negative and the classic example is

very negative and the classic example is
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.140

finally you have to eliminate about 90

finally you have to eliminate about 90

can't afford to have higher capital
 

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.840
can't afford to have higher capital
levels and a huge regulatory burden so

levels and a huge regulatory burden so
 

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.220
levels and a huge regulatory burden so
we ought to shift the risks back to

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.230
we ought to shift the risks back to

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940
 

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.620
well my general posture is that I am

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.630
well my general posture is that I am
 

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.900
well my general posture is that I am
opposed to any trust on the other hand

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.910
opposed to any trust on the other hand

institutions are too big to fail then

institutions are too big to fail then

institutions are too big to fail then
they have to be broken up because it

they have to be broken up because it
 

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.590
they have to be broken up because it
creates huge market distortions

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600
creates huge market distortions
 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.750
creates huge market distortions

guarantee can afford to take
 

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.530
guarantee can afford to take
dramatically more risk so what's going

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540
dramatically more risk so what's going
 

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.090
dramatically more risk so what's going
to happen if we don't break up the

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100

then they on the next cycle and the good
 

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.630
then they on the next cycle and the good

times come they'll come they'll be
 

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.250
times come they'll come they'll be
taking enormous risk and then the next

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260
taking enormous risk and then the next
 

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.980
taking enormous risk and then the next
cycle will be a really a disaster I

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:24.990
cycle will be a really a disaster I
 

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.510

personally don't believe they're too big

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:26.520
personally don't believe they're too big
 

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.320
personally don't believe they're too big
to fail I think they should be allowed

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.330
to fail I think they should be allowed
 

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.210
to fail I think they should be allowed
to fail and there ought to be a process

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220
to fail and there ought to be a process
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.410
to fail and there ought to be a process
where they failed just like any other

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420
where they failed just like any other
 

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.270
where they failed just like any other
company and then you wouldn't have to

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.280
company and then you wouldn't have to
 

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.880
company and then you wouldn't have to
break them up the capital requirement

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:34.890
break them up the capital requirement
 

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.060
break them up the capital requirement
that I described a book in the last

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.070
that I described a book in the last
 

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.440
that I described a book in the last
answer last question really would help

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.450
answer last question really would help
 

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:45.269
answer last question really would help
feel very effectively with this issue

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279
 

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.790
I think executive compensation ought to

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800
I think executive compensation ought to
 

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.610
I think executive compensation ought to
be set by the market place boards do

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:50.620
be set by the market place boards do
 

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.590
be set by the market place boards do
make mistakes sometimes in the executive

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600
make mistakes sometimes in the executive
 

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.199
make mistakes sometimes in the executive
compensation process I think there's

00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:55.209
compensation process I think there's
 

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.509
compensation process I think there's
been some obvious abuse of executive

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519
been some obvious abuse of executive
 

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.269
been some obvious abuse of executive
compensation in a few cases but I think

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279
compensation in a few cases but I think
 

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:03.299
compensation in a few cases but I think
the more generic problem is not that

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:03.309
the more generic problem is not that
 

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:05.369
the more generic problem is not that
people can be paid well but the

00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:05.379
people can be paid well but the
 

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.379
people can be paid well but the
measurement of performance is not right

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:07.389
measurement of performance is not right
 

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:09.480
measurement of performance is not right
and I think the two errors that have

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.490
and I think the two errors that have
 

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.239
and I think the two errors that have
been made one a lot of times performance

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:12.249
been made one a lot of times performance
 

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:14.340
been made one a lot of times performance
is measured to linearly it doesn't

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.350
is measured to linearly it doesn't
 

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.679
is measured to linearly it doesn't
include the comprehensive performance

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:16.689
include the comprehensive performance
 

00:12:16.689 --> 00:12:18.689
include the comprehensive performance
and secondly a lot of times performance

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:18.699
and secondly a lot of times performance
 

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:22.170
and secondly a lot of times performance
is too short term so i think that board

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:22.180
is too short term so i think that board
 

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.090
is too short term so i think that board
should be setting compensation i think

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.100
should be setting compensation i think
 

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.850
should be setting compensation i think
highly performing people are be paid

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:26.860
highly performing people are be paid
 

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.429
highly performing people are be paid
very well based on market conditions but

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:29.439
very well based on market conditions but
 

00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:31.949
very well based on market conditions but
i think boards should do a good job and

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959
i think boards should do a good job and
 

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.210
i think boards should do a good job and
I think frankly I think our board has

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:33.220
I think frankly I think our board has
 

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.590
I think frankly I think our board has
done a good job being sure the

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600
done a good job being sure the
 

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.540
done a good job being sure the
compensation is not just linear and

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.550
compensation is not just linear and
 

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.639
compensation is not just linear and
being sure it covers a long period of

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:38.649
being sure it covers a long period of
 

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:40.679
being sure it covers a long period of
time not just what happens over a short

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:40.689
time not just what happens over a short
 

00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:45.580
time not just what happens over a short
period

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:45.590
 

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.470
I think that the shareholders have to

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480
I think that the shareholders have to
 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.910
I think that the shareholders have to
select the board members and the board

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920
select the board members and the board
 

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.230
select the board members and the board
members have to make those kind of

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240
members have to make those kind of
 

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.940
members have to make those kind of
operating decisions I don't think

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:51.950
operating decisions I don't think
 

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.250
operating decisions I don't think
shareholders have enough information to

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.260
shareholders have enough information to
 

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.710
shareholders have enough information to
make concrete operating decisions they

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720
make concrete operating decisions they
 

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.270
make concrete operating decisions they
could put the board in the position they

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:58.280
could put the board in the position they
 

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.620
could put the board in the position they
simply couldn't attract the kind of

00:12:59.620 --> 00:12:59.630
simply couldn't attract the kind of
 

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.420
simply couldn't attract the kind of
talent that they need to operate we're

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:01.430
talent that they need to operate we're
 

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.830
talent that they need to operate we're
seeing that right now with some of the

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:02.840
seeing that right now with some of the
 

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.500
seeing that right now with some of the
the interference by the government in

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:05.510
the interference by the government in
 

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.500
the interference by the government in
saying executive compensation I do think

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.510
saying executive compensation I do think
 

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.020
saying executive compensation I do think
shareholders should be very careful in

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.030
shareholders should be very careful in
 

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.930
shareholders should be very careful in
selecting the board members I would say

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:13.940
selecting the board members I would say
 

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.490
selecting the board members I would say
this though I don't think shareholders

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:15.500
this though I don't think shareholders
 

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.290
this though I don't think shareholders
have been unduly particularly

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.300
have been unduly particularly
 

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.240
have been unduly particularly
institutional shareholders in what's

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.250
institutional shareholders in what's
 

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.370
institutional shareholders in what's
been going on recently because a lot of

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.380
been going on recently because a lot of
 

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.900
been going on recently because a lot of
shareholders are very short-term

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:22.910
shareholders are very short-term
 

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.970
shareholders are very short-term
oriented and so they encourage

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:24.980
oriented and so they encourage
 

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.160
oriented and so they encourage
short-term performance and they give

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.170
short-term performance and they give
 

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.810
short-term performance and they give
executives that act in the short term

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:28.820
executives that act in the short term
 

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.880
executives that act in the short term
manner so I think if shareholders want a

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:30.890
manner so I think if shareholders want a
 

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.170
manner so I think if shareholders want a
different long-term results and they

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.180
different long-term results and they
 

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.390
different long-term results and they
need to invest with a longer-term

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:34.400
need to invest with a longer-term
 

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.300
need to invest with a longer-term
perspective and that's a really

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.310
perspective and that's a really
 

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.160
perspective and that's a really
important responsibility versus

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.170
important responsibility versus
 

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.360
important responsibility versus
micromanaging the board process

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:43.370
 

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.390
if I were in charge I would go to a

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:46.400
if I were in charge I would go to a
 

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.260
if I were in charge I would go to a
private banking system and a monetary

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:50.270
private banking system and a monetary
 

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.269
private banking system and a monetary
standard based on market criteria which
