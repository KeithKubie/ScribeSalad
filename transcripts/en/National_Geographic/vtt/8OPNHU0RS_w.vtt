00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.266
Now that I'm by the river, I
can catch some fish for dinner.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.767
I don't have a hook
or line with me.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.466
But the Raramuri know
how to get everything

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.233
they need from the plants.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:18.200
I can get my fishing
line from an agave.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.467
You can take these spikes.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.467
Careful not to go right
through your tongue.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:50.967
Size per size, this is way, way
stronger than cotton thread.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.500
I can take this--

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.467
if I put a little bit
of a twist into it,

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.400
it'll make it about
four times stronger.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.500
I can't break it.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
It's amazing how strong it is.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.734
For hooks, the Raramuri
use another plant--

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:12.433
a black tipped agave.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:16.600
What I'm after are these
really hard, woody barbs.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.734
Here we go.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:37.300
The ground near the river
is crawling with insects,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.399
so I have lots of bait.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:48.866
And my line's in for just a
few minutes when I get a bite.

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:54.233
Just a little catfish there.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:02.633
Doesn't really matter if it's
a big one or a small one.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:06.767
All fish are protein.
