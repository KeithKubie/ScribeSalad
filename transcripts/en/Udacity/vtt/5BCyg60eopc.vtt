00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.340
Alright I'm sold. You want to make an approval process.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.600
What are we going to do? Help me out here.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.670
&gt;&gt; Well before we jump to make the approval process we need

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.730
to think about what are we actually trying to create the flow for.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.980
&gt;&gt; So we have our stage managers.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.040
&gt;&gt; And they need to approve whether or

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.229
not bands can be book at certain set times.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:18.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.840
&gt;&gt; So we want to create an approval process on set times.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Set times, makes sense. And when a booking agent tries

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.920
to book something, the stage manager has to sign off.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.492
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:33.230
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay. So, I guess I'll just search for approvals or something.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.470
&gt;&gt; Yep. It's in the set up.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.600
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Workflow and approvals,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.190
cool. Approval process. It's recommended that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.270
I follow the following instructions. I'm not going to do it though. So.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.470
&gt;&gt; Rules are meant to be broken.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Manage approval processes for set time right?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.820
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, create new.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.440
&gt;&gt; Yep. Click that guy.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.720
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I have a choice of wizards, a jump start

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.570
wizard, or a standard set up. Do you have a preference?

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.080
&gt;&gt; I use jump start, it's quicker.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.209
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, name for the approval process? Stage Manager Sign Off?

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah sure. Stage manager approval, whatever.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.235
&gt;&gt; Approval oh yeah they're called approvals.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.235
&gt;&gt;

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:10.622
[LAUGH]

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.510
&gt;&gt; So approval assignment email template. What are we

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.790
doing with that? Are we even setting an email?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.400
&gt;&gt; So we could if we wanted to, but we don't have to so in this case it's

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.740
okay. Okay, so we've got our specific entry criteria,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.660
use this approval process if defined criteria are met.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.610
&gt;&gt; So this is really similar to the workflow rule,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.670
right, where we're trying to come up with some certain criteria.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.094
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:35.460
&gt;&gt; That this should only fire this process if.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.810
&gt;&gt; Something

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.520
happens, it's true.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.450
&gt;&gt; If there's a baseline.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.750
&gt;&gt; And so when would we not want it to go for approval? Like, when would

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.550
we be like, this is bad data. This

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.340
shouldn't be under approval, because it's not complete.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.570
&gt;&gt; There wasn't a, a field miss, there's a field missing?

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.250
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so, what's the most important field on set time that would,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.820
has to be there, in order for it to be something we should review?
