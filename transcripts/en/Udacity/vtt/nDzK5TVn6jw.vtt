00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.460
As we said earlier, PKI can be used for

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.010
many other purposes than
we've mentioned so far.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
These include securing software until
you've entered the vendor's code

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.880
indicating you've paid for it,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.480
securing wireless networks, digital
rights management for movies and music.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.790
In reality,
PKI is more complex than described here.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.040
The validation of the certificate
should be more robust,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.780
something called extended validation.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.520
To reduce the computational load,
there are so

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.580
called hybrid approaches that create
keys just for a specific session.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.320
But this is probably not
sufficiently secure for health care.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.820
Finally, there is the concern
about advances in computing.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.695
We've assumed that given the Public Key,
it is too expensive and

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:53.140
time-consuming to
calculate the private key.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.430
Proposed quantum computers
might change this.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.510
And could lead to the need to
make major modifications for

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.980
encryption to remain useful.
