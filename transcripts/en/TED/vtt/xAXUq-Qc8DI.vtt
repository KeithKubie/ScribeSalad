00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.216
Have you ever heard of typosquatting?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.976
Well, typosquatting
is where companies like Google

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.456
post advertisements on websites
that are commonly miskeyed,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.576
and then they sit back
and rake in millions

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.096
banking on the fact that you're
visiting something like gmale.com

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.696
or mikerowesoft.com.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.736
(Laughter)

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.680
It just seems kind of silly, doesn't it?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.976
How about this?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.376
On February 28, an engineer at Amazon

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.056
made a similar, seemingly small key error.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.576
Only I say seemingly small

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.656
because this one little typo
on Amazon's supercode

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.416
produced a massive internet slowdown

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.456
that cost the company
over 160 million dollars

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.320
in the span of just four hours.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.440
But this is actually really scary.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.856
You see, recently, an employee
at the New England Compound,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.816
which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.536
didn't clean a lab properly

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.016
and now 76 people have died

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.816
and 700 more have contracted meningitis.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.936
I mean, these examples are crazy, right?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.936
When did we come to live in a world
where these types of typos,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.580
common errors, this do-your-best attitude
or just good enough was acceptable?

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.656
At some point, we've stopped
valuing perfection,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.240
and now, these are
the type of results that we get.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.616
You see, I think that we
should all seek perfection,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.096
all the time,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.080
and I think we need to get to it quick.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.496
You see, I run a training facility

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.976
where I'm responsible for the education
of professional delivery drivers,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.256
and in my line of work,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.376
we have a unique understanding
of the cost of failure,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280
the cost of just 99 percent,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.016
because in the world
of professional driving,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.880
just 99 percent of the job
means somebody dies.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.256
Look, a hundred people die every day

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.520
due to vehicular crashes.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.816
Think about that for a second.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.456
That's like the equivalent
of four commercial airliners

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.736
crashing every week,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.576
yet we still can't convince ourselves
to pay perfect attention behind the wheel.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.696
So I teach my drivers to value perfection.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.336
It's why I have them memorize

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.456
our 131-word defensive driving program

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.696
perfectly,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.296
and then I have them rewrite it.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.280
One wrong word, one misspelled word,
one missing comma, it's a failed test.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.416
It's why I do uniform inspections daily.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.176
Undershirts are white or brown only,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.256
shoes are black or brown polished leather

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.856
and frankly, don't come to my class
wrinkled and expect me to let you stay.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.576
It's why I insist
that my drivers are on time.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.376
Don't be late, not to class,
not to break, not to lunch.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800
When you're supposed
to be somewhere, be there.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.816
You see, I do this
so that my students understand

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.416
that when I'm training them
to drive a car and I say,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.136
"Clear every intersection,"

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.296
they understand that I mean
every traffic signal, every cross street,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.296
every side street, every parking lot,
every dirt road, every crosswalk,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.840
every intersection without fail.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.376
Now, new students will often ask me

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.056
why my class is so difficult,
strict, or uniform,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.656
and the answer is simple.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.256
You see, perfectionism is an attitude
developed in the small things

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.296
and then applied to the larger job.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.936
So basically, if you can't
get the little things right,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.696
you're going to fail when it counts,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.696
and when you're driving a car, it counts.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.696
A car traveling at 55 miles an hour

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.936
covers the length
of an American football field

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.016
in just under four and a half seconds,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.376
but just so happens to be
the same amount of time

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.856
it takes the average person
to check a text message.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.056
So I don't allow my drivers to lose focus,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.976
and I don't accept anything less
than perfection out of them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.256
And you know what?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.616
I'm tired of everybody else
accepting 99 percent as good enough.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.800
I mean, being less than perfect
has real consequences, doesn't it?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.816
Think about it.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.456
If the makers of our credit cards
were only 99.9 percent effective,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.216
there would be over a million cards
in circulation today

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.376
that had the wrong information
on the magnetic strip on the back.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.816
Or, if the Webster's Dictionary
was only 99.9 percent accurate,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.600
it would have 470 misspelled words in it.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.336
How about this?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.816
If our doctors were
only 99.9 percent correct,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.136
then every year, 4,453,000 prescriptions
would be written incorrectly,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.496
and probably even scarier,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.776
11 newborns would be given
to the wrong parents every day

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.176
in the United States.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400
(Laughter)

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.016
And those are just the odds, thank you.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.296
(Laughter)

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.816
The reality is that the US government
crashed a 1.4-billion-dollar aircraft

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.760
because the maintenance crew
only did 99 percent of their job.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.416
Someone forgot to check a sensor.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.296
The reality is
that 16 people are now dead,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.336
180 have now been injured,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.256
and 34 million cars are being recalled

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.656
because the producers of a car airbag
produced and distributed a product

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.920
that they thought was,
you know, good enough.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.816
The reality is that medical errors

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.376
are now the third leading cause
of death in America.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.656
250,000 people die each year

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.216
because somebody who probably thought
they were doing their job good enough

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.440
messed up.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.576
And you don't believe me?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.416
Well, I can certainly understand why.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.096
You see, it's hard for us
to believe anything these days

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.496
when less than 50 percent
of what news pundits say

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.936
is actually grounded in fact.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.376
(Laughter)

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.256
So it comes down to this:

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.960
trying our best is not good enough.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.760
So how do we change?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.216
We seek perfection

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.840
and settle for nothing less.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.896
Now, I know. I need
to give you a minute on that,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.936
because I know what you've been told.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.216
It probably goes something like,
perfection is impossible for humans,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.456
so therefore, seeking perfection
will not only ruin your self-esteem

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.052
but it will render you a failure.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.376
But there's the irony.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.856
See, today we're all so afraid
of that word failure,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.856
but the truth is, we need to fail.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.616
Failure is a natural stepping stone
towards perfection,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.416
but at some point, because we became
so afraid of that idea of failure

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.016
and so afraid of that idea of perfection,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.640
we dismissed it because of what might
happen to our egos when we fall short.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.336
I mean, do you really think
that failure's going to ruin you?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.416
Or is that just the easy answer
that gets us slow websites,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.440
scary healthcare and dangerous roads?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.040
I mean, are you ready to make
perfection the bad guy in all this?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.016
Look, failure and imperfection
are basically the same thing.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.576
We all know that imperfection
exists all around us.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.440
Nothing and nobody is perfect.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.256
But at some point, because it was
too difficult or too painful,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.456
we decided to dismiss
our natural ability to deal with failure

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.976
and replace it with
a lower acceptance level.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.736
And now we're all forced to sit back

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.416
and just accept this new norm
or good-enough attitude

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080
and the results that come with it.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.496
So even with all that said,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.256
people will still tell me, you know,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.216
"Didn't the medical staff,
the maintenance crew, the engineer,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.886
didn't they try their best,
and isn't that good enough?"

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.150
Well, truthfully, not for me
and especially not in these examples.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.656
Yeah, but, you know, trying
to be perfect is so stressful, right?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.536
And, you know, Oprah talked about it,
universities study it,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.296
I bet your high school counselor
even warned you about it.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.856
Stress is bad for us, isn't it?

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.096
Well, maybe,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.536
but to say that seeking
perfection is too stressful

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.736
is like saying that exercise
is too exhausting.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.216
In both cases, if you want the results,
you've got to endure the pain.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.176
So truthfully, saying that
seeking perfection is too stressful

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.600
is just an excuse to be lazy.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.776
But here's the really scary part.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.256
Today, doctors, therapists

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.416
and the nearly 10-billion-
dollar-a-year self-help industry

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.496
are all advocating
against the idea of perfection

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.376
under this guise that somehow
not trying to be perfect

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.176
will save your self-esteem
and protect your ego.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.776
But, see, it's not working,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.096
because the self-help industry today
has a higher recidivism rate

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.456
because it's more focused on teaching you
how to accept being a failure

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.016
and lower your acceptance level

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.080
than it is about
pushing you to be perfect.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.056
See, these doctors,
therapists and self-help gurus

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.800
are all focused on a symptom
and not the illness.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.776
The true illness in our society today
is our unwillingness to confront failure.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.176
See, we're more comfortable
resting on our efforts

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.176
than we are with focusing on our results.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.056
Like at Dublin Jerome High School in Ohio,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.000
where they name 30 percent
of a graduating class valedictorian.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.136
I mean, come on, right?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.016
Somebody had the highest GPA.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.736
I guarantee you it wasn't a 72-way tie.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.776
(Laughter)

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.696
But, see, we're more comfortable
offering up an equal outcome

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.216
than we are with confronting the failure,
the loser or the underachiever.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.696
And when everybody gets a prize,
everybody advances,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.896
or everybody gets a pay raise
despite results,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.256
the perfectionist in all of us
is left to wonder,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.056
what do I have to do to get better?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.600
How do I raise above the crowd?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.216
And see, if we continue
to cultivate this culture,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.976
where nobody fails
or nobody is told that they will fail,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.616
then nobody's going to reach
their potential, either.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.056
Failure and loss
are necessary for success.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.120
It's the acceptance of failure that's not.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.056
Michelangelo is credited with saying
that the greatest danger for most of us

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.296
is not that our aim
is too high and we miss it,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.656
but it's too low and we reach it.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.496
Failure should be a motivating force,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.600
not some type of pathetic
excuse to give up.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.960
So I have an idea.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.256
Instead of defining perfectionism
as a destructive intolerance for failure,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.816
why don't we try
giving it a new definition?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.856
Why don't we try defining perfectionism
as a willingness to do what is difficult

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.480
to achieve what is right?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.696
You see, then we can agree

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.416
that failure is a good thing
in our quest for perfection,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.896
and when we seek perfection
without fear of failure,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.856
just think about what we can accomplish.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.096
Like NBA superstar Steph Curry:

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.376
he hit 77 three-point shots in a row.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.616
Think about that.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.776
The guy was able to accurately deliver
a nine-and-a-half inch ball

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.536
through an 18-inch rim
that's suspended 10 feet in the air

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.136
from nearly 24 feet away

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.480
almost 80 times without failure.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.256
Or like the computer programmers

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.496
at the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.976
who have now written a program

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.656
that uses 420,000 lines
of near-flawless code

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.536
to control every aspect of igniting
four million pounds of rocket fuel

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.720
and putting a 120-ton
spaceship into orbit.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.696
Or maybe like the researchers

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.816
at the Children's Mercy Hospital
in Kansas City, Missouri,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.416
who have now developed a device

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.520
that can complete human
genome coding in just 26 hours.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.536
So this device is able
to diagnose genetic diseases

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.560
in babies and newborns sooner,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.136
giving doctors an opportunity
to start treatments earlier

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.336
and potentially save the baby's life.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.216
See, that's what happens
when we seek perfection.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.216
So maybe we should be
more like the professional athlete,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.656
or we should be more like
that tireless programmer,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.496
or like that passionate researcher.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.416
Then we could stop fearing failure

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.456
and we could stop living in a world
filled with the consequences

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.696
of good enough.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.936
Thank you.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.280
(Applause)
