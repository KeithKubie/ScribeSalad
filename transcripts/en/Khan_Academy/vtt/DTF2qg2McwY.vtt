00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Voiceover] "To help
freshmen and sophomores

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.132
"in selecting their courses,

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:06.651
"candid reviews of courses and instructors

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:10.142
"compiled by juniors and seniors."

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.537
So this already feels very strange.

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:13.872
They're giving us a subject,

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:17.250
which is "candid reviews
of courses and instructors

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.247
"compiled by juniors and seniors."

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:20.433
So what they've underlined here

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.600
which we're gonna think about

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.148
if there's a better way of phrasing it,

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.423
that already feels like the
subject of our sentence.

00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:28.708
And because they're saying, "To
help freshmen and sophomores

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.125
"in selecting their courses,"

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:31.808
essentially giving us
this prepositional phrase,

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.931
it's implying that the candid reviews

00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:36.069
of courses and instructors

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.692
compiled by juniors and
seniors did something

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:42.372
to help freshmen and sophomores
in selecting their courses.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.675
They're not telling us
what the candid reviews,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.528
they're not telling us
what the stuff in orange

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:47.558
right over here,

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:48.896
what did they do?

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:49.717
Another way to think about it,

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:50.901
they gave us the subject.

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:51.962
That's why over here in orange,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.528
"Candid reviews of courses and instructors

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:55.444
"compiled by juniors and seniors."

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.162
Well they're not telling us what they did

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.960
to help freshmen and sophomores
in selecting their courses.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.059
We don't know what the action
here is of the sentence.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.406
We don't know what the
predicate of the sentence

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:05.799
actually is.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.026
So I don't like it as it is,

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:11.058
it's not really making any sense.

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:13.183
So we can rule out the first choice

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:15.806
which is always the sentence as is.

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.798
Now let's look at the other choices.

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:20.543
"Candid reviews of courses and instructors

00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:23.596
"being compiled by juniors and seniors."

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.606
So once again,

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:27.907
that just keeps this as a
whole subject right over here.

00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:31.583
It still doesn't tell
us what this thing did

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:34.087
to help freshmen and sophomores
in selecting their courses.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:35.634
There's no predicate.

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:37.325
So I'll rule that out.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.981
"And to compile candid reviews

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.526
"of courses and instructors
by juniors and seniors."

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:46.031
So this one really sounds disjoint.

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:47.647
"To help freshmen and sophomores

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:49.284
"in selecting their courses,

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:52.278
"and to compile candid reviews

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.557
"of courses and instructors
by juniors and seniors."

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:58.229
So it's really this compound
prepositional phrase,

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.874
and they're really not even giving us

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.615
a subject or a predicate right over here.

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:04.626
Who's doing what to do this

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:05.574
and to do this?

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:08.848
So this one is also I
would say fairly bizarre.

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:11.549
"Juniors and seniors have
compiled candid reviews

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.544
"of courses and instructors."

00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:15.118
So I like this one

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:16.823
because this is actually
a complete sentence.

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:17.740
This actually a complete sentence

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.841
even if you did not have
the prepositional phrase

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:20.944
in the beginning.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:22.558
What's your subject here?

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:25.797
Well your subject is juniors and seniors.

00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.654
What did they do?

00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:30.475
Well they have compiled candid reviews

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:33.401
of courses and instructors.

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:35.641
So this by itself is a complete sentence

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.335
and we could throw this
prepositional phrase on the front

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.482
to say, "Well why did they do this?

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.212
"To help freshmen and sophomores

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:43.477
in selecting their courses."

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:45.381
So we get, "To help
freshmen and sophomores

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.937
"in selecting their courses,

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.655
"juniors and seniors,"

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:49.711
that's the subject,

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.217
"have compiled candid reviews
of courses and instructors."

00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:55.851
That one feels very good.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:57.931
Now let's just look at this last one.

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:00.821
"With juniors and seniors
compiling candid reviews

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.319
"of courses and instructors."

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.407
So once again it's just another phrase,

00:03:04.407 --> 00:03:08.404
not really giving us once again
a complete expression here.

00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:11.858
They're not giving us a
complete subject with an action.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:15.488
So I would rule this one out as well.
