00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.774
The correct answer is the first one. The 1st mystery demo gives a precise draw

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:08.080
order. First the blue object, then red, then green. The 2nd mystery program

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.960
sorts the objects in the opposite order that we'd want to use for the painters

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.866
algorithm. It orders them so that the closest are drawn first. While this order

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.550
is good when the z buffer's on, in that less shading computations are then

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.190
needed, it gives a consistently wrong look.
