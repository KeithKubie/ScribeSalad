00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.690
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.290
On behalf of my colleagues, in
particular, Doctor Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.720
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.900
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm Joan Weeks.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.900
I'm head of the Near East Section
that is sponsoring today's program

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.450
and we're very pleased to
present this program entitled,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.070
"Never Tell a Poet Not to Write."

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.980
And for a moment, I'm not going
to tell a poet not to speak,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.990
but I'm wanted to give you just
a little bit of an overview

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.760
of our division and its resources
in the hopes that you'll come back

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.120
and do research and
enjoy our collections.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.710
Today's program is
about Arabic poetry.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.210
So, I did a brief search
in our catalog

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.690
and that's at catalog.loc.gov.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.840
And I invite you to search for
yourself and come back in here

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.790
and enjoy our books,
particularly on Arabic poetry.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.790
If you just search under those
terms, you'll pull up 192 items.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.870
And if you further refine your
search to Arab women poets,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.790
you'll find specifically
materials about other women poets.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.960
And if you would like to, you can
refine your search by language

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.410
so that you can actually have
materials in Arabic or English

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.620
or whichever way you want them.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.220 position:56%
So, this is a custodial division
and it's comprised of three sections

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.300
that build and serve collections to
researchers from around the world.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.180
We cover over 78 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.840
Our Africa section covers all the
countries of Sub-Sahara Africa.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.860
And our Hebraic section
covers Hebraic the worldwide.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.680
And our Near East section all

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.060
of the Arab countries
including North Africa, Turkey,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.580
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan, the Russian,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.910
Balkans, Armenia and Georgia.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.220
And I'd like to invite you
to try out our 4 Corners Blog

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.640
with our special posts by our
special collections in Hispanic,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.630
European, and Asian as well as our
African and Middle East division.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.070
And like us on Facebook
and if you do that,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.850
you'll hear about further
events that --

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.620
and programs we're
planning in the future.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.280
And so, I'd like to remind
you also and invite you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.860
to ask questions at the end.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.880
But if you do, you're
implicitly giving us permission

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.400
to videotape you as this
program is being videotaped.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.150
So, without further ado, I'd
like to call up my colleague,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.520
Doctor Muhannad Salhi,
to introduce our speaker.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.820
Thank you.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.590
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.110
Thank you all for joining us.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.590
Our speaker today, Waed Athamneh,
is an Assistant Professor

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.560
of Arabic Studies at
Connecticut College.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.990
She is the Director of the
Arabic Studies program.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.800
She received her PhD in Near
Eastern languages and cultures

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.760
from Indiana University,
Bloomington in 2014.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.520
Her research focuses on modern
Arabic poetry and refugee studies.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.910
Athamneh's first book is Modern
Arabic Poetry, Revolution

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.740
and Conflict, University
of Notre Dame Press.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.990
She's currently working
on her second book

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.770
with Muhammed Massoud Refugee
Voices, Women of the Zaatari Camp.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.270
Athamneh's articles have appeared
in Middle Eastern Studies,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.960
Arabic Studies, Arab Studies
Quarterly, and The Journal

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.970
of Arabic and Islamic Studies.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.860
Athamneh teaches courses in Arabic
language, literature, and culture.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.970
There will be a book signing
at the end of the event.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.940
The question-answer period will
also be at the end of the event.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.620
But the -- Waed has been very kind.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.050
She brought us a not
big box of baklava

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.610
for anybody who's interested
in her book, okay.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.310
And so, at the end of the event,
please come to the conference room.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.690
And anybody who would like --

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.970
I'm sure Waed would be
happy to sign your book

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.390
and have some baklava as well.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.300
So, without further
ado, Waed Athamneh.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.210
Thank you very much
Doctor Muhannad Sahli

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.600
and thank you for being here today.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.490
It's an honor being at
the Library of Congress

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.730
and I couldn't be happier talking
about Arabic poetry to you.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.030
So, thank you for being here today.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.500
Today, I'm going to talk
about modern Arabic poetry

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.420
and why the Arab regimes
should never tell

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.780
and Arab poet not to write.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.880
Poetry has played an essential

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.920
in Arabic culture since
pre-Islamic times.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.860
Dating back to the sixth century,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.270
also known as a the
Jahiliyyah period,

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.660
poets were the political
spokespersons of the tribe.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.800
Each tribe had its own
poets to write its history,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.590
defend its stature, and be
its representatives and voice.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.120
Poets held esteem positions
in society.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.030
Not only to document the
ins and outs of their tribes

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.900
and defend its identity, but also

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.370
to promote their tribe
among the other tribes.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.280
Arab poets described in carefully
crafted verse the political

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.980
and cultural aspects of their
Bedouin society and used poetry

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.960
to praise the tribe
or attack its rivals.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.590 position:56%
Praise, boasting, satire, and elegy,
were among the major functions

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.210
of their pre-Islam
[foreign word], the oath.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.930
Pre-Islamic poetry was oral and its
performative nature demanded rhyme

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.200 position:56%
and meter to draw the attention of
the audience through its musicality.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.240
Tribes competed through
the talents of their poets

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.180
who would gather every year

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.510
to present their finest
poems to the public.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.290
The stronger the tribe,
the more powerful the voice

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.860
of its poets became.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.280
By the same token, the more
gifted a tribe's poets,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.410
the louder its voice
among other tribes.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.910
Poets moved men to go to war
and recounted their exploits

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.630
after their return
from the battlefield.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:10.290
If the tribe won a battle, its
poets wrote verses in its praise

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.710
which quickly traveled among
other tribes raising its status.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.230
If it lost, poets wrote
elegies and cited the tribe

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.320
to avenge its heroic,
slaughtered kinsmen.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.920
Arabs consider poetry one of their
supreme, cultural accomplishments.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.260
All though modern Arabic
poetry continued to retain some

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.910
of the major functions of the
pre-Islamic [foreign word],

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.350
its deeply concerned about
questions that pertain

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.330 position:56%
to the identity and future of Arabs.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.740
And here are some of the
functions of modern Arabic poetry.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.910
Another function is questioning
the political status quo

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.070
and giving voice to the
silenced, voiceless multitude.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:10.780
Modern Arab poets, like the
Egyptian, Ahmad abd al-Muti-Hijazi,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.020
the Syrian, Nizar Qabbani,
the Egyptian, Fatma Kandil,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.160
and the Iraqi, Muzaffar
al-Nawwab, wrote poetry for decades

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.520
to guard the collective memory,
to preserve our Arabic language,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.390
and to address the challenges
of our culture and society.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.740
In so doing, they were also
questioning our understanding

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.470
of history and rewriting from
the perspective of the people,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.670
not their authoritarian regimes.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.620 position:56%
Because these poets opposed their
governments and incited their people

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.430
through poetry to reject their
enslavement in a life void

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.320
of basic human rights, they
were often exiled, imprisoned,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.770
dismissed from official positions,
and harassed by the Arab state.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.110
Therefore, the experience of a
wandering human being in exile,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.830
or diaspora, and the search for
the lost paradise, the homeland,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.070
is a popular theme in
modern Arabic poetry.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:18.650
Poetry offered these poets and the
Arab individual a space to grieve,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.030
to criticize the status quo,
to dream of a better life,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.120
to meditate, and to feel.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.610
Poetry is one of the few remaining
expressions of art and beauty

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.190
for the Arab individual
in this tragic age.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:47.280
Poems do not lie and if the future
looks dim, poetry will say so.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.880
For those reasons and
many more, Arab regimes

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.950
and rulers should never tell
an Arab poet not to write.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.790
Because poetry invites
creativity and imagination.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:09.480
And Arab regimes do not want
their people to think or dream.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.910
They want ignorant, obedient
nations living in fear.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.580
Writing poetry is searching
for the key

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.850
that has been lost
to open closed doors.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:29.120
Poetry invites readers
to find their keys

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.070
or break their closed doors
and set themselves free.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.930
The price of freedom in the
Arab world is hefty for sure

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.640
and poets are the first to know.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.810
Here are the poets I'll
be talking about today.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.690
Qabbani, Nizar Qabbani, Ahmad
abd al-Muti Hijazi, Fatma Kandil,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.220
Muzaffar al-Nawwab, among
many other Arab poets,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.000
wrote poetry to preserve Arabic
language and the poetic tradition

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.680
as well as to address universal
causes that are of utmost concern

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.360
to humanity, and especially
to the Arab citizen.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.450
They feared for their fellow Arabs
and their language and heritage.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.540
And they used their
only weapon, poetry,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.350
to voice their concerns
and shape their stances.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.450
They saw poetry as
a platform to fight

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.780
against dictators and oppressors.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.110
They warned against the
loss of Arab identity

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:45.180
and anticipated a grand future if
Arab citizens and poets continued

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.040
to live in fear of oppression.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.530
For change to take
place in the Arab world,

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.640
fear of repression must
be eliminated and death

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.080
and ruin should be expected
before the sky rains

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.830
and the land can be fertile again.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.710
The first poet I'll be talking

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.260
about today is Nizar
Qabbani, the Syrian poet.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.850
Nizar Qabbani was born in 1923
[foreign word] in Damascus

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.210
and he died in London in 1998.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.670
He wrote over 40 books
of poetry and prose.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.600 position:56%
And his poetry has been celebrated
and translated in several languages.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:31.500
He's often referred to as the poet
of the people or the romantic poet.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.770
So, who is Qabbani?

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:41.730
Let's read some stanzas of
his poetry and discuss some

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.870
of the major themes and functions.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.260
The following stanza here
-- this is Nizar Qabbani --

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.140
We are Accused of Terrorism.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:56.050
Because of limitations of
time, I selected some stanzas.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.700
The following stanza is from his
poem, We are Accused of Terrorism

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.620
and in this poem, he voices his
disappointment with the status quo

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.930
in the Arab world which
reflects that of Arabic poetry

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.320
and how poets are treated.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:18.280
He says, "You will not find with me
a secret poem or a secret language

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.010
or secret books I imprison
inside the doors.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.180
I do not have even one poem walking

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.210
on the streets while
wearing a hijab.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.520
We are accused of terrorism
if we write about the homeland

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.960
that forbids us from buying a
newspaper or hearing the news

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.580
about a homeland where all
birds are banned from singing,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.220
about a homeland whose
writers are accustomed

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.710
to writing the air
out of extreme horror.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.950
We're banned from writing about
a homeland that resembles poetry

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.450
in our country, improvised,
imported,

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:05.220 position:56%
and loose of foreign tongue and
soul and having no beginning or end,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:13.050
detached from man and land
or from the plight of man."

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.420
According to Qabanni, nations
that fail to nurture their poets

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.090
to defend and preserve
their language

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:23.450
and literature will have no
civilizations to be remembered.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.740
Qabbani realizes how
fear governs Arabic life

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.760
and threatens Arabic
literature as well.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.010 position:56%
Arab writers and poets like
Qabbani, lived and live in a country

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.950
that forbids them from
living a normal life.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:44.520
It forbids them even from buying
newspaper or hearing the news.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.560
It turns the poets
down and bans them

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.000
from writing poetry,
from speaking out.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.930
However, Qabbani insists on
writing about this homeland

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.650
because it too is a victim.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.630
Qabbani refuses to oppress his bird

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.770
by using a secret language
to imprison the poem.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:13.630
Rather, he insists on writing naked
free poems about this homeland

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.290
and its displaced people.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.750
If Arabic poetry is reduced
to improvised, imported,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.470
and loose words of
foreign tongue and soil,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.340
then Arabs will have lost not
only a part of our culture

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.410
and thought, but also
their identity.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:34.470
Therefore, writing poetry for
Qabbani is an act of resistance

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.030
against erasing an Arab identity

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.040
and stripping its people
from their language.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:46.460
I quote, "Qabbani's hailed by
the Arabs to be a modern poet

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.230
of stature, whose poetry is read,
put to music, sung, and memorized.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.450
This is the most important
testimony to his genius."

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.750
End of quote.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.050
J. Gatin [phonetic spelling].

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:04.600
Qabbani said in 1948

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.940
when he published his first
collection the following --

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.070
and it says a lot about
him being a poet.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.590
I want art to be the property
of all people, like air, water,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.500
and the song of the sparrow.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.220
I dream about a poetic city.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.000
If the reader feels that my heart
becomes his heart and that I become

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.860
for him a mouth and throat,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.600
then I certainly shall have
achieved my aim, that is,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.230
to make poetry exist in every
house besides bread and water.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.930
The Arab authoritarian states
will continue indefinitely to hunt

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.810
down poets, call them terrorists,
and try to buy them off.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.110
But as [foreign name] says,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.210
"The dictator perishes
and the poet remains."

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.380
Qabbani maintains that writing free
poetry is the key to combat fear,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.980 position:56%
to fight oppression, and to preserve
what remained of our Arabism.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:12.020
This is what he can do as a poet.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:19.890
My second poet is Ahmad
abd al-Muti-Hijazi.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.800
Ahmad abd al-Muti-Hijazi
was born in the village

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.960
of [foreign word] Al-Menoufiya,
Egypt, 1935.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.740
His family was one of the
middle-class peasant families

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.510
in the Egyptian countryside where
he was educated and brought up.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.220
He wrote seven collections of
poetry between 1959 and 2011

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.190
and he has written 25
books in prose as well.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.190
His poetry has been translated
into several languages.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.020
The following stanza
is from his collection,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.560
Creatures of the Ninth
Kingdom, in 1989.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.840
This Ninth Kingdom refers to
[foreign name] dictatorship.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.460
In this poem, Hijazi gives shape
to the feelings of loss and despair

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.170
in the life characterized by
fear where he is, I quote,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.810
"At his closest to
modernist dramatization."

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:22.900
"Nothing remained of the glory
of this country but a bar.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.870
Nothing remained of the state
but a policeman showing off

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.020
under the last light
his long shadow one time

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.480
and another time his short shadow.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.900
Fear has become a homeland, a
currency, a national language,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.390
anthem and identity,
and elected council.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.120
And fear has become its savior."

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.500
According to Hijazi, the country

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.600
that once lived Arab nationalism
has been reduced to a bar populated

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.460
by chattering drunks and
a state of policemen.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:04.520
There is nothing to be proud of
about Egypt according this stanza,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.110
which has become a wasteland
devoid of democracy, freedom,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.200
morals, ethics, and security.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.240
Hijazi complicates the
image of his wasteland

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.910
by projecting fear into the scene.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:27.050
Fear has become the dominant theme
in every aspect of life, as we see.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.730
More importantly, it's
become the homeland.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.570
Dominating every aspect of
life in the Ninth Kingdom,

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.510
fear's now the religion and
the god everyone worships

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.680
and fears in the Arab world.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.110
Instead of promoting security,
Arab rulers use fear and oppression

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.710
to terrorize their people and
oppose their authority over them.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.860
Failing to maintain an
identity or speak a language

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.340
that doesn't involve
fear, Hijazi distrusts

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:03.570
and despises everything
he sees and he hears.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:13.550 position:56%
In another stanza from another poem,
Cement Trees, and commenting on fear

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.280
and hunting poets --
"The wind comes and goes

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.930
without crossing this
silence or being able

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.160
to convey the villages' distress.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.640
And the shipwrecked vessels

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.850
and these cement trees are
everywhere showing off and roaring,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.900
like demons, and hunting birds that
fall like stones in the radars.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.870
Or hanging them from
the fuzz of their necks

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.500 position:56%
on the wires of the spying machines.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.720
From our balconies, we know
that the birds are dying now

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.890
in these skies when
the flock crashes.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.930
Hijazi watches the
villages in distress

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.900
and shipwrecked vessels while
the wind comes and goes uncaring.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.990
Life seems to go on without
sympathy for the ordeal

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.560
of a poet whose life
came to the birds.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.790
Writers express the struggle of
the individual in their societies

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.480 position:56%
and oppose their oppressive regimes.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.700 position:56%
These regimes are like cement trees.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.160
They suffocate the individual

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.430
and hide his screams
between closed doors.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.480
They're like demons
which hunt human beings

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.580
and throw them mercilessly
to the grounds.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.020
Hijazi criticizes the Arab
regimes for spying on writers,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.570 position:56%
torturing them, and censoring and
banning their works from the public.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.990
The poem reflects the
disappointed pessimistic

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.390
and oppressed Hijazi's
poetry in the 1980's.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.450
Hijazi expresses opposition
to the lack of freedom

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.710
of expression throughout the Arab
world, particularly in Egypt.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.280
Writers are hunted down and
their lives are monitored.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.320
Hijazi sees the Arab
world as a wasteland

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.250
that oppresses its citizens
and silences their voices.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:08.260
That's why poets speak out
on behalf of their people.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:17.680
My third poet is my favorite
poet, Muzaffar al-Nawwab.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:26.880
Muzaffar al-Nawwab was born
in 1934 in Bagdad, Iraq.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.730
He spent over 40 years in exile
voicing his strong opposition to

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:37.620
and criticism of authoritarian Arab
regimes and Western imperialism.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.520
His words I quote,
"Are so controversial

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.090
that they cannot be
printed officially

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.420
in the Arab world are
under an interdiction.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.080
His poetry readings circulating
on cassettes are photocopied

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.740
and passed from hand to hand."

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.170
End of Quote.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.080
And now, the age of the internet,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.840
his poetry is available
online, of course.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.560
Although, Arab governments
continue to censor any threatening,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.250 position:56%
poetic material like that of Nawwab.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.150 position:56%
This is a quotation about al-Nawwab.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.070
Most central to al-Nawwab's
project as a poet,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.680
is the very concerted dedications
to the composition, orchestration,

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.720
and performance of poetry
that is meant to stir

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:37.650 position:56%
and agitate his audience, to provoke
and arouse a wide rate of emotions,

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:43.610
childlike wonderment, nostalgic
longing, sensuous arousal, disgust,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:49.740
rage, all in some way meant to be
intimately related back to the fate

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.250
of the contemporary
Arab world as a matter

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.800
of urgent collective concern."

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:05.200
A major recurring theme in the
following stanzas from With Wine

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.970
and Grief is My Heart Intoxicated
is in the words, grief and longing

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.030
for his homeland in diaspora.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:21.510 position:56%
And since you see it in translation,
I can read it in Arabic.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:25:35.670
[ Foreign Speaking ]

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:44.680 position:56%
al-Nawwab finds no keys in
diaspora to free him from his grief.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.040
He wanders in exile and wonders
if there is still a chance

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.510
to rescue what remained of the
homeland, its identity, and future.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.740
In this poem, al-Nawwab treats
themes of grief, oppression,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.060
ruthlessness, and homesickness.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.270
In the Arab world, poets

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:09.380
like al-Nawwab become a
ruthless plant living,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.130
or pretending to live in water.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:19.760
This plant longs for any dust
to call home but it finds none.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.610
Knowing what it means to be
a ruthless plant in water,

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:28.560
Nawwab looks at a sleeping
baby, hears him cooing

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.170
and wishes he does not
grow up to be as listless

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.510
and ruthless as the poet, himself.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:42.630
He prays the child grows up to find
himself a place he can call home.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.010
Because in the Arab world, there
is no privilege that equals

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:50.130
that of truly having a homeland.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:57.370
Having none, Nawwab realizes how
open wounds are not meant to heal

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.140
and therefore they
become the memory of loss.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:07.500
Grief runs in al-Nawwab's blood
and drowning in a ruin sea

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.790
of infinite pain is now the port.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.830
And Nawwab knows and
reminds us that the mud

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.880
of love in our land is harmed.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.720 position:56%
If the dirtiest mud sprouts jasmine,
when it's nurtured with love,

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.240 position:56%
what would the best Arab mud sprout?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.620
And Nawwab weeps for
the lost paradise

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.900
and the lost potential
of Arab youth.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.880
A youth oppressed and stripped
from its basic human rights.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:47.320
What does the future have
in store for this baby?

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.070
No one knows but the poet
is worried and rightly so.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.020
For no one knows what it means
to have a place to call home more

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:04.650
than a ruthless plant in water.

[ Foreign Speaking ]

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.230
I threw my keys in the Tigris
in the days of longing.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:36.540
And now in diaspora, there
remains no key to unlock me.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.940
Here I am, locked up but outspoken.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.040
He who was locked up in longing
and was lost on the sidewalks

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:52.530
of al-Shaam, shall relate to me.

Those who share the poet's
experience of walking

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.750
on the sidewalks of al-Shaam,
lost, sad, and alienated,

and relate to his pains

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.440
that no remedy can treat.

Despite being locked up in diaspora,
al-Nawwab continues to be outspoken.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.970
Many Arabs in the Arab
world and in the diaspora,

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.900

some aspects of his experience.

In another poem, the Old Tavern --
this is the last one by al-Nawwab --

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.060
Nawwab reminds us all that as an
Arab poet, he rejects two things.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:40.390
And we shall see these two things.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:46.760
Oh lord, I have accepted all
things except humiliation

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.100
and having my heart caged
in the sultan's palace.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.460
I was content that my lot in this
world be like that of a bird,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.560

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.490
al-Nawwab projects two things,
humiliation and becoming the voice

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.260
of the sultan instead
of that of the people.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.890
For a poet like Nawwab, the act of
writing poetry is a necessary act

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.170
of resistance to maintain
a dignified life.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.310
Like a bird, he needs
to return home.

However, because of his poetry,
he's destined to weep over the ruins

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.160
of the Arab world which has turned

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.980
into prison stretching
from to sea to sea.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.830
Now, I'll be talking
about Nazir Qabbani --

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:46.390
The complete poetry for
political abduction incident.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:49.300
This poem speaks afresh of the
status quo in the Arab world

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.370
and more specifically
to the refugee crisis

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.730
in Syria despite being
written some 40 years ago.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.720
So, it's a very interesting poem.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.200
There are a few quotations --

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.480
stanzas, of course because
it's a very long poem.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.240
Forgive us, our blood has
been shed since we were born.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.570
A thousand policemen
are on our papers.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.440
They shot us but we did not fall.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.840 position:56%
They tried to cut our legs to hinder
us from crawling but we stood up.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.160
They cut off our hands, so that we
cannot hold the pens but we wrote.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.370
They tried to convince us
that poetry is disbelief

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.720
so we became disbelievers.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.270
Forgive us if we urinate on all
the statues that fill the squares

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:42.860
of the city and all the images
that the police post forcibly

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.190
and all the shops of the
city and all the slogans

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.690
at which the children of
the city throw bricks.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.990
Forgive us if we pile like
sheep on the back of the ship,

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:00.790
if we are scattered on all the
oceans for years and years.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.160
We did not find among
the Arab traders,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.120
a trader who would accept
to feed us our buy us.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.900
We did not find among the beautiful
Arab women a woman accepting

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.280
to love us or free us.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.300
We did not find among
the Arab rebels a rebel

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.730
who did not stab us with a knife.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:28.730
Forgive us, forgive us if we reject
everything, if we break everything,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.680
if we uproot everything, if
we throw our names at you

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.510

us and the ports refused us.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:52.830
[ Foreign Speaking ]

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.720
Qabbani questions the predominant
narratives of Arab history,

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.000
religion, and literature.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.100
He envisions the future of the
Arab world, either in a revolution

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.930
where Arab leaders are attacked
in their palaces and ousted

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:14.560
by the people or in a
major refugee crisis

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.760
where the people are
ousted by their leaders.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.390
Qabbani defends the
people against the regime

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:26.970
in this court trial
offering a complete account

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:31.880
of an abduction incident that has
been taking place in the Arab world

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.410
without being reported
or fairly tried.

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:41.940
In ironically offering a poetic
apology to oppressor forces

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:48.430
that crush Arab individuals
and undermine their humanity,

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.790
Qabbani reveals a history
of systematic oppression

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:59.110
in the Arab world and incites
his people to revolt if they want

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:05.000
to stop this abduction from
continuing indefinitely.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.090
Towards the end of the
poem, Qabbani speaks

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:13.860
for his scattered fellow
Arabs, particularly refugees

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:19.430
who are denied entry by
Arab ports across the world.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:23.100
Qabbani tells the rulers of fear
in police states in the Arab world

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:28.880
to forgive us because we couldn't
change the way things are,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.440 position:56%
because we let you shed our blood
to get drunk with it as Nawwab said,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.950
and because we gave you the
keys to our prison cells

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.080
as obedient sheep you made us into.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.990
Until we face fear and take these
keys back and break these chains,

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:56.190 position:56%
nothing will change and no prophets
will come to save us from the abyss.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.130
The sun of oppression will
continue to burn us alive

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.140
and the world will continue

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.540
to become less humane
with every passing day.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.480
I end my talk today
with Fatma Kandil.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:32.010
Fatma Kandil was born [foreign
word] in Cairo in 1958.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.950
She wrote several collections
of poetry

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.570
and she's popular among
the young generation.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:42.100
The following stanzas are from her
poem, Thorny Gap, Suddenly Moving

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:52.060
or Keys [foreign speaking]
in which she raises questions

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:59.260
about the fate -- about fate and
free will and she addresses fear

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.180
and how to better deal with it.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:12.830
The keys that open doors
are the keys that lock them.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.470
And the keys strangled
in chains have nothing

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.120
but the drama of tinkling.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.930
But the key that dies in my
pocket reminds me it is time

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.570
that I become a reasonable
woman who lives in a house

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.510
without keys, without doors.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:38:38.040
[ Foreign Speaking ]

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.420
Every day while I am on the express
metro, a rundown house flashes by,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.100
a wooden ladder leaning against it,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.060
and a corrugated iron
door, always open.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.080
Every day, until it became my home.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.070
Fatma Kandil addresses the fear
controlling her life in general,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:39:00.080
her life as a female Arab
individual and uses the same keys

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.110
that suffocate her life to
unlock the doors of the rooms

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:11.910
that Arab citizens have been
confined in for centuries.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:20.340
She realizes that the house
she lives in only becomes here

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.260
when she breaks its doors open.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.630
So, she no longer needs
keys to open these doors.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.630
Fear governs every aspect of
our life, public and personal.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.790
Therefore, Kandil realizes
that the keys

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:38.970
that strangle her are the
keys that will set her free.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:45.900
Freeing the keys from the
chains is freeing oneself

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.340
from the same chains,
no keys, no doors.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:55.150
That even the rundown
house which is a metaphor

00:39:55.150 --> 00:40:00.850
of what our life has become in this
tragic time, becomes free home.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.610
Kandil tells us that we glance

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:11.550
at our rundown life everyday while
holding the keys to our freedom.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.870
But fear stops us from
acting, from changing.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:21.220
She reminds us that no one will
act on our behalf and if we want

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:30.700
to turn this rundown house into a
home, we better take responsibility

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.650
for our own fates, for our own
future, and make our own destiny.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:41.050
More important than this
realization, is that confession

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.560
that our life is a rundown house.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:50.740
In writing such poems, Kandil
refuses to be silenced and refuses

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.740
to surrender her destiny to fate.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.350
If Qabbani declares
he has no secret books

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.060
that he imprisons inside the doors,
Kandil insists to break these doors

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.160
and their keys altogether.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.550
A home is a loving place
you make for yourself.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.760
And it doesn't qualify as home if
its keys are with someone else.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.060
It doesn't qualify as home

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.790
if closing its doors means
imprisonment instead of freedom.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.530
Keys will not give you a home but
Arabic poetry becomes your home

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.830
when you have nowhere else to go.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.130
Never tell an Arab poet not to
write because you cannot take

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.490
from poets their final refuge
when everyone has failed them.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.290

&gt;&gt; Fear. They refuse
to submit to fear.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:17.440
And they know they hold the keys
which is for poets to speak out,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.170
to encourage their people to
speak, to run a dignified life,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.290
to refuse to be humiliated.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:25.300
So, everyone is searching
for his key and some

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.710
of them know they will never
find the key like Nawwab.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:32.830
He lost his key and he knows there
is no key but he's still talking

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.300
about the homeland and
diaspora and longing

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.120
and he's sharing his pain
and grief with others.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.380
So, for people, for Arab people in
the Arab world and in the diaspora,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.150
they read his poetry,
they relate to his grief.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.870
They share the same experience.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:53.230
They find home when they
don't have a home to go to.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:58.380
So, they're all -- they all
reject to submit to fear

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.160
and they all are looking for these
keys and they all want us to look

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.740
for these keys and to
speak out through poetry

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:14.140
if the audience is poetic or in
other means or to read poetry --

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.750
to relate to this poetry
because they write for us

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.440
and the poetry is universal,
of course.

poetry in one way or another.

He wants to -- he writes
free, naked poems.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:13.710
He says what he wants to say
without using a secret language.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.010
So he is against oppression

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.410
and authoritarian regimes
and he says it.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:22.310
So, his poetry is very

of Arab women, yes, exactly.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:28.690
That's why I wanted to end with
Fatma Kandil because she knows

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.690
that she has the keys to her life,
to her destiny, to her freedom

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.910
and through poetry,
she can reveal some

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.480 position:56%
of these keys and secrets to others.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:43.490
So, we're seeing more and more
of some kind of engagement

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:48.660
of Arab women in politics and in
poetry and being able to speak

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.400
out against the same conditions
they're subject to as men but more

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.810 position:56%
so because they're definitely women.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.630

&gt;&gt; Yes, in America, you
can find everything online.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.400
There are --

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.700
&gt;&gt; Where is it published?

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.170
&gt;&gt; It's published online as pdf's
so you can download and read

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:44.740
or you can go to websites that
publishes Arabic poetry so --

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.140
[inaudible comment] It's been
published in the Arab world

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.310
but you cannot have it, of
course, unless it's secretive.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.790
It still is, interestingly,
even online --

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.640
here I can find things
online because I'm here.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.490 position:56%
But when I go to Jordan or if you're
abroad, the websites are blocked.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:04.350
So, we can't really
read Nawwab easily.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:05.820
So, people make photocopies

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.120
and share them even
now in the Arab world.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.080
I used to read him as a
child because my father used

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.000
to read his poetry and we
have some of his collections.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.920
Sure, but ironically, still, he's
still banned in the Arab world

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.740
and if you try to go online if
you're in Jordan or in Syria

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.750
or in Iraq, it is a challenge.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:31.650
Yeah, but he's still, you know,
maybe because of these reasons,

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.250
he's celebrated, he's
translated, he's read.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.390
His poetry's memorized,
it inspires and incites.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.390
It aroused the audience.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:41.470
And if you go online,
also you can listen

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.320
to him read his own
poetry on YouTube.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.970
And people can relate
to his emotions

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.510
and the way he says things --
especially about [foreign words].

Very few. And I'm hoping I
will be able to do that next.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.810
There are epic poems, excellent
and amazing, by Nawwab,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.750
nobody translated, nobody
knows anything about.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.090
And that would be my
next project hopefully.

Yes, yes. Shem [foreign word] Shem.

In Syria, they refer
to Damascus as Shem.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:43.610
Outside Syria, Shem is Syria.

&gt;&gt; The younger generation is turning
to Qabbani and Muzaffar al-Nawwab.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.680
We have new poets, but
they can relate more

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.910
to that generation --
the 1960's generation.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:02.380
And we have new voices, one of them
is Fatma Kandil, but I can speak

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:09.500
about my generation, 1980's, it's
not a surprise that we go back

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.500
to the 1960's generations and
read their poets and we feel

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:17.920
that we can relate more to that
generation and their poetry.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.900
For some reason, I
think the poetry was

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:25.040 position:56%
and still is one of the best poetry.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.330
The poetry of Nizar Qabbani,
the poetry of [foreign name],

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:31.550
and the poetry of Muzaffar
al-Nawwab.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:37.870
I do read sometimes for young poets
like [foreign name] and other poets

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:39.720
and Fatma Kandil, but I always feel

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.390
like something brings
me back to al-Nawwab.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:46.670 position:56%
Something brings me back to the past
to read and appreciate their poetry.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:54.200 position:56%
And whenever I go to Jordan, I go to
the library, I speak to professors

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.810
and most of them say, "We're still
looking for something missing

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:02.160
in the new poetry which
makes us go back all the time

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.060
to the 1960's and 1970's
generation."

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.780
So, we would have to wait to see
how the new poetry turns out.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:14.610
But this poetry is still celebrated
and memorized in the Arab world.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.380
My father used to read
it to my mother

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.510
and I now read it to my husband.

&gt;&gt; They want to give them more time
before they critique their works.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:14.630
So that's why we go back
to the 60's and 70's.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.760
It's been time since they were
written so we can go back and,

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.510

&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.220 position:56%
Especially because of music as well.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.320
Some of this poetry has
been put into music,

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.030
Nazir Qabbani and Muzaffar
al-Nawwab.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.610
And you were talking about that.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.210
So, it travels across time and age.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.140
It's a strong poetry.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.440
It's beautiful poetry.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:56.290
And we can relate to it although it
was written 40, 50, 60 years ago.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.720
Especially [foreign speaking].

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.590
You see what's happening now
in Syria and you read this poem

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.510
and you say it's been 40 years
but it feels like yesterday.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:09.050
So, some of these poems have
emerged again now to the surface

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.730
and people have been reading them.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:15.230
And music also played a great role
because musicians usually look

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.300
at the poetry, at least in the
other world and want to put

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.450
into music something
that has been read,

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.900
world translated, and
that's popular.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.020
And this poetry is popular, so
instead putting to music something

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.730
that has just been published
or new or not critiqued

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:35.060
or has not been translated,
they would go to the 1960's

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:41.460 position:56%
or 70's generation, especially
Nazir Qabbani and Muzaffar al-Nawwab

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.760
because people can relate to them.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.220
The language they use,
as Nazir Qabbani said,

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.590
is a language that the
public can understand.

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.890
It's beautiful, it's poetry,

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:48.510
but it's something that
they can relate to.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.280
Unlike the poetry of Adonis.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.820
Adonis writes to the
elite because he believes

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.750
that the public will not change
anything and his hopes are

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.110 position:56%
on the elite who will change things.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.720
So, he writes the poetry that
only the elite can understand.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.770
But Qabbani said and Muzaffar said,
"No, we're writing to the public.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:08.630
Not only because we want
them to change things,

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.050
but because we relate to them.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.850
We are their voice so we speak
for them in one way or another."
