TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.820
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.945
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:07.170
news from Google.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.035
And this week, we have just
two quick cloud updates.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:11.850
We've made some
recent contributions

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.370
to the open source projects
for Minikube, which

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.650
lets you run Kubernetes
workloads locally,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
and Scaffold, a command line
tool for continuous development

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.940
on Kubernetes.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.880
Now, these updates should
help speed up the workflow

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.550
and reduce the difference
between how we develop

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.990
and run locally versus
in a Kubernetes cluster.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.850
And a lot more detail
is on the post.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.340
A short while ago, we
announced a new user interface

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
for BigQuery to make it easier
to uncover insights and share

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.135
them with teammates
and colleagues.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.260
This post highlights some
of the major improvements

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.870
that we've made to that
interface in the past five

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.770
months.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.590
Some of the functionality was
available in the classic UI,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.200
and some is totally new.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.124

and links to get started.

subscribe, and share.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.873
I'm Timothy Jordan for

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:01.260
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.400
It's actually my "Matrix" turn.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.190
It's Keanu.
