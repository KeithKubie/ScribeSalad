00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.379
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.700
It’s not just a sedan - it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.129
Switzerland has become a hotspot for suicide
tourism - but what does that mean?

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.789
And how exactly does it work?

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.939
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and you’ve
probably heard of the term “assisted suicide”

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.130
at some point.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.929
It’s a legal form of suicide, that’s performed
with the help of medical professionals.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.750
Most places in the world have banned it, for
ethical or religious reasons - but there is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.660
one country where assisted suicide is perfectly
legal, and that’s Switzerland.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.900
Currently, Switzerland has 6 different right-to-die
organizations, 4 of which willingly accept

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.820
patients who live outside the country.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.100
One of those organizations, is called “Dignitas
- to live with dignity, to die with dignity.”

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.960
It was founded in 1998, and since then, it’s
helped assist in the suicides of over 1,000

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960
people in Zurich.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.940
But as far as assisted suicide goes, it’s
relatively new - the practice has been legal

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.049
in Switzerland since 1942.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.539
Interestingly, there are a few states in the
US that do legally allow physician-assisted

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.360
suicide - including Oregon, Washington, Vermont,
and New Mexico - but Switzerland is unique,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.890
because it’s one of the few countries with
no national laws against it.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.549
As such, it’s created something of a “suicide
tourism” industry, where people travel from

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.380
all over the world, with the intent of ending
their life.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.909
Of course, not just anybody can choose to
do this.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.770
All patients undergo a thorough psychiatric
evaluation, to make sure they’re of sound

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.409
mind - but they also have to have a legitimate
medical reason for wanting to do it.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.380
And a recent study published in the British
Journal of Medicine, aims to find out exactly

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.360
who is partaking in suicide tourism - and
why.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.609
A team of researchers combed through databases
of information from the Institute of Legal

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.119
Medicine in Zurich, and looked at 611 cases
of assisted suicide between 2008 and 2012,

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.969
involving people from outside countries.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.959
The average age of someone seeking assisted
suicide, was 69 years old - ranging from 23

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.630
all the way up to 97.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.079
And women, they found, were 40% more likely
to choose assisted suicide, than men.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.010
The 611 cases also included people from 31
different countries - yet almost two-thirds

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.210
of the patients came from either Germany or
the UK.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.010
So why were they seeking suicide?

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.280
Well, the laws in the US state that you must
have a terminal illness, with a prognosis

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.140
of less than 6 months left to live.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.810
But it’s not like that in Switzerland.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.290
Certain organizations - like Dignitas - do
only work with terminally ill patients.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.880
But the actual Swiss laws, say you just have
prove that you’re not doing it for “selfish”

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.710
reasons, you’re doing it to “relieve suffering”
- whether that’s physical, mental, or both.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.610
In this study, the most common reason for
someone seeking suicide, were neurological

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.360
diseases - like paralysis, Parkinson’s,
motor neuron disease, and multiple sclerosis.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.650
Those accounted for almost half of the total
cases, followed by cancer and rheumatic diseases.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.790
And about 1 in 3 people, had multiple conditions.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.540
Now as foreign a concept as this is for most
of us - if you ignore the religious implications,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.870
there is something that seems wrong about
denying someone the ability to die with dignity,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.910
if they’re truly suffering from an incurable
illness.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.480
After all, we administer euthanasia to our
pets when they’re suffering.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.740
And from a moral standpoint, that’s even
more egregious - because animals can’t give

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740
consent.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.320
It is worth noting, though, the distinction
between euthanasia and “assisted suicide.”

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.319
Euthanasia is administered by someone else
- whereas “assisted suicide” is just that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.319
- assisted.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.290
In Switzerland at least, the drug can only
be “prepared” by a doctor - and the person

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.570
who’s committing suicide has to administer
the drug themselves.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.090
For most people in Switzerland, that drug
is sodium pentobarbital.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.870
It’s typically used to euthanize animals,
but it’s also been included in some of the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.260
lethal injection cocktails given to inmates
here in the US.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.510
When injected in high doses, it effectively
slows down your brain function, almost immediately,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.350
to the point where it stops - and once your
brain stops, eventually so does your heart.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.960
As far as lethal injection cocktails go, it’s
one of the more humane options.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.250
But even so, the topic of assisted suicide
is still highly controversial, and most countries

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.590
- including Germany and the UK - aren’t
eager to make it legal, anytime soon.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.090
What are your thoughts on this?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.960
Do you think assisted suicide should be legal,
or should it remain outlawed?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.060
Let us know what you think in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.260
watching!
