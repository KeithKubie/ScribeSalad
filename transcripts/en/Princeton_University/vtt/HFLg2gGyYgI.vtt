00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Kyle: ..and we're best friends.

00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.424
Arianna: Yes, we are.

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:10.448
...and he just kind of
gets along with everybody.

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:12.472
Kyle: I don't get along with
everybody as well as...

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.496
...as well as I get along with you.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.120
but it's true though

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:18.444
I feel like I've known you...

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:20.368
for....ever

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:21.892
Arianna: This feels like a family.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:22.916
You know what I mean?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.040
I think the
Spanish and Portuguese Department

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:27.964
has a very interesting way of

00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:29.688
making it feel like this is home.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.412
Alison: My friend Gaby Molina

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.436
we both went on this program

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.660
the summer after freshman year....

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:35.184
..didn't know each other beforehand.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.708
And we got really close then

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.732
and kind of went through the process...

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:42.056
sophmore year of deciding to
major in Spanish together.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180
...and I just remember we'd keep meeting up

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.204
for lunches, and we each had our

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:49.128
respective alternative majors

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:52.552
and just kept talking
ourselves closer to Spanish.

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:55.376
Until it came time for declaration day

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.500
and we're both like

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:58.188
"wait, like I think
we're both going to do it.

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.848
I think we're both
going to do Spanish."

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:02.472
I'll always remember all of the

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.475
 crazy memories that I've had

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:07.399
both abroad and in the Spanish Department.

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:09.123
Whether it be climbing up the mountain

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:10.947
in Barcelona to go interview

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:11.971
a radical Catholic nun.

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.995
Or eating rice and beans with strangers
that I recently met in Cuba.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.719
Or walking along the
trails of Machu Picchu.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.743
Or even going to Prospect House and
having a really good meal with

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.767
a TA or Professor.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.591
So in terms of how
"SPO" has helped me

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:27.715
I like to direct alot,
and I'm interested in

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:30.839
theater that matters.
Political theater.

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:35.063
And for my thesis
I've gotten to study Political Theater in Brazil

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:37.387
under the dictatorship.

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.111
and actually being able to connect
a country that I really I love

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:46.335
with a shared artistic heritage and passion

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.559
has been really really
important in thinking about

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.583
what matters for me moving forward.

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:53.007
So, I'm kind of hoping to continue

00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.131
studying some teatro do oprimido -
theatre of the oppressed

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.100
The fact that I've just been able to

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:05.924
go to anarchist dens in
the outskirts of Madrid

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:10.648
and also home studios in Havana

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:18.372
has been something I wouldn't
have expected I would be doing necessarily...

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:26.096
but it's very important for me in my
overall intellectual and personal growth.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.020
I think that my favorite
memories were actually

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:31.044
with my independent work.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:36.468
My advisors that I had really
guided my academic experience here

00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:38.292
in a way that I hadn't expected.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:41.216
And sort of like empowered me to....

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.240
I don't know.
I hadn't really thought of myself as an academic

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:49.564
before my independent work.
And having someone recognize it and say like

00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:55.588
"This is actually good. You're actually
thinking pretty differently about the field"

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:56.512
was a big deal.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:03:01.536
We went to see the Iguazu Waterfalls,
which is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.160
Standing on the edge of one of
the world's biggest waterfalls

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:10.284
as the water tumbles over
and we're just watching

00:03:10.308 --> 00:03:14.108
beautiful rainbows cascade about.

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:19.532
I think we were all really awestruck
and it put a lot of things into context.

00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:21.256
So that was an amazing moment.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.880
I think the best memories that I made were

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:26.646
actually the friends that I met
in Buenos Aires in my research

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:28.828
were all from Spain because
they were studying abroad.

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.152
And I got to see them when
I went back this January.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.403
So, that was really cool to
kind of complete the circle

00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:36.099
and maintain contact with
those friends I met abroad.

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:38.523
The thing that sticks out
in my head is just like...

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:41.347
a Spanish Department reception
at Palmer House with...

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.371
Kyle: DJ Max Grear.
Arianna: Yeah [Laughing]

00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:45.895
Kyle: And people dancing and I don't know.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.819
Kyle: What other department are people
going to be dancing Salsa for hours?

00:03:48.843 --> 00:03:51.743
Arianna: Yeah...with their professors!
Kyle: With their professors. Yeah!

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:55.367
Thank you everybody for an awesome
four years here at Princeton.

00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:58.691
I really appreciate your
friendship and your teaching.

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:04.015
Boa sorte. O melhor de tudo para vocês.
Obrigado por tudo.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.739
Pues estoy súper agradecida por todo lo que
me ha dado el departamento de español.

00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:13.163
De verdad ha sido una experiencia fenomenal y
si lo pudiera repetir, lo haría sin falta.

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:18.574
Y muchísimas gracias a Alberto,
que siempre ha sido una persona

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.311
que me apoya en todos los
momentos que lo he necesitado.

00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:28.535
De verdad te voy a echar de menos… a todo el departamento.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:32.559
Han sido cuatro años espectaculares.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.083
Muchísimas gracias
por todo, de verdad.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.107
Felicitaciones a todos mis amigos.

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:43.254
Y muchísimas gracias a todos los profesores
por darnos una experiencia increíble;

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:49.693
y por siempre, siempre,
darnos oportunidades

00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:56.155
que no podríamos tener
en otra universidad.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.790
Kyle: Caetano Veloso, the Brazilian Singer,
has a song "Alegre"

00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:05.214
which is like "joy".
Its a bit ironic, but, I would say

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.638
lets take it!
Like, Alegre! In this moment. I don't know.

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:09.662
Arianna: Yeah.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:15.686
Congratulations to the rest of the
strong Spanish Class of 2018.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.210
There are a lot of us and we did it!
We're almost there.

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:21.234
Enhorabuena.
