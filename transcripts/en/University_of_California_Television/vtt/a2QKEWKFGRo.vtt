American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.975
Professor Gordon-Reid, welcome to Berkley.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:03.929
- Glad to be here.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.536
- Where were you born and raised?

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:07.410
- I was born in Livingston, Texas,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.802
and when I was about six months old,

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:11.702
my parents moved to Conroe, Texas,

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:14.732
which was between Livingston and Houston.

00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:17.854
So, it's in East Texas, about
40 minutes north of Houston.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.951
- Looking back, how do you
think your parents shaped

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:23.066
your thinking about the world?

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:27.376
- Well, my parents were both
people who loved to read,

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.492
so we always had books in the house.

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:31.709
They were very political people,

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.494
and we discussed politics.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:35.439
I was a little girl, it was in the 60's,

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.749
of course, that was a very volatile time,

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.836
things going on on the
television, conversations.

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:43.671
So, it was a house where
people really discussed

00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:46.498
intellectual ideas,
argued, they're debaters.

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:50.775
We argued points all the
time, so it was a very,

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:53.025
I would say lively,
intellectual atmosphere.

00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:57.134
- And of your parents, were
both equally an influence

00:02:57.134 --> 00:03:00.164
or was your mother especially important?

00:03:00.164 --> 00:03:02.192
- Well, they were influences in both ways.

00:03:02.192 --> 00:03:04.593
I suppose my mother was important,

00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:08.959
because my mother had
sort of plans for me.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.348
She had ideas that I was
gonna do something wonderful.

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:13.943
I guess everybody's mother feels that way

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:17.737
about their children,
but she was very, very,

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.792
she was a schoolteacher.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.797
She would order books for the summer.

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:25.913
My brothers and I were really
upset because we actually had

00:03:25.913 --> 00:03:28.409
to have some version of school
even through the summer.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.242
(laughs)

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.098
- What did she teach?

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:31.375
- She taught English.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.220
She was an English teacher, loved grammar.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.162
It was her thing, was
a great writer herself.

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:40.625
So, I think the sort of extra preparation,

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.556
the idea that she was
preparing me for something

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.712
was very, very big in my life.

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:47.584
So, she was a great influence.

00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:50.641
My father was too, however,
because he was the one,

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.471
I think he was probably even
more political than she.

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.820
So, he was the one who sort
of fostered the kind of debate

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.226
and discussion quite a
lot in our household.

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:03.414
- Were history books especially important

00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:05.416
in your reading lists?

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:08.833
- Yes, I discovered that I loved history,

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.249
sort of reading age-appropriate
history books in school,

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.799
but my parents had other
books around during that time

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.792
about black history, African-American
history, and so forth.

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:23.644
And even regular history, or all history.

00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:25.935
And that's something
that I developed a love

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:29.658
for very early on, and so
it was a way to spend time,

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:32.717
particularly in the summers
in the heat of Texas

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:35.134
when you have to come inside.

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:38.674
There's a great deal to boredom.

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:40.870
When you don't have
distractions, you read.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.284
And I was always in the library
checking out books, so yeah.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.720
- And what was it like as a young person

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.553
in East Texas sort of experiencing

00:04:51.737 --> 00:04:53.523
the civil rights movement

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:57.429
with knowledgeable parents
who were steeping you

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.919
in history, and thinking,
and conversation, and so on?

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.991
- Well, it was particularly
interesting for me

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:06.891
because I integrated our school district.

00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:09.789
I was the first black child
to go to a white school

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.439
in our school district,
and that was a big point

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.747
because they had been
resisting, this is the mid-60's,

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:18.377
they had been resisting Brown.

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.898
The Brown decision coming
up with all kinds of plans

00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:23.214
about how to avoid that,
and one was called a

00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:26.673
Freedom of Choice plan, and
white parents were supposed

00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:28.639
to pick white schools for their kids,

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.429
and black parents were
supposed to pick black schools.

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:34.169
And my parents, following the news,

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.196
understanding that the
court and the 5th circuit

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:41.144
and the court would probably
not uphold those rules,

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:44.211
decided to send me to the white school.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.690
- And this would have
been at what grade level?

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.692
- First grader, I was a first grader.

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:52.080
So, for the first year,
I was there by myself

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.547
and I was very conscious of their being

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:57.512
on something of a mission.

00:05:57.512 --> 00:05:59.972
My parents agreed with
the school district not

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:03.680
to go to the press, not
to talk to the press,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.705
because they wanted it
to be very, very low key,

00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:08.993
none of this escorting her to
schools or anything like that.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:12.881
But just as sort of normal
as it could possibly be.

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.807
And I was there for a year by myself.

00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:19.152
Then, of course, the court
did strike these down,

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:21.397
and then, everybody had to shift and move,

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:23.215
and I was already sort of in place.

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:28.007
- So, it sounds like this
background that we've just talked

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:32.226
about empowered you to
be a tough little kid.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.059
(laughs)

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.507
Go through that, is that fair?

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:36.098
- Well, I don't know,
I've thought about this

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:38.198
over the years, it's the
chicken and egg thing.

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:41.932
Was I the right personality to do this,

00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:44.936
or did it shape my
personality being there?

00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:47.177
I'm sure it's a little bit of both.

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:49.844
I've not minded being by myself,

00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:54.757
which I was quite often
during that time period.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:59.287
You know, reading, I knew
how to sort of take care

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:02.674
of myself, in a way, so it
was a profound experience.

00:07:02.674 --> 00:07:04.993
And it's not something that
I've, I've thought about it,

00:07:04.993 --> 00:07:06.329
but I probably haven't thought about it

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:09.335
the way a historian should think about it.

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.594
I've sort of turned myself
to other people's lives

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:15.597
and not my own, but it was
a pretty, pretty formative,

00:07:15.597 --> 00:07:17.460
and a kind of amazing thing to do.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.960
I'm not sure that,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.175
and people say, "Well, that's a lot to put

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:27.057
"on a kid," but I suppose
somebody had to do it.

00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:29.199
- You had self-confidence,
though, from your parents.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.782
- Yeah, oh yeah, oh definitely.

00:07:32.898 --> 00:07:36.861
The one thing, my mother
believed I could do anything.

00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:40.956
And that kind of, that
assurance about that

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:43.385
could be, you know, it's empowering,

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.668
but it could also be sometimes,

00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:46.317
"Ah, you know, I really can't do that."

00:07:46.317 --> 00:07:48.202
But she really did believe in me,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.785
so that idea of her
belief and her support.

00:07:53.107 --> 00:07:55.034
Her parents, my grandmother,

00:07:55.034 --> 00:07:57.047
I had a grandmother who
was quite extravagant.

00:07:57.047 --> 00:08:00.397
I remember her going to,
that she went to Sakowitz,

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.881
which was the big sort of
department store in Houston,

00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.239
and buying lots of clothes, great clothes,

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:10.060
because I was gonna be dressed
to the nines when I went.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.054
So, it was a kind of a family enterprise.

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:15.937
They didn't sit down and say,
"Now, you're on a mission."

00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:17.914
But you could tell from all of this

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.222
that this was something
that was important.

00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:25.389
- Now, as you're reading a
book in elementary school,

00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:29.624
I guess, about Jefferson
and his black friend,

00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:33.732
tell us that story, because
it starts there, in a way.

00:08:33.732 --> 00:08:34.773
(laughs)

00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:35.968
- Yes, it starts there.

00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:40.208
I read a book, a biography,
a child's biography,

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.642
when I was in the 3rd
grade about Jefferson,

00:08:42.642 --> 00:08:46.871
and the story was told
by a fictional slave boy

00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:50.213
who was supposed to be
telling Jefferson's story.

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:54.288
And I noted the contrast between
the depiction of the boy,

00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:57.371
who was sort of lazy and not serious,

00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:02.324
and he was upset with
Jefferson because Jefferson,

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:05.328
you know, Marse Tom, or
however they described him,

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:07.751
wanted to read books and was curious,

00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:09.263
and wanted to find out about the world.

00:09:09.263 --> 00:09:11.817
He didn't wanna hunt,
and fish, and everything.

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:16.041
And I remember being embarrassed
by that because it was,

00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:17.723
the book was sort of
in the back of our room

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.391
where they had the little library for us,

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:21.493
we had a real library but also a library

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.556
in the back of the room.

00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:25.880
And I knew that my
classmates might see that,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.697
and I knew that they would
make the identification

00:09:28.697 --> 00:09:32.747
between me and the enslaved
boy, who was depicted in a way,

00:09:32.747 --> 00:09:36.000
sort of unnecessarily,
in an exaggerated way

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.323
as this person who was unserious,

00:09:38.323 --> 00:09:42.223
as in contrast to Jefferson who was white

00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:43.641
and was supposed to be all that was good

00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:48.214
and the enslaved boy
was stupid, essentially.

00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:51.797
And it struck me then
that that was unfair,

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:55.718
but it also, the sort of interest

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.847
in Jefferson and Monticello
and slavery, sort of came,

00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:02.844
that was the germ of it right there,

00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:07.467
with the combination of the
interest and at the same time,

00:10:07.467 --> 00:10:11.565
concern about the way the black
enslaved boy was depicted.

00:10:11.565 --> 00:10:13.315
So, it started there.

00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:19.053
People have asked me why
did the other biographies,

00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:21.823
there was Madison and
George Washington Carver,

00:10:21.823 --> 00:10:25.406
Dolly Madison, why did
Jefferson stand out?

00:10:26.572 --> 00:10:28.153
It's not something you can explain.

00:10:28.153 --> 00:10:31.626
Why does someone wanna play the
violin instead of the piano.

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:33.126
It just struck me.

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.328
That's how it all got started.

00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:39.204
I continued to read
about him over the years.

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:43.725
- And so, you completed
your high school in Texas,

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:47.194
and where did you go from
there when you went to college?

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:49.764
- I went to Dartmouth College
in Hanover, New Hampshire.

00:10:49.764 --> 00:10:52.431
So, the opposite end of the map.

00:10:53.617 --> 00:10:55.784
I wanted to go away to
school in New England.

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:57.487
There was sort of romance in doing that.

00:10:57.487 --> 00:11:00.464
So, yeah, that's where I went.

00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:04.196
- At Dartmouth did you, when
did you get the history bug?

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:08.934
Did you get it at Dartmouth or
did you have the history bug?

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.929
- Well, I'd had the history bug since

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:14.203
from elementary school,
even before Jefferson.

00:11:14.203 --> 00:11:18.370
I would read, I was very,
very interested in Egypt,

00:11:19.547 --> 00:11:21.185
books about ancient times.

00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:25.494
And so, the history bug
was always there for me.

00:11:25.494 --> 00:11:29.078
At Dartmouth, it was wonderful
because Baker Library

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:32.335
is there, and you know, a fabulous library

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:35.662
and I could sort of indulge
and read all that I wanted.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:38.245
And I also was a history major.

00:11:39.318 --> 00:11:42.784
- But then, were there any teachers

00:11:42.784 --> 00:11:45.649
at Dartmouth that interested
you in the direction

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.918
of history that stand out?

00:11:47.918 --> 00:11:51.706
- Michael Green, the late
Michael Green, was influential.

00:11:51.706 --> 00:11:55.218
Leo Spitzer, Elizabeth Wayland,
who's a Russian historian,

00:11:55.218 --> 00:11:57.721
for I had a brief detour where
I was very much interested

00:11:57.721 --> 00:11:59.446
in Russian history and
sort of read everything

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:02.613
that I could in Russian
novels and so forth.

00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:05.387
Yeah, there were people
there who interested me.

00:12:05.387 --> 00:12:07.901
- And a course on Jefferson?

00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.466
- Not a course on Jefferson,
but certainly courses

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:12.515
in which Jefferson figured.

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:15.015
- And graduate from Dartmouth,

00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:18.020
so why law school and not history?

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.187
- Well, I had had this sort
of dual interest in law.

00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:27.905
Sort of stoked by my father
who sort of admired lawyers.

00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:30.746
And he thought that that
would be a good idea.

00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:33.592
And also, I think
because of my background,

00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:37.952
I knew that my going to
Anderson Elementary School

00:12:37.952 --> 00:12:40.170
had been started, the process

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.233
of doing that came from the law.

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:45.232
It came from lawyers
who made that possible,

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:47.782
who actually effectuated that change.

00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:50.865
So, lawyers were seen to me as people

00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:54.950
who could affect change in society.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.576
I thought a little bit about journalism,

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:58.672
that was my first job when I was 15.

00:12:58.672 --> 00:13:00.215
I worked at the Conroe Courier.

00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:02.212
And this was the age of
Woodward and Bernstein,

00:13:02.212 --> 00:13:03.767
and they were sort of heroes.

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:06.587
But journalism, I found
when I got to Dartmouth,

00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:09.396
journalists seemed a little cliquey to me,

00:13:09.396 --> 00:13:12.807
and it was sort of a boy's club.

00:13:12.807 --> 00:13:15.060
So that was sort of out for me.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.311
I figured that the actual
profession might be that way.

00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.700
I didn't go to history
because I was reading

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.144
and I was told that there
were too many PhDs in history.

00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:29.621
What I didn't understand is
that there's almost no PhDs,

00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:32.901
black PhDs in history,
and they would have loved

00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:34.571
to have me go to the program.

00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.555
And I could have gotten a JD PhD,

00:13:36.555 --> 00:13:40.855
but I decided to go to Harvard Law School,

00:13:40.855 --> 00:13:43.460
and figured that if I was
interested in history,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.514
you could keep reading it.

00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:49.458
- I like to ask my guests about the skills

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:53.628
and the temperament that
they think are important

00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:56.365
for the professions
that they've undertaken.

00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:58.964
Now, you have dual professions, in a way

00:13:58.964 --> 00:13:59.881
- Yes, yes.

00:14:01.498 --> 00:14:03.352
- So, let's talk about that.

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:07.019
In other words, what
skills does a historian

00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:10.285
and then a lawyer really need,

00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:12.779
and is there an overlap between the two?

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:14.605
- Well, there's definitely an overlap.

00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:16.532
I would say the skills that a historian,

00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:20.490
that I've brought to bear in
doing history is curiosity.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.760
That's the first thing.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.247
You have to have curiosity and tenacity.

00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:26.580
You have to have imagination

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.743
to figure out a research strategy.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.070
I mean, how do you find things

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.554
that you're interested in?

00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:34.162
And that's very, very important.

00:14:34.162 --> 00:14:36.983
I think that certainly
overlaps with the law.

00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:40.178
The difference between
history and law on that score,

00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:44.066
however, is that
historians have the luxury,

00:14:44.066 --> 00:14:47.747
have the capacity, to
direct their own research.

00:14:47.747 --> 00:14:49.045
If I'm interested in Jefferson

00:14:49.045 --> 00:14:51.729
and I wanna do a book about
Jefferson or whatever.

00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:53.951
If I'm interested in the
civil rights movement,

00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:55.314
I can do that.

00:14:55.314 --> 00:14:56.877
Law is a service profession.

00:14:56.877 --> 00:14:58.323
A lot of people don't realize that,

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:00.406
but lawyers are servants.

00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:05.258
And you have to learn
how to have curiosity

00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:07.354
about other people's lives,

00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:10.854
you have to learn how to interest yourself

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:14.308
in other people's lives,
and do the kind of job,

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:16.840
the concentration that's needed

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.474
to be really, really
serious, because lawyers,

00:15:20.474 --> 00:15:23.109
unlike historians,
lawyers are dealing with,

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:25.054
you hold people's lives in your hands.

00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:28.455
In some instances, actually
people could be put away,

00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:32.733
could die based on what their
lawyer does or does not do.

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.495
And that seriousness of
purpose has to be there.

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:36.828
It's not a game.

00:15:38.184 --> 00:15:41.785
You can see it as a game, but
it's a very important game.

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:43.161
Not that history isn't important,

00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:45.833
but there're not no life
and death stakes there.

00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:48.145
- Now, in both in a way, well, especially

00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:52.244
if you're a trial lawyer,
you have to tell a story,

00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:53.522
- [Annette] Mm hmm, yeah.

00:15:53.522 --> 00:15:55.179
and a historian has to tell a story.

00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:57.576
- Yeah, oh no, the law
is a writing, I mean,

00:15:57.576 --> 00:16:01.953
that's the other reason that
law could be a choice for me,

00:16:01.953 --> 00:16:04.635
because lawyers are writers, as well,

00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:05.882
and they're story tellers.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.215
And even if you're in trial,

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:11.389
even if you're doing,
whether it's criminal law

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:14.221
or civil, you're telling a story.

00:16:14.221 --> 00:16:17.721
And whoever tells the superior story wins.

00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:23.412
- The other issue here
in both it would seem

00:16:23.412 --> 00:16:26.662
that you make decisions about the facts

00:16:28.748 --> 00:16:31.978
and what are to be included and excluded.

00:16:31.978 --> 00:16:33.076
- Oh, yeah.
- If you're defending somebody

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.788
who there's certain factual situation

00:16:35.788 --> 00:16:39.242
where you don't want it
to come up in the trial.

00:16:39.242 --> 00:16:43.409
Talk a little about that,
because that is very important

00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:48.311
in your very compelling first work,

00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:52.256
looking at what the historians
had said about Jefferson.

00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:54.897
- Well, it's interesting, the
first book that I wrote was

00:16:54.897 --> 00:16:57.995
about the historiography of this question

00:16:57.995 --> 00:17:00.489
whether Jefferson had had
this long term liaison

00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:02.983
with an enslaved woman, Sally Hemings.

00:17:02.983 --> 00:17:06.783
And you know, as a lawyer, I think people,

00:17:06.783 --> 00:17:08.273
I was a law professor at the time,

00:17:08.273 --> 00:17:10.478
just a law professor at the time,

00:17:10.478 --> 00:17:13.168
I didn't have an adjoint appointment.

00:17:13.168 --> 00:17:16.178
I noticed that historians
sort of view lawyers

00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:19.515
as doing what they call
law office history,

00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:23.265
namely cherry-picking
facts to write a brief.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.722
The problem, however, is that good lawyers

00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:31.352
don't just cherry-pick the facts.

00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:35.169
Good lawyers know the opponent's case

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:37.252
better than the opponent,

00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:41.778
because you have to know
those kinds of things.

00:17:41.778 --> 00:17:46.368
And what I saw was historians
sort of cherry-picking

00:17:46.368 --> 00:17:50.253
and not, because there was no opponent,

00:17:50.253 --> 00:17:53.307
not understanding that one of these days

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:56.225
that could come back to haunt them.

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:58.141
Because they had less stuff out.

00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:01.308
They had shaded the truth by omission.

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:05.135
So, what I wanted to
do in writing the book

00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:07.781
was to replicate that
moment when you're a lawyer,

00:18:07.781 --> 00:18:09.884
you're looking at the entire record,

00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:11.948
you know your side, you
know the other side,

00:18:11.948 --> 00:18:15.647
so you know the sides, you know the story,

00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:19.380
the possible stories,
but also give attention

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.547
to analyze the other side.

00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:26.911
- So, is it fair to say
that it was fortunate

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.198
that you went to law school--

00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:32.088
- Oh, absolutely.

00:18:32.088 --> 00:18:36.540
- Instead of history graduate
school because the law

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.574
and the training empowered you--

00:18:38.574 --> 00:18:39.807
- Oh, absolutely.
- To see the problem.

00:18:39.807 --> 00:18:41.930
- It empowered you, it
gave you the confidence,

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.060
somebody might say arrogance, (laughs)

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.318
to say that you could take this on.

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:48.968
I've talked to since
I've become a historian,

00:18:48.968 --> 00:18:52.051
and I pal around with historians now.

00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:54.291
A couple of them have told me

00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.197
that if I had been a graduate student,

00:18:56.197 --> 00:18:59.372
they would have told me
not to do my first book.

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:01.417
They would have dissuaded
me from doing that.

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:04.338
But as a law professor, we sort
of think we're mini experts

00:19:04.338 --> 00:19:07.890
on everything, and can
opine on everything.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.566
But also, we had the tools
and we're confident to do it

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:13.694
because we understood that law school is

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:17.684
about critical thinking,
and critical thinking is

00:19:17.684 --> 00:19:19.351
of use in any venue.

00:19:20.397 --> 00:19:24.148
It's easy, I suppose,
to well, easier to sort

00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:27.008
of replicate a story, to repeat a story,

00:19:27.008 --> 00:19:29.648
but when you get to the
point of taking things apart,

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:32.123
taking arguments apart,
putting them back together,

00:19:32.123 --> 00:19:35.142
analyzing, that's what
law school is about,

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:36.489
and that's what lawyers do,

00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:37.827
and that's what law professors do.

00:19:37.827 --> 00:19:41.994
So, yeah, I think I credit
my training in law school

00:19:42.976 --> 00:19:45.382
with giving me, number one,
the confidence to do that

00:19:45.382 --> 00:19:48.556
and to do that first
book, but I also know how

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:50.446
to do it in a way that would be effective.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:54.535
- In the first book, let
me give the exact title is

00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:56.835
"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings:

00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:58.918
An American Controversy".

00:20:02.387 --> 00:20:05.225
It's quite a read, so it's
extremely well-written,

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:08.642
but it almost reads like a mystery story.

00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:14.842
In addition, the reader becomes excited,

00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:16.452
and I'm coming at this cold

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:19.942
in preparation for this interview.

00:20:19.942 --> 00:20:22.859
It's uncovering a truth, basically.

00:20:28.242 --> 00:20:32.325
At one point in the book,
you as a person trained

00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:37.613
in the law, you tell us
about the rules of evidence,

00:20:37.613 --> 00:20:40.951
and how evidence contributes
to burden of proof.

00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:44.110
So, you're ready to go
and you're empowering

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.171
the reader to be ready to go.

00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:49.561
- Yeah, well, I saw myself,
people think, you know,

00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:51.949
the publicist for the book,

00:20:51.949 --> 00:20:53.876
that we went to the
University Press of Virginia,

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:55.337
they don't usually have a publicist,

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.498
but they had an idea that this book might

00:20:57.498 --> 00:20:59.646
be a crossover hit, so
they hired somebody.

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:03.208
And the idea was to sort
of sell this as a trial,

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.841
but that really isn't what it is.

00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:08.047
It's really more a law
professor talking to students.

00:21:08.047 --> 00:21:11.778
That this is what we do to talk
about how you use evidence,

00:21:11.778 --> 00:21:14.445
and how evidence can be misused.

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:20.297
And I had the experience of
sort of going through the book,

00:21:20.297 --> 00:21:24.146
my own understanding about
this story was unfolding

00:21:24.146 --> 00:21:25.994
as I was writing the book.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.014
And I think if I were to do it now,

00:21:28.014 --> 00:21:30.275
I probably would go back

00:21:30.275 --> 00:21:33.130
and change the beginning of the book,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.568
because I think if you can sort

00:21:34.568 --> 00:21:36.318
of see me moving more

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:40.259
towards the conclusion about this,

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:42.922
that I didn't have before when I started.

00:21:42.922 --> 00:21:46.439
The book is really about
how historians had written

00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:50.078
about the subject, not
whether or not Tom and Sally

00:21:50.078 --> 00:21:52.309
actually had an affair.

00:21:52.309 --> 00:21:54.273
I wasn't gonna make a
statement about that.

00:21:54.273 --> 00:21:59.010
I just knew that the
argument was sort of tainted

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.754
by understandings about race,

00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:03.924
and understandings about class.

00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:08.395
A thumb was put on the scale
for whites and wealthy people.

00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:12.555
And when less empowered
people said things,

00:22:12.555 --> 00:22:15.832
it was disregarded, and I
thought that that lesson

00:22:15.832 --> 00:22:17.178
could be displayed in the book.

00:22:17.178 --> 00:22:18.703
But as I'm doing it, I realize I start

00:22:18.703 --> 00:22:22.286
to find information
saying, "Wait a minute,

00:22:23.416 --> 00:22:25.579
"I could talk a little bit
about the actual substance

00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:27.588
"of the question, too."

00:22:27.588 --> 00:22:31.785
- It's interesting because
you said yesterday at lunch

00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:34.702
in a conversation with faculty that

00:22:37.367 --> 00:22:40.035
you wound up doing this
because this was the time

00:22:40.035 --> 00:22:43.256
that the Jefferson movie came out.

00:22:43.256 --> 00:22:46.006
A lot of the reviews were saying,

00:22:47.495 --> 00:22:50.271
"Well, this movie is nonsense

00:22:50.271 --> 00:22:52.278
"because there was no
sexual relationship."

00:22:52.278 --> 00:22:54.701
that's very interesting because

00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:58.127
not only was there conventional wisdom.

00:22:58.127 --> 00:23:01.617
Let's put it this way,
there was historical wisdom

00:23:01.617 --> 00:23:04.840
about which there was no
controversy before you wrote,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.508
but also that it had seeped
into the popular culture.

00:23:08.508 --> 00:23:11.841
And that provoked you and rightfully so.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.693
And really it was about
you're overthrowing

00:23:19.896 --> 00:23:23.432
a consensus in the history profession.

00:23:23.432 --> 00:23:25.725
Talk a little about that because

00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:29.736
that must have been
quite empowering for you

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:32.403
because you were seeing a truth,

00:23:33.363 --> 00:23:35.008
the lawyer that you were,

00:23:35.008 --> 00:23:37.689
that nobody else was really seeing,

00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:41.543
especially among those
most qualified to see it.

00:23:41.543 --> 00:23:45.312
- Well, all of the sort of
parts of my life came together.

00:23:45.312 --> 00:23:46.988
As I mentioned earlier, one of the things

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:50.457
that lawyers do is they can affect change.

00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:53.485
If they see an injustice,
they can take action.

00:23:53.485 --> 00:23:55.213
And that's what you're supposed to do.

00:23:55.213 --> 00:23:59.109
That feeling of outrage
and an injustice was

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:00.893
what propelled me to do this.

00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:04.005
Because I knew when people were saying,

00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.823
"Oh, this didn't happen,

00:24:05.823 --> 00:24:08.272
"Jefferson wouldn't be
involved with a slave girl,"

00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:09.421
all those kinds of things,

00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:12.709
I knew that Madison Hemings
who was an enslaved man

00:24:12.709 --> 00:24:15.266
at Monticello, and the
son of Thomas Jefferson

00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:18.201
and Sally Hemings, and
another enslaved man,

00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:21.444
Israel Jefferson, who's
real last name was Gillette,

00:24:21.444 --> 00:24:23.042
had said that it happened.

00:24:23.042 --> 00:24:25.821
And I thought, "You know, these are people

00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:30.107
"who were the objects of
slavery, the victims of slavery.

00:24:30.107 --> 00:24:33.429
"If we can't listen to them,
then what does that say

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:38.026
"about us as a country, as
a community, as a society?"

00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:41.535
You know, you typically
reserve your greatest sympathy

00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:43.904
for the people who are victims,

00:24:43.904 --> 00:24:46.258
who are obvious victims of repression.

00:24:46.258 --> 00:24:49.620
You don't spend all of your time

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.966
molly-coddling the person
who has the jack boot

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:55.511
on somebody's neck, and
that was what was going on.

00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:59.678
And I felt outrage and I
wanted to talk to the men,

00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:03.959
and these were largely
white, male historians,

00:25:03.959 --> 00:25:07.376
who were basically dismissing this story.

00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:11.842
Just sort of lay bare their prejudices

00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:14.009
and their illogic, really.

00:25:15.878 --> 00:25:19.948
And their assurance about this
was, I thought, unjustified.

00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:21.314
So, it was kind of fun.

00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:22.892
I was having a blast doing it.

00:25:22.892 --> 00:25:27.059
It was one of the most
enjoyable experiences I've had.

00:25:28.534 --> 00:25:31.461
- And he's talking again
about the character

00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:33.903
of a lawyer-historian.

00:25:33.903 --> 00:25:36.320
This took courage, basically,

00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:40.843
to be able to say,

00:25:40.843 --> 00:25:43.760
"This is wrong, this is not right."

00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.237
- That's what lawyers do.

00:25:47.237 --> 00:25:48.070
- [Harry] Right.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.100
- This is wrong, this is not right.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.489
And that's what law
school empowers you to do,

00:25:53.489 --> 00:25:56.338
and the profession, the sort
of history of the profession,

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:58.093
and the heroes of the profession,

00:25:58.093 --> 00:26:00.329
are the people who do that.

00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:01.856
The people who stand up and say,

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:06.386
Charles Hamilton Houston,
who decides I'm gonna use

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:08.518
what training I have to begin to chip away

00:26:08.518 --> 00:26:10.498
at the system of Jim Crow.

00:26:10.498 --> 00:26:13.126
And it might be crazy to
do, or the tobacco lawyers

00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:16.161
who you thought would never
beat that particular lobby,

00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:18.736
people were just sure
that will never happen,

00:26:18.736 --> 00:26:21.197
and they eventually beat it.

00:26:21.197 --> 00:26:23.105
And they actually won.

00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:26.438
And those are the people that we revere,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.355
the people who take a
chance, who stand up and say,

00:26:31.355 --> 00:26:34.797
"This is wrong," or take
on the tough challenge.

00:26:34.797 --> 00:26:38.285
And so, it was in keeping with
the ethos of the profession

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:42.487
and in the ethos of what my
parents taught me growing up.

00:26:42.487 --> 00:26:44.756
- And also the ethos of
the civil rights movement.

00:26:44.756 --> 00:26:47.076
- [Annette] Absolutely.

00:26:47.076 --> 00:26:48.256
- It changed everything.

00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:49.173
Now, in the

00:26:52.815 --> 00:26:56.398
triumph of the conventional wisdom

00:26:56.398 --> 00:26:58.231
before you came along,

00:26:59.548 --> 00:27:01.924
let's talk a little about
what's going on here.

00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:04.759
Because Jefferson is not anybody.

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:06.217
- [Annette] No.

00:27:06.217 --> 00:27:09.731
- He's an icon of American history.

00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:13.898
All men are created equal,
and so on and so forth.

00:27:14.982 --> 00:27:19.149
As you said, Sally Hemings
was a slave, basically.

00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:23.985
And when I read the
book, what came to mind,

00:27:23.985 --> 00:27:27.902
it was what you had
identified is the structure

00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:31.766
of intellectual racism, basically.

00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:33.516
And we don't think of

00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:39.373
racism being embedded

00:27:39.373 --> 00:27:42.739
in the assumptions of
establishment historians.

00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:43.697
- [Annette] No.

00:27:43.697 --> 00:27:46.197
- Up until this point in time.

00:27:48.464 --> 00:27:50.468
So, on the one half we have the icon,

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:53.396
but then you have this
whole group of people

00:27:53.396 --> 00:27:57.961
who are dismissed, who are
diminished as human beings,

00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.478
who basically it doesn't
matter what they're saying,

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:02.310
because it's not true
because they're black.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.143
- Yeah, yeah.

00:28:03.143 --> 00:28:06.288
No, and that's the
importance of the story.

00:28:06.288 --> 00:28:09.457
Even whatever you thought
about the ultimate answer

00:28:09.457 --> 00:28:11.806
to the question, that was the thing

00:28:11.806 --> 00:28:14.030
that I thought was so striking.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.936
And that I wanted people to say,

00:28:15.936 --> 00:28:19.046
"Well, this is happening
in this particular story,

00:28:19.046 --> 00:28:20.528
"where else is this happening?

00:28:20.528 --> 00:28:21.925
"How else is this happening?"

00:28:21.925 --> 00:28:25.173
And to get people to think that racism,

00:28:25.173 --> 00:28:27.096
because Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson,

00:28:27.096 --> 00:28:28.549
these were people who were--

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:31.463
- [Harry] Famous historians.
- Famous Jefferson historians.

00:28:31.463 --> 00:28:35.225
These were people who were
considered southern liberals.

00:28:35.225 --> 00:28:37.281
They're not the people
that you would think

00:28:37.281 --> 00:28:41.448
of sitting around with a clan
robe on or anything like that,

00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:45.510
but it shows you how, as you said,

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.677
assumptions and habits of
mind can embed themselves,

00:28:50.644 --> 00:28:53.114
are embedded in the structure
of how we think about things.

00:28:53.114 --> 00:28:56.153
And unless it's this constant process

00:28:56.153 --> 00:29:00.483
of questioning yourself
that brings it out,

00:29:00.483 --> 00:29:01.565
and that's why it's so hard.

00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:05.357
It's a difficult thing to
examine your own prejudices

00:29:05.357 --> 00:29:10.176
and assumptions and think
that you might be acting

00:29:10.176 --> 00:29:11.752
in a way that is prejudicial,

00:29:11.752 --> 00:29:13.556
acting in a way that is unfair.

00:29:13.556 --> 00:29:16.964
- And it's interesting, I
wanna move on to Jefferson,

00:29:16.964 --> 00:29:19.737
but there's certain things
that stand out so over

00:29:19.737 --> 00:29:23.931
and above this big
picture that you have of,

00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:26.130
"Well, they're black, so what they said

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.738
"or wrote was not important."

00:29:27.738 --> 00:29:31.125
But as you work your way through this,

00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:33.786
there are little pieces of evidence

00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:35.953
that are quite remarkable.

00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:38.769
I'll mention a few of them.

00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:41.907
That Sally Hemings makes
an agreement with Jefferson

00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:45.209
to come back from France where
she could have been free,

00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:49.180
and because she was a mother
worrying about her children,

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.436
that she was pregnant, she
would have more children,

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:56.784
and he promised to free
them when they were 21.

00:29:56.784 --> 00:30:00.888
Little things like Madison
Hemings, many years later,

00:30:00.888 --> 00:30:04.383
tells this story, nobody
believes it, they dismiss it,

00:30:04.383 --> 00:30:08.552
because the editor of the
paper is an abolitionist--

00:30:08.552 --> 00:30:10.759
- [Annette] Yeah,
anything he says is a lie.

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:13.181
- But Madison, in this interview,

00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:16.356
tells us little things about Jefferson.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:19.791
For example, he really
didn't care to be a farmer.

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:22.629
He didn't like farming, he
was actually a craftsman,

00:30:22.629 --> 00:30:26.796
who liked to work in his shop,
and he trained his children

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:32.037
by Hemings to have
trades and be craftsmen.

00:30:32.037 --> 00:30:36.716
So, little things that tell
us a lot about Jefferson.

00:30:36.716 --> 00:30:38.195
And in a way, the fact,

00:30:38.195 --> 00:30:41.362
the way he treated his black children

00:30:44.437 --> 00:30:47.381
brings out the humanity in him, in a way.

00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:49.007
Although, he's living in this system,

00:30:49.007 --> 00:30:50.242
he's still a slaveholder.

00:30:50.242 --> 00:30:52.083
- Yeah, I think that's
a really important point

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.750
about small details.

00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:57.277
Because when people,
when police for example,

00:30:57.277 --> 00:31:01.444
do investigations, they
always keep something behind.

00:31:02.404 --> 00:31:05.103
They don't say the thing out loud,

00:31:05.103 --> 00:31:06.936
because they know if
they encounter somebody

00:31:06.936 --> 00:31:10.007
who knows that detail, they
obviously know something.

00:31:10.007 --> 00:31:11.316
And so, that's what you find

00:31:11.316 --> 00:31:13.983
in Israel Jefferson's statements

00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:16.124
and Madison Hemings's statement.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:19.352
It's little things that
tell you about Jefferson,

00:31:19.352 --> 00:31:22.237
that tell you about the
lies that you can check,

00:31:22.237 --> 00:31:24.834
that can be corroborated
from outside information,

00:31:24.834 --> 00:31:27.825
so you know that this person
isn't just making stuff up.

00:31:27.825 --> 00:31:29.224
And they never, historians,

00:31:29.224 --> 00:31:30.268
'cause they were not interested

00:31:30.268 --> 00:31:31.666
in really finding the answer

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:33.399
'cause they didn't want it to be true.

00:31:33.399 --> 00:31:35.028
Going through that process to sort

00:31:35.028 --> 00:31:37.157
of corroborate what he was saying.

00:31:37.157 --> 00:31:39.554
And on the other side, I should say,

00:31:39.554 --> 00:31:43.660
looking at the Jefferson
family official story

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.827
that was replete with errors and lies,

00:31:48.442 --> 00:31:51.229
I should have to say,
that they had to know

00:31:51.229 --> 00:31:54.101
that this person was
lying about those things,

00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:57.250
yet it didn't affect
their overall credibility.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.646
The only thing that was important was

00:31:58.646 --> 00:32:00.632
that they said Jefferson didn't do it.

00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:03.503
So, they ignored all the signs.

00:32:03.503 --> 00:32:05.535
So, it was like when you come to this

00:32:05.535 --> 00:32:07.802
and begin to pull it all apart,

00:32:07.802 --> 00:32:09.436
it was relatively easy to do

00:32:09.436 --> 00:32:11.471
because it was just so
blatant the way they were sort

00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:14.554
of blinding themselves to indications

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:17.342
that this story was true.

00:32:17.342 --> 00:32:18.770
- And you know, what struck me that

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.945
that's why it's important,
this book is so important

00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:27.459
even today where we've moved
beyond the controversy,

00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:31.300
because what you're showing is in the law,

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.369
you apply the same standards of evidence

00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:37.702
and burden of proof to both sides.

00:32:37.702 --> 00:32:39.398
And in this case--

00:32:39.398 --> 00:32:40.366
- [Annette] It just didn't happen.

00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:41.201
- It didn't happen.

00:32:41.201 --> 00:32:44.784
And it didn't happen
because of the racism.

00:32:48.102 --> 00:32:52.269
It's not to say necessarily,
I don't know these historians,

00:32:53.172 --> 00:32:56.150
these famous historians,
that they were racists,

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.983
interpersonally, but
they bought in to a story

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.540
because it was,

00:33:06.225 --> 00:33:08.367
well, it was the conventional wisdom.

00:33:08.367 --> 00:33:09.917
- And they didn't want it to be true.

00:33:09.917 --> 00:33:11.331
- [Harry] Yeah.
- Because what it would say--

00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:12.172
- [Harry] They didn't want your version.

00:33:12.172 --> 00:33:13.409
- No, they didn't want the version,

00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.688
they didn't want
Jefferson to be the father

00:33:15.688 --> 00:33:17.188
of these children.

00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:22.503
Dumas Malone, at the end of his life,

00:33:22.503 --> 00:33:24.583
he gives an interview to the
New York Times, and he says,

00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:28.350
"Well, I could see him having
sex with her one or two times,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:32.389
"but what I couldn't see would
be a 38-year connection."

00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:34.062
Which I thought was kind of telling,

00:33:34.062 --> 00:33:35.206
it's remarkably telling.

00:33:35.206 --> 00:33:38.209
So it would be okay once or twice,

00:33:38.209 --> 00:33:40.459
but not anything long term.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.817
It was almost as if well,
one or two times puts him

00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:48.530
in the range of a normal white guy,

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.411
but the other is sort of alien to him.

00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:54.479
And so, I think that said
a lot about his values.

00:33:54.479 --> 00:33:58.003
- In addition to your lawyerly skills,

00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:02.170
and I mean that in a complimentary
way, and your research,

00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:07.953
your prodigious research
in all of these works,

00:34:07.953 --> 00:34:11.773
there is an element in
your work and in your talk

00:34:11.773 --> 00:34:15.856
of common human insight,
basically, common sense.

00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:21.345
Well, what would a person
do in a situation like,

00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:25.844
talk a little about that,
because it's really the case

00:34:25.844 --> 00:34:30.011
that you have to understand
people to a certain extent

00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:33.869
to see what's going on.

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:35.807
- Yeah, it's an interesting
thing because I think

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.903
it's something that sets me a little apart

00:34:37.903 --> 00:34:40.727
from conventional
historians who don't like

00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:43.849
to believe there's such
thing as a human nature.

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:47.363
That there's not, I
think that there's not a,

00:34:47.363 --> 00:34:49.417
I don't believe there's
a fixed human nature,

00:34:49.417 --> 00:34:52.243
but I do think that there
are some commonalities

00:34:52.243 --> 00:34:55.970
that run throughout human existence

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.637
and recurring themes in history.

00:35:01.094 --> 00:35:03.635
Lawyers sort of rely on that.

00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:05.365
I mean, historians might
be skeptical of it,

00:35:05.365 --> 00:35:07.224
but lawyers rely on it.

00:35:07.224 --> 00:35:09.466
And judges rely on it.

00:35:09.466 --> 00:35:12.549
And it's very important to
sort of see those patterns

00:35:12.549 --> 00:35:17.079
and to understand where
they're coming into play.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:20.142
And this is a story that demanded that.

00:35:20.142 --> 00:35:23.451
Because we don't have
Jefferson's writings about this,

00:35:23.451 --> 00:35:27.897
we don't have Sally Hemings's
writings about this.

00:35:27.897 --> 00:35:31.544
- There are no written
records, letters, diaries--

00:35:31.544 --> 00:35:33.435
- Between the two of them.

00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:35.182
I mean, Jefferson's friends talk about,

00:35:35.182 --> 00:35:37.763
a friend of his talks
about this in a diary,

00:35:37.763 --> 00:35:40.677
but there's nothing in
between the two of them.

00:35:40.677 --> 00:35:42.331
So, what you're basically doing

00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:44.177
is drawing reasonable inferences

00:35:44.177 --> 00:35:47.770
from people's behavior,
and repeated behavior.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.532
And I would trust that over
what people say anytime.

00:35:51.532 --> 00:35:53.272
That's the kind of thing that you have

00:35:53.272 --> 00:35:56.886
to bring to bear in this situation.

00:35:56.886 --> 00:35:59.261
- Let's talk a little about Jefferson.

00:35:59.261 --> 00:36:03.428
Now, your new book, "Most
Blessed of the Patriarchs:

00:36:05.092 --> 00:36:08.708
Thomas Jefferson and the
Empire of the Imagination".

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:12.875
This is co-written with
leading Jeffersonian historian.

00:36:14.196 --> 00:36:16.939
What were you all trying
to do in this book?

00:36:16.939 --> 00:36:21.928
- Well, we were trying to
sort of strip away a lot of,

00:36:21.928 --> 00:36:25.647
I think the layers that had
been put upon Jefferson,

00:36:25.647 --> 00:36:27.089
to try to pull him out,

00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:31.113
to extract Jefferson's own understanding

00:36:31.113 --> 00:36:33.075
about what he was doing in the world.

00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:37.342
We think that a lot of books
have been written about,

00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:39.584
that are basically sort of
saying what Jefferson ought

00:36:39.584 --> 00:36:42.011
to have done, ought have
been doing in the world.

00:36:42.011 --> 00:36:44.407
And you should've done this
and you should've done that,

00:36:44.407 --> 00:36:46.961
and you didn't do this and
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:46.961 --> 00:36:50.088
Instead of thinking, "Well,
what did he think he was doing?"

00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:53.375
This was a person who started out life

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.120
in a particular way, had
a particular mission.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.839
And we try to discover,

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:00.913
re-discover what that
mission was by looking

00:37:00.913 --> 00:37:04.580
at his own writings,
looking at his actions,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.778
and to sort of stand aside and
not be all about judging him,

00:37:10.778 --> 00:37:13.883
which is what has happened now.

00:37:13.883 --> 00:37:16.156
He's become sort of the
whipping boy for slavery,

00:37:16.156 --> 00:37:17.393
as if he was the only slaveholder

00:37:17.393 --> 00:37:19.303
in the founding generation,

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:20.796
if he was the only racist white man

00:37:20.796 --> 00:37:22.164
in the founding generation.

00:37:22.164 --> 00:37:24.574
It's really kind of like a caricature.

00:37:24.574 --> 00:37:27.835
And it's being, hes'
sort of stuck in a ditch.

00:37:27.835 --> 00:37:30.733
So, we wanted to recover this
person who was interesting

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:32.486
and important to American history,

00:37:32.486 --> 00:37:35.704
but do it by looking at
the world through his eyes,

00:37:35.704 --> 00:37:38.465
not absolving him of anything, but to say,

00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:40.300
"What did he think he was doing?"

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.800
- And this again, so that in a way if you,

00:37:45.187 --> 00:37:49.448
before your writings, if
the historiography builds

00:37:49.448 --> 00:37:52.698
up Jefferson, and they turn him into a,

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.406
at one level, he's not human.

00:37:56.406 --> 00:38:00.406
And that by bringing his
humanity back in, then,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.607
and I look at your book which is much more

00:38:04.607 --> 00:38:06.854
than what I'm gonna talk about,

00:38:06.854 --> 00:38:09.274
but it's kind of the
evolution of his ideas.

00:38:09.274 --> 00:38:12.393
So, here is a man who said,
"All men are created equal,"

00:38:12.393 --> 00:38:17.301
and then he comes out of
Virginia, he goes to France,

00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:19.733
he becomes a revolutionary politician,

00:38:19.733 --> 00:38:24.344
so his ideas evolve, and I
wanna talk a little about that.

00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:28.545
So, he starts as a man,
before the revolution,

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:30.747
the American Revolution, as a man of ideas

00:38:30.747 --> 00:38:33.247
who's a patriarch in Virginia,

00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:36.798
a landowner, and a slave owner.

00:38:36.798 --> 00:38:38.456
- Yes, that's all of those things,

00:38:38.456 --> 00:38:42.544
but he also is crucially, he sees himself

00:38:42.544 --> 00:38:44.826
as an inherent to the enlightenment,

00:38:44.826 --> 00:38:47.763
and he sees himself as
a progressive person.

00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:52.096
Jefferson looked at life
through the eyes of science,

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.479
that we're gonna be
making new discoveries,

00:38:54.479 --> 00:38:56.990
inoculations, all these kinds of things

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.411
that are gonna make life better.

00:38:58.411 --> 00:39:00.050
And life is gonna get better and better

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.250
the more educated people become.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.390
He develops the sort of
tenets of progressivism

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.628
at that time, he's sort of
skeptical of the church,

00:39:08.628 --> 00:39:12.128
of organized religion, he is anti-slavery.

00:39:13.762 --> 00:39:17.762
As a young man, he copies
a poem about the evils

00:39:19.818 --> 00:39:22.556
of slavery, of the slave
trade, and it's commonplace,

00:39:22.556 --> 00:39:24.529
but before he's in public life at all.

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:28.494
So, he's establishing himself
as, I'm a person who is,

00:39:28.494 --> 00:39:31.825
not better than his Virginia cohort,

00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:34.885
but he's more advanced
than his Virginia cohort.

00:39:34.885 --> 00:39:36.610
And this is the attitude that people have

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.521
about him throughout his life.

00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:41.151
There's a story, it may be apocryphal,

00:39:41.151 --> 00:39:45.318
of Jefferson standing on a
courthouse eating a tomato

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:50.906
at a time when many people
thought tomatoes were poisonous.

00:39:50.906 --> 00:39:52.807
So, this idea of him as the avatar

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.725
of the enlightenment
takes hold very early on.

00:39:56.725 --> 00:39:59.308
And that's how he sees himself.

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.496
So, he's this patriarch, as you said,

00:40:02.496 --> 00:40:05.698
and at the same time he sees
himself as a progressive,

00:40:05.698 --> 00:40:08.135
that eventually people like him,

00:40:08.135 --> 00:40:10.205
they will become obsolete

00:40:10.205 --> 00:40:13.028
as the world becomes more enlightened.

00:40:13.028 --> 00:40:17.195
- And he talks about slavery
as a stain on Virginia

00:40:18.276 --> 00:40:22.276
and on society, and he
makes some modest efforts

00:40:24.484 --> 00:40:27.151
to overturn it, but he discovers

00:40:30.277 --> 00:40:33.720
that the system won't move basically.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.597
Is that a fair way to say it?

00:40:36.597 --> 00:40:39.565
- After the revolution, and we have,

00:40:39.565 --> 00:40:41.746
there's the United States of America,

00:40:41.746 --> 00:40:44.774
he believes that there has
to be a republican solution

00:40:44.774 --> 00:40:47.698
to slavery, republican
meaning majority rules.

00:40:47.698 --> 00:40:49.168
People have to vote.

00:40:49.168 --> 00:40:51.724
But he knows that at that time,

00:40:51.724 --> 00:40:54.799
the people of Virginia are
not gonna vote slavery out,

00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:57.049
and he turned his attention

00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:00.889
to other things that he can do.

00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:04.005
And that is, become involved in politics,

00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:07.349
and help develop the
United States of America.

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:11.340
Now, what he doesn't
understand is that slavery,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.110
by not dealing with slavery,

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.163
that the United States of America,

00:41:16.163 --> 00:41:18.889
several decades after that would split.

00:41:18.889 --> 00:41:22.811
By the mid 19th century, it's
already clear near the end

00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:25.959
of his life that it's
possible that the North

00:41:25.959 --> 00:41:29.330
and the South would go
to war over slavery.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.928
But that is not something that
he would have contemplated

00:41:31.928 --> 00:41:34.175
or advocated as a young man.

00:41:34.175 --> 00:41:38.092
It had to be people
voting, and that was never.

00:41:39.714 --> 00:41:41.958
I mean, people say that
he should've done this,

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:46.826
he should've fought harder,
but I don't really know how.

00:41:46.826 --> 00:41:48.310
I don't think the people of Virginia

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.580
and the South were ready
to vote slavery out.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.964
- And as a revolutionary
politician at the time

00:41:54.964 --> 00:41:58.381
of the War of the Revolution, he sort of,

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:01.802
you were suggesting in
your lecture yesterday,

00:42:01.802 --> 00:42:06.276
comes to the conclusion
that Native Americans

00:42:06.276 --> 00:42:09.276
and the slaves are not us, in a way,

00:42:10.753 --> 00:42:13.469
because of the possibility they have

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:16.515
to align with the British
to get their freedom.

00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:20.182
So, it's a state that
becomes very difficult

00:42:21.177 --> 00:42:25.259
for him to deal with in
terms of his original ideas.

00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:28.076
- At first, he's
anti-slavery as a young man.

00:42:28.076 --> 00:42:30.676
After the revolution, it becomes clear

00:42:30.676 --> 00:42:34.912
that African-American people
are a threat because he knew.

00:42:34.912 --> 00:42:37.363
He said, "How can you love a country

00:42:37.363 --> 00:42:39.807
"that has treated you like this?"

00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:43.045
We are enemies and we're gonna be enemies.

00:42:43.045 --> 00:42:44.635
And he's talking in the abstract

00:42:44.635 --> 00:42:46.804
about African-Americans in general,

00:42:46.804 --> 00:42:50.045
and whites in general,
but the interesting thing

00:42:50.045 --> 00:42:52.329
about it is that in his personal life,

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:54.795
he begins to think that he can manage,

00:42:54.795 --> 00:42:57.732
he knows how to manage the situation

00:42:57.732 --> 00:43:01.399
to sort of stave off
that kind of hostility.

00:43:02.475 --> 00:43:05.711
But he did not think that was
possible on a large scale.

00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:09.628
- And so, he goes to
France and he sees America

00:43:11.245 --> 00:43:12.897
in comparison with France.

00:43:12.897 --> 00:43:16.147
And that leads him to extol the virtues

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:22.205
of our natural surroundings,
and the small landholder,

00:43:22.205 --> 00:43:25.822
the character of the individual that comes

00:43:25.822 --> 00:43:28.405
from his ownership of property.

00:43:29.848 --> 00:43:34.008
And you call it at some
point, you say at one point

00:43:34.008 --> 00:43:36.223
in the book that it leads to, in his mind,

00:43:36.223 --> 00:43:38.547
a domestication of slavery.

00:43:38.547 --> 00:43:42.531
So, he develops a theory
that says, in effect,

00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:46.648
there's a public realm, and
that public realm depends

00:43:46.648 --> 00:43:50.642
on the individual farmer
with his property,

00:43:50.642 --> 00:43:53.517
his land, and his slaves.

00:43:53.517 --> 00:43:57.184
And that is the source
of liberty, in a way.

00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:03.160
So, that's the next step in his--

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.987
- Yeah, France is critical
to his understanding

00:44:05.987 --> 00:44:08.451
of things because when he leaves Virginia,

00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:09.925
he's kind of sour on Virginia.

00:44:09.925 --> 00:44:12.214
He has a terrible time as governor,

00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:15.179
his behavior was put under investigation,

00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:19.048
he was exonerated, but he
left for France in a kind

00:44:19.048 --> 00:44:21.462
of surly mood about his fellow Virginians.

00:44:21.462 --> 00:44:23.969
And he gets to France and he sees,

00:44:23.969 --> 00:44:27.051
he loves the music, he
loves the architecture,

00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:29.379
there're things about
the society he loves,

00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:32.629
but he's aghast at the status of women,

00:44:34.529 --> 00:44:38.696
women who are forward, and
participating in politics.

00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:42.782
He's aghast at beggars on the street.

00:44:42.782 --> 00:44:46.371
He talks about and his
daughter talks about being

00:44:46.371 --> 00:44:47.640
in a carriage and having beggars

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.426
and people desperately beggin' for money.

00:44:51.426 --> 00:44:53.368
And there's starvation.

00:44:53.368 --> 00:44:56.339
So, he begins to say, "Well,
you know, we have it bad,

00:44:56.339 --> 00:44:58.423
"but we aren't as bad as this."

00:44:58.423 --> 00:45:01.590
And he becomes sort of sanguine about,

00:45:04.664 --> 00:45:06.510
much more sanguine about the situation

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.864
with enslaved people in Virginia.

00:45:08.864 --> 00:45:12.947
And he develops this idea
that he can ameliorate.

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:18.302
Christa Dierksheide has
written a book about,

00:45:18.302 --> 00:45:21.193
that talks about amelioration,
Jefferson's ideas

00:45:21.193 --> 00:45:24.200
about amelioration of
slavery, making it better.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.232
And once you do that, you're just gone.

00:45:27.232 --> 00:45:31.399
I mean, from a state of war
and evil to well, you know,

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.746
I could do this in a way
that makes it all right,

00:45:34.746 --> 00:45:37.384
then that's a way of
comforting yourself about this,

00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:40.793
and he becomes comfortable
in the institution.

00:45:40.793 --> 00:45:44.876
He sees the Hemings family,
which the family was,

00:45:45.748 --> 00:45:49.041
six of them were the
half-siblings of his wife,

00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:51.800
including Sarah, Sally Hemings.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.449
He sees his relationships
with them as sort

00:45:55.449 --> 00:45:58.265
of exemplifying how he
was as a slave owner.

00:45:58.265 --> 00:46:00.923
Well, of course, they're different

00:46:00.923 --> 00:46:02.556
than other enslaved people,

00:46:02.556 --> 00:46:04.586
but these are the people
who are in the house,

00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:07.235
the people with whom he has
the most intimate relations,

00:46:07.235 --> 00:46:10.991
and he sees himself acting
as a good slave owner,

00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:12.172
with respect to them.

00:46:12.172 --> 00:46:13.165
- A benevolent.

00:46:13.165 --> 00:46:14.774
- [Annette] A benevolent slave owner,

00:46:14.774 --> 00:46:15.941
the thing we can't accept.

00:46:15.941 --> 00:46:16.774
- Patriarch.

00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:18.616
- Benevolent patriarch,
which of course, we're like,

00:46:18.616 --> 00:46:21.855
"Ah, you know you can't do that."

00:46:21.855 --> 00:46:23.166
But that's how he saw it.

00:46:23.166 --> 00:46:27.336
And so, the person who
had this very serious idea

00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:30.449
about the evils of slavery says,

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:31.911
"I can do this the right way."

00:46:31.911 --> 00:46:33.781
And of course, as I said, as we've said,

00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:36.911
that's the road to perdition right there.

00:46:36.911 --> 00:46:40.694
- And the other element
in this is his role

00:46:40.694 --> 00:46:43.352
as the founder of the
University of Virginia.

00:46:43.352 --> 00:46:47.519
And so the idea that future
generations who were trained

00:46:48.882 --> 00:46:52.920
in the enlightenment would be
able to solve this problem,

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.294
but not here and now while I live.

00:46:55.294 --> 00:46:58.446
- Yeah, solve it without bloodshed.

00:46:58.446 --> 00:47:00.999
And that eventually this
would come, but of course,

00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:04.515
as we know, that's not what happened.

00:47:04.515 --> 00:47:07.153
- This is kind of a case study

00:47:07.153 --> 00:47:10.460
in theory and practice, in a way.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.499
Talk a little about that,

00:47:11.499 --> 00:47:13.166
because here is this

00:47:16.046 --> 00:47:19.136
American leader who had these,

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:22.886
could state clearly
these very powerful ideas

00:47:23.722 --> 00:47:27.596
of the enlightenment,
but as he lived his life

00:47:27.596 --> 00:47:31.596
in Virginia as a patriarch,
as he goes to Paris,

00:47:33.806 --> 00:47:37.521
and brings over the young slave girl

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:40.438
to take care of his young daughter.

00:47:41.402 --> 00:47:43.735
As he comes back, he really,

00:47:45.623 --> 00:47:48.930
his ideas sort of confront reality,

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.695
which he can't change,
and his ideas change.

00:47:51.695 --> 00:47:54.862
But we do see, I think that he's a man

00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:58.045
who doesn't like conflict,

00:47:58.045 --> 00:48:01.021
he likes to ameliorate situations,

00:48:01.021 --> 00:48:03.586
but when you have a structural problem

00:48:03.586 --> 00:48:06.193
like racism, that's not enough.

00:48:06.193 --> 00:48:07.126
- No, it's not enough.

00:48:07.126 --> 00:48:09.153
And it's not enough to absolve him,

00:48:09.153 --> 00:48:12.742
it's not enough for him to
become a good slaveholder.

00:48:12.742 --> 00:48:15.909
Slavery was comfortable for Jefferson.

00:48:17.212 --> 00:48:20.768
It brought him a lifestyle
that allowed him to live

00:48:20.768 --> 00:48:24.768
as a man of letters, of
the republic of letters.

00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:31.463
Madison Hemings talks about
him, that Jefferson spent most

00:48:31.463 --> 00:48:34.198
of his time in his office
writing those thousands

00:48:34.198 --> 00:48:37.327
of letters that we have,
communicating with people

00:48:37.327 --> 00:48:38.928
over the seas, and other people

00:48:38.928 --> 00:48:41.479
in the rest of the United States.

00:48:41.479 --> 00:48:45.729
He didn't have to worry about
keeping his life in order.

00:48:45.729 --> 00:48:48.276
There were people who did that for him.

00:48:48.276 --> 00:48:50.847
Enslaved people, and his
daughters who actually served

00:48:50.847 --> 00:48:54.180
as the hostesses after he lost his wife.

00:48:56.053 --> 00:48:59.303
Slavery brought him a level of comfort,

00:49:00.395 --> 00:49:03.152
and there are many things
you think about saying,

00:49:03.152 --> 00:49:05.471
you know, this is really bad,

00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.455
but if you're getting something out of it,

00:49:08.455 --> 00:49:11.455
if you don't have the emotional push

00:49:13.569 --> 00:49:15.608
to do something about
it, most of the people

00:49:15.608 --> 00:49:18.671
who freed slaves in Virginia
during that time period

00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:22.166
were acting under the
influence of religion,

00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:25.287
of Evangelical religion, the Quakers,

00:49:25.287 --> 00:49:27.439
the Methodists, and Baptists.

00:49:27.439 --> 00:49:30.462
He was not operating under that system.

00:49:30.462 --> 00:49:33.263
Religion can make you do
things, irrational things.

00:49:33.263 --> 00:49:35.338
And we think it's
obviously the moral thing.

00:49:35.338 --> 00:49:37.197
But to get rid of your property would have

00:49:37.197 --> 00:49:38.600
been thought of as an irrational thing.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.920
- And he was a debtor, he was in debt.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.776
- Oh yes, he was in debt to do that.

00:49:41.776 --> 00:49:43.117
But there were time periods

00:49:43.117 --> 00:49:46.599
if he had conducted himself
differently early on,

00:49:46.599 --> 00:49:49.243
he could have, if he'd
made it a mission to sort

00:49:49.243 --> 00:49:50.515
of work his way out of debt,

00:49:50.515 --> 00:49:52.162
he probably could have done that.

00:49:52.162 --> 00:49:55.079
But how ofen, it's a human failure.

00:49:56.142 --> 00:50:00.103
You know something is
wrong, but you do it anyway.

00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:03.470
- And it does take what
we were talking about,

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:07.880
your human insight, your
insight about people,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.748
to at least, we've knocked him down

00:50:10.748 --> 00:50:12.775
from the icon that he was,

00:50:12.775 --> 00:50:16.618
but he was a human being
operating in his times.

00:50:16.618 --> 00:50:19.946
And his solutions weren't adequate given

00:50:19.946 --> 00:50:22.328
what the horror of slavery was.

00:50:22.328 --> 00:50:23.609
- But he did other things.

00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:25.309
One of the other things
that I think you have

00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:28.717
to do in approaching Jefferson
is to have a little bit,

00:50:28.717 --> 00:50:29.924
to think about yourself.

00:50:29.924 --> 00:50:34.541
I mean, here was a person
who was a revolutionary,

00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:36.368
he wrote the Declaration of Independence,

00:50:36.368 --> 00:50:39.414
an ambassador, a vice
president, a president,

00:50:39.414 --> 00:50:40.710
he founded a university.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.380
That's a lot of stuff
to do in your lifetime.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.213
And then you say,

00:50:43.213 --> 00:50:45.484
"Oh, and why didn't you
solve the slave problem?"

00:50:45.484 --> 00:50:47.442
So, you think about, "What have I done?"

00:50:47.442 --> 00:50:50.568
What are all the people when
we come up against someone

00:50:50.568 --> 00:50:53.313
like that, what have we done actively

00:50:53.313 --> 00:50:56.472
to transform our own circumstances?

00:50:56.472 --> 00:50:58.410
Maybe we've done one or two things,

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.137
but we certainly haven't
been all of those things.

00:51:01.137 --> 00:51:04.318
That's a lot to ask for
somebody in one life

00:51:04.318 --> 00:51:06.939
to say that he'd do everything.

00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:09.550
His attitude was, well look,

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.092
our generation founded a country,

00:51:12.092 --> 00:51:14.707
we broke away from the largest, excuse me,

00:51:14.707 --> 00:51:17.084
the most powerful nation on Earth,

00:51:17.084 --> 00:51:18.999
and we formed our own country,

00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:21.233
and we set up a government.

00:51:21.233 --> 00:51:22.877
Can't you do something?

00:51:22.877 --> 00:51:26.627
What is the next step
that you're gonna take?

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.540
Well, it could be an excuse
if you wanna call it that,

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.640
but it just seems to me to
be, if you look at the record

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.076
and you compare it to what I'm doing,

00:51:36.076 --> 00:51:37.384
what other people are doing,

00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:39.805
it's a lot to be judgmental about somebody

00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:42.910
who's done so much when we've
not done anything like that.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:47.077
- One final question, looking
back into your career,

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:52.266
are there any insights that
you have that you could share

00:51:52.266 --> 00:51:56.433
with us about overturning
assumptions, looking at reality,

00:51:57.697 --> 00:52:01.864
that would apply to the present
disturbances that we have

00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:07.328
and movements like the
Black Lives Matter movement,

00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:10.825
the confrontation with the police,

00:52:10.825 --> 00:52:13.908
because it would seem in pointing out

00:52:15.426 --> 00:52:18.259
and overthrowing structural racism

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.499
and intellectual discourse, it's relevant

00:52:23.499 --> 00:52:26.171
for the situation we have now.

00:52:26.171 --> 00:52:29.453
- Well, you have to be, and
this is a difficult thing,

00:52:29.453 --> 00:52:31.257
you have to think something is at stake.

00:52:31.257 --> 00:52:35.424
There has to be a moral, morality
is a part of the inquiry.

00:52:36.727 --> 00:52:37.616
People say you're not supposed

00:52:37.616 --> 00:52:40.613
to apply your morality to historical.

00:52:40.613 --> 00:52:44.082
I just don't see how, you
can't check that at the door.

00:52:44.082 --> 00:52:48.276
And morality, I think,
demands that people understand

00:52:48.276 --> 00:52:50.866
that our common humanity,
which means that we have

00:52:50.866 --> 00:52:54.796
to be empathetic, we have to
try to imagine what it's like

00:52:54.796 --> 00:52:57.924
to be a person who is a
citizen of the country,

00:52:57.924 --> 00:52:59.790
but a second-class citizen.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.228
What does that do to our country,

00:53:01.228 --> 00:53:03.657
what heights are we not reaching,

00:53:03.657 --> 00:53:05.302
what goals aren't we reaching

00:53:05.302 --> 00:53:08.122
by having large segments of our population

00:53:08.122 --> 00:53:12.227
who don't have access to true citizenship?

00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:15.001
So, it's about other people,
but it's also ultimately

00:53:15.001 --> 00:53:16.412
about ourselves as a country.

00:53:16.412 --> 00:53:18.826
We have to want the
United States to progress.

00:53:18.826 --> 00:53:22.534
And that requires really
deep soul searching,

00:53:22.534 --> 00:53:25.307
and it requires work, the kind
of work that I said before,

00:53:25.307 --> 00:53:26.950
questioning your own assumptions.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:29.889
And I don't know how to tell
people to do that exactly,

00:53:29.889 --> 00:53:32.990
but I could say that you should.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:36.107
- Well, on that note, I want to thank you

00:53:36.107 --> 00:53:39.091
for being our guest today,
being on the campuses,

00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.696
the Jefferson lecture.

00:53:40.696 --> 00:53:42.696
It was quite an occasion

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:47.633
for some remarkable insights.

00:53:47.633 --> 00:53:48.565
Thank you very much.

00:53:48.565 --> 00:53:49.398
- Thank you.

00:53:49.398 --> 00:53:52.071
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:52.071 --> 00:53:55.445
for this Conversation With History.

00:53:55.445 --> 00:53:59.112
