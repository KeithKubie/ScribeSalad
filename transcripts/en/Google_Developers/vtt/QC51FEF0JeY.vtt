00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.720
ANKUR KOTWAL: One of the
biggest challenges game

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.960
developers face is building
engaging game worlds.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.570
We want to provide a
realistic environment that

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.820
isn't handcrafted, a
world that's familiar,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.380
yet is fun for players,
regardless of where they are.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220
The Google Maps APIs gaming
offering solves this problem.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.260
This platform for
building real world games

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.270
is built on Google
Maps and backed

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.220
by Google infrastructure.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.860
Hi.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.250
I'm Ankur Kotwal, a
developer advocate.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.680
With the Google Maps
APIs gaming offering,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.580
developers can create dynamic
experiences at global scale.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.070
Google Maps APIs
provide hundreds

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.740
of millions of 3D buildings,
points of interest,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.770
roads, landmarks,
cafes, parks, and more

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.900
to help you form
your game world.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.840
This is the same model of
the world as Google Maps,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.810
but you don't have to
be a mapping specialist

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.490
to build real world games.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.920
The SDK interprets
the geo data for you.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.810
Additionally, you can completely
customize your game world.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.630
You can change colors,
apply alternate textures,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.990
and even swap out
prefabs altogether.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.090
The gaming offering
also enables you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.870
to design rich and engaging
games in the real world.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.780
You can ensure that players
have an engaging experience,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.900
regardless of whether
they're in a busy urban city

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.680
or in a rural town.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340
Finally, you can also
deliver game experiences

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.050
at global scale.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.600
Relying on Google's
infrastructure

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.030
means faster response
times, on-demand scaling,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.680
and peace of mind.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.380
Let's look at the
three components that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.060
make up the gaming offering.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.150
The first is access
to Google Maps data.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.810
This is a rich, accurate, and
living model of the real world.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.230
Since it's powered by the same
infrastructure as Google Maps,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.810
it scales to billions
of daily requests

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.480
and is constantly
updated to reflect

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.590
our ever-changing world.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120
The second component
is an SDK for Unity.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.390
The Maps Unity SDK
creates every Maps feature

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.880
as standard Unity game objects.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.500
Since they're just standard
Unity game objects,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.940
you can also add colliders
for physics and ray casting.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.650
Each of these real
world features

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.890
comes with semantic metadata,
so you can correlate them

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.270
with your game.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.870
You can fill parks with
trees, style your game world

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.410
in a fantasy land, or
use a specific 3D model

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.210
for each hospital in the city.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.950
We include lots
of other features

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.880
to help you build your game such
as nine slicing for applying

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.470
textures to arbitrarily
sized buildings,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100
decorators for adding
parapets and other geometry

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.260
to the tops of
buildings, or borders

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.930
to simulate ambient
occlusion contact shadows.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.870
We provide access to the
names of roads and buildings

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.810
and integrate with Unity's
lighting and skybox systems

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.950
for a beautiful day
and night cycle.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.850
We also support Unity's
level of detail system,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.190
automatically fading
out distant geometry

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.410
to maximize mobile performance.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.510
The Maps Unity
SDK has been built

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.850
to be performant
on mobile devices,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.050
yet it can scale up to the
most powerful gaming platforms.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.940
The third and critical component
is the playable locations API,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.730
which helps you design
interactions around real world

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.190
locations at global scale.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.040
The playable locations API
provides more than just points

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.970
in space.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.950
It provides
appropriate locations

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.170
that deliver an
engaging experience,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.390
regardless of where
your players are.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.370
The playable
locations API enables

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.700
you to tailor your gameplay
to natural environments,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.190
like parks or rivers.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.380
For example, you could
put treasure chests

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.280
at real world ATMs or
supplies at supermarkets.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.730
You could also put more
valuable game rewards

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.380
at rarely visited locations.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.290

to get in touch with us.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.220
With the Google Maps
APIs gaming offering

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.680
you can make the real
world your playground.
