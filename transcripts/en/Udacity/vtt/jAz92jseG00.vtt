00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.500
But aside from that, one of my pet peeves is

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.070
having to switch between input keyboards manually to input different

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.650
types of data. If a form is asking me for

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.510
my phone number, it should just give me the number keyboard

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.320
by default, right? Well it turns out, this is pretty

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.240
easy to do. HTML5 added new form input types to make

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500
input easier. Let's go into the dev tools, and change

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.400
this text input field to a tel input field. And now,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.770
let's click on the field again, and you'll notice

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.370
now, not only do I get a number pad, but

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.490
I get a telephone umber pad, complete with the hash

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.430
and star symbols, and alphabet assignments on the numeric keys.
