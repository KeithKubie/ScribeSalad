LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live as I/O

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.450
from Moscone Center here
in San Francisco.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.285
I'm Louis Gray from Google
Developers Live.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm joined today by Baris
Gultekin, who's working on

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.690
Google Now.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.750
Welcome, sir.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.190
BARIS GULTEKIN: Hi.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.820
Thank you.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.010
LOUIS GRAY: And you're the
Director of Product Management

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.580
in the search team focused
on Google Now.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.270
Google Now has really been
incredible, I think a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.850
revolution, in search.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.940
To have the card-based
capability and some of the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.300
automation that you're doing
and really trying to

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.210
anticipate what it is a user's
looking for and tell them just

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700
at the right time.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.330
So I know we have a good chunk
of time to talk it today at

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.240
GDL at I/O. Thank you
for joining me.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.290
Maybe you can give us a little
bit of background on the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.170
project and how it came to be.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.800
BARIS GULTEKIN: Sounds great.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.990
Thank you.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.130
It's exciting to be here.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.300
I have a few slides that I'd
like to go through to just

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.010
talk about Google Now.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.410
Let me just dive right in.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.760
LOUIS GRAY: Go ahead.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.383
We'll jump in the slide deck
and have a conversation.

00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:01.210
BARIS GULTEKIN: Sounds good.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.800
So we started Google Now to
help you at just the right

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.720
time by giving you the
information right

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240
when you need it.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.570
But before I start and talk
about Google Now, I think it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.710
helps to think about how Search
has evolved over time

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.160
to lead us to where
we are now.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.020
We started in 1998 with the
concept of keywords.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.090
And when users type in a
keyword, our users were

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.850
delighted to find all of these
links, the ten blue

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.450
links on the web.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.730
But of course immediately they
started asking for more.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.010
So we started adding things like
images and videos so they

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.440
get a much richer
experience when

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000
they search for something.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.020
And recently we announced
the Knowledge Graph.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010
The Knowledge Graph is our
ability to understand

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.890
semantically about things,
places, and people, and the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.050
relationships between them.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.780
So we can answer questions
directly and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990
in a lot more detail.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.610
And of course, afterwards
came Mobile.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.000
With Mobile, it's really,
really important that we

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.260
understand conversation.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.350
And it's really important
that we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.710
understand natural language.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.890
So that's what we focused on.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
And then we launched it
as part of Google Now.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.800
If you think about both of these
directions, it's all

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.610
about giving you the right
answer really fast, when you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.730
need it, especially with Mobile,
giving you the answer

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.000
fast, right away is
very important.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.990
And Google Now is a great
evolution into this next step.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.840
It gives you the information you
need before you even ask.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.500
So think about it as trying to
understand your context and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.640
giving you the information
that's right

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.690
relevant for that context.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.090
So we think about Google Now as
a way to give you just the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.310
right information at just
the right time.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.210
It's supposed to be
very contextual.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.890
And if you take a step back it
really fits in well with what

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.860
we want to do in Google.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.320
At Google we want computers to
do all the hard work so you

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.890
can focus on what matters
to you most.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.190
Google Now embraces that and
tries to use the power of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.510
Google with thousands of
computers and also have this

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.540
powerful machine that's very
contextual, your phone, that

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.130
you have a personal relationship
with, and combine

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.140
the two to give you the
information you need at just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.390
the right time.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.730
So it helps to have users walk
through a day of life in

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.050
Google to even visualize
what Google Now does.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.290
And the first step is
Google Now helps you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.330
organize your day.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.280
So imagine that you woke up in
the morning and you're sipping

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.230
your coffee.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.050
Chances are you care about what
to wear that day and you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.130
care about the weather.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430
So we'll just have the
weather ready so you

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.320
know what to wear.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.830
And if you need an umbrella,
you can take the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.200
umbrella with you.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.190
As you're getting ready to leave
home, we'll tell you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.920
about traffic.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.640
Chances are you care about
traffic, of course.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.650
And you know that you need to
leave a little early if

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.360
there's traffic on
your way to work.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.830
And when you get to work, the
types of things you care about

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.190
are "when my next meeting is."
So we'll make sure that we

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.240
tell you when your next meeting
is and tell you that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.670
you need to leave now
so you're not late.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.200
We don't want our users
to be late, ever.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.329
So we're very proactive about
telling our users--

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.820
taking into account where they
are and where they need to go

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.310
and taking into account
the traffic.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.400
We also want to make sure
that we remove friction.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.780
As you're going through your
day, there's a lot of

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.790
different things that you
have to worry about.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.830
And we want to make sure that we
assist the users when they

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.680
need assistance the most.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.030
And travel is one such case.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.900
When users start traveling,
they need a lot of

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.450
information.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.510
They'd like to get a lot of
suggestions for their travel.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.190
So Google Now is a great
assistant for travel, as well.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.590
For instance, when you're
traveling and you're waiting

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.250
for the train to come, we'll
tell you that, "here's the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.762
next train, it's arriving in
five minutes." So you know

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.200
that you need to hurry up a
little bit to get to your

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.610
destination.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.200
Or when you arrive at your
airport, we'll have your

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.090
flight status so that you can
take your time and grab a bite

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.330
before you get to your gate.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.320
We'll also have your boarding
pass ready.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.330
And when you take that flight
and land at your destination,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.820
we'll help you get
to your hotel.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.230
So that's one less thing
to worry about.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.730
Another thing that we really
want to do is we want to help

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.190
you discover new things,
as well.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.440
So for instance, when you're
at a symphony with a loved

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.240
one, and your mind is back at
home about the sports team

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.110
that you care about,
we'll keep you

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.460
updated about live sports.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.880
And when you're traveling and
you are wandering around, we

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.790
want to make sure that you don't
miss that cool photo

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.810
spot that everyone's
taking pictures at.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.210
So we'll show you where
that photo spot is.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.690
And as you're getting ready for
the weekend, we also want

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.110
to help you find cool things
to do for Saturday evening.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.910
We'll show you comedy shows
or concerts that weekend.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.690
So that's broadly what
Google Now does.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.130
It's very contextual.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.330
It tries to understand what you
need and try to provide

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.560
you the information before
you even ask.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.500
LOUIS GRAY: Having looked at the
keynote today, we looked

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.410
at Amit and some of his vision--
he called it the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.560
"Star Trek Computer"--

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.620
to bring on the future of Search
and getting the content

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.810
to you at the right place,
at the right time.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.080
And some of the words he talked
about was "assist", and

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.336
really trying to find the next
step, to be able to get it to

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:36.210
you exactly when you need it.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.940
I had this interesting
experience when Google Now

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.740
first came out.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.100
It's been about a year.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.080
And I remember I was at home one
Saturday in the middle the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.230
day and my phone buzzed.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.810
And it said, "you need to leave
right now to get to--"

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.706
and at the time, it called it
"unknown location." And it

00:06:48.706 --> 00:06:50.550
said, "you have 25 minutes." And
I looked and I said, what

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.800
are you talking about?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.150
And I realized every Saturday
around that time I had gotten

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.110
in my car and driven to take my
kids to baseball practice.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.320
And somehow Google knew this.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.470
And it alerted me, without my
having to tell it anything,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.430
that I should go immediately
if I'm going

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.420
to get there on-time.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.240
Because I always go on Saturday
at that time.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.620
And that was my aha moment that
Google Now was really

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.750
impressive.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.450
From a geeky perspective,
we call it

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.330
Persistent Implicit Search.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.060
It's constantly searching
for you.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.120
And you might not explicitly
tell it what you want but it's

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.317
always looking on your behalf to
find you the right content

00:07:24.317 --> 00:07:25.570
at the right time.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.570
And so what is your view
on that, in terms of

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.570
the future of Search?

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.460
How is Now kicking that off?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.310
BARIS GULTEKIN: So we
have all of this--

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.350
you have all of this
interaction

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.070
with your phone, right?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.260
You carry it with you
everywhere you go.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.050
But yet, it's very, very
important for us to understand

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.120
that and then help you at
just the right time.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.880
In your case, for instance,
being able to tell you that,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.880
hey, there's traffic, you should
leave now, because

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.950
you're always there at the
time is the aha moment.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.940
For a lot of our users, things
like when they search for a

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.180
restaurant to go to and then
they hop into their car and

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.560
the directions to that
restaurant is right there.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.620
These little things are these
magic moments that our users

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.870
really love.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.880
If that answers your question.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.630
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.280
And one thing, you talk about
people now, originally, it was

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.070
all on Mobile.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.240
And this really--

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.330
having Glass, it's been a really
impressive thing to

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.580
find the content, exactly what
you want, with just a swipe of

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.420
the finger.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.890
But we saw some really
incredible

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.540
additions today, to Search.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.090
And maybe you can talk to me a
little bit about how some of

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.740
that Voice Search is coming to
either Chrome on the desktop,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.440
but as well as the new cars that
came out at Google I/O.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.049
BARIS GULTEKIN: So the Voice
Search coming into Chrome is

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.039
quite exciting.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.169
We announced that with what
we call the "hot word".

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.980
You can start talking to your
desktop or laptop right away.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.180
All you need to do is, when
you're on google.com, just

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.930
say, "OK, Google," and
start speaking what

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.350
you'd like to get.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.880
We think that's really,
really exciting.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.280
And it's, again, in that
evolution, where the Star Trek

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.710
computer is slowly
becoming real.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.220
You need to be able to talk to
your computer and have it do

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.010
things for you.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.230
So we think that's really
exciting, basically bringing

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.470
the power that we have with
our devices to also other

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.190
platforms, like the laptop
and the desktop.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.500
In addition to that, we also
announced that we're going to

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.720
have Reminders on Google Now,
which I'm really, really

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.400
excited about.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.250
We want our users to rely on
Google when they need to be

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.450
reminded of things.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.540
So if you are going to--

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.680
if you need to remember to buy
eggs when you go to Safeway,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.880
all you need to do is just say,
"remind me to buy eggs at

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.920
Safeway." And the reminder will
be there contextually,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.270
right at the right time.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.250
LOUIS GRAY: So when I get next
to Safeway, it'll say "hey,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:45.570
buy eggs?"

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.960
BARIS GULTEKIN: When you're at
Safeway, it'll say, "hey, buy

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.450
eggs." Also, because Google Now
semantically understands

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.990
the locations that you care
about, you can also say things

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.770
like, remind me when I'm at
home to do something, or,

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:03.760
remind me when I get to work
to talk to my colleague.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.440
So it's basically time-based
reminders and

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.100
location-based reminders.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.350
Another thing that's really,
really important is that we're

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.080
also enabling an integration
of reminders in your search

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.000
experience.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.060
So let's say you're searching
for a movie that's upcoming.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.770
On the Knowledge Graph, you'll
be able to see a button that

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.960
says, "remind me when this movie
comes out." And it'll

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.610
remind you when that happens.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.010
Or when you are searching for
a date, "when are Oscars?"

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.440
When you see that date, also
you'll have a reminder to be

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.480
reminded when that becomes
available.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.070
LOUIS GRAY: I think one of the
things we talked about was

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.850
that Google Now really
started as a 20%

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.060
project here at Google.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.650
For those who are a little
familiar with Google's

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.510
culture, that's when an employee
essentially dedicates

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.945
one day of his or her week to
a new project and focuses on

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:48.250
it all the time.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.830
And what that really means is
usually an employee has a

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.810
full-time job and another
job, which is the 20%.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.250
Can you take me through that?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.180
How did that become a 20%
project of yours and then

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.720
consume you fully?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.440
BARIS GULTEKIN: Absolutely.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.510
It's really exciting.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.410
Even though we're betting really
big on Google Now, it's

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.050
had its humble beginnings as
a 20% project, as you said.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.740
It started when our engineering
lead was thinking

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.410
about, how do you make sense of
the location information?

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.220
And then he launched the
location history analysis and

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.370
basically understanding that we
show our users, here's how

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.030
much time you spend at home and
at work, and here are the

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.380
places that you go
to frequently.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.860
Then we gathered a group of
engineers, volunteers,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.440
volunteering their time
in addition to

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.320
their full-time job.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.980
And we started putting
demos together.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.610
These demos got our executives
really excited.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.790
And when we went to our
executives and said, hey,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.080
here's something we have.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.380
They were so excited that they
said, great, launch it in a

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.590
few months, we have
I/O coming.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.930
And the rest is history.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.990
We launched it in four months.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.680
And the reception
has been great.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.860
LOUIS GRAY: We are coming
up on that one year.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.420
It's amazing to think
that it only

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.230
launched at I/O last year.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.910
To me, it felt like we've
always had it.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.010
I've been an Android user.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.560
We've always had the cards.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.520
It's really easy to kind of look
and see what the sports

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.710
scores are.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.070
And it learned really quickly.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.030
It says, hey, this guy likes--

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.610
I like the A's, you like
the Giants, we

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.110
can still be friends.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.460
You still get to see that
content, sports scores, and

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.850
the stocks, and the news,
and the whether.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.270
It's been really interesting
to see that kind of

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.190
recommendation pop through, and
get exactly what you want.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.945
Now I/O is a developer
conference.

00:12:27.945 --> 00:12:30.300
So I'm going to ask you a
geeky question again.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.540
You look at this--

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.520
you've really got to pull from
a lot of different places.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.720
You talked about location
history being the first one.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.770
So you've got to pull from the
Directions API, Calendar API,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.440
Google Translate API.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.270
How did you go about looking at
all of these different APIs

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.020
to make one cohesive service?

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.990
And did having those APIs in
play make it a lot easier and

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.170
a lot faster to ship?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.130
You only had four months.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.350
BARIS GULTEKIN: Absolutely,
yes.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.820
So we have a huge benefit of
sitting on top of all of the

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.680
Google services that our users
use and love every day.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.350
So when we started, we rely on
a lot of core services that

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.730
Google has, Location is one of
them, but also the Calendar,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.030
email, and the searches
that you have.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.720
So we have the benefit of all of
these teams thinking really

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.190
hard about those instances when
users use those products.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.320
And what we do is we bring
information from those

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.050
products to the user proactively
at the right time.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.920
So we did have a lot of benefit
from all of those

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.720
API's that are available
to us.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.970
LOUIS GRAY: And I think, what I
saw at Google Now, you look

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.210
at today's keynote.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.410
And a lot of it was about having
the same environment on

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.690
desktop, on Mobile, on tablet.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.540
Android introduced the
capability to dismiss

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.910
notifications across each
of these devices.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.110
Is that something where
we're really

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.650
looking at having a unique--

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.440
sorry, a similar interface on
each of these devices, as well

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:53.805
as Google Now?

00:13:53.805 --> 00:13:54.330
BARIS GULTEKIN: That's right.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.800
So we announced the availability
of Google Now on

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.030
iOS, iPhone, and
iPad recently.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.190
So we want to make sure that we
bring our services to where

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.060
our users are, regardless
of the platform.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.880
So starting with Android, we
brought it to iOS, and now

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.310
part of it is also available
on the desktop.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.090
So we want to make sure that our
users to get the best of

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.670
Google, regardless of
where they are.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.010
LOUIS GRAY: Now I'm going to
bring up the Giants one more

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.720
time, but in a different way.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.770
So a few months out of the year,
I'm intensely interested

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.820
in a couple sports teams,
because I'll

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.470
play fantasy football.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.400
And so I'll find myself
constantly checking on the

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.270
scores for the Washington
Redskins and the New York

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.650
Giants, because I've got a
couple of their players.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.410
And after that, I don't care.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.320
And so, how easy is it for
somebody to dismiss something

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.850
where Google Now infers an
interest, but it might be a

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.770
temporal interest.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.940
What kind of information can
they do to help teach Google

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.580
Now and make it better?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.170
BARIS GULTEKIN: So we
do various things.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.200
We try to understand the
likelihood that you're

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.430
interested in something.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.700
So things like time decay,
for instance.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.890
The last time you were doing a
search and you were engaging

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.990
with the A's or Giants.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.140
If it has been a long time since
you've engaged, then

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.020
we'll take that into account in
understanding whether you

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.080
care about seeing that
information.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.020
There's also things you can do
like dismisses for instance.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.140
You'll learn from
your dismisses.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.930
We give a lot of control
to our users.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.660
So they can also tweak the cards
that they're seeing.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.930
They can add more
sports teams.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.440
They can remove sports teams.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.680
So all of those in combination
are the things.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.860
Either implicitly we try to
understand that that was

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.110
temporal, or explicitly you
can teach the system by

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.440
dismisses or by saying, no,
I don't want this anymore.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.940
LOUIS GRAY: Is there
a Google Now API?

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.140
Is there a way for developers
to tap into that and make

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.260
their own custom cards?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.010
Or ways for the applications
to interface with that?

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.110
BARIS GULTEKIN: So we have a
couple of partnerships that

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.680
are already live.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.520
For instance, with United
Airlines, when you check in,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.330
you'll have your boarding
pass ready when you

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.770
arrive at the airport.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.360
Or when you purchase a ticket
with Fandango, that ticket

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.510
will be ready when you arrive
at the movie theater.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.330
We also have a partnership
with Zillow.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.930
So if you're in the market for
a home, we'll show the open

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.220
houses in the area
you're looking.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.650
In addition to all of this,
today we are also announcing

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.500
that, with our select partners,
they can mark up

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.800
their emails so we understand
whenever there's a flight or

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.030
whenever they have a hotel
or reservation coming up.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.130
So all of those are ways where
we engage with our partners to

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.860
provide more information into
Google to show to their users.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.750
LOUIS GRAY: So what type of
information goes into Google

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.410
Now to improve recommendations?

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.550
You've talked about location.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.620
You've talked about possibly
search history.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.470
But what else does Google take
from the different pieces that

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.360
you're watching on a mobile
phone to make your cards even

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.040
more smart?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.410
BARIS GULTEKIN: So location's
a core component.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.350
We want to be able to help you
get to your next destination

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.490
and tell you traffic about it.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.200
So location becomes a very core
component of Google Now.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.420
Searches are quite important.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.460
We'd like to help you continue
researching or we'd like to

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.220
help you get to your next
destination because you've

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.690
been researching that place.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.329
So Search is another
component.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.800
Calendar is really important
because with Calendar, you're

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.700
explicitly saying, I have this
meeting that I need to get to.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.910
So there are many things that
we can help with that

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.410
experience.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.020
So we focus on that, as well.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.540
At large, what we try to do is
we try to think about, what

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.619
are the instances in which
our users need

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:21.810
assistance the most?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.410
And could we predict and help
in those instances?

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.990
And prioritize that way.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.830
LOUIS GRAY: So I
had an incident

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.990
recently when I was traveling.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.230
I flew over to Paris.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.410
And I open up my phone, and
first time I get Wi-Fi access,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.440
I look at my new cards.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.200
And it was really incredible
to see how not only did the

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.820
phone know what I was doing,
but it had all

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.060
this helpful stuff.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.500
And I know your demo basically
talked about

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.640
places to take photos.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.400
And for me, I'm not really
huge photographer.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.840
But I appreciate knowing that.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.690
But it had stuff like
conversions.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.230
It would say how many dollars
a euro is and other bits.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.020
What are the things that
play into travel?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.220
What kind of really cool cards
can come up when I travel

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.600
3,000 miles?

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.430
BARIS GULTEKIN: So when you
travel, there are a couple of

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.600
things we show.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.670
We show your time at home
so you know when

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.320
to call back home.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.370
We'll tell you things like
conversion rates, the currency

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.200
conversion rates.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.970
We'll give you information about
translation, so you have

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.530
a translation tool at
your fingertips.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.180
We'll also show you
attractions if

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.140
you're new to that city.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.400
If you've been to that city
multiple times, chances are

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.970
you don't care about attractions
anymore, so we

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.340
won't show it.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.630
LOUIS GRAY: How many times
is a number of times?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.520
Is three a lot?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.660
Is five a lot?

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.640
BARIS GULTEKIN: Five
is probably a lot.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.300
The way we try to think about it
is, is showing this card to

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.290
the user adding value?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.430
And if you've been to a place
five times, if you've been to

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.320
London five times, for instance,
showing you, hey,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.330
there's Big Ben, doesn't
really matter anymore.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.680
So we stop showing it.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.610
We also want to make sure that
throughout the process of

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.830
traveling, we help with
various things.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.730
For instance, if you were
searching on Google a week

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.090
before you go there about
getting to a destination, for

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.210
instance, a restaurant that
you're going to meet your

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.650
friend at, we'll show you
directions to that place when

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.340
you're there.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.120
So it's basically a collection
of things that we want to help

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.860
you manage your day-to-day life
as well as little tools

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.850
that will also help with
the experience.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.590
In addition to helping you
discover new content, like

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.020
photo spots nearby,
or attractions.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.640
LOUIS GRAY: We talked a little
bit about the genesis of the

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.400
product as a 20%.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.150
So I'm really intrigued by the
amount of content that is

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.010
flowing through mobile devices,
the amount of mobile

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.060
web tracking that's happening,
the amount of mobile web

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.330
browsing that's occurring.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.850
Would this project even have
made sense in a world without

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.190
smartphones?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.110
Would it even have happened?

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.720
What were those trigger
points that says, aha,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.050
we've got to do this.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.550
BARIS GULTEKIN: I think
Mobile is critical.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.820
Because people--

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.970
Mobile, first of all, it's
a very contextual device.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.930
It has location in it.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.500
It's also connected and it's
with you all the time.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.440
Another aspect of Mobile is
that users have this very

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.970
personal connection with
their devices.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.220
They're constantly using
their device.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.210
I think Mobile is key in helping
us understand what

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.310
your context is, in helping us
understand in what situations

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.610
you need this type
of information.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.310
So without Mobile, I think this
product would have been

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.870
much less powerful.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.505
LOUIS GRAY: Do you find
sometimes that people confuse

00:20:16.505 --> 00:20:18.920
Google Now with Voice Search
and they'll ask

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.660
you one or the other?

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.210
Do you see them as being
completely intertwined?

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.280
BARIS GULTEKIN: I think the
whole Search experience--

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.770
we think of that [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.200
as a whole.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.870
So Google Now is part of the
Google Search app on Android

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.960
as well as on the iPhone.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.700
You can search with
your keyboard.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.270
You can also do a Voice query
and it will assist you with

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.110
that query.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.670
And it will also try to infer
what your search is and try to

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.910
show you information.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.290
So I see all of this as a
collective assistant trying to

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.770
help you, either before you
ask or when you ask.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.950
We want to make sure that
we have the best

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.390
experience for you.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.030
LOUIS GRAY: You put out a
keyword, which is "assist."

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.640
There's assist, and there's
anticipate.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.060
Anticipating what you're going
to ask before you even ask it.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.920
Going back to Voice Search,
I'm a parent.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.980
I've got three kids that
are five and under.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.740
And for them, every screen
should have everything in the

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.690
world available.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.220
They can't believe it
if they can't find

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.860
exactly what they want.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.460
And I'll often run into my
daughter holding up a Nexus 7

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.980
tablet to her face and saying,
Google, show me

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.550
videos of sea turtles.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.240
And if it doesn't load, like if
there's a problem with the

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.680
[INAUDIBLE], she's like, Google,
show me videos of sea

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.770
turtles, until they all come
up and she's on her way.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.750
And so it's just been--

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.060
you look at the evolution of
it and the fact that we're

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.370
able to take all of these things
for granted, to be

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.280
right there.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:33.930
It's just stunning.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.110
And I look at Google Now, with
its cards, and the fact that

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.960
it is only a year old, and
how far we've come.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.480
It's been really incredible
to watch.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.670
I definitely appreciate you
coming on the GDL at I/O stage

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.440
to talk about it.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.190
And I hope we can see really
incredible stuff for year two,

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.970
when we definitely will
be bringing you back.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.200
BARIS GULTEKIN: I can't wait.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.460
We believe the potential is so
high and we're just starting,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.100
so, looking forward to it.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.680
LOUIS GRAY: So definitely, thank
you for taking all the

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.730
time with me, Baris, I really
appreciate that.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.640
For those of you on the live
stream, if you want to see

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.470
great GDL content the rest of
the year, subscribe to Google

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.640
Developers on YouTube
and check out

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.990
developers.google.com/live.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.560
We'll be back here at
4:30 talking about

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.840
performance on Chrome.
