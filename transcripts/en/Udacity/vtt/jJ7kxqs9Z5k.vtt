00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.685
Our answer, interestingly enough is, a plus c over 2, b plus d over 2. To figure

00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:09.205
out how we got to this final answer, let's start again with the x coordinate of

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:13.880
our midpoint. Our x coordinates of the two original points are a and c. And let's

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:18.360
say they want to start at a and move halfway towards c. First we find half the

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.152
distance between these two coordinates. Which is the distance, c minus a, just

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:27.185
divided by 2. Then you need to shift that over graphically so that we're

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:31.566
starting at point a, instead of starting at the origin. So we need to tack on a

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:35.972
distance in x of a. I said that I wanted your answer as a single fraction, so we

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.501
need to simplify this a little bit. Putting this all over one common denominator

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:45.323
gives us c minus a plus 2a, all over 2. And in the end we get c plus a over 2,

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:50.262
Or of course because of commutivity, a plus c over two. We do the same exact

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:55.126
thing for our y co-ordinate except of course we use the y values of these two

00:00:55.138 --> 00:01:00.497
points. And we end up with d plus b over 2. Together, these two coordinates give

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:01.893
us our final midpoint.
