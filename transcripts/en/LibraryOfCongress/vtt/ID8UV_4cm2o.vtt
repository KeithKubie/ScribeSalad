00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.080
&gt;&gt; Debra Band: It's an
extraordinary honor to be with you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.790 position:56%
to share my fourth illuminated book.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.180
I'm so very grateful to Dr.
Brenner for inviting me.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.120
Each time I come to this building,
it's like entering a temple.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.990
But, of course, unlike a religious
temple, it belongs equally to all

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.960
of us, of all intellectual
and spiritual paths.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.980
Now, this work is expressly
Jewish, but its core ideas

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140
of fusing spiritual and
secular relate to all faiths.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.240
This morning, I'm introducing
you to my vision

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.790
of how we can fully fuse our
souls and our modern minds

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.450
through this new book, which
presents the customs and liturgies

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.070 position:56%
of one of the most important moments

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.480
in all Jewish tradition
that occurs every week.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.530
On Friday evenings, the
Shechinah, in Jewish mysticism,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.880 position:56%
the most accessible emanation of
the divine spirit, enters synagogues

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930
and homes as the sunsets
and Sabbath arrives.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.450
As we shed our weekday schedules
and demands, she wraps us in a veil

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.090
of ecstatic, exalted imagery
that couldn't be more different

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.750 position:56%
from the imagery of our daily lives.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.300 position:56%
Ideas about the beauty of creation,
of divine wisdom, and energy flowing

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.430
and sparkling through
the material world.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.050
We express these ideas in a
sunset synagogue prayer service,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.050
followed up around the home dining
table, in a tradition developed

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.030
by the Jewish mystics, the
Kabbalists, of 16th-century Tifat,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.580
or Safed, in northern Israel.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.340
The companions and followers

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.470
of the remarkable wunderkind
Rabbi Isaac Luria.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.940
Luria and his fellows drew upon
an unbroken mystical tradition

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.150
stretching back through the
Renaissance and medieval Italy

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.300
to Spain, Provence,
and ultimately Israel,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.310
as far back as the Temple Periods.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.610
The term "kabbalah"

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.050
in fact literally means
that which is received.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.760
Luria and his community of fellow
mystics received a tradition

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.590
that had been the secretive
study of an exclusive group

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.480
of the most sophisticated Jewish
scholars for over 2000 years.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.100
And they revolutionize that
tradition by opening it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.990
up to the greater Jewish community

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.720
through this ecstatic prayer
service, enabling the study

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.000
of kabbalah to reach
the general community.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.730
The whole Hasidic movement,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.560
beginning in mid-18th
century Ukraine, in fact,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.010
grew from the popularization of
Jewish mysticism that was sparked

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.650
by the Luria kabbalah
Shabbat tradition.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.240
As men and women of the dawn of the
21st century, who heard the news

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.300
when the Nobel Prize was
awarded for dating the Big Bang,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.430
I think many of us need more
than biblical commandment

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.740
or vague spiritual feelings
or even ecstatic joy

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.210
in singing beloved
liturgies together

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.110
to fully appreciate the grandeur of
the relationship with the divine.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.140
This is true not only
in the Jewish world,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.620
which is what my work deals with,
but for all religions in our time.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.490
It is essential that we understand
our relationship with the divine

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.610
through not only the spiritual
but also through the tangible

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.500
and physical aspects of our minds.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.030
We live in an age when organized
religion too often seems more

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.720 position:56%
focused on organization than on
spirituality, and is being abandoned

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.300
by much of Western society.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.660
A couple of years ago, the Pew
study on religion sounded the alarm

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.650
for all American religious
communities, Jewish as well,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.280
that we need to find new ways

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.900
of keeping our communities
engaged in our tradition.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.190
Paradoxically though, the need
for moral and spiritual rootedness

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.350
in a frightening and
nihilistic world increasingly so,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.700
has never been keener.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.830
To me, an essential question
in religious life is how

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.710
to satisfy the hungry and
demanding minds of people planted

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.810 position:56%
in the material world of data and
science and still give them a portal

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.510
into the world of the spirit,
of the historical panoply

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.400
of religious community on thought,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.510
maintaining the integrity
of the tradition.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.290
For instance, in the Jewish
world, few have to be convinced

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.150
of the importance of Friday
night Sabbath dinners.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.760
But in my 30 years of
interviewing hundreds

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.730
of young couples toward designing
their Jewish marriage contracts,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.750
I've seen that family Sabbath

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.090
and festival dinners are the single
most important, powerful conveyor

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.870
of joy in Jewish tradition
from one generation to another.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.330
However, at the same time,
all the numbers are showing

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.890
that the family dinner experience
alone doesn't convey the tradition.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.860
That a Jewish feeling alone
doesn't convey the tradition.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.000
That even singing the blessings and
songs doesn't give our children,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.100
even ourselves all too
often, compelling reasons

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.360
to bond to our traditions.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.870 position:56%
In our fast-paced, data-driven
world, in this marketplace of ideas,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.700
we need to have a real-world
reason to drop everything

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.850
on Friday afternoon and focus
instead on spiritual matters.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.870
Now we have to find a way of
making it all makes sense,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.350 position:56%
to show all our generations that
the world, that our daily experience

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.590
and the world of our
souls are in fact one.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.300
I think that part of the problem is

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.520
that too often organized
religion requires us

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.270
to divide our brains in half.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.600
Half, for instance, accepts
the empirical science spun

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.510
out of the theory of the Big Bang.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.530
While half of the brain believes

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.110
that the world was
created in six days.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.740
And I'd like to share with you
the journey that has helped me

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.810
to resolve this dichotomy,
through fusing poetry and metaphor,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.300
paint, parchment, and gold.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.470
Let me tell you how I
embarked upon this trip.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.180
It has led me to places
I never expected to go.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.150 position:56%
Now, I come from a long line of
Jewish scholars and rabbis descended

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.780
from the celebrated 18th-century
Hasidic Master [foreign language].

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.900
But in recent generations,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.690
the family consciousness
became more aligned

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.100
with more normative rationalist
Jewish rabbinic thought

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.170
than with the primarily mystical.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.830
My beloved late first husband
David was a NASA astrophysicist.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.290
And I found his and his
colleagues work entrancing.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.630
His career led me to
become entirely comfortable

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.460
in the intellectual world of
modern physics and science,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.050
and more than slightly skeptical
about a more mystical approach

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.830
to existence than that native to
mainstream traditional Judaism.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.620
I'm showing you now a
Hubble Space Telescope image

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.410
of the extreme deep field of space.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.480
Showing us lights in the universe
arriving now, or better in 2014,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.970
when this image was made.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.850
But emitted as far back
as the early universe.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.580
So take a good look at this photo.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.910
You're going to find
that it's a central image

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.630
in the paintings I'm showing you
here and throughout the book.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.960
Deciding to work on the
gorgeous kabbalah Shabbat customs

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.580
and liturgy, presented
me though with a problem.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.560
Obviously, I had to confront
Jewish mysticism head on to begin

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.870
to make head or tail of it.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.980 position:56%
Now, mysticism, as I mentioned, had
never been on my intellectual radar.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.150
But at the same time, I knew
it was a serious matter not

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.370
to be toyed with carelessly.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.240
In fact, right at the beginning
of my work in the Jewish arts,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.140
I was horrified at
the careless approach

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.820
with which I saw kabbalah
misused in the arts community.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.860 position:56%
And early on, I decided that I would
never touch kabbalah unless I was

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.840
prepared to pour myself into it.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.260
When my Song of Songs book came
out in 2005, the renowned scholar

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.690 position:56%
of medieval Jewish mysticism, Arthur
Green, sent me an annoyed email,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.580
criticizing me for working
with midrashic but not

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.970
with the cabalistic
allegory on the poetry.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.270
So what else?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.110
Upon deciding to explore
kabbalah Shabbat, I contacted him

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.810
to guide my reading, so that
I could begin to orient myself

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.820 position:56%
in the Lurianic mysticism that had
sent forth the Friday night liturgy.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.960
And at the same time, I joined
a little weekly reading group

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.540
in Hasidic literature
at my synagogue.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.760
And thunder clap, I discovered
to my complete incredulity

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.540
that the questions
and concerns probed

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.170
in kabbalah were strikingly
similar to those at the heart

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.510
of the scientific world in which
I lived my entire adult life.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.550
Kabbalah seemed to
share the same concerns

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.250
as cosmology and particle physics.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.720
Questions concerning the
beginning of the world,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.620
the unity of all matter,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.670
and perpetuating the glorious
order of the world around us.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.360
Now, this was all very perplexing.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.090
I was absolutely certain that my
late husband's, the astrophysicist,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.250
spirit was rolling with laughter
at my colossal misunderstanding.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.260
But soon, I found that a
well-respected astrophysicist,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.090
Howard Smith, who was here at
the Smithsonian for many years

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.260
and is now at Harvard, had
explored this very concordance.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.600
And that other biologists

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.520
and mathematicians had
been edging toward similar

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.620
if not theological ideas
about the unity of all matter.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.940
And at the same time through
my reading on kabbalah,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.320
I also discovered that the sages
who originated key concepts

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.790
in Jewish mysticism themselves
understood the mystical realm

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.240
of their own experience
through the use of metaphor.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.910
Sort of extreme midrash,
if you will,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.420
for rendering the otherwise
inaccessible reality

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.330
of the divine accessible
to human imagination.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.770 position:56%
And metaphor midrash, for many years
already, these had been as basic

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.040
to my work as brushes and paint.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.320
Now, many Jewish thinkers
have written of the unity

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.540
of the material and
spiritual worlds.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.910
Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, in his
2011 book, The Great Partnership,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.500
Science, Religion, and the Search
for Meaning, wrote eloquently

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.270
of how science and religion
offer not conflicting accounts

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.740
of the universe but rather two
complementary points of view.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.210
The first demonstrating
the mechanism

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.580
and the second giving
us the meaning.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:51.040
The 16th and 17th century mystic,
Avraham Azulai, seemed to strain

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.990
to describe all the energy
of the universe as the light

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.390
of the infinite God head,
which spreads from above,

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.020
down to the end of all levels.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.120
And in his lyrical distillation
of Kabbalah, the 13 Petalled Rose,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.120
Adin Steinsaltz tells of how
the soul swings between reaching

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.630
for the divine and plunging
into the physical world.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.880
That this oscillation is the
very nature of life itself.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.170 position:56%
In both the assent to God and the
decent to matter, there is holiness.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.510
Never is any one-way holy
sufficient unto itself.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.020
And it's only when
they exist together

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.090
that they constitute a real
passage between heaven and earth.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.390
Yet, how to keep all of this

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.260
in mind while actually
living out traditions?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.270
Illuminating Kabbalat
Shabbat would offer a chance

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.790
to fuse our traditions and prayer
not only with imagery drawn

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.570
from the Kabbalistic sources and my
usual combination of Bible midrash

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:59.120
and archaeology, but also with
science, astrophysics, and biology.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.090
This quickly became my means
of broadening our understanding

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.420
of the Sabbath to reflect not only
a spiritual sense of the completion

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.250
of the world but also a
view of the tangible unity

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.830
of all matter understood
through cosmology and physics.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.700
As I mentioned before, we live in
the millennium, forget millennium,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.080
we live in the decade in which
astrophysicists pinpointed the Big

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.020
Bang through the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.090
We have dated the moment
of "in the beginning."

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.150
So here in front of me
lay my next challenge

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.730
in creating an interpretation of
Jewish tradition that would engage,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.620
fuse our emotional, spiritual
hearts with our analytic,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.310
space-age, information-age minds.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.420
And many for the science

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.050
and a real-world context
for the mysticism.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.800
Off to the races.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.540
So now, put on your virtual
stereo vision glasses

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.050
and let's consider how all
this works in just a few

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.490
of these painted prayers.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.380
You'll be able see
them all in the book.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.790
For the last minute or
so, you've been looking

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.790 position:56%
at my illuminated paintings of Psalm
96, the second in a series of Psalms

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:18.190
that lie at the heart of the
synagogue kabbalat Shabbat liturgy.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.100
Who of us standing at the seashore
amid the clamor of thundering waves

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.330
and rustling palms,
has not been dumbstruck

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.740
at the dramatic power
of the created world.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.200 position:56%
And that I think is exactly what has
caught the psalmist attention here.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.180
And so in these paintings,
the singing of the wind

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.450
through the trees, the roaring
of the waves, and energy rushing

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.760
through the ever-evolving
heavens, announce the presence

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.070
of God in the physical world.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:56.870
And if you look at these black and
colored bands lining the texts,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.090
these present the spectral
admission lines,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:06.000
effectively the light signature for
the gases most prevalent in air.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.870
You can begin to see here
how I confuse the physics,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:15.430
the material world of our daily
experience, with the spiritual.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.160
Now, Psalm 96 is the second in
a series of psalms at the heart

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.030
of the Kabbalat Shabbat
synagogue service.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.720
Each of which, to me, leads
us to experience the grandeur

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.210
of creation using a
different kind of sense.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.510
My partner in this project, the
scholar of medieval Hebrew poetry,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.110
who translated all the poetry
and wrote the literary analyses,

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.430
Raymond Scheindlin, a few years
ago, he stood here to share

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.660
with you his new book
on Judah Halevi.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.800
Ray suggests that these psalms must
have seemed a most appropriate way

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.710
of stimulating the worshipers
to meditate on the meaning

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.330
of the Sabbath as remembrance
of the work of creation.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.070
For them, the Sabbath was more
than a mere act of remembrance.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.770
It was a reenactment
and a prefiguration.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.460
By properly observing the
Sabbath, the worshiper participates

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.610
in renewing the original
act of creation,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.830
helping to guarantee the fecundity
of the world for the coming week.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:24.040
The poem Yedid Nefesh, Souls
Beloved, is a luscious love poem

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.340 position:56%
and song to god by the 16th-century
sought Kabbalist [foreign language],

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.510
one of your [foreign
language] companions.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.010
And my illuminations
play on the idea

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.130
of the passionate love it expresses
between god and the human soul.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.760 position:56%
Obzekrid [phonetic] describes god as
the soul's beloved, soul's father,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.320
soul's light, soul's
protector, soul's glory.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.190
Always returning to the intimate
language of romantic love

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.780
to express the depth of
human emotion to god.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.540
Whether father, healing
light, or protective king,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.110
god is the intimate
eternal beloved of the soul.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.290
The microcopy that you see, the
lines of tiny writing that you see,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.620
winding through the paintings,
includes the full text

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.860
of the biblical Song of Songs.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.030
The love poetry that inspired the
themes of divine and erotic love

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.590
and union that pervade
Jewish mysticism.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.700
Other imagery, the intense
love of a father for his baby.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.210
A gazelle, this gazelle nested
securely in the forest floor,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.070
captures other qualities
of the human --

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.330
of the warm human love for the
divine that the poet expresses.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:43.180 position:56%
And these scenes reflect also the
unity of the whole biological world,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.290
the whole material world.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.430
Our history also unites us.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.080
The columns of palmets [phonetic]

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.550
that you see flanking
the text are adapted

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.820
from a little ivory furniture
plaque now in the Israel museum

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.850
that was found in Samaria, and
which is exactly contemporary

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.180
with the building of
Solomon's temple and palace.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.680
In the biblical books
of Kings and Chronicles,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.910 position:56%
palmets [phonetic] patterns are
described for those great buildings.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.970
And there's perfectly solid art
historical reason to suspect

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.770
that this pattern is the
very one that was used

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.350 position:56%
in decorating those great buildings.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.300
And so I use these palmets
[phonetic] often in my work,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.730
to allude to the importance of the
temple as god's dwelling on earth

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:34.310 position:56%
and the historical unity of Jewish
community across time and geography.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.820 position:56%
There's much more detailed symbolism
in each of these paintings,

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.250
but I'll let you read
about that in the book.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.400 position:56%
But, again, the infant and the force
imagery remind us of the importance

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.970
of living our spiritual
life through the wonders

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.750
of the natural world
that we inhabit.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.590
One of the signal ways in which
Jews sanctify the 25 hours

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.530
of the Sabbath is with the
Kiddush, the blessing over wine

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.390
at the beginning of
the Sabbath meals.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.830
Now, in the Kabbalistic sources,
wine is a symbol of divine wisdom.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.550
And the Sabbath is the time

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.370
that wisdom flows most
abundantly into the material realm.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.250
My interpretations of kiddush
present the mystical idea

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.130
of the wine's translation of divine
wisdom into the material world

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.010
through a mathematical metaphor.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.290
So here at right, the Hebrew
lumination plays with the image

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.250
of the wine fountains, with
which many Jews share kiddush

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.930
with the family and
friends at our tables.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.470
These cups though aren't arrayed
on the typical tiered trays

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.190
but pipe wine from the
uppermost to the lower cups.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.490
And this wine is much more

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.050
than fermented grape
juice, even the best.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.680
Instead, this wine overflows
from one level to the next,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.150 position:56%
following the mystical metaphor that
describes how divine wisdom flows

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.510
from the highest, most
hidden aspects of god,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.630
downward until it reaches
the material world,

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.860
and finally appears to us as water.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.400
The 10 cups refer, if you haven't
already guessed, to the 10 sefirot,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.370
or emanations, or qualities of god.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.040
And they're presented here in
colors associated with each

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.940
of them in the zohar [phonetic].

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.710
But what's this pyramid
arrangement all about?

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.450
Now, just as the kabbalistic system
ascribes the number 10 cosmic

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.400 position:56%
significance -- for instance, the 10
sefirot -- Pythagorean philosophy,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.650
the beginning of Western
mathematics,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.180
also regard the number 10 as holy.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.520
They describe the tech
tractors [phonetic],

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.510
the pyramid symbolizing the unity
of the universe that's formed

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.120
by the flow of geometric
form from a single point.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.050
The four levels of these cups
Pythagorean pyramid trace the

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.080
development of geometric
form as follows.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.300
At top, the single cup
represents a single point.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.240
At the second level, the two cups
represent the two points necessary

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.300
to determine a line.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.610
At the third level, the three
cups are the three points defining

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.910
a plane.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.420
And finally, at bottom, the four
cups are the four points necessary

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.820
to determine a tetrahedron, the
simplest three-dimensional form.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.210
The microcopy surrounding both
these pages is the passage

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:31.110
from Proverbs 8, in which
wisdom, personified as a woman,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.640
rejoices in being the
almighty's first companion

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.870
from before creation.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.560 position:56%
And how she takes pleasure, not only
in being god's closest companion,

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.430
but also a playmate of
humankind, bridging the divide

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.990
between heaven and earth.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.380
Since time is short,
I'll leave you to find

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.960
out about the English
painting in the book.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.420
This is all about Luria's
ideas about the sweetness

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.820
of the sheena's presence on earth.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:05.040
I love the kabbalistic notion
of how we draw divine wisdom

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.590
into the world on the Sabbath.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.880
As we saw, blessing wine is an
important means of doing this,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.200 position:56%
but we begin the process by lighting
Sabbath candles a few minutes

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.240
before sunset.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.690
My own private prayer, after
blessing the candles, in fact,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.510
asks for wisdom for guiding my
family and to imbue my work.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.560
In these paintings of candle
lighting, I fuse the light

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.730
of the candles with the
lights of material creation.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.920
There's so much going on here.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.650
Medieval poetry and [foreign
language] historical women's

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.330
meditations, my mother's and
grandmother's candlesticks,

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.190
and all that's explained
in the book.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.630
But right now, let me just
focus on the sources of light.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.550
First though, a few words about
the origin and mystical role

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.360
of Sabbath candle lighting.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.320
The ritual began in the
period of the Mishnah,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.270
that is in the first couple of
centuries of the Common Era,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.080
during the period of the first
codification of Jewish law.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.670
And it was begun simply
to light the Sabbath table

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.320
so that family could relax
and enjoy their festive meal

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.880
and Sabbath rest together
at leisure.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.880
Mystical sources though
suggests that the light

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.880
from the Sabbath candles adds
to the [foreign language],

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.120
the additional soul that
flowers within the soul

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.490
of every Jew during the Sabbath.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.320
Now, this [foreign
language], additional soul,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.800 position:56%
descends from the feminine emanation
of god, the [foreign language],

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.170
the divine emanation
closest in material world.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.480
It's the woman of the house
who enjoys the privilege

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.180
of lighting the candles, reenacting
the unification of the human

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.820
and divine spheres, of the sphere
of the emanations themselves.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.840
So let's focus for a moment on
the Hebrew illumination at right.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.630
Let's start with the
candle flames at the center.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.380
Their blue and gold motif
represents the [foreign language],

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.520
the divine energy flowing
throughout the universe.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.230
We view the candles against the
dusk sky lit by the setting sun,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.590
while the ever-evolving
deep sky wheels far

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.790
above our heads and homes.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.390
Now, this image is taken from that
same Hubble photograph I showed you

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.950
earlier, showing lights of
origin so distant that it comes

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.390
from the earliest periods
after the Big Bang.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.400
The geometric painting
surrounding the words

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.320
of the blessing is a
classical Moorish pattern,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.380 position:56%
that was part of the visual
surroundings of the Sephardic world,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.540
the world of the Spanish Jews.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.710
This pattern expresses the
flow of all geometric form

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:53.170
from a single point, symbolizing
the origin of all the universe

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.220
and the creator whose work
we celebrate on the Sabbath.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.170
There's so much to share here
about the beauty of the Sabbath

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.520
and the fusion of the
spiritual with the scientific,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.530
and there are many
themes in this book

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.850
that I haven't even
begun to deal with today.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.890
But let me show you just two more
pairs of paintings that relate

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.770
to one of the most popular ways

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.480
that we experience the material
world as the Sabbath arrives.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.710
Food. Challah, the special
braided egg bread that we eat

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.210
on the Sabbath, is not
only the first thing eaten

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.190
at the Sabbath dinner, but the
bread symbolizes all the bounty

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.490
of the feast.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.910
And the act of baking
it most weeks is part

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.210
of my own spiritual
preparation for the Sabbath.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.940
At right, I'm showing you
a meditation and painting

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.820
about the act of kneading
the challah dough.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.000
And you can see in the bottom
left corner, right here,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.720
a little blob of dividing
yeast cells,

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.720
that bit of microbiology
that defines bread.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.690
Above and below the painting,
you'll see a little meditation

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.070
about the spiritual significance
of kneading the dough.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.940
This was a remarkable find for
me since these are the words

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.300
of my ancestress pearl, the wife
of Rabbi [foreign language].

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:17.000
At left, the blessing itself
surrounds an image expressing the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.080
mystical significance of the
act of breaking the bread.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.390 position:56%
The shadowy winged figures represent
the seraphim, who, as you'll read

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.530
in the book, mystic
suggested to him the feast.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:34.080
The two loaves are set within a
view of the deep cosmos, again,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.260
that Hubble photograph, suggesting
the all suffusing divine,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.900
and the hills of Judah
burgeoning with the wheat harvest.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.790
And after the meal,
after singing some songs,

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.030
all of which are also
here, we thank the almighty

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.140
for the bounty of creation.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.320
Jewish tradition precedes the
grace after meals with Psalm 126,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.690
that we describe as Shir Ha'maalot.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.080
And these paintings tie
the miracle of the rebirth

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.800
of the Jewish homeland, about
which the psalm remembers dreaming,

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.250 position:56%
to the biological and
agricultural wonder of bringing food

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.010
from our sacred soil once again.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.340
There's some wonderful
archaeology here.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.470
Imagery from Orr [phonetic],
Abraham's home,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.790
from the first Temple Period and
from the early Byzantine Period.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:28.020
But I want to draw your attention
to the two agricultural paintings.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.170
At right, the semicircular
painting shows a woman,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.400
the mourning woman Jerusalem
of Jeremiah, traipsing away

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.850
from her destroyed home,
dragging a bag of seed.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.810
What she can't see happening
behind her is that water,

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.300
a symbol of wisdom and torah
throughout our sources,

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.370
is starting to flow again, and
those seeds falling from her bag,

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.840
they're actually beginning
to germinate.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.940
Above her, the deep sky reminds
us of the all suffusing presence

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.110
of the divine, of the unity
of the entire physical world.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:09.300
At left, we flash forward to the
miracle of the modern rebirth

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.830
of the land and the
advent of modern Israel.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.600
The locale incidentally in both

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.540
of these paintings is a
spot on [foreign language].

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.740
Now, the dream of the
resettlement of Israel is reality.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.030
And again we draw sustenance
from the land.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.270
The fields and hills sprout with
date palms, crops, and vines.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.450
And farm workers use
tractors to harvest the bounty

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.800
for which we give thanks
as we end the evening.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.450
I hope that these paintings

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.050
at your table will spur discussion
among both adults and children

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.140
about what it means to
celebrate the Sabbath.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:56.110
I've developed a small paperback
bench or table side condition

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.320
of the home and table
materials, so that all can share

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.200 position:56%
and discuss the text, the paintings,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.730
and the vibrant ideas
within them all.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.130
So we see that there
really isn't any division.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.900
Instead, we have a unification
of the scientific world

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.700
of our daily experience

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.360
and the mystical world
revealed to us on the Sabbath.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.690
We just need to put on
our stereo vision glasses.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.440
Thank you.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.100
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library Of Congress.
