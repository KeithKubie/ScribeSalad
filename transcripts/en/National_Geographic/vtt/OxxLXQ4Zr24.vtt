00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.404
( intro music )

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.816
( applause )

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.285
John Grant: Thank you all
for being here tonight.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:23.222
And listening to us tell you
a little bit about Curiosity.

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:26.291
So, starting out with
why Gale Crater.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.693
<i> Well, here is a map of Mars.</i>

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.863
<i> We've landed in six locations
 before Curiosity.</i>

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.832
<i> Why do you need to go
 for a seventh? Haven't we--</i>

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.500
<i> haven't we been all
 over the planet?</i>

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.468
<i> It looks kinda like
 a shotgun blast to me here</i>

00:00:36.468 --> 00:00:38.171
<i> in terms of the yellow marks.</i>

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.207 line:0%
Well, Mars is a smaller planet
than the Earth.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.777 line:0%
But without oceans it's got
about the same land area

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.646 line:0%
as the surface of the Earth.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.981
And I travel a fair amount,
more than I'd like to

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.716
but if I had only been
to six places

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.419
on the surface of the Earth,
I wouldn't know much about it.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.021
Let me give you one example.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.556
There is a place
where I used to live

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.958
in Western New York, called
Letchworth State Park.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.693
It's called the
'Grand Canyon of the East'.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.328
A fabulous place.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.863
But if I had
never been out west

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.099
and didn't know
about the Grand Canyon,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.600
it would be
kind of a different story

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.802
in terms of
where I might choose to go.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.804
But what if the rocks
in the Grand Canyon

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:12.938
weren't of interest

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.507
and the ones in
Letchworth State Park,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.508
even though it's smaller,
were.

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:18.344
So what you really need
when you are looking

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.547
at landing sites is not only
do you have to know something

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:24.583
about the planet and
where the good places are

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.920
but you've got to
bring together the expertise

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.788
to be able to look
at those places

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.057
and find out which ones
are the most relevant

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.391
for the kinds of things

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.727
that you want to accomplish
with your mission.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:38.031
So, we started with about
65 landing site candidates

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.767
from our Science Laboratory,
Curiosity.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.535
We whittled it down
to the final four

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.870
that you see here in white.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.971
<i> Holden Crater,
 Eberswalde Crater,</i>

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.041
<i> Mawrth Vallis
 and of course Gale Crater</i>

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.642
<i> where we ended up going.</i>

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.377
<i> And just to give you
 a sense of</i>

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.979
<i> what we found attractive
 about those four places</i>

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.748
<i> and I'll point out
 that the yellow ellipsis</i>

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.916
<i> that you see here</i>

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.319
<i> are all 25 kilometers long
 by 20 kilometers high.</i>

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.321 line:0%
<i> We've got Mawrth Vallis
 on the upper left.</i>

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.655 line:0%
<i> There is this stratigraphy,</i>

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.892 line:0%
<i> these layers of rock
 that we see there</i>

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.261 line:0%
<i> that we see a sense of
 different kinds of clays</i>

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.197 line:0%
<i> from top to bottom
 and it's an ancient,</i>

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.366 line:0%
<i> ancient set of rocks
 that tell us something about</i>

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.502 line:0%
<i> the earliest
 history of the planet.</i>

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:17.970
A question about Mawrth was

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.672
how did those rocks
get to be there

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.607
and we never really
could get a handle on that.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.675
Although work has been
moving forward.

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:24.944
<i> Down here in the lower left</i>

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.979 line:0%
<i> we see a place
 called Holden Crater.</i>

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.981 line:0%
<i> It's about the same size
 as Gale Crater,</i>

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.683 line:0%
<i> about 100 miles across</i>

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:33.752 line:0%
<i> and here we see along the side
 of the crater sediments</i>

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.588 line:0%
<i> that have been washed down
 into a big fan.</i>

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.357 line:0%
<i> It's the best alluvial system
 preserved on Mars.</i>

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.160 line:0%
<i> Over here on the lower right
 we see Eberswalde Delta.</i>

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.296 line:0%
<i> A place where we might go
 and sample sediments</i>

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.264 line:0%
<i> that have been
 deposited by water</i>

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:48.134 line:0%
<i> running down through a river
 in the ancient past.</i>

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.237 line:0%
<i> The problem or question
 about these two on the bottom</i>

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.140
<i> were they occur relatively
 late in Mars' history</i>

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.409
<i> compared to when we think
 it was the wettest.</i>

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.110
And if we got there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.547
we're seeing a fairly narrow
period in the history of Mars.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.949
So we want to know
relative to habitability

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.384
when those things occurred,

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.587
we might want to
sample a place with a section

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.088
that's preserved
is much older.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.025 line:0%
<i> And that brings us to Gale
 up here in the upper right.</i>

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.493 line:0%
<i> You'll notice that in this
 100 mile across crater,</i>

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.362 line:0%
<i> 150 kilometers across,</i>

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.064 line:0%
<i> there is this mountain of
 material.</i>

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.566 line:0%
<i> Five kilometers or
 three miles high.</i>

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.235 line:0%
<i> And the layers
 that are in that mountain</i>

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.970 line:0%
<i> are very much like pages
 or chapters in a book.</i>

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.573 line:0%
<i> And when we look
 at the chemistry</i>

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.741 line:0%
<i> or the chemical composition
 of those layers,</i>

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.377 line:0%
<i> we see a transition
 from the kinds of things</i>

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.879 line:0%
<i> that were deposited in water
 in wet conditions</i>

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.481 line:0%
<i> near the bottom
 to drier things</i>

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.216 line:0%
<i> as we move up
 through the section.</i>

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.986 line:0%
And so Gale became a chance
to sort of read the chapters

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.355
related to the changing
environment on Mars,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.724
from when it was wetter

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.925
to when it's relatively
dry today.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:49.628
<i> And that's why
 we picked Gale Crater.</i>

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.865
<i> Gale Crater lies across
 this transition on Mars.</i>

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.900
<i> What you see here,
 this topography</i>

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.903
<i> where the yellows and
 the reds are relatively high</i>

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.705
<i> and the blues
 and purples are low.</i>

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.106
<i> And Gale right there
 in the middle</i>

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:04.176
<i> straddles this boundary called
 the 'planetary dichotomy'.</i>

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:07.079
<i> And what we see here already
 visible is this mound;</i>

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.348
<i> this mountain of material,
 Mount Sharp.</i>

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:11.584
<i> If we zoom in
 on the crater proper,</i>

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.287
<i> we are looking across here
 towards the south</i>

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.689
<i> and on the north side
 between the small crater</i>

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.123
<i> that you see
 in the middle of the mountain</i>

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.225
<i> is about where
 we were planning to land.</i>

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.728
<i> So we wanted to land
 and be able to drive directly</i>

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.296
<i> over to the flank
 of the mountain</i>

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.267
<i> transitioning up between these
 layers of material,</i>

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.535
<i> these chapters in the book,
 telling us about</i>

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.336
<i> the environmental history
 of Mars.</i>

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.938
<i> But there was
 another target there.</i>

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:37.776
<i> A small channel that runs down
 the wall of the crater.</i>

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:39.111
<i> This is a closer view now.</i>

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.913
<i> The top of the crater
 is now to the north,</i>

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.782
<i> so I've turned things
 around on you.</i>

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.982
<i> This is an image from</i>

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:45.418
<i> the Mars Reconnaissance
 Orbiter.</i>

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.486
<i> There is this incredible
 synergy between</i>

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.221
<i> the cameras
 that we have in orbit</i>

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:51.457
<i> and the pictures that
 we can take of the surface,</i>

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.459
<i> and the things that
 we can do on the surface</i>

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.261
<i> to ground truth that data.</i>

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.363
This data,
we can resolve things

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.798
that are about
20 meters across.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.234
The camera has a resolution
of six meters per pixel.

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:03.769
And we can see
that channel now

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.437
coming in from the upper left

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.539
and draining out into
a fan of sediment.

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:08.774
We call this an alluvial fan.

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:10.709
And there are many examples
of this on Earth

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.946
that we see in places
for example like Death Valley.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.681
So this became
a very important

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.249
secondary target,

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.751
to the layers
in Mount Sharp,

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.420
for our exploration.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.922
<i> Well, here is the view
 from the surface</i>

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.156
<i> after Curiosity landed.</i>

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:26.058
<i> This is one of
 my favorite images</i>

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.225
<i> from the mission</i>

00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:28.393
<i> because to me it's almost like</i>

00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:29.695
<i> you are standing
 in Death Valley</i>

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:32.397
<i> looking up the west
 at the Panamint Mountains.</i>

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.100
<i> And seeing this
 fan of material,</i>

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.602
<i> you can see the bright outline
 of Peace Vallis,</i>

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:39.738
<i> this channel coming down
 and the sloping sort of</i>

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:41.641
<i> deposit of sediment
 that's being</i>

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.544
<i> laid down by that river
 some time in the past.</i>

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.778
<i> We are way down
 at the very far end of that</i>

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:49.248
<i> where we landed
 with Curiosity.</i>

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:52.117
<i> In fact we weren't even sure
 if we were going to be</i>

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.919
<i> on those sediments.</i>

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.488
<i> Now here is an overhead view,</i>

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:56.989
<i> this time
 from the HiRise camera,</i>

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.458
<i> which can image things that
 are about three feet across.</i>

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:01.894
<i> It has a resolution of
 about 25 centimeters</i>

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:03.062
<i> or about a foot.</i>

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.897
<i> You can see
 where Curiosity landed,</i>

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.899
<i> the two blue spots over here
 on the left.</i>

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.068
<i> And those are the tracks
 of the rover.</i>

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.902
<i> When we landed,
 because we had</i>

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:12.838
<i> mapped the surface
 of our landing ellipse</i>

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:15.541
<i> before we got down
 to the surface of the planet</i>

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.310
we knew that there were
some different terrains

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.445
that we were likely to sample,
depending on where we landed.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.081
And because we landed
at that spot there,

00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:25.484
we happen to be very close to

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:26.985
three different kinds
of material

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:28.687
that were sort of like
a Rosetta Stone

00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:32.225
we thought for understanding
the geology of our traverse

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.326
as we went across to
Mount Sharp.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.594
<i> The most of the material for</i>

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:38.230
<i> the left two-thirds
 of the image was one type</i>

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.232
<i> and the lower right corner
 was another,</i>

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:42.535
<i> and then the brighter
 whitish-blue stuff up there</i>

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.769
<i> is a third.</i>

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:46.271
<i> Seeing this juncture of these
 three different materials</i>

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:47.906
<i> knowing that
 they held to clues to</i>

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:50.576
<i> what was going on in Gale
 and that they might be related</i>

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.111
<i> to that alluvial fan,</i>

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.614
drove us literally
in the opposite direction

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:58.284
than we intended once
we got down on the surface.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.119
Mount Sharp is down
to the left--

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.288
to the lower left,
your left, my right.

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:06.525
We went east,
we went to your right.

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.160
<i> And it paid off.</i>

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.695
<i> Very soon
 after we got started,</i>

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.863
<i> we started to find
 these outcrops.</i>

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:13.065
<i> The pebbles that you can see</i>

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.700
<i> weathering out,
 that are rounded.</i>

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.435
<i> Becky Williams
 who is here tonight</i>

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:18.270
<i> was the lead author
 on a science paper</i>

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.739
<i> that first described these</i>

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.873
<i> as 'deposits related to
 that river</i>

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:23.943
<i> flowing down
 that side of the canyon'.</i>

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.711
Now,
in Death Valley it doesn't,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.813
it doesn't rain very often.

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:30.783
But when it does,
that water comes out fast.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.151
And I can almost imagine

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.819
when I see
these sorts of things,

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.389
you know water up to
my thigh kinda thing

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.959
draining across the surface
depositing these gravels.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.961
What an amazing
and different place

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.262
this must have been

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:46.165
three, three and
a half billion years ago.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.601
<i> We got into this place
 called Yellowknife Bay</i>

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.302
<i> and here's our dried up
 lake sediments.</i>

00:07:50.302 --> 00:07:51.503
<i> This is a mudstone.</i>

00:07:51.503 --> 00:07:53.438
<i> We drilled down
 into this rock.</i>

00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:55.574
<i> The rocks weren't red,
 they are gray.</i>

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:58.511
<i> They tell us something about
 the conditions in the past.</i>

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.112
<i> When we look
 at the chemistry it tells us</i>

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.715
<i> that these clays that are
 in here were deposited</i>

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.217
<i> in conditions that were
 relatively neutral,</i>

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:07.520
<i> that is not too acidic,
 not too basic.</i>

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.388
But we've already sampled

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:11.624
sediments washed down
in a river

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.325
and ancient lake deposits.

00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:15.728
And we haven't even
gotten to Mount Sharp yet.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:18.931
So, clearly the first bit
of information

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.432
that we got back
from Curiosity,

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.434
really sort of set us
on our ear,

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.037
in terms of understanding Mars
as a planet

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.805
and how it evolved.

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:28.374
<i> Since leaving Yellowknife Bay</i>

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:29.675
<i> and these ancient lake
 deposits</i>

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.944
<i> we've been traversing across
 a landscape</i>

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.846
<i> that's littered
 with sedimentary rocks.</i>

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.182
<i> You can see some of those here
 in the foreground.</i>

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.217
<i> And we've been sampling these
 as we've gone,</i>

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.620
<i> trying to understand more
 about the relationship</i>

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.322
<i> between sediments
 washed down in this river,</i>

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.858
<i> Peace Vallis and out
 onto this fan of sediments</i>

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:48.527
<i> versus the sediments
 that have been</i>

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.495
<i> shed off
 the side of Mount Sharp.</i>

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:52.131
There's still kind of
an uncertainty

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.432
in terms of
where some of these

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.200
different sediments
have come from

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.137
and what their origin is
in relationship

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:00.706
to the timing of the formation
of this big, huge mountain

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:03.508
in the middle of the--
of the crater.

00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:04.776
But as you can see this image,

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.678
we haven't lost
sight of Mount Sharp.

00:09:06.678 --> 00:09:09.080
It's always sort of been
dead in our sights.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.183
And we are actually
more than half way there

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:14.286
from when we left
the Yellowknife Bay area.

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:18.423
<i> And in fact we see images
 like this almost daily</i>

00:09:18.423 --> 00:09:20.926
<i> with Curiosity
 and it reminds us exactly</i>

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.496
<i> why we came here
 and why this is the goal.</i>

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:26.432
<i> Because you can see
 the layers here</i>

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:29.635
<i> that I described earlier
 as sort of chapters in a book.</i>

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:30.903
<i> And you can see here</i>

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.406
<i> how they transition
 from sort of darker</i>

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.006
<i> and grayer layers
 near the bottom</i>

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:37.175
<i> to lighter sediments
 at the top.</i>

00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:39.711
<i> And knowing what we already
 know about Gale Crater</i>

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:42.815
<i> from our exploration
 of these lake and sediments</i>

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.416
<i> washed down in the fan,</i>

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:47.286
<i> we are very eager to get here
 and understand more</i>

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:50.122
<i> about the evolution
 of the Martian climate</i>

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:52.291
<i> as these sediments
 were deposited.</i>

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:55.261
( applause )

00:09:55.261 --> 00:10:00.800
( outro music )
