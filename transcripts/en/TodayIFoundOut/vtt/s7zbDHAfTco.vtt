00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.870
Born into a poor peasant family in a foreign
land, no one had worse odds to become the

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.240
ruler of the Byzantine Empire than Basil.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.210
Yet, through a combination of hard work, scheming,
murder and competence, Basil ascended to the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.790
Byzantine throne and enjoyed 19 years of relatively
peaceful rule.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.340
Authorities disagree over when and where Basil
was born.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.790
Some place his birth year as 812 CE, while
others set it around 830 CE.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.660
Ethnically Armenian, scholars also disagree
over whether he was born in Thrace, and then

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.479
carried off with his peasant parents as captives
of the Bulgarian khan Krum, or if he was born

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.569
in Macedonia after his parents were abducted.

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.410
Whatever the case, he lived for a time in
Macedonia, although Armenian was his first

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
language, and he is reported to have spoken
Greek (the language of Macedonia) with a noticeable

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.059
accent.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.260
At some point, Basil, along with other captives,
escaped the Bulgarians and returned to their

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.890
homes in Thrace around 836.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
Finding little opportunity there, he set off
to make his fortune in the big city.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.330
His arrival in Constantinople has been transformed
by admiring historians into legend:

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.830
On a Sunday, near the hour of sunset, he reached
the Golden Gate, a poor unknown adventurer,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.060
with staff and scrip, and he lay down to sleep
in the vestibule of the adjacent church of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.060
St. Diomede.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.080
During the night, Nicolas, who was in charge
of the church, was awakened by a mysterious

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.670
voice saying, “Arise and bring Basileus
into the sanctuary.”

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.420
He got up and looking out saw nothing but
a poor man asleep.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.830
He lay down again, and the same thing was
repeated.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.210
The third time, he was poked in the side by
a sword and the voice said, “Go out and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.070
bring in the man you see lying outside the
gate.”

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.280
He obeyed, and on the morrow he took Basil
. . . and adopted him as a brother.[1]

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280
Climbing through the Ranks

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.210
Regardless of the veracity of any supernatural
claims for Basil’s ascension, he was greatly

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.150
helped by the monk, Nicolas, who introduced
him to the doctor of a very rich and well

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.530
connected man, Theophilitzes.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.590
Possessing extraordinary strength, Basil was
employed by the courtier (and relative of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.659
the Empress Theodora) as a groom.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.739
Together, they travelled to Patrae on the
Greek peninsula of Peloponnese.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.999
There, Basil met (and impressed) the wealthy
Danelis.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.290
Shortly thereafter, Basil fell ill (or faked
being sick) and was left behind by Theophilitzes.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.140
When Basil recovered, Danelis became his patron
and made him a wealthy many by bestowing on

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.200
him slaves, gold and other items, ostensibly
in exchange for Basil taking her son under

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.239
his wing.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.111
Nonetheless, Basil remained in Theophilitzes’
service and eventually reunited with him in

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.420
Constantinople.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.609
While attending a wrestling match (Basil was
not originally one of the contestants), and

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.279
because of his enormous strength, he was invited
to take on that day’s champion; according

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.569
to one account: “Basil threw the Bulgarian,
squeezing him like a wisp of hay.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.359
‘From that day the fame of Basil began to
spread through the city.'”[2]

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.730
The triumph was eventually reported to the
emperor Michael III.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.269
Later, after Basil helped tame the emperor’s
intractable new horse that had resisted all

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.139
other efforts, Michael took Basil into his
own service as Hetaeriarch (captain of the

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.139
guard).

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.569
Shortly thereafter, Basil was appointed to
the post of High Chamberlain.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.359
Totally obedient to Michael (or seemingly),
Basil divorced his wife at Michael’s command

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.950
and married Michael’s mistress (in name
only).

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.540
Many scholars believe that the children of
this marriage were actually Michael’s (including

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.980
Basil’s successor, Leo VI).

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.579
It is unclear if loyalty to Michael or personal
ambition was the driving force behind Basil’s

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.579
next move.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.799
Basil had heard a rumor (or started one, depending
on your point of view) that the emperor’s

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.969
right hand man, the then second most-powerful
man in the Byzantine Empire, Caesar Bardas,

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.159
was planning to depose Michael.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.840
Basil tried to warn the emperor, but Michael
did not believe him.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.079
So Basil conspired with other ambitious young
men, including Symbatios, a young minister

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.889
and son-in-law to Caesar Bardas.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.330
Together they were able to convince Michael
of Bardas’ treachery, and Bardas was eventually

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.499
murdered when Basil “and the other co-conspirators
rushed in and hewed him in pieces” right

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.629
in front of Michael.[3]

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.779
Grateful to be rid of the traitor, Michael,
who was officially childless, adopted Basil

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.109
as his son and promoted him to the rank of
Magister.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.029
Then, mysteriously, on the Pentecost, May
26, 867 CE, Michael crowned Basil Basileus

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.090
and Augustus.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.569
On the steps before the ambo in St. Sophia,
Michael addressed his subjects:

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.739
The Caesar Bardas plotted against me to slay
me, and for this reason induced me to leave

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.739
the city.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.110
If I had not been informed of the plot by
Symbatios and Basil, I should not have been

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.110
alive now.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.920
The Caesar died through his own guilt.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.670
It is my will that Basil, the High Chamberlain,
since he is faithful to me and protects my

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.230
sovranty {sic} and delivered me from my enemy
and has much affection for me, should be the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.430
guardian and manager of my Empire and should
be proclaimed by all as Emperor.[4]

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.430
Friends Fall Out

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.620
Although Michael’s words were strong, the
real effect was that Basil was in charge of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.620
the day-to-day operations of the empire, while
Michael retained his position as the true

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620
emperor.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.810
Hard to believe that didn’t end well.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.640
Sure enough, the two had a falling out.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.040
Michael began to think Basil was too big for
his britches, and he considered appointing

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.980
another to Basil’s place.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.790
One drunken evening, Michael told Basil, “I
made you Emperor, and have I not the power

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.190
to create another Emperor if I will?”[5]

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.170
Having a talent for murder by this point,
Basil hatched a plot to kill Michael.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.570
On September 24, 867 CE, Basil enticed Michael
to dinner; while Michael drank heavily, Basil

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.350
made an excuse to leave briefly.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.420
He snuck into Michael’s chambers and jerry-rigged
the lock.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.310
Returning later with eight buddies, Basil
and his co-conspirators hacked at Michael,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.680
cutting off both of his hands before killing
him.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.130
Basil’s position as emperor was now secure.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.130
Basil’s Reign

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.600
During his 19 years as emperor, Basil kept
the ship of state on an even keel.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.360
He oversaw the creation of a set of laws,
known as the Basilika, which governed Byzantium

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.850
until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.650
He also extended Byzantium’s power by forming
alliances with European rulers and establishing

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.460
strongholds across the Adriatic and Mediterranean
Seas.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.570
His greatest gift may have been his understanding
of human motivations.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.700
He successfully navigated difficult court
politics and was able to keep its different

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.120
factions from ever uniting against him.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.630
He also worked at maintaining a good image
with the common man by living piously, providing

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.770
orderly public services and maintaining relatively
light taxes.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.060
Basil died on August 29, 886 CE.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:27.340
He was succeeded by his son Leo VI the Wise.
