00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.260
Eh, it's good,
but Dana Carvey did it first.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.680
"Imagine every morning you wake up,
you can't remember who you are."

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.060
"Your name is M.L. Poug."

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.640
"Sh*t."

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.980
_

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.140
_

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.580
_

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.500
_

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.840
_

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.500
_

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
_

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.940
_

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.640
So if you're a Nolan fanboy,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.500
enjoy the best movie ever made
until The Dark Knight.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.920
Which, I guess was the best movie
ever made until Inception.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.340
Which, according to you all, was the best movie
ever made until The Dark Knight Rises.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.440
Look, he's proved himself
as a great filmmaker,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.260
but you fanboys rate Dark Knight Rises
over Citizen F*cking Kane?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.800
Dark Knight Rises isn't even
the Citizen Kane of Batman movies!

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.880
"Something doesn't feel right.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.300
I think someone's f***ing with me."

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.540
Thrill as Lenny attempts to keep his world in order
in a pre-smartphone era.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.680
"(phone ring)"

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.700
"Who is this?"

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.040
As he utilizes Polaroids,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.140
pen and paper,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.060
"Trust me.
I need to write this down."

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.900
and of course, his tattoos.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.700
They're one part case file,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.480
"Fact 6: Car license SG137IU."

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.060
one part to-do list,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780
and one part lyrics
from a new metal song.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
♫ Memory is treachery! ♫

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.200
Hmm, I wonder which tatt reminds him
to keep frosting his hair every few weeks.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.420
"Yeah, OK. One's fine."

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.300
Prepared to be shocked
by revelations like...

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.300
This guy isn't who he says is.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.280
And he's actually manipulating Leonard.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.140
"Don't believe his lies."

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.260
This girl isn't who she says she is.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.160
And is actually manipulating Leonard.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.340
"I can say whatever the f*ck I want
and you won't remember."

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.740
And shockingly,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.880
this guy isn't who he says he is.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.920
And is actually...

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.500
Manipulating...

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.540
Leonard.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.240
"F*ck."

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.240
"Do I lie to myself to be happy?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Yes, I will."

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.480
GENIUS!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.980
Meet Leonard,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.000
a single-mindedly obsessed white guy
with slicked back hair,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.740
A.K.A., your typical
Christopher Nolan protagonist.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.200
He's a short-term amnesiac
who can't remember anything after his injury.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.040
"Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860
It's about the last thing
that I do remember."

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.960
Except for the details of his conditions
he devloped after his injury.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.840
Hmm...

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.720
"One last thing,
I have this condition."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.700
"Condition?"

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.320
"I guess I've already told you
about my condition."

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.080
"My condition."

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.980
"Because of my condition."

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.960
"I have this condit-"

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.900
"Yeah, I know all about your
f*cking condition, Leonard!"

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.200
He won't rest until he gets revenge
for the death of his wife,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.960
"(gun reload)"

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.000
even though it seems like they didn't have
the best relationship to begin with.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.320
"How could you read that again?"

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.040
"Don't be a prick.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.180
I'm not reading it to annoy you,
I enjoy it."

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.540
"Ouch."

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.220
She's just not that into you, bro.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.160
Return to an era when all the best movies
lied to you until the very end.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240
And experience a twisting story,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.320
told in reverse where you already know
what happens.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440
But keeps you guessing
as to why.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.860
"What the f*ck you talking about??"

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.520
"I don't know."

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.580
Because if you put it
in chronological order,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.600
it just a dude who makes
a really long phone call,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.720
describing what's wrong
with him,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.380
then tricks himself into
shooting someone.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.920
"No!"

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.880
"(gunshot)"

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.760
Brilliant!

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.720
From the Michael Bay for people
who've read a book in their life.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.100
Comes the film that kickstarted
the world's Christopher Nolan obsession,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.920
and made people mildly aware
of his brother.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.620
"You are the director's brother."

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.580
"This is not the first time
you worked together, correct?"

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.620
"Nah, this should be the fifth time
we worked together."

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.100
I am so confused.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.340
