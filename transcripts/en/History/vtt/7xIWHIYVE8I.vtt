00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.330
NARRATOR: Veterans of both
World War II and the Vietnam War

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.170
risked their lives
for their country,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.210
but the way they were
treated by both the US

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.380
government and their
fellow citizens

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.120
could not have been
more different.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.040
A lot of that had to
do with why they were

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
fighting in the first place.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.210
On December 7, 1941, Japan
waged a surprise attack

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.000
on Pearl Harbor.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.210
The US declared war
on Japan, and it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.920
didn't take much to
convince the nation

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.920
to rally around the cause.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.580
The sudden criminal attacks
perpetrated by the Japanese

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.880
in the Pacific
have treacherously

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.420
violated the long-standing
peace between us.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.380
NARRATOR: And when Japan's
ally, Nazi Germany,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.920
declared war on
the US days later,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.080
World War II took on the larger
goal of fighting fascism.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.670
Though there was a draft,
thousands voluntarily

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.420
enlisted to fight, some
even lying about their age

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.710
or illnesses to get in.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.460
The reasons for US involvement
in Vietnam were a bit murkier.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.420
At the height of the Cold
War, America's leaders

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.250
were determined to stop
the spread of communism,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.790
so they threw their support
behind the South Vietnamese

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.750
to prevent a takeover
by the Communist north.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.880
But unlike World War
II, there wasn't even

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.420
a formal declaration of war,
and the majority of Americans

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.120
weren't concerned with the
affairs of the Vietnamese.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.580
But President Lyndon B
Jonson and the powers that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
be wanted a win
against communism,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.250
so the US escalated
involvement, sending over

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.790
2 million troops to Vietnam
throughout the course

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580
of nearly a decade.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.380
In contrast to World War II,
many potential Vietnam recruits

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.540
actively avoided the draft--

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.460
Muhammad Ali one of the
most famous examples.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.290
Hell no, we won't go.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.000
Hell no, we won't go.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.750
NARRATOR: Support for
the troops at home

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.620
also reflected the nation's
attitudes toward the two wars.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.620
World War II propaganda urged
Americans to aid the troops

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.750
abroad in any way they could.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.830
Civilians donated scrap metal
and rubber for equipment,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.460
rationed food and gasoline, and
even grew fruits and vegetables

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.170
in so-called victory gardens.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.670
During the Vietnam War, the mood
at home was downright hostile.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.620
Vietnam was the first
televised conflict.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.330
Footage and photos
beamed every ugly detail

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.790
directly into American homes.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.290
Atrocities against
women and children,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.290
drug use, and chemical warfare.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.040
The images sparked a massive
anti-war movement that demanded

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.880
American troops come home.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.670
[shouting]

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.880
NARRATOR: And here's
where the experience

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.540
of World War II and Vietnam
veterans diverged the most--

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.380
the homecomings.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.040
When Japan surrendered in
1945 and World War II ended,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.210
victorious soldiers
arrived home to ticker

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.540
tape parades and emotional
reunions with loved ones.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.330
After nearly 10 years
of fighting in Vietnam,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.210
the cost and casualties proved
too much for America to bear.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.170
The US finally withdrew
in 1973, and South Vietnam

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.500
fell to the Communist
North two years later.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.920
It was America's
first major defeat,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.670
and the troops bore
the brunt of this loss

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.420
when they returned home.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.500
Many recalled being spat
upon, or called baby killers.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.540
Others felt ostracized
as scapegoats

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.710
for an unwinnable war rife
with dishonorable conduct.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.080
And this led to another
stark difference--

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.210
the way veterans were
treated by the system

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.750
after returning home.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.670
When World War II
soldiers came home,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.380
the Veterans
Administration offered them

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.250
generous education benefits,
and a monthly living

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.420
stipend under the GI Bill.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.500
In contrast, Vietnam
veterans often

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
had trouble receiving
enough compensation

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.790
to cover their living
and educational expenses.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.920
Bureaucracy, red
tape, and cutbacks

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.290
led many to avoid
the VA altogether.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.250
It wasn't until the 1980s that
America began to make things

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.420
right with Vietnam veterans.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.120
A crucial step was
the 1982 dedication

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, DC.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.460
The late '70s and
'80s also saw a rise

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.080
in movies portraying the horror
and heroism of the Vietnam War.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.920
While many films
about World War II

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.120
served as propaganda to
reinforce its necessity,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.540
movies about Vietnam
were more ambivalent

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.120
and reflective, and often
from the perspective

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.040
of surviving veterans.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.290
The box office successes
of films such as "Platoon"

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.500
and "Born On The 4th of July"
signaled that Americans were

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.830
finally coming to understand
and appreciate the men and women

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.170
who served in Vietnam.
