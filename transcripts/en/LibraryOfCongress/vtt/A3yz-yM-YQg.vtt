Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: I'm Karen Jaffe.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.290 position:56%
I'm head of the Young Reader Center,
and I'm welcoming you to the Books

Center and the Center for the Book.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.870
I'd start out by welcoming our
special guests, students from --

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.940

and the Ludlow Taylor
Elementary, all from Washington.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.510
Let's give everybody a hand.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.300
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.230
They are our special guests today.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.770
It's my honor and great pleasure
to introduce Cynthia Levinson,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.020
who is no stranger to
the Library of Congress.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
Cynthia is a writer of
nonfiction books and articles

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
about and for young people.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.970
She's a former educator and
she conducts writer workshops

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.450
and play shops, which I don't
think I know what it is, Cynthia,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.610
but maybe you'll tell
me at some point.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.710
It sounds cool.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.900
As well as presentations like
the one she's doing today.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.950
She has written for respected
children's magazines,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.030
such as Apple Seeds, Calgary,
Cobblestone, Faces, and Odyssey.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.630
Her books include a children's
biography of Hillary Clinton,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.290
entitled Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Do All The Good You Can.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.130
Watch Out For Flying Kids.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.890
How Two Circuses Two Countries

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.480
and Nine Kids Confront
Conflict and Build Community.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.600
We were very lucky to have Cynthia
bringing several of the Israeli

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.320
and Palestinian children
that she wrote

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.280
about to our National Book
Festival several years ago.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.100
People are still talking
about this performance.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.440
It was amazing.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.330 position:56%
We've Got a Job, the 1963 Birmingham
Children's March, published in 2012,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.160
is the backdrop for her newest
book that you're going to hear

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.960
about this morning,
The Youngest Marcher,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.710
The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks,
a young civil rights activist.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.490
While we first met
Audrey in We've Got a Job,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.310
this book focuses specifically
on her role in the event

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.580
and how a nine-year-old girl can
make a difference in history.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.010
One quick bit of housekeeping.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.990
Towards the end of the program,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.340
we will have a question-and-answer
period

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.370
where you can ask questions
of Cynthia.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.920
Please hold your questions till
then and wait for the microphone.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.010
We have several people
with microphones

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.590
who are going to be walking around.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.800
That's why we asked for that aisle.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.040
And if you raise your hand,
Cynthia will call on you,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.510
she'll point in your direction,
and that will let our people

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.500
with the microphone
know who you are.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.510
So now I present Cynthia Levinson.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.910
[ Applause ]

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.520
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: And
this was Karen Jaffe,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.410
the head of the Young
Readers Center.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.140
So I want to thank Karen and
the Young Readers Center,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.150
the Library of Congress,
everybody here,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.210
thank you very much for coming.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.140
Now, Karen mentioned that I'm
going to read to you a book

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.800
about Audrey Faye Hendricks.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.990
Audrey was a real person.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.640
She told you that I
write nonfiction,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.210
that means that the books I write,
I don't make up the stories.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.630
The people and the
events really happened.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.340
The events that Audrey took
part in happened in 1963,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.520
which was 54 years ago, when
Audrey was nine years old.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.620
Is anybody here nine years old?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.000
Oh, then you're the same
age that Audrey was.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.260
Well, think about that
when you hear her story.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.340
Now, she lived in Birmingham,
Alabama.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.540
Does anyone know what the
word segregation means?

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.560
Oh, a lot of people do.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.850
You want to tell me
what segregation means?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.150
&gt;&gt; Me?

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.100
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.370
&gt;&gt; I think segregation
means that -- I forgot.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.670
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Okay.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.970
Well, you know what?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.270
And I just realized, we don't
have a microphone right now,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.000
and that's not fair to the
people who are videoing.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.120
So I'll tell you, segregation
means when people are separated,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.860
they're segregated from each other.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.410
And in Birmingham, for decades and
decades, and in many other places

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.280
in the southern part of the United
States and in the northern part

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.070
where I grew up, people
were very separated.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.830
Black people from white
people in particular.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.270
And that's the story about Audrey.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.450
Now, the book opens, as you'll
see in just a second, when Audrey

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.830
and her mother are cooking
a very special dinner,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.250
some of her favorite things.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.770
I was going to ask you some of your
favorite things but I shouldn't do

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.620
that till we get the microphone.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.420
So we'll wait for that.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.000
So let me start by
reading you the story.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.480
I'm going to move over
here so everybody can see.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.040
I'm glad you can see
that screen too.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:27.150 position:56%
Whenever Mike flew into town, Audrey
and her mama cooked barbecued ribs,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.440
stewed greens, sweet potato
souffle, and Audrey's favorite,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.060
hot rolls baptized in butter.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:44.180
There's a recipe in the
back of the book for them.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.230
Other folks knew Mike
as Martin or Dr. King.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.400
Heard of him?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.210
The Hendrickses used his nickname.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.190
They did the same with
other ministers too,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.340
like Fred Shuttlesworth
and Jim Bevil.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.080
After Mike blessed the
feast, mama expected Audrey

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.130
to keep still during supper.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.260
But when grown-ups talked about
wiping out segregation laws

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.370
that kept black and white
people apart in Birmingham,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.630
she just had to speak up.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.850
Audrey intended to go places
and do things like anybody else.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.750
I want to eat my ice
cream inside Newberry's.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.250
I want to sit downstairs
at the Alabama.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.520
I don't want hand-me-down
schoolbooks.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.300
But stools at the counter,
plush movie theater seats,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.800
books so fresh they
crackle when you open them,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.960
those were for white children.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.190
Hush, says mama, nine-year-old
children should not speak in front

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.270
of company, especially
ministers like Mike, Fred,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.300
and Jim who were bringing
dreams of justice.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.860
Audrey knew all about segregation.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.690
She knew to pay the driver at
the front of the bus and step off

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.210
and walk around to the back door.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.480
Drink from the fountain with
the dirty bowl and warm water .

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.060
Use the freight elevator at
department stores downtown.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.720 position:56%
Front row seats cool water
elevators as white gloved operators,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.100
the law said those
were for white folks.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.980
Every Monday night, Audrey and
her mama and daddy and her aunts,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.040 position:56%
uncles, and cousins joined neighbors
and friends at Fred's church

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.070
for worship, fellowship,
and testimony.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.030
She sang and swayed along
with the movement choir.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.240
Her voice spirited and spiritual.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.150
Black and white together
we shall overcome.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.610
For once she didn't
have to keep still.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.510
Then came testimonies.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.630
White store owners won't hire me.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.460
Ku Kluxers chased me.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.720
Policeman called me names.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.810
The hateful stories
made Audrey squirm.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.540
She tried to tell her
mama, that's not right.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.760
Shhh! How could mama
expect her to hush?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.770
She had to make things right.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.930
But what could she do?

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.700
When Mike visited Fred's church,
thousands of people crowded

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.160
around her to hear him preach.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:31.490
In a voice as taut as steel cables,
as smooth as glass, he intoned,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.940
segregation is morally
wrong and sinful.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.240
That's true!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.700
Fired up, Audrey sat taller.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:46.590
An unjust law is no law
at all, he proclaimed.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.630
Audrey had listened to
Mike explain his plan

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.410
at her supper table
and knew what he meant.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.930
If a law is unjust, disobey it.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.900
Sit down inside Newberry's.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.900
Picket those white stores.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.760
March to protest those unfair laws,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.300
why even marching was
against the law.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.110
Then get arrested.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.130
Fill the jails, Mike exclaimed.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.490
Fill Birmingham's jails so full
the policeman can't squeeze

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.230
in one more person.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.310
Pack cells so tight that policeman
have to quit arresting people

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.720
for demanding their rights.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.500
Audrey just knew Mike's
plan would work.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.010
She twisted in her pew to see
which grown-ups would walk

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.080
down the aisle, volunteer for jail.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.380
But they mostly stayed put.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.180
Eyes staring at their
feet, hands on their knees.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.470
Feet, hands, and knees didn't move.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:50.090
Fill the jails, Mike pleaded,
meeting after meeting.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.930
But heads shook.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.500
All around her, Audrey heard, no,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.580
best not break those
segregation laws.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.510
Bossman will fire me.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.840
Landlord will evict me.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.620
Policeman will beat me.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.540
If nobody protested,
Mike's plan would fail.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.830
Police could keep arresting anyone
anytime for anything forever.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.960
Audrey would never
be able to go places

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.640
and do things like everybody else.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.270 position:56%
One night, Jim announced a new idea.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:28.970
If grown-ups won't do it,
fill the jails with children.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.530
Audrey leaped to her feet.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.360
I want to go to jail, she declared.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:44.820
Mama looked deep and saw that
Audrey's eyes begged, please.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.600
Okay, mama said.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.790
Audrey strutted down that aisle.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.040
She was going to jail.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.860
Two mornings later, she put
on a fresh pressed pinafore

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.900
and shiny Mary Janes
with turned down socks,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.200
protester's got to look nice.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.660
In the meantime, her
daddy bought her a game

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.230
to help her pass the time in jail.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.890
Her mama and daddy took her
by Center Street Elementary

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.030
to tell her teacher she'd be
absent, maybe for a whole week.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.730
Ms. Wells wrapped her
arms around her.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.610
Audrey knew she was proud of her.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.930
She said goodbye to
her grandparents.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.480
You'll be fine, her
grandmother said.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.490
She knew Audrey would
be brave, so did Audrey.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.830
Then her mama and daddy drove her
to the 16th Street Baptist Church

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.420
where the children were gathering.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.320
Even before she reached the door,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:43.680
Audrey heard loud voices
chanting freedom songs.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.400
Inside, hundreds of big kids
called out to friends and crowded

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.500 position:56%
around signs for their high schools.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.590
Parker. Carver.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.250
Her head swivelled.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.830
Where was the sign for
Center Street Elementary?

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.360
She was the only protester
from her school.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.680
The youngest child
in the whole church.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.450
And she knew no one.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.220
Audrey huddled by her
parents in the basement.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.740
But when Jim lined her up
with the others two by two

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.500
and the door swung open,
Audrey straightened up.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.150
She was going to break a law and go
to jail to help make things right.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.790
Clutching a protest sign in one
hand and her game in the other,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.100
Audrey marched out the door.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.070
She stomped and sang, ain't going
to let nobody turn me round,

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.350
turn me round, turn me round.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.560
We're going to sing
that in a little bit.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.160
Half a block from the church, a
white policeman stopped Audrey.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.480
He pointed toward a paddy wagon.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.050 position:56%
Sentence: one week in juvenile hall.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.910
A matron locked Audrey into a day
room with two dozen other girls,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.980
all older, all bigger,
all strangers.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.800
Audrey sat down alone and
slipped the cover off her game.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.220
I told you to sit down,
the matron yelled.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.520
Audrey jumped.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.640
She didn't remember standing up.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.410
The matron dragged her
to a dark, empty room.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.250
When I tell you to do
something, you do it,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.520
she commanded, or I'll
leave you here.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.380
Trembling, Audrey quietly followed
the matron back to the day room,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.760
put away her game, laid
down her head, and cried.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.130
Jail was harder than she thought.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.350
And she wasn't fine after all.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.020
By evening, Audrey
was hungry and tired.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.310
For dinner, soupy,
oily, tasteless grits.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:05.030
At night, a bare mattress with
one thin sheet for a cover.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.020
Audrey and her cellmates
were led outdoors

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.330
into an empty concrete pen
surrounded by high prison walls.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.040
The older girls talked together.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.910
Audrey wondered what her
classmates were doing.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:22.890
Ms. Wells would be
keeping them busy.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.090 position:56%
On another day, Audrey was sent to a
huge room and told to sit in a chair

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.730
that was so high, her feet
dangled above the floor.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.150
Four white men glared at her.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.720
She'd never talked to
a white man before.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.910
Are you against America,
one demanded to know.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.340
No, sir, she answered politely.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.820
What do you talk about at
those meetings, another asked.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.810
Our freedom.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.720
Why did you march?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.850
To go places and do
things like anybody else.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.710
What was wrong with that?

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.520
Every meal time, Audrey
stared at greasy grits.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.730
She could barely spoon them into
her mouth, let alone swallow them.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.670
Every night, the cot's
wire springs jabbed.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.200
Every morning, she had nothing to
do but sit alone with her game.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.770
In the afternoons though, more
kids crowded into the day room.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:31.020
Some days, many of them
arrived sopping wet.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.550
A girl explained that firemen aimed
powerful hoses at the children.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.270
Surging water spun them off
their feet and down the street.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.660
They got up and kept
marching anyway,

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.630
until they too were sent to jail.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.230
By Audrey's fifth day in detention,

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.960
the police couldn't
squeeze in one more person.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.570
We filled up all the rooms!

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.980
We filled up all the rooms!

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.760
Audrey practically jumped up
and down, she was so proud.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.420 position:56%
Watching television in the day room,
she saw black people stroll straight

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.340
into stores and restaurants
like they belonged there.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.300
No one else could be sent to jail.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.430
Everything had changed.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.020
After seven days, Audrey went home.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.800
Her mama and daddy
wrapped their arms tight

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.850 position:56%
around her, washed the jail off her.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.920
And for dinner, hot
rolls baptized in butter.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.690
Two months later, the City

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:40.430
of Birmingham wiped segregation
laws clean off the books.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.760
Audrey licked her spoon
clean at Newberry's counter,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.560
like everybody else, black and
white together, like we belong.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:18:00.550
There's a picture in the book
of Audrey as a real little girl.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.520
This was actually taken
when she was 11 years old.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.250
So she was two years
older in this picture then

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.540
when she went to jail for a week.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.420
I talked with Audrey,
I interviewed her.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.340
And here's a picture of
her when I talked with her.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.860
And I have pictures too from
the real children's march.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.320
This next picture -- well,
this one might be okay.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.930
This is a picture of the church,
the 16th Street Baptist Church,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.680
that the children walked out of.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.270
Audrey was not alone, as you saw.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:52.160
Eventually when they filled up all
the rooms, somewhere between 3000

00:18:52.160 --> 00:19:01.640
and 4000 children went to jail in
Birmingham in a week in May 1963.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.180 position:56%
And Audrey was the youngest of them.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.330
Here's a picture of some of them.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.570
The next picture is
just a little bit scary.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.130
Remember I read that the firemen
aimed powerful water hoses

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.430
at the children?

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.480
Here's a picture of the firemen.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.800
And at the end of that hose
right there, the other end,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.320
there are young people who
were being hosed off their feet

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.510
and down the street.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:34.190
And here's a picture of a high
school girl getting arrested.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:43.560 position:56%
And here's one of the day rooms
that the girls were in, like Audrey.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:50.040
But let's go back to Audrey.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:56.020
She and all those other kids
were protesting segregation.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.550
If you were going to
protest something,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.630
what would you protest about?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.820
Oh, I see a hand right back there.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.190
Yeah, can you give
them the microphone?

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.100
What would you want
to protest about?

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:17.010
&gt;&gt; I would protest about
that if I would protest

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.650
that segregation is not
even fair for nobody.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That is true, segregation is not
fair for anybody, I agree with that.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.310
Who else would like to say what
they would like to protest about?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.610
Would you like to tell us?

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.080
Wait till you get the microphone.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.570
&gt;&gt; I think everybody should
do marching everywhere.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.420
&gt;&gt; Everybody should be
marching everywhere?

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.720
&gt;&gt; Every year.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.020
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Every year.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.230
Well, that could be.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.160
There's been a lot
of marches recently.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.870
One more. Yes, right here.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.520
Yeah, one more.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That no animals should be harmed.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.050
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: That
no animal should be harmed,

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.160
that's something else
to protest about too.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.560
I agree with you about that.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.250
Now, you know that
the kids made signs.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.210
I have some here, not
that they made,

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.180 position:56%
but there's some protest signs here.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.190
This is one that a kid made in
another book talk that I gave.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:28.130
If you were going to.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:35.190
If you were going to make
protest signs, raise your hand

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.720
if you have an idea -- let's
think, think for five seconds.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:52.040 position:56%
If you wanted to write a protest
sign, what would you write it about?

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.920
Would you like to come
up and tell me what you'd

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.940
like to write your
protest sign about?

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.590
Yeah? You want and let
somebody else go first, okay.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.460
Would you like to come up?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.760
Come up and tell me.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.990
What you like to write
a protest sign about?

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:19.680
&gt;&gt; I would like to
write a protest sign

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:28.000
about that girls should have the
right to play in a boys' league.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.520
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Girls
should be able to play --

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.370
my handwriting is not
very neat right now --

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:43.630
in a boys' league, right.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:51.050
Wait right here because you
are going to wear this sign.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:57.790
There goes my pen.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.690
Can you wait right here?

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:08.100
Okay. Who else would like
to tell us a protest sign?

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:19.130
How about back there in the green
shirt with the orange sleeves?

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.170
What's your protest sign?

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:27.090
&gt;&gt; Segregation is a sin that
people shouldn't follow.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.390
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Okay, how

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:33.320
about people shouldn't follow
segregation, is that okay?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:44.560
People should not follow
segregation.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.010
All right.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:53.630
And let's take one more person.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.320
You all right?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.940
Can you stand right here?

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.680
Great. I think I see two
hands waving right there.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.290
Yeah. Come on up.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.950
Right over here, come
right down the aisle.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.230
Good job.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.950
&gt;&gt; I would say freedom for all.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.250
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Freedom for all?

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.550
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.850
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Okay,
we're going to write down here

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.370
in my messy handwriting, freedom --

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:42.470
maybe I can write this
in -- for all, all right.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.420
You want to wear the sign?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.890 position:56%
Good. Now, do you remember that
Audrey and the other kids also sang?

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.800 position:56%
All right, can you stand right here?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.500
Great. I'm going to play you
a song that the kids sang.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.790
I started to sing when I
was reading the book to you.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.000
And then we're going
to sing it together.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:25.390
Okay, here it comes,
I think, or maybe not.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.250
I think the audio is not working.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:34.740
So let me sing it --
because it looks like --

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.880
all right, I'm going to sing
it for you and then we're going

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.090
to sing it together, okay?

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:46.840
Ready? Ain't gonna let
nobody turn me round,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.420
turn me round, turn me round.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:57.690
Ain't gonna let nobody turn me
round, gonna keep on walking,

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:03.000
keep on a marching,
walking into freedom land.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.670
Hey, you know this song, don't you?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.740
Okay, everybody stand up.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.710
Just stand right where you are.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.580
And -- okay, but you got to listen.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:27.020
I can't talk louder than you.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:34.050
Hold on. So you all are going
to -- you're going to stand up.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.740
You're all going to
march in place like this.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.830
And you are going to march up
and down right in front of us.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.370
You're going to go in that
direction and then turn

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.670
around here and come here.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.970
And we're all going to sing.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.270
Are you ready?

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.570
You march in place.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.130
And you march up and
down right here, okay.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.430
All right, here we go.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:27:01.130 position:56%
Ain't gonna let nobody turn me
round, turn me round, turn me round.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:08.960
Ain't gonna let nobody turn me
round, gonna keep on walking,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.840
keep on a talking,
marching into freedom land.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.050
Whoo! Good job!

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.810
Okay, everybody down.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.700
Thank you, marchers!

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.020
Yay for marching!

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.490
Very good.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.590
You can keep those and
you can go back and sit

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.580
down with your school, okay.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.950
Thank you.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.250
Great marching.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.010
Now, of course, you
should be in jail, right?

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.310
Like Audrey.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:46.220
Isn't it amazing that she did that?

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:52.270
Well, Karen told you
that I wrote the book,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.790
but I didn't draw the pictures.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:01.820
A woman named Vanessa
Brantley-Newton drew the

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.270
illustrations for the book.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.100
Would you like to see
how she did it?

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.840
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: So this is --

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.380
I don't know if the
sound will work or not.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.460
But you'll be able to see her.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.990
This is a part of an
interview that she did

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.840
with the New York Times
about two weeks ago.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.990
And this is clips from
that interview.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.070
If you don't hear the sound,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.290
it's okay because the
two of them are talking.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:38.250
But you'll be able to
see her drawing pictures.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:48.040
No, the sound is not
there for some reason.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:55.220
In this part, Vanessa is explaining
that Audrey was nine years old

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.900
and that she had pigtails.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.000
And Vanessa said that
she had pigtails also.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.490
And she is saying, Vanessa
is saying to the person

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.660
who was interviewing her,
that when she was little,

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.430
she had pigtails too.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:37.910
So she says in here, I
get Audrey, I get her.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:42.270
And the interviewer
also asked Vanessa

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.620
if there were any photographs
of Audrey to work from.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.520
There was that one photograph
that I showed you of Audrey,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.350
that was the only one that she had
from when she was a little girl

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.060
that she was able to share with me.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:05.090
But Vanessa said she
liked Audrey's sassiness.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:12.310
Don't you think was
a little bit sassy?

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.600
Now, Vanessa used to
be a fashion designer.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.400
She was trained in clothing design.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.150
And so when you take a
look in the book closely,

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.920
you'll see that everybody
is dressed very nicely.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.280
And you remember where Audrey
said that she had to look nice?

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.270
She put on her Mary Jane's,
her black patent leather shoes

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:40.070
with a strap and her white lace
turned down socks and a dress?

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.370
That's what she did.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.660
And all the girls went
to jail looking nice.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.170
In fact, one of the
people I interviewed

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.370
when I was doing research
for the book said

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:57.350
that she took her special going to
church underpants with her to jail,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:03.680
because she knew she
needed to look really nice.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.960
So can you see Audrey
coming together?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.730
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: I'm
not good at drawing at all,

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:24.160
but I think Vanessa did a
wonderful job in the book.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.150 position:56%
And while Vanessa was being
interviewed and drawing this picture

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:36.880
of Audrey, people were
emailing her through Facebook.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.620 position:56%
There were emails from people in New
Zealand and Australia and France,

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.710
and they were saying that they
liked her drawing so much.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.010
It was really thrilling.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.630
I wasn't in New York but I
watched this while it was happening

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.670
on my telephone.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.120
Because it was on Facebook.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.340
In fact, if you go to my website,
you can find out where it is.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.840 position:56%
And she reads part of the book also.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.170
And then you'd be able
to hear the audio.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:14.650
There, there is Audrey.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.440
So I've read you the story and
we've marched and we've sung

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.480
and you've seen how the
pictures were drawn.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.780
Who has questions?

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.800
And remember, I'm going to call on
you and then we're going to wait

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.620
for you to ask your question
until the microphone comes.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:38.120
Yes, I see a hand right here,
somebody holding a red jacket.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.660
&gt;&gt; How long did it
take to make the book?

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.760
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: How long
did it take me to make the book.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.260
It's a little hard to say because,
as Karen said, I wrote another book

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.370
for older kids before this one,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.170
and I spent about three
years writing that book.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:58.190 position:56%
And then it took me probably another
year to write this book I guess.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.260
But this book kind of depended
on my doing the other book.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.830
I had do the other one first
before I could do this,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.080
because it's harder to
write shorter books.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.230
It's easier to write longer books.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.570
So I wrote the long book first
and then I had to spend more time

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.640
so I could pare it
down to a shorter book.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.070
Let's get a question over here.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.300
Yes? Wait just one second,
wait till the microphone comes.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.070
&gt;&gt; Do you get to choose
your illustrator?

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.830
&gt;&gt; That's such a good question.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.090
I did not choose the illustrator.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.960
The publisher chooses
the illustrator.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.640
But she's a wonderful illustrator.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.320
And she's illustrated
in about two dozen books

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.510
and she's also written
a couple of books.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.640
She had a book that came out just
last year called Mary Had a Little

00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:00.140
Glam, about a little fashion
plate, which is very cute.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.470
And she also illustrated
a book about --

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.920
do you know the song,
We Shall Overcome?

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.750
We shall overcome.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.900
She illustrated a book about
the history of that song.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:19.590
And so I think she did just
a great job with this book.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:26.060
And I did get to -- we didn't talk
while she was illustrating it.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.360
The book was all done.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.660
We didn't talk about it.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.600
But I could email through
our publisher.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.980
Because she had questions,
like what did Audrey look like?

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.020
What did her parents look like?

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.550
What are the food, the dishes,
that they served the food in,

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.380
what did those look like?

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.310
What did Audrey's house look like?

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.130
And I knew those things because I
had visited Audrey at her house,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.430
so I knew all about that.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.030
She wanted to know what
the church looked like.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.510
She wanted to know what the
police cars looked like,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.280
all kinds of things like
that, and I could tell her.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.610
Do you have one more question?

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.700
Did you have one more question?

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.000
Yeah, okay.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.740
Why don't we let him ask
a follow-up question,

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.760
then we'll go to somebody else.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.650
&gt;&gt; So you visited her
house in Alabama?

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.860
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: I did, I went
to Birmingham, Alabama three times

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.460
to do research for the book.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.090
Well, all right, yes, right here.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.050
Yeah? Microphone.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:32.880
&gt;&gt; Was Audrey more sassy
or her mom was more sassy?

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.420
Because her mom seems sassy.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.800
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
Was Audrey protesting

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.610
or was her mother protesting?

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:45.150
&gt;&gt; No. Was Audrey more
sassy or her mom more sassy.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.970
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Oh,
was Audrey more sassy, oh.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.210
You know, I never met her mother.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:55.150
I tried to meet her mother,
but her mother was very sick,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.370
and so I couldn't meet her.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.670
So I can't say.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.610
But I will tell you that
they were both very brave.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:09.530 position:56%
Because her mother was very, very
active in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:16.450
But you know, between us, my
guess is that Audrey was sassier

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.780
than her mother, that's my guess.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:27.040
Yes, what would you like to ask?

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.930
&gt;&gt; Is Audrey still alive?

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.500
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Audrey is not
still alive, I'm sorry to say.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.840
She died of cancer in 2009.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.360
It was very, very sad.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:46.410
Whoa, whoa, that got
a lot of reaction.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:51.050
Oh, goodness, that
caused a lot of commotion.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.500
Let's see some more questions.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.410
What would you like to ask?

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.000
We have another question.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.690
Somebody needs to ask a question.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.950
&gt;&gt; When is her birthday?

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.050
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: When
is her birthday, you know,

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.000
I don't know when her
birthday is, I forgot to ask.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.090
But I am in touch with
Audrey's sister Jan.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.090
Jan still lives in Birmingham.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.930
And in fact, it was Jan
who gave me the recipe

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.610
for hot rolls baptized in butter.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.230
So I could probably find
out when her birthday is.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:33.400 position:56%
I think we need somebody right here.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.150
&gt;&gt; Did you make the book?

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.020
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: No,
that's a good question.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.470
So the book is actually made by
a company, a publishing company.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.030
And they helped me write the book

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.280
and they helped Vanessa draw
the pictures with the book.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.500
And then they have these pages,
these like electronic pages.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.200
And the book was actually
printed overseas.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.450
I don't know where,
someplace in another country.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.180
And it gets printed over
there and all put together

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.800
and the cover gets put on and
then it gets put in big boxes

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.740
and everything and it gets
on a ship and it comes

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.980
over to the United States, and then
they send it out like to bookstores

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.820
and the Library of Congress
and things like that.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.170
I think back over here.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.520
Oh my gosh, there's
so many questions.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.210
Okay. I'm glad we have
lots of time for questions.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.960
How much time do we have?

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.290
&gt;&gt; Was it fun?

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.790
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Was
it fun to write the book?

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:43.540
You know, I felt honored
to write the book.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:59.170
It was interesting and informative
and sad and scary and revealing.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.510
And I felt proud to be
able to write the book.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.390
Because, hold on, I actually
would like to explain this.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.530
Because when I was doing research
for the book, I talked to Audrey

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.010
and I talked to her sister Jan.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:19.830
In fact, I talked to dozens
of people who were children

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.980
who broke the law on purpose
in Birmingham and went

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.450
to jail, just the way Audrey did.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:33.140
The others were all older than
she was, but they had done it.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.840
And they were willing to
share their stories with me.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.170
And I was very honored
that they would talk to me.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.000
So that's how it felt
to write the book.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.800
Let's go back over to this side.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.030
Yes, have you asked a question yet?

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.330
I don't think so.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:54.040
Okay, sorry, thank you.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.650
&gt;&gt; When did she die?

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.970
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
When she died, in 2009.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:02.540
Oh, how old was she?

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.540
Well, you know what,
it's a math problem.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.840
Figure it out in your head.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.140
Don't tell us.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.440
When you're ready, you
can raise your hand.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.390
She was nine years old in
1963 and she died in 2009.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.880
So you can figure out
how old she was.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.710
Let's go over here.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.910
I think right there.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:27.140
&gt;&gt; How did you get
the idea of the book?

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.450
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: When did
I get the idea of the book?

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:36.280
I got the idea of the book
when -- now, Karen said --

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:45.620
Karen told you that I wrote
articles for magazines.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.740
And I was writing an article for
a magazine, a children's magazine,

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.890
about music in the
civil rights period.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:57.120
Like We Shall Overcome and Ain't
Gonna Let Nobody Turn me Round

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.520
and This Little Light of Mine.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.330
Do you know This Little
Light of Mine?

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.160
Great, another wonderful song.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.880
And I discovered this
story about Audrey.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.480 position:56%
And I hadn't really known it before.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.430
I knew that people had gone
to jail in Birmingham in order

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.660
to protest segregation,
but I didn't know

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.540
that it was children who had gone.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.850
And when I learned it was children,

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.750
I decided I'd better
write this book.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.040
So I did. Okay, I think
a question right here,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.560
and then we'll go back
to the other side.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.520
&gt;&gt; Who made up the song?

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.820
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Who made
up the song, I don't know.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.600
Does anybody know the song Ain't
Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round?

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.800
That song, does anybody know?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.040
I don't know who wrote that song.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.320
That sounds like a
good research project.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.420
Can you get on the Internet
when you get back home

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.820
or at school or a library?

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.010
Yes? This sounds like a
great thing to look into.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:04.090
And you could let us know, okay.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.800
Yes? Here.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.720
&gt;&gt; Why did we have segregation?

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.490
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Why
did we have segregation,

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.880
there's a good question.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.170
For no good reason, for
no good reason at all.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.290
White people I hope
used to believe --

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:38.270 position:56%
and I wrote the book for older kids.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:45.020
And in that book, I explain that
white people at the time thought

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.390
that black people carried diseases.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:56.240
There were a lot of reasons,
like trying to keep black people

00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.200
from having good jobs and
getting a good education

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.050
and living in nice houses.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.110
There was no good reason for it.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.680
There were just a lot of
reasons people told themselves.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.480
I think we need to go over here.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.820
We have a marcher who
has a question.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.780
Wait for the microphone.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.650
&gt;&gt; Is there still segregation
in some places?

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.550
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Is there
still segregation in some places.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.000
Well, I grew up in Ohio.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.910
And in Ohio, we didn't have the
laws the way there were in Alabama,

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.850
but we had a kind of segregation.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.620
Karen and I actually
grew up together.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.020
We went to the same school.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:46.160
And we had -- I'm going to give you
a big fancy Latin term: day facto.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.980
It sort of means like, in fact.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.550
In real life there was
actually segregation,

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:58.690
but there weren't laws
requiring it It just happened.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.230
So is there still segregation?

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.730
I now live in Austin, Texas.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:07.710
And we don't have laws about
segregation there either.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:12.020
But it so happens that there
are a lot of black people

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.430
who live in one part of town.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.420
There are a lot of Hispanic people
who live in another part of town.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.270
And there are white people who
live and there are Indian people

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.430
and there are people
from Bangladesh.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.670
And they kind of group together.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.210
So we don't have segregation
that's required,

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.670
but it does sort of happen.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.860
Do you see that where you live?

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.830
No, good, I'm glad you don't.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.880
It's much better that way.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.710
Let's see, let's go over this way.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:48.190
I think right there,
yeah, right there.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:52.480
Let's just wait for the microphone.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.580
&gt;&gt; What other books did you write?

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.030
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Well, Karen
mentioned that I wrote a book

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.990
about kids who are in a circus,
Jewish and Arab Muslim kids

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.990
who perform in a circus together.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:09.300
And I wrote a book about Audrey for
older kids with other kids in it.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.280
And I wrote a biography
of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.960
And I have another book
coming out in September

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.810
about the U.S. Constitution.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.220
So we have one more question.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.840
Okay, we have time
for one more question.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.090 position:56%
Oh, my golly, you know what, I'm
going to close my eyes and I'm going

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:31.430
to go like this and I'm going
to point in the very back.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:33.660
Yeah, you, right there.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.480
&gt;&gt; Why did the girl
want to go to jail?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.030
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson: Why
did she want to go to jail?

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:40.890
Why do you think?

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:44.180
Do you know why she
wanted to go to jail?

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.900
Let me ask one person
if they can explain.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.820
Do you know why she went to jail?

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.270
Do you know why she went to jail?

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.570
Can you say?

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.170
Okay, yeah.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.950
Right here.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:02.330
&gt;&gt; Because you weren't
really allowed to protest,

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:08.040
and she protested about it, and
that's why she got put in jail.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.340
&gt;&gt; Cynthia Levinson:
And she wanted to go

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.180
so they could fill all the jails

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.810
so that nobody else could be
jailed if they broke the law.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.570
And so that's why she went to jail.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.480
Thank you very much.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.850
Thank you for coming.

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.510
And I think we're all done.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:33.230
[ Applause ]

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.690
Hold on just a second.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:41.170
We are being asked -- we're being
asked to sing one more time.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.280
Do you know the words?

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.800
To sing Ain't Nobody
Gonna Turn Me Round?

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.240
You think you know it, all right.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.690
You ready?

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.110
One, two, three.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:03.670 position:56%
Ain't gonna let nobody turn me
round, turn me round, turn me round,

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:10.530
ain't gonna let nobody turn me
round, gonna keep on a walking,

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:16.170
keep on a talking,
marching into freedom land.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.470
Whoo, good job!

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.550
[kids singing] You're
doing a much better job.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:29.910 position:56%
We can just keep doing this all day.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:41.200
Keep on a talking,
marching up to freedom land.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.130
Thank you!

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.800
