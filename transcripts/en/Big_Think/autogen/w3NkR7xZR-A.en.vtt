there are two really different ways of
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.000
there are two really different ways of
looking at it and one is to look at

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
looking at it and one is to look at
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.799
looking at it and one is to look at
people's mood or state of mind they live

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
people's mood or state of mind they live
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.160

reaction when they think about their
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.349
reaction when they think about their
life we know now that these two are

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
life we know now that these two are
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.730
life we know now that these two are
really quite different and they they're

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
really quite different and they they're
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040
really quite different and they they're
sensitive to different factors so the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
sensitive to different factors so the
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840
sensitive to different factors so the
thing that make you satisfied - not

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
thing that make you satisfied - not

people have very little idea you know
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619
people have very little idea you know
how their tastes will change they're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
how their tastes will change they're
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229
how their tastes will change they're
susceptible first of all to what we call

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
susceptible first of all to what we call
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.529
susceptible first of all to what we call
a focusing illusion and that is makes it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
a focusing illusion and that is makes it
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330
a focusing illusion and that is makes it
virtually impossible to think straight

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

you're thinking about it so the mere act
of thinking about something makes it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
of thinking about something makes it
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569
of thinking about something makes it
more important that it's going to be so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
more important that it's going to be so

be living in California and you know you
think oh you'd be a lot happier well no

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
think oh you'd be a lot happier well no
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630
think oh you'd be a lot happier well no

increased by 30% you think a lot no you
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609
increased by 30% you think a lot no you
know it wouldn't so just about

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
know it wouldn't so just about
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.010

everything that people think about they

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
everything that people think about they
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010
everything that people think about they
exaggerate its importance if you look at

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
exaggerate its importance if you look at
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.590
exaggerate its importance if you look at
life satisfaction at what makes people

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
life satisfaction at what makes people
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.520
life satisfaction at what makes people
satisfied with their lives

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530
satisfied with their lives
 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.340
satisfied with their lives
you know most of what we know it has a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
you know most of what we know it has a
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.789
you know most of what we know it has a
lot to do with people's goals when we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
lot to do with people's goals when we
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.429
lot to do with people's goals when we
ask people how important money is to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
ask people how important money is to
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679
ask people how important money is to
them when they're 18 and we look at

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
them when they're 18 and we look at
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.380
them when they're 18 and we look at
their income at age 45 we find that the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
their income at age 45 we find that the
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440
their income at age 45 we find that the
people who said at age 18 that money

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
people who said at age 18 that money
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440
people who said at age 18 that money
didn't matter to them very much at 8:45

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
didn't matter to them very much at 8:45
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690
didn't matter to them very much at 8:45
money doesn't matter to them very much

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
money doesn't matter to them very much
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.969
money doesn't matter to them very much
so there the correlation between their

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
so there the correlation between their
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.889
so there the correlation between their
income and their satisfaction with life

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
income and their satisfaction with life
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.920
income and their satisfaction with life
is really very low the people said that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
is really very low the people said that
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870
is really very low the people said that
money is very important to them those

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
money is very important to them those
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999
money is very important to them those
who made a lot of money are really quite

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
who made a lot of money are really quite
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.830
who made a lot of money are really quite
satisfied with their lives and those who

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
satisfied with their lives and those who
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.960
satisfied with their lives and those who
didn't make a lot of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
didn't make a lot of
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.510
didn't make a lot of
really quite miserable so goals are very

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
really quite miserable so goals are very
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.900
really quite miserable so goals are very
important to life satisfaction
