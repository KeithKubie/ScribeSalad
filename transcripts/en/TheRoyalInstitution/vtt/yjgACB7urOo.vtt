00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.400
Here at the Ri recently we've been
having a lot of fun with smoke rings.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.740
I built this giant cannon for this year's
CHRISTMAS LECTURES

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.300
and I thought, why stop at smoke?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.140
Smoke rings, fire rings, bubble rings,
they are all vortex rings.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.900
Vortex rings are formed when a fluid, which can be a liquid or a gas,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.760
is forced through a hole.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.900
This forces the fluid to curl back
in on itself, which creates a distinctive

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.580
ring shape called a torus.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.900
Fluid dynamics can help us understand
why the vortex rings form,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.400
which is why I've put together
this plastic bag DIY cannon.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.720
When you fire a smoke ring, you force the
smoke from inside the cannon

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.180
through the relatively still air of the room.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.220
To start with, the smoke is basically
a fast-moving ball.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.400
As it emerges through the opening,
the smoke on the outside of the ball

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.680
is being slowed down because of
the friction between it and the edges of the hole.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.480
Once it leaves the cannon, there
is friction at the interface

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.360
between the smoke and the air in the room.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.560
This means that you get smoke in the
center of the ball

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800
moving faster than the smoke
around the edges,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.260
and so the smoke on the edges
starts to curl around

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.820
and form a mushroom cloud.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.040
As the smoke reaches
the back of the cloud,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.000
it's drawn into the faster moving
current of air in the centre,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.220
it's this flow pattern that
eventually causes the ring to form.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.040
The amazing thing about smoke rings

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.920
is how far they can travel without dispersing,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.020
they hold their shape for a really long time.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.440
The spinning flow pattern actually
reduces the impact of friction between

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.160
the smoke and the air in the room.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100
This is similar to how it's easier to roll a
ball across the floor

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.280
than it is to slide one.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.600
This means that even though vortex rings
can travel a really long way,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.080
they don't lose much kinetic energy as they go.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.420
So I can use an air cannon like this one
to knock over unsuspecting plastic cups.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.840
You can also blow out candles

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.020
And if you add butane, you can do this...

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.980
The same basic physics can be shown
with bubbles underwater.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.860
So here, we have our underwater
bubble ring set up,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.040
in place of our air cannon we have
the water bottle you can see in here.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.740
Underneath we've got those jars
just for structural support.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.181
To help us visualize the rings
we have these bubbles

00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:12.234
and to force the water out of the opening we have this handy bat

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.920
which we like to keep in the prep room
for emergencies.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.580
You might have seen videos of dolphins
and whales making bubble rings underwater.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.580
They somehow move their fins
to create the vortex,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.780
and exhale to create the bubbles.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.640
A vortex ring also forms
when a small mass of liquid

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.080
moves through a larger body of still liquid.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.740
The friction at the interface between the two fluids

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.400
causes the vortex ring to form.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400
Think about raindrops falling on a lake.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.540
Under each one a vortex ring is
actually forming,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.600
it's just normally we can't see it

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.990
Thank you for watching!
