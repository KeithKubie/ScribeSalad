MANDY WAITE: "I've developed
an application,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.670
[? 12 man months. ?]

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.480
But today, I had difficulties
to set up the IT strategy

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.630
related to the maintenance
of the source code.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.921
Taking into account the amount
of releases of Google App

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.722
Engine Python, do you
have any advice?"

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:13.620
FRED SAUER: OK.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.540
If I remember right, I think
you were sort of suggesting

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.390
the person who asked this
question, they asked a few

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.210
more questions, and I think you
said it looked like they

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.395
were maybe running Python 2.5.

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:25.465
MANDY WAITE: Exactly.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:26.240
FRED SAUER: Yeah.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.290
So App Engine has a deprecation
policy on all of

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.070
our production services.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.600
I believe it's one year.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.420
And that's kind of our guarantee
to you that we're

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.210
not just going to change
APIs on you.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.280
That when we bump up the next
version of the application,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.180
your application is going to
continue working, the APIs are

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.970
going to behave the way
that they're expected.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.870
Having said that, there
are incremental

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290
changes that we make.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.670
Just like the Python
language is--

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.380
Python 2.5 is not as common
anymore as Python 2.7.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.550
At some point you need
to make a switch.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.690
It should certainly not
be a regular burden.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.730
I have applications that I
deployed more than a year ago,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.720
and they're still running
just fine.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.380
That's the experience of
most of our users.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.390
Usually what we find is that
developers are making changes

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.160
because they want to take
advantage of new APIs, or new

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.290
capabilities, that
we've launched.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.360
There have been probably a
couple of cases where we've

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.180
sort of had a changing, not a
breaking API change, but a new

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.490
version of a capability that
we've made available, and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.810
that's from Python 2.5 to 2.7
there are some differences.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.030
And Python 2.7 provides a lot of
great features that weren't

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.130
possible in 2.5, like
the ability to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.446
handle concurrent requests.

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:02.910
There's many language
preferences.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.100
We also had to change from the
Master/Slave Datastore to the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.370
High Replication Datastore,
which has huge advantages.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.550
The Master/Slave Datastore had
regular maintenance periods.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.170
There's still a few users on
that, but I believe the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.870
majority of users
are now on the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.820
High replication Datastore.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.250
Just a much better experience.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.210
When you commit your data, it
gets committed to multiple

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.410
data centers synchronously.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.700
When a data center goes down,
you don't even notice it.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.460
And that sort of improvement
is sometimes worth going

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.910
through the effort and making
sure that the way you're

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.680
executing queries is
still compatible

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.100
with the new version.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.940
But you have plenty of
time to make that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090
change on your schedule.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.080
So what we find that developers
do, is they sort of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.910
use one version of the SDK,
they're developing locally,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.300
they go through a couple of
releases on their own.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.370
And then there's kind of a
break, maybe once a quarter or

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.330
so they say, you know
what, let's catch up

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.410
to the latest features.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.860
Let's see what we
can incorporate

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.060
that we haven't yet.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.740
And then they'll kind of
bump up the version.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.383
And so you should sort of
naturally flow along with the

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:11.490
App Engine releases.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.270
MANDY WAITE: It's important to
also stress what we mentioned

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.080
earlier, experimental features
are always likely to change

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.530
from one release to another.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.096
So if you are using an
experimental feature, you'll

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:24.870
probably get enormous benefit
just from using that feature.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.680
But you may have to adjust your
code when we release a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.780
new version, just to keep
up to speed with it.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.710
Hopefully that's not a big
impact, though, not something

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.890
that's huge.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.000
FRED SAUER: No, it's generally
a polish around the edges.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.510
When it's in the experimental,
we're still trying to collect

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.400
feedback from the community,
find out new use cases, maybe

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.890
there's ways that we can improve
the API a little bit.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.570
And so you've seen that, for
example, with the Search API

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.440
from the very early
days to now,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.870
there's a couple of changes.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.440
But generally things have just
gotten better and all of our

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.125
users have been quite
happy with that.

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:02.490
MANDY WAITE: All right,
excellent.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.860
OK.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.310
So we've got two more
questions here.
