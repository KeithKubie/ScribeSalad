Narrator: 2016.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:09.467
NASA's CASSINI SPACECRAFT
IS 12 YEARS INTO ITS MISSION

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:10.968
TO STUDY SATURN,

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:14.167
THE SECOND LARGEST PLANET
IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.467
ON APRIL 8, CASSINI IS TASKED

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:23.400
WITH IMAGING
THE PLANET'S OUTER RING,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.400
A BAND OF ICY DEBRIS KNOWN
AS THE "F" RING.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.934
Aguilar: THE "F" RING IS A THIN,
LITTLE RING

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.567
THAT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE BRAIDED WIRE

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:36.868
THAT GOES AROUND THE BIG,
MAJOR, FAT RINGS OF SATURN.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.334
MATERIAL IN THE "F" RING
IS SO FINE

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.501
THAT IT'S ALMOST
LIKE FROZEN SMOKE.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.734
Narrator:
WHEN THE CASSINI TEAM

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.601
AT NASA's JET PROPULSION
LABORATORY

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.067
STUDIED THE IMAGES,

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.634
THEY DISCOVER
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:56.000
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
JUST PUNCHED CLEAN THROUGH

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.167
AND LEFT A HOLE BEHIND.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.534
IT LOOKS REALLY WEIRD.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.100
IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE
THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.234
IN THE "F" RING.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.200
IN THESE IMAGES,
PART OF THE MATERIAL

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.734
THAT'S BEING PULLED OUT
FROM THE RINGS

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:09.834
LOOKS LIKE IT'S POINTING
TOWARD PANDORA,

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:12.601
SO IT MIGHT BE PANDORA
BEING MISCHIEVOUS

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.834
AND CAUSING THIS DISTURBANCE.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:18.167
Narrator: THE IMAGES SEEM TO
PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.501
THAT PANDORA'S
GRAVITATIONAL PULL

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:24.601
HAS DRAGGED MATERIAL
OUT OF THE "F" RING,

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.834
BUT SCIENTISTS CALCULATE

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.133
THAT THE 70-MILE-LONG MOON

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.868
COULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:32.868
FOR THE MASSIVE DISTURBANCE.

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:34.634
Baines:
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MATH,

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.667
WE FIND OUT THAT PANDORA
WAS JUST TOO SMALL.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.100
ITS GRAVITY IS JUST
NOT BIG ENOUGH

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.734
TO CAUSE THIS KIND
OF INTERRUPTION,

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.667
SO HERE, IT SEEMS TO BE
JUST AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.968
IT'S ACTUALLY OFF THE HOOK.

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.367
Narrator: THE CASSINI IMAGES
PROVIDE NO FURTHER CLUES

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.868
TO THE ORIGIN
OF THE GIANT CHASM.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:53.767
IT SEEMS A MYSTERY OBJECT

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.767
TRAVELED THROUGH THIS REGION
OF SPACE

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.300
AND THEN DISAPPEARED.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.133
WHATEVER CAUSED THIS
SIMPLY ISN'T CAPTURED ON CAMERA.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.534
IT'S GONE BEFORE
CASSINI CAN SPOT IT.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:07.968
SOMETHING BIG, REALLY BIG,

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:11.133
CREATED THIS HOLE,
BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT.
