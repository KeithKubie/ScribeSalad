00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 Elex follows a very open policy. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560
 Job title does not stop you from moving forward. 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.920
 This is achieved through the spirit of initiative, passion and professionalism. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.480
 I started my relationship with Elex through Clash of Kings. 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.720
 In which players can create communities 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.560
 With members of other alliances, 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.160
 Thereby increasing their strength and expanding Alliance areas. 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.920
 You can also fight against alliances and other players in different countries. 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.040
 &lt;i&gt; Clash of Kings is a truly global product 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 Real-time translation is therefore a very important feature. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.840
 We use Google Translate to translate our games. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.800
 After players edit their language lists, they automatically show changes. 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.280
 Then we store the most frequent sentences, 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.960
 We use it to speed up the translation process. 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.160
 &lt;i&gt; Clash of Kings is not only available on smartphones &lt;i&gt; but also on tablet devices. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 Through our work on game development, we focus on how to develop the contents of our games 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.600
 According to brands and styles. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.200
 Because Elex is distinguished, 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 It opposes many of the old trends in game production, 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680
 So we learn a lot of new things. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 The Android feature is an open, easy-to-access system. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.800
 It also allows us to specifically handle customer management 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
 And works very effectively in the management and support of internal games. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.480
 The "Ratings and Reviews" function is very useful, 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.920
 Where we can get useful feedback from game users 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480
 This is very important to us. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.200
 Elex began its work when we were five students at Beihang University. 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.200
 We dreamed of exporting Chinese creativity to the world market. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 Elex's globalization plans have been summarized primarily in breaking out of the mainland, 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.680
 And enter the Southeast Asian market. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.840
 The cost associated with user acquisition in this region is relatively low. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.560
 A large number of these users use Google or the primary Android system 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920
 They help us progress in our journey. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
 The second phase was entering the markets of Europe and the United States. 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.760
 Google's market share is very large in these two regions, 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240
 Including high-value users. 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.600
 It also has the right resources to help with this type of marketing. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600
 The third stage is the most difficult - 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 And how to consolidate our foundations in the most difficult markets, 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680
 Such as Japan and the Middle East. 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.400
 We are now in this third phase. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 We've collaborated with Google in many ways. 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.520
 We've launched in-app promotions in many areas to help us increase revenue. 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480
 We have also established many gift card events, 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.480
 Giving players free of charge the same fun as playing for a fee. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240
 This has increased the number of users playing for a fee. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 We've worked with Google 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.400
 For a lot of activities in the weeks and festivals of the games through the Internet and offline, 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.840
 This has allowed players to learn about other fun aspects of gaming experience 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.800
 And increased user participation. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.720
 Our goal is to become a global gaming company. 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 So we need to be successful on the basic Android system. 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.880
 We are working to achieve this in our own way through creative ideas that help us realize our dreams quickly.
