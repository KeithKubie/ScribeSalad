[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.990
KARISHMA SHAH: All right.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.220
Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm honored to be here with you.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.290
And as you know, tech
overlays all industries.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.940
Because of the
attendees here today,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.400
the diversity of the lineup,
we already know that.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.620
And one of my
favorite quotes is,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.380
"When you see a glimmer of
madness in people's eyes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.050
when they speak about what
they do, pull up a chair

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.910
and let them transport
you to their world."

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.640
And we're about to be
transported to four worlds

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.277
through these
phenomenal women today,

00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:35.860
and we're going to
kick off with that.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.620
So we'll just go down the line.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.682
Tell us about your world
and what drives you.

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:42.390
HILLARY HARTLEY: Hi,
I'm Hillary Hartley.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.540
I live in San Francisco,
but I sort of commute

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.140
to DC a little bit.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.980
I am a federal employee.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.420
Hello, bureaucrat.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.130
And honestly anyone that would
like to be a bureaucrat, this

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.850
is a great time.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.539
Your government
needs you, especially

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.580
if you're a technologist.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.370
So I'll be back there,
just a little plug.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.180
But what has driven me has been
a combination of my family,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
both my parents and
now my nuclear family,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.140
and also just I was hooked.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.710
Really my first
job out of college

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730
was with the team that
runs arkansas.gov, so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.140
the state website for Arkansas.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.540
And it was late 90's.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.350
We were putting services on
the web for the first time.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.360
Possibilities kind
of seemed endless

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.136
in terms of what we could
do to make your life easier,

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:38.760
or your life easier,
and my life easier

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.430
in terms of interacting with the
government, and I was hooked.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.550
So I've been kind of
an outsider, not really

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.020
a govie, about 20 years.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860
But I have been serving
the federal government

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.730
for the last four years.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.230
And I can't see myself
really doing anything else.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.340
But five years
ago I sort of took

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.311
a sideways journey with
some friends in the Bay Area

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.810
who we've been going to South
by Southwest for several years

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.940
and weren't quite getting
the same thing out

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.949
of that conference
anymore, but we still

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.730
longed for that community.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.690
So we thought, well, can we
convince a bunch of people

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.950
to just go somewhere with
us and have a sort of South

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.270
by Southwest, Burning
Man-type experience.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.630
And so we ended up
looking into renting out

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.062
a hotel in Palm Springs.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:32.520
And doing the math on exactly
like how many tickets will we

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.150
need to sell to be
able to do this.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.860
So we thought,
OK, if we can sell

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.750
400 tickets we can
buy out this hotel

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.880
and have all our friends
come to the desert

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.497
and it will be amazing.

00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:41.080
And we did it.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.704
It sold out in 48
hours, and now we're

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.370
doing it for the fifth
year this summer.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.320
And someone coined
it Burning TED,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.620
which is probably accurate.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.200
It's a pool party, but with
people like yourselves.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.700
With amazing, creative,
entrepreneurial, not just

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.890
technologists, but
really a wide spread

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.450
of folks that have
found this community.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.200
So that's Yes and Yes Yes.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.270
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: Wow
that's pretty amazing.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.160
Can I get a ticket
for this year?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.600
HILLARY HARTLEY:
Yes, they're on sale.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: Hi, my
name is Aniyia Williams,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.210
and I'm the founder
and CEO of TINSEL.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.720
We make tech jewelry for
women, and this is really

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.460
driven by a couple of things.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.910
My personal passion
for creating things.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.752
I have a lot of hobbies.

00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:27.960
Actually I should say I used
to have a lot of hobbies

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960
because I don't really
have a lot of time to do

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.290
but so many things today.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.250
And it really also was
spurn out of the fact

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.190
that I've noticed that
consumer electronics are not

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.070
designed with women in
mind, and we deserve better.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.200
I'm actually wearing
our product right now.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.370
It's a necklace that actually
has fully integrated headphones

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.950
in it, so.

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:50.780
DIANA TRUJILLO: Hi, everyone.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.450
My name is Diana Trujillo, and
I immigrated from South America.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.930
And right now my job
is to explore space.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.170
My job is to try to figure
out, with an international team

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.010
of scientists and engineers, if
there was ever any possibility

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.300
of life on the surface of Mars.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.450
And I love my job.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.230
My job as a Deputy
Project System Engineer

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.339
and as a Deputy Team Chief
for the Engineering division

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.830
means that I am in charge of
the technical integrity of what

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.530
we do with the Mars
Curiosity Rover.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.780
The Mars Curiosity Rover
is the biggest robot

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.020
that we have landed on
the surface of Mars.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.185
He has laser beam
eyes, nuclear power.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.110
It's like you're thinking
about Marvel or something

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.600
and we just actually landed
this ginormous thing.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.240
I love it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.430
I love my job
because every day I'm

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.910
part of the few people that
actually get to see pictures

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.350
from a different world, right?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.760
I'm among the first 20 people
to see an image that is just

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.860
getting transmitted from Mars.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.890
And I think that I just
love the fact that space

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.310
is such a romantic area because
you think about the fact

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.860
that you're trying to discover,
not as special individual that

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.600
was a genius and somehow made it
to work in the tech industry is

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.550
actually as humanity.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.130
You're trying to find
out what's out there.

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.770
You're trying to understand
things that nobody actually

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.300
understands.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.020
And I think that it requires
a lot of different backgrounds

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.320
and it requires a lot of
different ways of thinking

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.180
because nobody has seen it.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.330
There so many times at work
that I see the picture of Mars

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.060
and I'm like, I did
not expect the Rover

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.230
to get stuck like that.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.040
Or I didn't expect the arm to
move the rock that we touch.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.590
We were sure that rock
was ginormous plate,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.410
and it turned out to be
actually not that big.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.510
And so, yeah.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.099
So that's kind of
what I do right now.

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.140
KARISHMA SHAH: Thank you.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.410
Kim?

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.390
KIM HUNTER: Thanks for
having me here today.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.330
My name is Kim Hunter, and I
had some similar experiences

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.990
in Washington.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.670
I was in DC for 10 years.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.330
I went there to
change the world.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.800
I felt like politics
was the way to do it.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.800
I started to see some breakdowns
in how to make change,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.980
so went and traveled
the developing world.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.140
Found social entrepreneurship
and individuals

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.181
that were really building
businesses and thinking

00:06:28.181 --> 00:06:29.650
how to solve big problems.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.380
Landed in San Francisco
four years ago.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.170
Started to work with
impact-driven startups

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.420
and met Aclima.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.330
And so Aclima is
actually an Earth shot.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.430
It's basically, how can
we explore the world

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.240
that we live in today and really
turn the signals of the Earth

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.820
into data that we can use?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.530
So we deploy environmental
and sensor networks that

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.150
map air quality in real-time.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.380
We do that in buildings.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.150
There's actually an Aclima node
in the back of the room here.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.290
We're deployed across
Google's portfolio.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.790
We also map the
outdoor environment.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.060
So the idea is we can provide
hyper-local, high-resolution

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.452
data about air occlusion
and air quality,

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.410
so that we can better
represent the environment

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.839
and have a healthier
people and planet.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.880
And then I'm also really
passionate about women's

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.780
leadership.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.470
Two years ago I started Women
Catalysts with Lindsay Jean

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.480
Thompson, who is here today.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.520
And we really wanted
to create a community

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.700
to support women to take action.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.660
To ask for help.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.770
To give help.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.980
And we just celebrated our
two year anniversary and over

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.957
a $35,000 raise for local
nonprofits this year.

00:07:33.957 --> 00:07:34.915
KARISHMA SHAH: Amazing.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.190
When I spoke to Kim earlier to
prep for this panel she said,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.500
my work makes my soul sing.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.170
And I thought that was just a
phrase to share with you all.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.390
To find work that
makes your soul sing.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.210
So I'm going to ask the question
that's on everyone's mind now.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.360
Deana, how do you get
to work on something

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.770
literally out of this world?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.752
Had you always wanted
to work for NASA?

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:03.710
DIANA TRUJILLO: I have.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.200
So, yeah, my story is
a little bit unusual.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.290
So I'm originally from South
America and I came to the US

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.140
when I was 17 by myself.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.380
I only had $300 in my pocket.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.790
I didn't know any English.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.400
I didn't know anyone, but
I had this crazy dream

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.590
that I wanted to work in
space and explore the unknown.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.550
But that dream kind
of collided with what

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.600
the dream of every
Hispanic, my people.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.260
My Hispanic people's
dream is to come to the US

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.240
and hopefully be a maid.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.480
And hopefully get
enough money as a maid

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.330
to send back to your country
and take care of your own.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.690
So those two things that
clash in my mind I still

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.180
managed to somehow
become a maid,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.780
and take care of somebody else's
house, and get enough money.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.450
But it still felt like
there's something missing.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.870
I feel like I'm meant
to do something else.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.450
And that feeling of
being uncomfortable,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.390
that feeling that maybe a
lot of you guys feel of I

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.530
am meant to do something
else with my life,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.480
was what pushed me
to get two more jobs

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.660
and then put myself
through English classes.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.310
And after that go to
university and get a degree

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.032
on Aerospace Engineering.

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:30.336
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.470
Thank you, guys.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.950
I think that after that I had
my first break, which was I

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.100
was doing great at school,
and just side note.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.880
I was doing great at
school and in Colombia they

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.140
grade you with numbers.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.050
But it's like, you're doing
great, you're 90 or 100.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.590
And I kept looking at my
transcripts and I'm like 4.0?

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.790
This is terrible.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.290
My dad is going to kill.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.720
He's not going to
understand what's going on.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.020
And I didn't understand until
I walked into somebody's office

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.900
and they're like, no, you should
apply for the Honor's Society.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.840
I was like.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.700
OK.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.910
And at that point was when
everything make sense to me.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.720
I had not realized that I
was doing so great in school.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.300
And somebody gave me
a break and the break

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.080
that I got was somebody
said, hey, go to this website

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.490
and apply for this internship.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.040
It was a NASA
Academy internship.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.130
And so the NASA
Academy is a program

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.570
that around like 3,000 people
apply, 18 people gets elected.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.180
And the program is
super, super competitive

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.510
because what they do is
that once you get selected,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.470
they fly you to every
single NASA center

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.240
to meet the center directors.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.840
They fly you to places
where you meet the CEO.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.280
You meet astronauts.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.220
And I don't know what
happened, but they selected me,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.502
and I was the first Hispanic
woman on that group.

00:11:01.502 --> 00:11:07.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.529
And so yes, so I
got to meet everyone

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:11.820
that had the job that I wanted.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.680
And in fact, I went
from not having

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.400
the option of understanding
what I could do with my life

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.450
to thinking that I
wanted everyone's job.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.932
I want that job
today and tomorrow.

00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:21.640
And it's like, OK, I
don't know what job,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.069
but I want all of them.

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:25.110
KARISHMA SHAH: I feel like
you have enough energy

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.690
to take everyone's job.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.220
DIANA TRUJILLO: So, anyways.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.590
What ends up happening
with that is I

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.870
met everyone, but here's one
thing that was interesting.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.350
Nobody looked like me.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.870
There were all men.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.560
There were all white men.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.900
There was no Latina
or Latino in it.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.010
Not even that, right?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.644
And they were all 50 and 60.

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:48.560
And they were like, one
day, you'll get there.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.970
Ten years of work.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.090
I'm like, are you serious?

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.670
I have to wait 10 years
to be what I want to be?

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.750
So anyways, fast
forwarding that Latin thing

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.800
that I have of survival
and fighting and finding

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.900
the thing that I
need to do, I found

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.300
my way of getting the courage to
actually apply and be like, OK,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.170
maybe if I get denied
it will be fine.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.490
At least I applied.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.540
And low and behold,
everything worked out.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.080
And I got into JPL.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.940
And just to jump to the punch
line, there's no way on earth

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.610
that I ever thought that
this Latina girl who

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.180
didn't know any English, who
had no idea what she was going

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.290
to do with her life, will
end up as senior management

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.440
of the technical aspect
of a Rover on Mars.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.434
So I want you guys to realize
that my story is something that

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:43.350
could be happening to
you, or to your parents,

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.190
or to your family.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.410
Or to many of you
maybe you actually had

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.842
to save a lot of money to
even be here to hear us speak.

00:12:49.842 --> 00:12:52.050
And the point is, it doesn't
matter where you're from

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.460
or what background you have.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.810
Clearly, I was able to do it.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.482
And if I can, so can you.

00:12:57.482 --> 00:13:03.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.210
KARISHMA SHAH: So what
about for everyone else?

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.820
You're in tech, but did your
industry find your or did

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.780
you find your industry?

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.154
How did you develop
your passion?

00:13:11.154 --> 00:13:13.950
Hillary, you said you
will always be a govie.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.730
HILLARY HARTLEY: Yeah,
it's in my blood now.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.300
A colleague on our team coined
the phrase, impact junkie.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.370
That's really who
we are recruiting.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.400
That's who comes
and serves with us.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.890
So even if it's maybe adjacent
to government in the future,

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.009
I'll always be a govie.

00:13:32.009 --> 00:13:33.050
KARISHMA SHAH: I love it.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.836
Aniyia.

00:13:33.836 --> 00:13:36.210
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I would
say that for me, it really

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.200
just goes back to
my desire to create.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.020
My background is
actually in music.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.450
I'm a classically
trained singer.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.140
I worked in nonprofit in
the arts for a little while.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.200
And I started working in tech
because my husband's a software

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.360
engineer, and he got
recruited to work

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.910
at a company in San
Francisco, and we

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.100
decided-- we were in DC
at the time actually--

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.590
and decided we were just
going to quit our jobs,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.980
and move to San Francisco.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.580
And I kind of fell into tech.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.210
And me starting
TINSEL was really

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.880
because I wanted to solve a
problem that I felt like I had,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.140
which was digging
headphones out of the bottom

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.050
of my bag every day and
being so annoyed by that.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.120
And untangling
them all the time,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.390
and losing them,
and buying new ones.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.000
But also feeling like the
options that were out there

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.130
didn't really suit me.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.700
And I got that crazy
idea that maybe I

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.610
could be the one to make this
thing after I went and looked

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.954
to try to find it and buy it.

00:14:37.954 --> 00:14:39.870
I thought it spoke to
the fact that no one was

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.680
trying to make the products
that I wanted to have.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.460
And so that was a real
driver for me for sure.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.160
KARISHMA SHAH: And you said when
you go to factories in China,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.900
you're not amazed
that people aren't

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.960
making these products because
you're the only one there.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.876
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
that's definitely true.

00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:57.630
I think that it also
does speak to when

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.080
we talk about representation
and diversity.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.600
The lack of diversity
at the kinds

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.150
of companies that get to
make products like these.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.830
When I go to China or even in
the parts around here, when

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.770
we get to see these
hardware companies

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.560
the stakeholders, the big
decision-makers in terms

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.860
of the direction of how
these products are made,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.930
women aren't often with
the seat at the table.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.360
And so it's not a big
shocker that the products

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.740
aren't made with us in mind.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.880
I'd like to change that.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.910
KIM HUNTER: Well, I went
to a Washington, DC at 18.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.520
Born and raised in
Birmingham, Alabama.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.640
My dad was an
HIV/AIDS researcher.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.190
So I was doing AIDS marches at
eight years old in Birmingham,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.890
Alabama, and became
just so conscious

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.640
of social justice issues
and the need for us

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.270
all to be active in our world.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.060
And I was also a big
fan of The West Wing.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.960
So I had it in my mind that if--

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.270
this is like dating me a bit.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.390
But I wanted to be CJ Cregg.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.850
I was like, I want to be
White House press secretary.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.820
And at 18 I'm going to go to
George Washington University.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.070
I'm going to get a degree
in Political Communications.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.527
I'm going to intern at the DNC.

00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:13.860
I'm going to work in the Senate.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.460
I'm going to build my way
up to be at the White House.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.640
And I started to do that.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.280
And I got on this
ladder and I think

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.712
that the reason I
bring this up is

00:16:24.712 --> 00:16:26.670
because I think there's
semblances between this

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.920
and what other women
can experience.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.320
I got in this linear
ladder in which

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.190
I would go from this
internship to this job.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.140
And I was going to start
climbing the ladder

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.970
to get to this point.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.290
And I started to feel around
25 something didn't feel right.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.190
I was like, do I really want to
be White House press secretary?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.100
Is this how I'm going to really
make a change in the world?

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.830
And I started to try and
listen more to myself.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.090
And also had to sort of
let go of some of the pride

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.309
or some of the expectations
that I let others put on me,

00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:02.850
or that I would let
other people down

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.710
if I walked away
from this career

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.930
and started to
explore my passion.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.950
And around 28 I
started to think,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.470
I think I need to take
some time and figure out

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.420
what is my calling.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.980
And so at 28 I quit my job,
sold everything, got a backpack,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.050
and just hit the road.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:27.329
And I just let myself
live and pick up

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.480
on what I really wanted.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.310
And when I moved
to San Francisco,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.200
I was going to be a consultant.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.920
I was like, I'm going
to pivot, so to speak,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.980
and take my communications
background from DC

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.450
and work with startups.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.760
And it was tough.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.570
I Airbnbing my
apartment to make rent.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.310
I made a mixture of
lentil sausage and tomato

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.490
every week to eat at
like the lowest budget.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.430
But I was rebuilding a
network, so yeah, it was tough.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.820
I got off this ladder
and I started afresh.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.470
But I had this
wealth of foundation,

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.550
wealth of information and
experience that I could apply.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.000
And I worked hard and it was
tough, but eventually started

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.470
to make connections,
build community,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.150
and now four years
later you know

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.060
I wasn't expecting
to be where I am.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.310
But I think opening
myself up and not

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.760
having this tunnel vision
really made the world a lot

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.908
more colorful for me.

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:33.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.660
KARISHMA SHAH: And on the
topic of things being hard.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.440
Aniyia, starting a
company is no easy feat.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.870
Tell us about the challenges
in growing TINSEL.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.290
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.300
Everybody likes to
say hardware is hard.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.310
I hate it when people say that.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.240
Everything is hard.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.371
In fact, I think I'm going to
answer that question in just

00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:55.120
a second, but I kind
of want to, because I

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.310
feel like we're
already galvanizing

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.160
around this theme,
that it's hard,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.830
but if you work hard
then you can get there.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.630
And there's truth to that, but
it is also a lot more nuanced.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.430
There is also
something to be said

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.180
for access and opportunities,
which I'm sure we'll

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.530
talk a little bit more about.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.030
Hopefully we'll
have time for that.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.530
But I would say
that I acknowledge

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.020
that I was in a really,
really fortunate position

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.240
when I started TINSEL.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.250
So I would say that three
things made that possible.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.840
I'm answering that question now.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.660
One of them is that
I had been working

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.000
at a startup for a few years.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.730
Started there because, like
I said, I quit my job in DC,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.010
came to San Francisco,
and I was going

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.880
to actually start my own
thing like a Etsy shop,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.050
actually, making wigs.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.060
One of my hobbies
is making wigs.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.190
And so I was like,
oh, this will be fun,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.820
but I did I didn't
know anyone here.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.275
So I was like, I also
do want to meet people.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.400
And it ended up happening
that I got an opportunity

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.730
to work at the startup called
Voxer as an office manager.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.530
And I was way
overqualified for the job,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.430
but I was like, it's part time.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.952
It's easy.

00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:03.160
I'm going to meet new people.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.570
The company sounds cool.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.320
Sure.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.850
And so very quickly
after I started there,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.530
there was no lack of things
that they needed help with.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.940
And I just would jump in
and start working on things,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.949
and helping solve
problems, and made my way

00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:16.990
through the organization.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.480
So after about three
years of working there

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.860
I was running the
marketing team.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.020
I was on the senior
team of the company.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.530
And so that obviously was
recognized by the leadership

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.840
there.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.330
When I had this
idea for TINSEL, I

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.917
was actually going and having
a conversation with the CEO.

00:20:33.917 --> 00:20:35.500
And I was telling
him that I was going

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500
to leave because I was
ready for a new challenge

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.350
and I didn't know what it was.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.590
And I was like, I want
to give you a heads up.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.400
I'm going to leave.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.390
I'm not really sure what
I'm going to do next,

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.300
but I do have this
idea and I actually

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.249
wanted to ask you if you know
any industrial designers.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.790
Because I have this
thing in my head.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.140
I need someone that can
help me visually get what

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.850
I'm thinking out of my head.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.950
And he made an
introduction to his friend.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.020
His friend basically,
in that conversation,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.230
told me if you want to build
hardware, you need money.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:07.900
You can't make something out of
nothing with a physical thing.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.760
And so he's just like,
you need to go back

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.680
and ask Tom for money.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.880
He needs to invest in this.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.281
And I'm like, OK.

00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:14.780
All right.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.780
And so I did actually
end up convincing

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.170
Tom to give me the
money to help see if it

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.620
had legs to get it started.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.310
So that was the
first enabling thing.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.920
I just happened to have
worked with someone

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.810
who had the resources
and believed in me.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.620
I had that
relationship with them

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.470
that they would
take that bet on me.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.200
The second thing was I mentioned
my husband's a software

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.800
engineer.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.730
He worked at Yammer.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.020
Yammer got acquired.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.810
We got enough money
to have some savings

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.910
that I could take the
risk of quitting my job

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.162
and trying to do
this thing full-time.

00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:46.870
And then I'd say the
third thing was just

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.680
a shit ton of creativity
and resourcefulness

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.430
that got me to where I am today.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.260
And so going out and
needing more money.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.900
Hardware is expensive.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.660
And fundraising for it
is a huge challenge.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.490
We actually did
do a crowdfunding

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.640
but even to get to the
crowdfunding campaign you need

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.250
so much money just to do
the product development,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.590
to bring the team on, to
make sure you can actually

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.750
realize this thing.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.480
And it was just a real struggle.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.880
And so I feel like,
in my opinion,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.870
I don't think that
investors in this area

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.590
really value hardware, or
fashion, or women-focused type

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.190
of companies.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.200
But that's OK.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.360
I think that you just have
to think about the fact

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.120
that there's many ways
you can skin a cat.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.140
And that has kind of been a
theme of growing this company.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.260
Is like trying to figure
out how you can do more

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.200
with less and other ways
that you can get around

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.930
a system that is
not made for you.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.450
So that is what I
would also drive home

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.710
alongside the hardware.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.420
Because yes, the shit is hard.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.850
But you definitely
have to remember

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.300
that someone telling
you no isn't always

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.860
the end of the road.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.170
You could try to find another
way to get in that door.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.974
Go around like the back or sneak
in the window or something.

00:23:05.974 --> 00:23:10.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:11.780
KARISHMA SHAH: So
clearly, adapting

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.970
to change is kind of a
theme that's evolving here.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.460
Another theme that's
come out is your identity

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.180
is always evolving.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.990
So how much is work a
part of your identity,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.770
and what else makes
up your identity?

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.782
Hillary?

00:23:25.782 --> 00:23:27.240
HILLARY HARTLEY:
Work has very much

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.680
become a part of my identity.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.030
I think, probably similar
to some other startup

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:37.760
founders, 18F, we always
had a startup mentality.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.410
We were the scrappy little
team inside a big bureaucracy,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.110
and we always kind of thought
of ourselves as a startup.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.050
And started with 10 people,
and quickly grew to 20, and 50,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.920
and now we're 200 people
across the country from DC

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.300
to San Francisco.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.940
And that has definitely
been my third kid.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.060
I have two human kids
that I love very much.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.710
But that team and that
effort has absolutely

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.900
been mine my third baby.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:13.290
And it's a lot of work, but
it absolutely both fills me up

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.360
and takes away as well.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.860
But it's absolutely sort of
become part of my identity.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.950
And I think a huge part of
that has been being part

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.290
of the leadership of that team.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:31.360
And also being kind of a leading
organization, a leading team,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.680
something that's been in
the spotlight, because there

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.760
has been so much talk about
just the tech ecosystem

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.640
over the last four to eight
years at the federal level

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.940
between 18F, USDS, the
Presidential innovation

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.030
Fellowship.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.120
And so I've taken
it very seriously

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.410
to be one of the folks that
gets to sit on this stage.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.050
Whether it's here or
at any other conference

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.480
or any appearance.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.320
And be my true self.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.810
And be a woman that wants
to connect with folks.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.980
Be a lesbian that wants
to connect with folks.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.450
Be sort of just who I am.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.630
And I think that that
has been supremely

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.280
important in terms of attracting
the similar kind of folk

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.540
to our team.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.400
We do have a pretty vibrant
gay, and lesbian, and trans team

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.830
just in our small
200 person team.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.676
And our female to male ratio
isn't what we want it to be,

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:33.300
but it's better than
the tech industry.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.840
I think at one point
it was 30%-40%.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.940
And the tech industry has
spent a billion dollars

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.620
on this diversity problem.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.540
We're not figuring
our way out of it

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.990
by spending a lot of money.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.480
It's just not happening.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.781
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.200
Networks matter, access
matters, relationships matter,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.629
mentor ships matter.

00:25:54.629 --> 00:25:56.170
There are companies
that are starting

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.400
to figure out that magic mix
of data science, so some of it

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.360
is tech.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.780
So that you can get into the
wells and get into the pools

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.140
that you want to get into, but
then mentorship and interview

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.330
style and all that
kind of stuff.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:15.550
And so I think just that
piece of my identity I've

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.637
been really fortunate it's
been allowed to be out there

00:26:19.637 --> 00:26:21.220
and flourish as well,
which has been--

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.330
KARISHMA SHAH: And
hopefully others

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.204
are able to follow a
similar path because you

00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:26.890
were mentioning the last
thing Obama did, would you

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.100
like to share?

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.270
HILLARY HARTLEY: Oh, yes.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.430
So I'm representing today.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.540
This is the Presidential
Innovation Fellowship.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.890
It's our little track jacket.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.410
Everybody's got to have
a track jacket, you know.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.910
Code for America
has a track jacket.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.760
We were like, we
need track jackets.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.490
So this is the PIF track jacket.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.460
So yes, actually the
Presidential Innovation Fellows

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.050
have been a catalyst really.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.110
They started in 2012 under the
Chief Technology Officer Todd

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.950
Park, and then Megan Smith
followed him, and really kept

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.210
the torch going.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.350
And now through huge
bipartisan support,

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.130
literally everybody
voted for it.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.624
It was called the TALENT Act.

00:27:02.624 --> 00:27:04.540
I can't remember exactly
what that acronym is,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.130
but it's the government.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.100
But the TALENT Act has now made
the Presidential Innovation

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.550
Fellowship a permanent
part of government.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.390
And it was literally
the last bill

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.670
that President Obama signed
as he was in the holding

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.930
room waiting to go out on stage
and pass the baton to President

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.510
Trump.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.550
So we were very fortunate
to get that signed.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.520
Yes, it's a big deal.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.360
A lot of people going a heroic
last mile to get that signed,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.750
but it is now part of
the legislative code,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.207
and you can be a PIF too.

00:27:34.207 --> 00:27:36.040
KARISHMA SHAH: We're
at about three minutes.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.087
So anything for identity?

00:27:37.087 --> 00:27:39.420
Otherwise there are a couple
of questions we can get to.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.764
ANIYIA WILLIAMS:
Yeah I just want

00:27:41.764 --> 00:27:43.930
to say that I think that
there are three things that

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.350
shape identity in my eyes.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:52.390
The things that I do
as well as who I am.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:53.240
I am a black woman.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.850
There's no denying that.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.070
I wear that in a
very visible way,

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.780
and it obviously
impacts the way that I

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.910
have interactions in the world.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.270
And then the
choices that I make.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.640
Including those to
become a mother.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.900
I have a small child
and that has really

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.870
formed a new aspect of my
identity in the past year.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.530
Handling, wrangling,
all of the things.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.560
Being a mother,
building a company.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.054
It's real.

00:28:25.054 --> 00:28:26.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:28.750
KARISHMA SHAH: Diana?

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.250
DIANA TRUJILLO: I
think that I spend

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.670
a lot of my time
trying to figure out

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.887
how to find my identity.

00:28:35.887 --> 00:28:37.720
And I think that I made
a couple of mistakes

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.261
that I wanted to
share with you guys.

00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:42.520
Sometimes you think that
what you do is who you are,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.660
and that has nothing
to do with it.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.900
And I just had discovered
recently really

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.050
as I'm pregnant now and
I have a kid at home,

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.370
and my identity is everything.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:58.290
Where I come from, what I
do, my family, how I behave,

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.400
what I think, how
I speak, my accent.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.380
All of those things
is my identity.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.850
And I think that
trying to separate

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.600
those things as you are coming
to the office, it's a bad idea.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.690
Actually it's a much better
idea to bring all of that chaos

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.500
to the office.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.600
Because that's when you
think, wait, I saw my kid

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.807
actually playing with that.

00:29:14.807 --> 00:29:17.140
So we probably can do something
like this with the Rover

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.140
when it does this thing.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.600
I literally have
done those things

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.390
where you could think there's
no way I could compare

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.690
my kids laughing about the
wind to try and to figure out

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.390
that's a bad idea to use
the arm when it's so windy.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.100
And so I think that
that's my message.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.980
My message with respect
to your question

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.720
is, don't separate your things.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.070
Don't try to hide
certain things about you.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.790
Just bring the whole
chaos to your office

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.412
and figure it out on the fly.

00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:43.870
KIM HUNTER: Yeah
and I'll just add.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.240
We interviewed a woman for Women
Catalysts a couple of weeks

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.670
ago.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.628
Her name is Wendy Chen.

00:29:47.628 --> 00:29:50.800
She was a record store
owner in San Francisco,

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.430
and then built the iTunes
Store from physical to digital.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.130
And then she now is an
artist making knots.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.800
And her main message
was, give yourself

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.220
permission to explore who you
are, and what your passions,

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.600
are and what you want to do.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.000
Because bringing all of
yourself and allowing

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.480
yourself to do that is one
of the most important things

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:10.999
you can do.

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.040
KARISHMA SHAH: I love it.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.210
OK, go ahead.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:13.900
ANIYIA WILLIAMS:
I'm sorry, I just

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.430
want to say one
more thing before we

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.380
go is that to all the
women here in this room,

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.040
we were talking
about this backstage.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.230
I think it deserves
to be said, which is

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.880
that you deserved to be here.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.470
In fact, you deserve to be
in any room that you're in.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.970
Do not let anyone question your
experience, your perspective,

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:40.510
the treasure that you
bring to any conversation.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.680
You absolutely
deserve to be there.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.138
Remember that.

00:30:44.138 --> 00:30:47.102
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:49.034 --> 00:30:50.700
KARISHMA SHAH: I'm
going to end with one

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.920
quick rapid-fire
question down the line.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.750
15 seconds each.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.000
What does your life look
like 10 years from now?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.606
Are you in the same industry
or is it OK if passions change?

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:01.980
We're going to
start at that end.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.480
And also just leave
us with a nugget

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.130
of knowledge about your world.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.020
KIM HUNTER: Yeah,
well 10 years ago I

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.170
didn't think I'd
be sitting here.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.170
10 years from now, I'm not
going make any promises.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.710
I'm going to see where it goes.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.670
I'm looking forward to
growing Women Catalysts.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.100
Like Aclima is doing a lot
of exciting work right now.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.130
Going to continue to build that.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.980
And my nugget of advice would
be something that I actually

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.730
started to put into
practice just actually

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.000
in the last couple of months
was when you get wrapped up,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.750
and you're on the passion track,
and you're on the chaos train,

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.700
I really encourage
you to try and develop

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.670
some time in the morning
to find some stillness

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.230
and listen to yourself.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.180
Think about how you
want to approach

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.520
your day, how you
want to end it,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.800
how you want to
interact with people.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.330
I do it by throwing the i
Ching actually every morning.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.830
Google it.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.830
It's interesting.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.850
It gives me that four minutes
before I start my day to tune

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.510
in.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.620
And that makes me a tremendously
more effective leader,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.330
and brings a lot more joy
and clarity to my life.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.527
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.860
DIANA TRUJILLO: I think that
in 10 years from now for me

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.850
I have two goals.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.290
One of them is I want to get
rid of that stereotype of what

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.690
Latina women should look
like and what we should do.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.190
We should stay at
home, have babies.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.000
That's not going to happen.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.470
I am pregnant, but
that's not why.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.660
So I think that I want
to fight that and in 10

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.220
years from now the
way that I feel

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.780
like I will be
fighting that is by,

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.060
like you said, having
representation.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.560
I see myself being mission
manager of the mission that's

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.320
going to take humans to Mars.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.200
And I hope to be in that room
and have some kids that say,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.183
I want to be her.

00:32:43.183 --> 00:32:47.047
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.150
I think that the
nugget of advice

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.140
that I have for you guys
is how I feel and I believe

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.941
the word confident means.

00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:58.190
Sometimes I see the guys
walking in and they just say,

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.990
we're going to do this.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.240
And it's like wait, you
haven't asked everyone else.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.020
And I wonder sometimes
like, how do you

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.330
have that confidence,
walking in, and saying this,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.310
and not even second guessing?

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.800
And I think that I don't
believe that that is confidence,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.300
actually.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.440
I think that the word confidence
is the ability of you keeping

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.140
a positive mind that
you're going to figure out

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.590
what's going to happen.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.070
It's not about walking in
and dominating the room.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.620
It's about walking in and
knowing I can do that,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.846
and I'm going to figure out
even if I don't know how.

00:33:27.846 --> 00:33:28.720
KARISHMA SHAH: Great.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:32.954 --> 00:33:34.870
ANIYIA WILLIAMS: I would
say that I definitely

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.350
want to continue the
proliferation of these really

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.870
beautiful hardware fem tech
things out in the world.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.830
But alongside that it's also
really, really important to me

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:53.350
that I do my part in allowing
opportunities for more women

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.890
and people of color to be
able to start businesses

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.440
and bring their ideas to life.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.830
I think that the bar
is really, really high

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.980
in terms of being able to take
that risk and take that leap.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.320
And I really want to make
it more possible for people

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.920
like me to pursue
something that they really

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.405
should have the chance to do.

00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:20.777
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:20.777 --> 00:34:22.610
HILLARY HARTLEY: I'm
just going to be honest

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.270
and say, I have no idea.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.587
My oldest kid is 7, so he'll
be 17 about to graduate,

00:34:28.587 --> 00:34:29.170
go to college.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:33.169
So that-- even just thinking
about that freaks me out.

00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:34.810
So I really don't know.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.330
Although what I
do hope is that I

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.630
continue to be in a
position to essentially

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.010
both make an impact
on the world,

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.322
but also make an
impact on individuals.

00:34:44.322 --> 00:34:46.030
Not just through the
services or whatever

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.739
that my team might be
delivering at any given moment,

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:54.909
but by nurturing folks into
places that they want to be.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.139
Two nuggets of wisdom.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:35:00.934
One, in terms of a mentor,
someone I look up to.

00:35:00.934 --> 00:35:02.350
She's on my mind
because I've seen

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.060
her a couple of times
in the last week,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.470
but just last night I was
honored to go and sit at a gala

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.100
where Megan Smith was awarded.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.580
And Megan was here at
Google, and then she

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.400
was the third Chief Technology
Officer of the United States.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.100
And the thing that I think
I most admire about her,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.830
and the thing that I think
I want to bring to myself,

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.860
and that I've noticed about
how I start to interact just

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.480
both with my team
and with the world,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.110
is that Megan will bring anybody
into the room where it happens.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.330
She makes you feel
like you're important

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.930
and that you belong there.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.430
And I think that
is so important.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.420
And if you're
looking for a mentor,

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:41.730
if you're looking for those
experiences, I know it's hard

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.320
and imposter syndrome
is absolutely real,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.500
I am a living proof.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.010
But if you can bring
up the courage to ask,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.072
I guarantee you
someone will say yes.

00:35:53.072 --> 00:35:54.030
KARISHMA SHAH: Amazing.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.990
So to finding our way together.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.370
Let's help each other out.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.770
Let's give it up for these
phenomenal women again.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.720
