00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.170
Use completing the square to
find the value of c that makes

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.890
x squared minus 44x plus c--
so we can just figure out a

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.690
c-- that makes it a perfect
square trinomial-- and a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.590
trinomial is just a polynomial
with three terms here.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.990
Then write the expression as
the square of a binomial.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.690
So we have x squared
minus 44x plus c.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.370
So how do we make this into
a perfect square?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.460
Well, if you just look at the
traditional pattern for a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.920
perfect square, let's
just think of it in

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.350
terms of x plus a squared.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.860
That's the same thing as x plus
a times x plus a, and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.260
we've seen this before.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.150
And if you were to multiply this
out, that's x times x,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.170
which is x squared, plus
x times a, which is ax.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.850
Plus a times x, which is ax.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.490
Plus a times a, which
is a squared.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.365
So it's x squared plus 2ax,
these two, you have an ax plus

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:03.610
an ax gives you 2ax,
plus a squared.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.820
So if we can get this into this
pattern, where I have

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.120
whatever value is here, if
I take half of it, right?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.490
This is going to be 2a here.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.240
If I take half of it and square
it over here, then this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.150
will be a perfect square.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.530
So if we look over here, this
thing right here is 2a, if we

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.960
want to pattern match, if we
want to make this look like a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.070
perfect square.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.300
That has to be 2a.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.550
So negative 44 is equal to 2a.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.790
And this, right here, this c, if
we pattern match, c has to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.770
be equal to a squared.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.100
So what's a?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, if we know negative 44
is 2a, we can divide both

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.140
sides of that by 2.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.310
And we know that negative 22
has got to be equal to a. a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.770
has got to be equal
to negative 22.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190
a is half of the coefficient
right here.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.100
It's half of negative 44.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.250
And whenever you complete the
square, it's always going to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.420
be half of the coefficient
right here.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.840
Now, if that's a, what
does c need to be?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.800
Well, c needs to be a squared
in order for this to be a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.430
perfect square.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.880
So c needs to equal negative
22 squared.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.390
And we can figure out
what that is.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.880
22 times 22, we could put the
negative later-- actually it's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.390
just going to be the same thing
because the negative

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.040
times a negative
is a positive.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.900
2 times 22 is 44, put a 0.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.580
2 times 22 is 44.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.200
Get a 4, get an 8, get a 4.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.950
So it's 484.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.350
So if we were to rewrite this
as x squared minus 44x plus

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.030
484, then this is a perfect
square trinomial.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.050
Or we could write
it like this.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.130
This is x squared minus 2
times-- or maybe I should

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.750
write it this way-- plus 2
times negative 22x plus

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.350
negative 22 squared.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.140
And when you view it that way,
it's pretty clear that this is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.170
a perfect square, and if you
were to factor it, it's the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.040
same thing as x minus
22 times x minus 22,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.980
or x minus 22 squared.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.530
These are all equivalent
statements.
