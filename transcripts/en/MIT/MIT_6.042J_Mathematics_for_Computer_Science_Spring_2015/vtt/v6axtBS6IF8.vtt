00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.620
PROFESSOR: So now we start
on a new unit called counting

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.329
or combinatorics.

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:06.620
And it's about counting things.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.911
Now one of the things that
happens when you're counting

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.090
is your typically adding
up a bunch of numbers

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.920
that you've counted
along the way.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.736
And so you wind up needing
to deal with sums a lot.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:20.110
And so let's start with those
mathematical preliminaries.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.360
We're going to look at three
kinds of sums, arithmetic

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.730
sums, geometric sums,
and harmonic sums.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.430
All of which come
up very regularly.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.390
And they all have
reasonably nice formulas

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.330
that explain what they sum to.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.820
Let's begin with the simplest
ones of arithmetic sums.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.910
So there's an example.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200
This supposedly is
the kind of problem

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.530
that was assigned to children
in the the 18th century

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.610
to keep them busy in class.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.170
And the great mathematician
Gauss, Carl Friedrich Gauss,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.180
whom you know for magnetism
and from probability theory,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.530
but also in fact the
inventor of congruence

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.520
and the number theory
that we've studied,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.710
showed his brilliance
as a child prodigy.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.570
When he was nine-years
old, supposedly, he

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.640
noticed that in that short
of numbers, that we just saw,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.840
there were 30
numbers, and each one

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.900
was 13 greater than
the previous one.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.499
The idea being that
the tutor didn't

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.790
want to go through the effort
of summing everything up.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880
He knew the trick to
get the sum quickly,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.420
but he kept his
students busy for hours

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.220
doing that kind of problem.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.740
I don't know whether that
this is a true story or not,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.656
but it's a good story.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.850
So let's go on with it.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.880
So in other words,
what Gauss noticed

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.010
was that the numbers on that
page looked like 89 and 89

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.170
plus 13 down through the 30th
number 89 plus 29 times 13.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.300
And then he saw how to get
the sum of a simple expression

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.290
for the value of this sum.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.830
And the logic is that
let's call the first term F

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.050
and then the next term is F plus
2 d-- F plus d, where d is 13

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.540
and F is 89.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.530
Next one would be F plus
2 d down to the end.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.910
And I'm going to
call the last term L,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.169
which is 89 plus 29 times 13.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.430
And this would be L minus
d or 89 plus 28 times 13.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.720
And let's call that sum A.
We don't know what it is yet,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.070
but we're very quickly
going to derive it.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.000
One of the standard tricks to
find nice formulas for sums

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.120
is to find a arithmetic
relation between the sum

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.140
and a slight
perturbation of the sum.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.950
In this case, I'm just going
to write the sum backwards.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.300
So it's the same
sum A, but written

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.310
where the first term is last
and the last term is first.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.380
And now notice what happens
when I add up these two sums.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.190
I get 2A of course.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.450
But every one of these terms--
this is a F plus L. This

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.000
is a F plus d plus L minus D.
It's F plus L. This last one is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.540
an F plus L.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.400
Every one of these
pairwise subsums

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.070
comes out to be
F plus L. And now

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.280
we have a formula for the whole
series in my simple formula

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.810
that A is equal to the
sum of the first term

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.160
plus the last term divided by
2 times the number of terms.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.216
By the way, the first term
plus the last term divided by 2

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.840
maybe is more memorable
if you remember

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.360
that it's the average term.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.240
It's the average size term
times the number of terms.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.230
And that's how you sum
up an arithmetic sum.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.870
So we can wrap up with a
familiar example, namely

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.840
the sum of the
integers from 1 to n.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.270
This is an arithmetic
series, starts with one.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.540
And the d, that
is the difference

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.110
from successive terms is simply
1, 1 plus 1, 1 plus 1 plus 1

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.680
down to n.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.780
And according to
our formula, it's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.160
the first plus the last over
2 times the number of terms.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.680
And we have that
familiar formula

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.830
for the sum of the
first n integers.
