we do that more and more effectively

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:24.630
we do that more and more effectively
 

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.079
we do that more and more effectively
than any place I know and we're going to

than any place I know and we're going to
 

00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:29.089
than any place I know and we're going to
continue to do more of it the way to

00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099
continue to do more of it the way to
 

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:31.789
