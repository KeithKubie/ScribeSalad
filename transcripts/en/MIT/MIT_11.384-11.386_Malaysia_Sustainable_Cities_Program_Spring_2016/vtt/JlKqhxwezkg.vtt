00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.090
TEJ KUMAR KARKI: Hello,
my name is Tej Karki.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.560
I'm a visiting scholar in the
MIT-UTM Malaysian Sustainable

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.180
Cities Program.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.550
I welcome viewers to watch
this video about the challenges

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.180
of urban flooding in Malaysia.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.860
Floods are the third
most destructive disaster

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.930
in the world, after
storms and earthquakes.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.450
In Malaysia, floods account
for 90% of natural disasters.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.980
The average annual
costs of flood damage

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.610
are over $100 million US.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.390
In this video,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.980
I will show how residents
and local authorities

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.080
dealt with floods in Kota Tinggi
town in southern Malaysia,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.120
and what the global community
can learn from this experience.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.840
The key message is that
this video provides

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.330
is that the residents
and local authorities

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.110
should not only
strengthen their ability

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.730
to deal with flood
disasters, but also

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.860
communicate with each other
and take joint action.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.650
From December 2006
to January 2007,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.450
huge floods that
would normally be

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.710
expected to occur
every 50 years,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.590
occurred twice in Kota Tinggi.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.910
Heavy monsoon rain
poured continuously

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.930
for five days in
mid December 2006.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.260
The rain prompted huge
flooding in the area.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.290
Upstream flood
control dams failed

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.880
to contain the excess water.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
As a result, the downstream
Johor river water levels

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.656
rose rapidly and flooded
all of Kota Tinggi.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.320
For one week, the
town was under water.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.950
Two weeks later, the
rain started again

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.220
and lasted four days.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.920
Since the soil was already
saturated with water

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.520
from the previous
flood, it could not

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.890
absorb any more flood water.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.860
As a result, this rain generated
an even deeper and more

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.010
widespread flood in the area.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.830
Between the two flood
events, over 5,000 residents

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.340
were evacuated.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.180
Fifteen people were killed,
and $44 million US of property

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.260
was damaged.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.620
Many town residents did not
receive early warning messages

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.190
in time.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.860
The huge unexpected flood
shocked both the town residents

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.270
and local authorities.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.420
Some residents
left for shelters,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.880
some were stranded
on roofs, and others

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.550
sheltered in tall
buildings near their home.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.300
Those who took refuse in the
houses of their loved ones

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.450
were also flooded.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.790
Eventually, they had
to go to shelters.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.310
Many were not able to
protect valuable assets

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.910
like cars and furniture.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.940
One resident, who was on a
trip abroad during the flood

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.040
incident, lost everything.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.260
Another resident's
downtown boutique shop

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.450
went completely underwater.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.230
Those residents who were busy
praying inside their homes

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.710
did not anticipate that
the flood would rise

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.540
so fast in their front yard.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.540
Those who did not go to
the shelter in the daytime

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.910
had difficulty getting
rescued at night.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.500
Most residents were not trained
in how to respond to flooding.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.010
The households did not
discuss flood issues

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.120
with their neighbors, and
they acted individually.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.630
The flood victims
rescue needs far

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.660
exceeded the ability of the
Kota Tinggi district authority.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.040
The firefighters had
limited resources

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.550
to respond to mounting
calls for rescue.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:05:11.550
SPEAKER: (Non-English)

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.610
TEJ KUMAR KARKI: Most city
transport routes and vehicles

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.140
were inundated
causing a disruption

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.570
in the supply of basic goods.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.230
Because of the
disruption in the supply,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.700
the local authorities had a hard
time meeting demand for food.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.080
Providing clean water
and better sanitation

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.910
were are other challenges.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.180
More importantly,
the town itself

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.040
is located in a flood risk area.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.750
It sits largely on a flood
plain near the Johor river

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.230
that is often inundated
due to high tides.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.060
Even so, the local zoning map
does not show flood risk areas

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.510
in the town.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.290
New housing developments are
now under way in areas that

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.910
were heavily inundated in 2006.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.760
Furthermore, most houses
developed in flood risk areas

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.910
have low [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.350
Private housing
developers prefer

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.540
building low [INAUDIBLE] to
minimize construction costs

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.850
and maximize profits.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.110
This development trend
makes the ground floor

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.930
vulnerable to any ordinary
flooding in the area.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.840
This goes against the
traditional Malaysian practice

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.760
of building houses on stilts.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.170
For cities and towns
in the global south,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.940
the Malaysian experience
reveals three priorities

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.920
for flood preparedness--
educating and empowering

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.020
local residents,
strengthening the capacity

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.090
of local authorities, and
improving local zoning

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.430
regulations.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.860
First, the local authorities
should educate and involve

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.360
local residents in all
flood related issues.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.520
This would encourage
the residents

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.380
to form a neighborhood level
flood prevention community.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.360
Second, the authorities should
establish a reliable flood

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.290
warning system.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.070
They should make sure
that firefighters

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.610
have enough equipment,
manpower, and advanced training

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.050
to respond and rescue.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.040
The firefighters should
work with local residents,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.620
train them, and develop a joint
strategy on coping with floods.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.370
Finally, plenty authorities
should create a zoning map

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.300
that shows flood
risk areas in town

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.520
and that prohibits
new development

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.890
in those risky areas.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.380
They should provide monetary
incentives to residents

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.370
to raise their house
floors above the ground.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.440
The authorities should
relocate and resettle residents

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.640
living in flood prone
areas to higher ground.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.700
The experiences
presented above showed

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.540
that the residents, as
well as local authorities

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.230
need to strengthen
their ability to deal

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.110
with flood disasters in cities.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.290
However, their strengths
will not be as effective

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.550
if they act separately.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.780
Both the city residents
and local authorities

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.390
should work together,
talk to each other,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.429
learn from each other,
and act collectively

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.660
to find ways to deal
with flood disaster.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.210
