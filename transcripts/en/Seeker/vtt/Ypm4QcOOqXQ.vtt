00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.280
When we think about what our universe is made
up of, we automatically think of stars, planets,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.320
galaxies!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.590
But the reality is that is less than five
percent of the mass of the universe.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.440
The other ninety five percent?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.260
Well that’s one of the biggest questions
in science today, and what some of the greatest

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.850
minds in astrophysics are trying to decipher.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.520
The hunt for dark matter has spanned decades
and though we can’t see it, smell it, feel

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.629
it, taste it, or hear it, we can see its gravity
impacting other things.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.469
So if we only really know five percent of
the story, discovering this elusive dark matter

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.609
would unlock an entirely new understanding
of everything and everyone in our known universe.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:54.909
So how close are we to finding dark matter?

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.319
If you’re not really familiar with dark
matter, let me get you up to speed on what

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.549
we know so far.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.229
What we know is it exists.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.850
And that’s about it.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.890
No, seriously.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490
But there are a few things we are at least
confident about:

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.829
Dark matter is this really mysterious, strange
substance.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.070
It's amazing in some sense because it's all
around us.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.770
Right now, as I'm sitting here, a wind of
dark matter is going through me.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.350
It doesn't interact with me, which, at least,
it doesn't interact with me much so my body

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.299
doesn't realize it's there, the Earth doesn't
realize it's there.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.520
We are pretty sure it's a new particle.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.800
If it were not a new particle, if there's
something totally crazy, then science would

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.920
be revolutionized overnight in a way that
it has never been in the history of mankind.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.020
And then finally we know a lot about what
dark matter isn't.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.790
So there have been lots of different kinds
of experiments that have looked and tried

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.590
to discover what dark matter is and haven't
found it yet.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.799
And so we've excluded a lot of possibilities.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.369
But why is this missing piece of our universe
so important to find and understand?

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.969
It could be that someday if we could manipulate
this stuff, we could actually use it as a

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.900
source of energy or something.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.189
In the far future, there might even be a huge
payoff for us if we could manage to do that.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.660
In the late 1900s when JJ Thompson discovered
the electron in cathode ray tubes nobody knew

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.150
what the electron was good for.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.520
He just thought this was an interesting thing
to study.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520
And now when we think about how we live our
lives, we all go around all the time with

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.330
our heads in our phones, which are packed
full of devices that rely on the quantum mechanical

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.640
properties of the electron.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.260
And so although we haven't found dark matter
yet, there's a huge amount of it out there.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.170
And understanding its quantum mechanical properties,
who knows how it's going to change our lives?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.580
This is a puzzle that is being put forward
by the universe to us.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.830
I cannot think of anything else better to
do with my time than to try to answer that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.120
puzzle.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.300
Even though we haven’t seen it yet, there’s
a few key pieces of evidence we have found

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.840
so far in the search for dark matter that
tell us we’re on the right track:

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.160
We are certain that dark matter exists because
the evidence for additional mass in the galaxy

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.450
is all over the place in astronomical observations.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.690
You can see the gravitational pull on stars
and on galaxies, to even a lot more subtle

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.500
things like you can see the relativistic effect
of invisible clumps of dark matter causing

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140
light rays to bend.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.620
Most recently there have been beautiful observations
using optical data and X-ray data looking

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.450
at gravitational lensing to infer the distribution
of matter in colliding clusters of galaxies.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.640
But by far the smoking gun for dark matter
is the Cosmic Microwave Background.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.700
This is the earliest thing that we can see
through our telescopes through light.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.730
It’s basically a photograph of a moment
in history after the Big Bang, when the universe

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.000
was only three hundred and eighty thousand
years old.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.170
It also shows temperature data, and when we
measure the fluctuations in temperature, the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.150
position of the peaks can determine the ingredients
of our universe.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.370
It shows that less than five percent of the
total mass of the universe is made up of what

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.780
we call “normal matter,” like visible
stars, planets, and galaxies.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.870
Then twenty six point eight percent of the
mass of the universe is dark matter and the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.820
rest is made up of dark energy.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.380
If you asked me what dark matter was I'd say
I have no idea.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.530
If you ask me what dark energy is, you wouldn't
be able to show that because it would be I

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.870
have no bleep bleep bleep bleep idea.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.030
Which means we should just leave dark energy
for another day.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.000
Now, the reason the CMB was so significant
in proving dark matter exists is because when

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.290
we compare theoretical models with these peaks,
there's an extremely compelling match, practically

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.990
ruling out a universe without dark matter.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.310
So basically putting it all together, dark
matter is the simplest explanation we have

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.490
that explains all of the data that we have
from different types of observations.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.220
To match these discoveries and observations,
scientists came up with a theory for what

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.220
dark matter could be: WIMPs.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.280
WIMPs — which stands for weakly interacting
massive particles, but of course, the name

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.630
WIMP is so cute that everybody likes to use
it instead — are particles that are heavy,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.410
and that's where the “massive” comes from
and “weakly interacting” means that they

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.110
have an interaction strength that's maybe
around the electroweak force.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.010
WIMPs started being discussed sometime in
the 1980s.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.160
They've really been dominating the conversation,
I would say, until about the last five or

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.720
10 years.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.620
WIMPs are beautiful because they solve a lot
of problems kind of for free.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.140
You don't add too much, you just get a lot
of explanations for mysteries that we want

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.060
to know.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.200
If we can find WIMPs, it’s possible that
that would then mean we have found dark matter.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.570
So scientists began planning and building
a lot of different experiments to look for

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.889
WIMPs, dispersed all over the world.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.930
Experiments look for dark matter in three
ways.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.720
You can make it, break it, or shake it.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.780
So the experiments that make it try to produce
dark matter particles in ultra high energy

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.950
collisions of proton beams and accelerators
like in the Large Hadron Collider.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.960
And those experiments look for some evidence
that dark matter particles were produced and

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.650
flew out of the detector.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.750
The Large Hadron Collider is pushing particles
together at such high speeds that when they

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.920
slam into each other, the kinetic energy that
breaks off can be frozen into matter to be

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920
studied.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.800
It’s possible that these tests could generate
something that matches the properties of dark

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
matter.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.560
The second search method is called indirect
detection — the “break it” method.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.290
This is when we observe dark matter in space,
and since it is so far away from us, we are

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.400
only seeing what is produced when dark matter
particles are annihilating each other — which

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.230
could happen if there’s a high enough density
of them.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.570
And finally, the “shake it” method is
actually called direct detection — because

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.600
scientists theorize that dark matter may set
off extremely sensitive detectors.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.660
I work on the DEAP experiment.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.400
And we use a detector which has three and
a half tons of argon and is located a mile

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.340
underground in Sudbury Ontario, Canada.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.730
And what we're looking for is some evidence
that a dark matter particle struck an argon

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.030
atom and then that argon atom deposited the
energy in the detector.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.820
And that produces a flash of light.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.150
It takes months or even years to get the experiments
going and they often run for month or years

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.120
just collecting the data that they need in
order to see if the dark matter is there where

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.930
they think it might be.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.310
So with all of these different searches, and
all these different methods, have we found

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.590
anything close to WIMPs?

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.010
We've been looking for almost 25 years.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.120
And we haven't seen it yet.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.400
That means that WIMPS are still allowed to
be the answer. On the other hand, when you

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.139
don't find something for a few years, then
you start to think, "All right, well, maybe

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.010
I'd to look in other places too."

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.180
I think what we're seeing now is a push in
that direction.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.639
In fact, the search for dark matter is experiencing
a major, exciting shift right now for the

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.220
first time in decades.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.520
The search for WIMPs will continue, but scientists
are clamoring onto the scene with new ideas

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.370
for what dark matter could be, bringing the
hunt to new corners of the universe.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.030
Once you go beyond the idea of WIMPs and start
thinking about other ideas for what dark matter

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.800
could be, you find actually there's a lot
of great possibilities.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.870
There are very light-mass particles like sterile
neutrinos, which is kind of a cousin of the

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.330
neutrinos that are part of the standard model,
or axions, this is kind of a very, very, light

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.351
particle that explains certain mysteries for
the strong nuclear force.

00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:05.430
One thing I'm actually really
excited about is looking for dark matter through

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.050
new forces.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.270
I think this is an avenue that is a relatively
modest mathematical change to the theory,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.360
that opens up a whole new range of different
experimental handles.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.199
You could imagine that it's actually something
to do with extra dimensions of space where

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:24.080
at every point in space there's a different
direction that we can't see because our eyes

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.600
don't know how to look in it, but you can
actually send energy into it and you can have

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.730
particles that live in it.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.189
I'm really interested right now in the possibility
that dark matter might actually interact with

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:34.189
electrons.

00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:38.490
And so I'm focusing on looking at searches
using an alternate signal.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.289
And I think that that's kind of a trend for
a lot of experimentalists: is we're thinking

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.780
about how can our experiments do more?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.740
How can we test other possibilities?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.730
These are just a handful of new theories — there
are so many more, with great names like fuzzy

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.730
dark matter.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:02.040
Or, what if there was a periodic table of
dark matter just like what we have for elements?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.999
Testing these new theories can be folded into
existing experiments or drive completely new

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:08.279
ones.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.649
Other ideas are actually even more exotic.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:13.990
You could imagine that you're going to use
gravitational waves to discover something

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.300
about dark matter.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.610
Other advances are more in the way that we
actually do analysis.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.649
So, there are things like machine learning
that allow us to be very sensitive to tiny

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:26.430
and very subtle signals that are buried in
complicated backgrounds.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.069
The machines can be trained to discover things
that your eye wouldn't be able to pick out

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.170
from a set of data.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.259
So to recap: We know it exists.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:38.970
We’ve been searching primarily in 3 different
ways for WIMPs, but haven’t found them yet.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.559
In doing so, we’ve eliminated a lot of what
dark matter is not — which is progress.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:46.850
And we have a bunch of new ideas to explore.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.620
So how close are we to finding dark matter?

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.400
If the current round of experiments are going
to be able to discover dark matter, and there's

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.680
a good reason to think they might be, I think
we would know in a couple of years.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.259
On the other hand, if these experiments are
not quite what we need, it could take longer

00:10:03.259 --> 00:10:04.259
than that.

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:05.259
I'm an optimist.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:06.259
I'll tell you I could find it tomorrow.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:08.730
I might have already found it.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.279
I've got two years of data in the can that
I haven't look at yet.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.899
It may be right around the corner.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:18.670
The honest answer is we really have no idea,
but it's exciting because we have a fighting

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.269
chance of being really close.

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:25.540
It is a hugely exciting scientific question
and there are great experiments taking data

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.540
now.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.589
And big leaps forward in sensitivity.

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:31.910
So I think the chance that we discover dark
matter in the next 10 years is good.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.110
I'm betting on it.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.500
When the discovery comes, it's going to be
like a bolt of lightning and it's going to

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.020
change everything.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.240
