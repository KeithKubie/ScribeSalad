00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.370
( intro music )

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:09.476
Albert Lin:<i> I'm on a quest to
 find the secret burial site.</i>

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.511
<i> The forbidden tomb
 of the man who ruled</i>

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.081
<i> one of the largest
 empires ever known.</i>

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.150
<i> Genghis Khan.</i>

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.720
<i> It's the most incredible
 archaeological puzzle</i>

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.422
<i> of the last millennium.</i>

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.859
( applause )

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.060
Thanks a lot.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.163
<i> This is me.</i>

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.366
Can anybody in this room
guess which one is me?

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.867
( audience laughter )

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.202
<i> It's that one, right.</i>

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.636
( audience laughter )

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.605
And that's my grandpa
and my grandma

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.141
sitting around all their
grandchildren, in Hong Kong.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.978
My grandpa used to tell
me all the time that

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.479
he thought that, you know

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.248
<i> that we had come
 from the north.</i>

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.151
And he told me to
study hard, you know

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:55.321 line:0%
to do well in school, but...

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.457 line:0%
to be curious about
those sorts of things

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.760
to try to figure out
where we came from.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.930
To always know where we came
from and who we were, right.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.099
<i> So, I did study hard,
 you know, I'm...</i>

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.201
<i> There's me at a
 microscope studying hard.</i>

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.037
<i> And then one day I
 ended up with this</i>

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.572
<i> Ph.D. in Engineering!</i>

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.140
<i> And I thought about
 my grandpa, you know.</i>

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.644
I thought about this guy who--
he grew up at a time of war.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.980
And he travelled all over China
but he never made it north.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.082
And I thought, well, you
know, I'm going to do this.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.320
And I saved up a little money
and I bought a ticket to China.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.622
And I had this plan, I
thought that I would go to

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.958
the outskirts of the
capital Ulan Bator

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.661
and I'd buy a horse, on the
outskirts of the capital.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.264
I'm a grad-- just like a
fresh grad student, right

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.300
I'm like, "I'm going to buy
a horse", you know.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.801
I didn't know how
to ride a horse.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.103
( audience laughter )

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.605
And, I was going to go out
into the middle of nowhere

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.175
and I was a going to
live with these nomads

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.910
and when I had to
come back I would...

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.614
press "home" on my GPS, you know

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.615
get back to the capital

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.349
back to the same place
that I'd bought the horse

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.052
and I would trade it back in for

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.320
you know, the cash that I had
used to buy the horse and then

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.389
you know, I'd break even
and then come home.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:07.727
And, I met these two
women on this train

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.395
you know, these two
Mongolian women.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.964
And, the next thing you know,
they said, well, look I've--

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.399
They had a brother and they
introduced me to their brother.

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.402
He agreed to take me up to...

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.140
...to their uncle's land, and
they would give me a horse.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.409
<i> And there I lived
 with these nomads.</i>

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.679
<i> Literally lived with
 these nomads for months.</i>

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:33.519
<i> We think of this place as this
 far off country, you know.</i>

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.188
<i> A place of legends, right?</i>

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:39.592
<i> And there was one individual</i>

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.461
<i> whose name was Temujin.</i>

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:45.298
He went to this mountain
called the Burkhan Khaldun

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.033
or the God mountain.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.436
And he spoke to the sky,
to Tengri.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.471
And he asked what
should he do, right.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.776
What should he do? Should
he live this like...

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.812
this life of being a
subservient slave

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.049
you know, his wife had
just been stolen from him.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.685
Or should he fight back.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:10.489
This guy Temujin would one day
take on the name Genghis Khan.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.526
<i> In Mongolia he's
 thought of as a hero.</i>

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.829
<i> He's thought of as the
 great creator of...</i>

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.799
<i> of not only their nation
 but their... religion</i>

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.935
<i> you know, their
 spiritual leader.</i>

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.638
<i>So why is it that we don't know</i>

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.606
<i> this history that
 the Mongols see?</i>

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.442
There was never a
painting of him

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:32.011
during the time
that he was alive.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.413
There was never a
document written

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.715
about him by his own people
while he was alive.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.719
There's literally
not a single one of...

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.555
the Imperial family, he or his
sons or his grandsons, anybody

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.691
not a single one of their tombs
have ever been discovered.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.426
It's like it was just this...

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:50.296
this whisper of history, right.

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:53.900
But he also created this world,
which we see today.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.904
He had a system of meritocracy,
which was far beyond its time.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.573
He created the first, you
know, global currency.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:04.943
He installed a uniform
written language

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:08.514
that he instated across all of
the lands that he dominated.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.283
He created the first empire

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.853
which practiced
religious freedom.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.690
We don't really know that
much about him, right

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.558
but, he changed the world.

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:22.194
And maybe if we can
go back to this

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:24.997
this zone, this Ikh Khorig,
this forbidden precinct

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.366
<i> maybe we can begin to
 piece his story back</i>

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:30.236
<i> from the last bit of
 evidence that we have then,</i>

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.739
<i> then we can start knowing more
 about the truth of this story.</i>

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:36.375
<i> So, that's me, that's
 where I was, right.</i>

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.744
I just finished my
Ph.D. in Engineering.

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.746
I thought, well, maybe I
can start using my mind

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.648
in a way that will allow me to
answer these questions, right.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.016
<i> I can use satellite imagery</i>

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.819
<i> I'll get the world's highest
 resolution satellite imagery</i>

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.357
<i>I'll... use this over the entire
 region of this Ikh Khorig</i>

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:55.060
<i> I'll scan it with point-five
 meter resolution imagery</i>

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.763
then I'll use drones,
with cameras on them

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.565
and I'll take
pictures of the earth

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.568
where the satellite imagery
told me things were, you know

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.304
a little bit off or weird or
something that looked ancient.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:08.040
<i> Then I'd use things like
 ground penetrating radar</i>

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.677
<i> like magnetometry, like
 electro-magnetic induction</i>

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:12.979
to try to scan the ground and

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.816
find things in the
sub-surface that were off.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.517
And I would use
these tools because

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.652
the Mongolian belief is that

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.020
if you disturb the
tomb of Genghis Khan--

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.222
The reason why that area was
so forbidden is because

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.857
if you disturb this tomb then
you might cause this curse

00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:27.459
that will end the world, right.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.397
<i> But I quickly realized how
 am I going to find anything.</i>

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.700
I've got 6,000 square
kilometers of data

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.638
in which one pixel is less than
half a meter in resolution.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.908
I've got literally a
lifetime of work to do

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.010
just to sift through this data

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:47.113
to find that tiny fragment of
information that might be weird.

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.248
<i> This is my data, right.</i>

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:53.185
<i> Can I have people help me
 find something like a tomb of</i>

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.353
<i> you know, something that
 I don't even know</i>

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.222
<i> what I'm looking for, right.</i>

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:59.158
<i> Can anybody tell me if I
 said if you had to find a tomb</i>

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.894
<i> what you would say, I
 mean, in this image</i>

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.464
<i> does anybody see something
 that looks off?</i>

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.065
Yeah, right.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.568
You know, these
little things, right?

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:12.004
That looks modern, that
looks like a river

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.939
and what is that, right.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.474
<i>We thought well, that's simple.</i>

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.042
<i> So let me make it
 simple for everybody.</i>

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.445
<i> Let's make it easy for
 people to do this.</i>

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.880
<i> Let's make it so that you
 can tag data easily.</i>

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.150
<i> We chop up all the information
into all these tiny little bits</i>

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.720
and we'll make it simple
and easy for people to see what

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.523
you know, to place dots
and tags on things

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.058
that they think are weird.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.460
<i> And, we built this thing
 and we put it online</i>

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.961
<i> we thought, well, this
 is how we'll do it.</i>

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:38.296
<i> We'll create this website
 where we'll have</i>

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:39.865
<i> people sifting through data.</i>

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:42.368
And then every single day,
in the field

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:46.405
I would download this data with
satellite communication links.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.974
And I will go and
search for those...

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.677
those sites of interest that
are identified by the crowd

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.245
and then I'd blog back.

00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:58.117
<i> In less than a few months, we
 started collecting data that</i>

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:02.388
<i> exceeded over like, 2.5
 million human generated tags.</i>

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:05.057
<i>And then when you look a little
 closer at certain regions</i>

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.692
<i> you can see each
 one of these dots</i>

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:10.929
<i>is an individual tag by a person
 who is sitting on their couch</i>

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:14.233
in San Francisco, New York,
Washington DC

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.468
and when they converge

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:19.438
you start to see things,
clusters, right?

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:20.640
When you pulled away the data

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.278
you see the same tiniest little
nuances of something weird.
