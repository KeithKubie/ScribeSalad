00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.190
(Guitar music throughout)

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:21.704
Music is a language.

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:26.577
Both music and verbal languages
serve the same purpose.

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.666
They are both forms of expression.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:32.761
They can be used as a way
to communicate with others.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:35.482
They can be read and written.

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.643
They can make you laugh or cry,

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:39.899
think or question,

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:42.030
and can speak to one or many.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:46.304
And both can definitely make you move.

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:53.548
In some instances, music works
better than the spoken word,

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:56.887
because it doesn't have
to be understood to be effective.

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:02.425
Although many musicians agree
that music is a language,

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.534
it is rarely treated as such.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.125
Many of us treat it as something

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.125
that can only be learned
by following a strict regimen,

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.255
under the tutelage of a skilled teacher.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:16.078
This approach has been followed
for hundreds of years

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:20.194
with proven success,
but it takes a long time.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.249
Too long.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:34.232
Think about the first language
you learn as a child.

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:37.011
More importantly,
think about how you learned it.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:41.277
You were a baby
when you first started speaking,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.694
and even though you spoke
the language incorrectly

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:45.400
you were allowed to make mistakes.

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:47.654
And the more mistakes you made,

00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:49.840
the more your parents smiled.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:57.772
Learning to speak was not something
you were sent somewhere to do

00:01:57.796 --> 00:01:59.626
only a few times a week.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.698
And the majority
of the people you spoke to

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.050
were not beginners.

00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:05.513
They were already proficient speakers.

00:02:07.473 --> 00:02:10.598
Imagine your parents forcing you
to only speak to other babies

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:12.865
until you were good enough
to speak to them.

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.450
You would probably be an adult before
you could carry on a proper conversation.

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:23.377
To use a musical term,

00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.908
as a baby, you were allowed
to jam with professionals.

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.196
If we approach music
in the same natural way

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.097
we approached our first language,

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.407
we will learn to speak it
in the same short time

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.551
it took to speak our first language.

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:48.087
Proof of this could be
seen in almost any family

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.524
where a child grows up
with other musicians in the family.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.439
Here are a few keys to follow
in learning or teaching music.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.069
In the beginning, embrace mistakes,
instead of correcting them.

00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:40.314
Like a child playing air guitar,
there are no wrong notes.

00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:44.021
Allow young musicians to play

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.072
and perform with accomplished musicians

00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:47.182
on a daily basis.

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:52.624
Encourage young musicians to play
more than they practice.

00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:56.291
The more they play the more
they will practice on their own.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:59.229
Music comes from the musician,
not the instrument.

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:03.417
And most importantly,

00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:06.410
remember that a language works best

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:08.761
when we have something interesting to say.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.985
Many music teachers never find out
what their students have to say.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.240
We only tell them
what they are supposed to say.

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:25.307
A child speaks a language for years
before they even learn the alphabet.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.547
Too many rules at the onset,
will actually slow them down.

00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:35.038
In my eyes, the approach to music
should be the same.

00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:39.118
After all, music is a language too.
