00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.689
You’ve probably heard of CRISPR technologies
and their much-discussed ability to edit our

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:06.689
DNA.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.440
For the most part, these stories probably
refer to CRISPR-Cas9.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.130
But a new system, CRISPR-Cas3, has just been
used in human cells for the very first time...and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.710
offers a whole new set of tools that could
have huge implications for curing previously

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.940
incurable viruses.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.220
To review, CRISPR-Cas9 is the combination
of a custom-made piece of RNA (that’s the

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.540
clustered regularly interspersed palindromic
repeats, or the CRISPR part) and an enzyme

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.129
(that’s the CRISPR associated protein 9,
or Cas-9 part).

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.969
The RNA is engineered to recognize a certain
segment of DNA, which guides the CRISPR-Cas9

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.230
system to that section so it can then cut
and delete, or potentially add to, or even

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.239
replace with an altered version.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.859
CRISPR-Cas9 belongs to a family of CRISPR-based
editing tools called Class 2 systems.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.670
There are actually three classes of CRISPR-Cas
systems, most of them belonging to classes

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.149
one and two.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.449
CRISPR-Cas3 is a Class 1 system.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.590
Class 1 systems are apparently more prevalent
in our biological processes and are more sophisticated

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.540
than Class 2 systems, but have so far they’ve
only been used experimentally as gene editing

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.230
tools in bacteria and archaea.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.530
CRISPR-Cas3 has the unique capability to search
for, identify, and delete much longer stretches

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.040
of DNA than CRISPR-Cas9, chunks up to 100,000
base pairs long—and it makes multiple cuts

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.540
along that chunk, kind of like a shredder.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.750
A research team that recently demonstrated
this in human cells for the first time--in

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.420
a petri dish--believes the Cas3 system could
be a better option than Cas9 because it uses

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.910
a longer guide RNA sequence.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.180
This means it’s better at more accurately
locating the chunk we want to target.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.910
This makes it ideal for editing non-coding
segments of our genome.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.560
These are pieces of our DNA, about 98% of
it, actually, that don’t directly correlate

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.130
to something.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.740
Instead they act as regulators, determining
how much that gene is expressed, if at all.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.789
We don’t have a great understanding of what
this huge swathe of our DNA really does, so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.189
using CRISPR-Cas3 to delete large sections
and then seeing what happens, in a lab setting

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.730
of course, could give us a much better understanding
of what these non-coding sections do and how

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.870
they work.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.299
CRISPR-Cas3 could also delete sections of
genes that have been permanently altered by

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.299
viruses.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.540
Diseases like herpes actually hijack our DNA,
inserting their sequences into our genome

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.260
to use our cell’s machinery to make their
own often malicious proteins.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.879
Herpes in particular is spectacularly good
at avoiding our immune system and goes through

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.910
dormant stages, making it impossible to cure.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.330
But its permanent alterations of our DNA could
make it vulnerable to attack by CRISPR technologies,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.980
and CRISPR-Cas3’s accurate targeting and
powerful shredding capabilities could knock

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.840
it out of our system for good.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.859
Some other teams are pointing to CRISPR-Cas3
as a potential solution for antibiotic-resistant

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:03.859
bacteria.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.340
Instead of deleting a sequence of DNA infected
by a virus’ DNA, CRISPR-Cas3 could just

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.670
chew up the bacterium’s whole genome beyond
the point of repair, causing the organism’s

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.450
death—no antibiotics required!

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.019
So, CRISPR-Cas3 has the potential to delete
large chunks of our DNA, proving useful and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.239
potentially more efficient and cost-effective
in some essential medical situations—but

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.689
we still have to learn how to control it.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.330
While the most recent study into CRISPR-Cas3’s
potential did demonstrate that we can use

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.040
it in human cells, we still don’t have total
control over how long a section we tell it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.299
to delete.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.029
And of course, since we’re not even entirely
sure of the complete function of most of our

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:50.029
genes, we would want to make sure the stuff
we’re deleting is, y’know...safe to delete.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.689
Or that we have a healthy version to replace
it with, some kind of backup plan.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:59.109
There are all kinds of new studies coming
out about the unexpected effects of CRISPR-Cas9—

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.510
deletions we didn’t mean to make and didn’t
see coming—so with all of this gene-editing

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.510
stuff we’ll need to proceed with extreme
caution and many more years of experimentation

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.620
before we see this in a clinical setting.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.319
But this new exploration of CRISPR-Cas3’s
potential is an exciting first proof-of-concept

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:21.010
for a technology that could one day provide
a solution for previously incurable viruses.
