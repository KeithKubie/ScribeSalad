00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.179
A director’s objective should be making
the audience believe anything – no matter

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.540
how fantastical – that’s on the screen,
meaning sometimes they’ll have to pull out

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.570
all the stops and get really creative with
how they film their scenes. They know they’ve

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.880
been successful when viewers walk away wondering
how exactly that one jaw-dropping moment was

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
captured on film. Here is Screen Rant’s
look at How It Was Shot: 10 Secrets Behind

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.800
Amazing Movie Scenes.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Skyfall

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.860
The James Bond movies are known for extravagant
action, but this is crazy by even 007 standards.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
When pursuing Silva through London’s tube,
the villain tries to take Bond out by crashing

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
a train through the structure. For safety
reasons, you’d think they’d do this digitally,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.890
but director Sam Mendes went all-out. The
crew built two replica train carriages that

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.870
weighed 5-7 tons and dropped them off of a
track raised 20 feet above the Pinewood Studios

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.489
set. The model train dismantled a majority
of the sound stage. Digital effects were added

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.740
in post, but most of the scene was filmed
practically for maximum effect.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.740
Interstellar

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.920
Though viewers remain divided on its story,
there’s no denying that Interstellar is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.110
a technical marvel full of beautiful visuals.
The film made headlines for its limited emphasis

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.560
on digital effects, and that includes some
of its other-dimension locations. Towards

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.549
the end of the film, Cooper ventures into
the black hole and ends up in a tesseract

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.450
where he can communicate with his daughter
Murph. What viewers are seeing is Matthew

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.500
McConaughey hanging from a harness, moving
around in an actual set that was constructed.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.430
In a time where green screen is over-used
to fill in environments, it’s refreshing

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.470
to see a director go the extra mile.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.470
Independence Day

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.060
It’s an iconic shot of 1990s cinema: an
alien ship destroys the White House to send

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.040
America into chaos. To accomplish this, director
Roland Emmerich didn’t resort to the digital

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.079
effects that were becoming more frequent.
His crew built a 10x5 feet model and spent

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.060
a week planning an actual demolition to put
on the screen that needed 40 explosive charges.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.969
When they needed fire to shoot down the streets
of New York, they tilted a model upright beneath

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.890
a camera filming downwards to create a rolling
“wall of destruction.” ID4 is known for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.569
its spectacle, and it’s quite impressive.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.050
Speed

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.450
One of Speed’s most nail-biting moments
is when a bus has to jump a 50 foot gap in

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.270
the incomplete highway. Sounds like a job
for CGI, but the stunt was mostly done for

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.510
real. A ramp was built so the bus could get
the necessary lift and only the stunt driver

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.980
was in the vehicle – wearing a shock-absorbing
harness to avoid injury. When filming the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.230
scene, the bus traveled further than anyone
anticipated and broke one of the cameras.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.569
Luckily, they got it all on film and the only
digital effect needed was to add in the gap

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.420
that’s shown in the final product.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.269
The Matrix

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.519
Groundbreaking for several reasons, The Matrix’s
bullet time effects have been parodied endlessly

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.860
since 1999, but they weren’t easy to create.
Bullet time scenes were created using a version

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.099
of time-slice photography, using temporal
motion to make the shot progress in a slow

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.590
motion. Cameras were placed all around an
object and started fractions of a second after

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.510
each other to create the slow-mo effect. The
frames together reached a frequency of 12,000

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.540
frames per second, as opposed to the usual
24. The Wachowskis did have to use digital

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.360
effects – but just to remove the cameras
that were all around.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.260
The Dark Knight

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.599
One of the standout set pieces in Christopher
Nolan’s Batman sequel is the car chase through

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.989
Gotham City when the Joker attempts to track
down Harvey Dent. What’s even more amazing

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.129
is that digital effects were not used for
its two most iconic moments. When the Tumbler

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.849
makes its appearance and upends a garbage
truck, what you’re seeing are third scale

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.000
models of the Tumbler, the truck, and the
road. At the end of the sequence when the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.140
Joker’s truck flips over, that was accomplished
by building a steam-piston mechanism into

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.610
the trailer and actually flipping it in a
closed off street section.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.799
Die Hard

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.450
John McClane’s life is a living hell in
the Die Hard franchise, and when shooting

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.540
the seminal first film, director John McTiernan
didn’t make things any easier for Bruce

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.860
Willis. The crew strived for realism to portray
the film’s high-octane action, meaning most

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.599
of what viewers see is real. For a majority
of the exterior shots of Nakatomi showing

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.470
explosions, full-scale practical explosions
were set off in and around the actual building.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.340
So when Willis is jumping off rooftops and
desperately trying to break through glass,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.770
he may not even be acting due to what might
happen if it goes wrong.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.020
Gravity

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.380
Gravity is one of the most visually-stunning
films ever made, as even some professional

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.919
critics thought they filmed it in actual space.
What director Alfonso Cuaron did was shoot

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.830
the actors’ faces and filled everything
else in digitally. They had to film the actors

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.500
in a way so that the light would match the
all-CGI environment, or else it wouldn’t

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.780
look right. To combat this problem, cinematographer
Emmanuel Lubezki folded an LED screen into

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.610
a box and suggested filming the actors standing
in the box. That way, the projected image

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.530
could move while the actor stayed still, instead
of vice versa. The end result was an Academy

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.530
Award.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.289
Return of the Jedi

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.500
Before the dawn of CGI, George Lucas had to
resort to old school techniques to make his

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.440
galaxy far, far away come to life. In Return
of the Jedi, he originally wanted to shoot

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.380
the Luke vs. Rancor fight by placing a performer
in a suit. When those attempts failed, the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.300
crew used a high-speed puppet to film the
creature in his pit. For the moments when

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.310
Luke is in its grasp and is about to be eaten,
a Rancor hand prop had to be built so they

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.430
could shoot Mark Hamill’s close ups. It
was a second resort, but it paid off in the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.039
end and gave the trilogy one of its most thrilling
moments.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.419
E.T. – The Extra Terrestrial

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.710
It’s a magical moment of cinema: E.T. and
the kids going flying in bikes. More than

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.979
30 years later, many are still wondering how
that sequence was filmed. According to star

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.050
Henry Thomas, it wasn’t as awe-inspiring
as the final product. Bikes were bolted to

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.590
the end of a camera crane in a studio and
were dipped and lifted in front of a blue

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.520
screen. The environment was added later in
post to create the visual effect that we all

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.699
remember. It may not have been exciting to
shoot, but the scene is incredibly convincing

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.600
on film, leading several to believe that the
bikes were actually up in the air.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.850
Thanks a lot for watching!
