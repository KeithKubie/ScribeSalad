Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. What makes you nervous about this? Alright, three big areas. First humans and all of buys, incredibly complex. Homeo talk about genetic code, which is mindbogglingly complex, but our genetics exists within the incredible, incredibly complex systems biology. We have all of these things like our microbiome, our virome are proteome, the Metabolome, and then that exists within the context of our environment. And everything's always changing and, and interacting. And so we are messing and we have the tools to mess and we will mess because we're this hubristic species with these really complex ecosystems, including ourselves. We don't fully understand. That's number one, two and you mentioned it before, this issue of, of equity. What happens if we have, every technology has to have first adopters. If you don't have it, you never get the technology. But what happens if a group of people move much more quickly than other people, whether it's real or not, even if they believe it's real.

Speaker 1:          01:01          You could imagine big, dangerous societal changes. And the third big area is diversity. And we think about diversity. We think why it's great to have diverse workplaces and schools. And, and we're more better people for it and we're more competitive. The diversity is something much, much, much deeper. In Darwinian terms, diversity is random mutation. Like that's our core survival strategy as a species. If we didn't have that, you could say we distilled be single cell organisms but we wouldn't, we would have died because the environment would have changed and we wouldn't have had the built in resilience to adapt. Yeah. That is really important when thinking about diversity, right? Yeah. We need a non uniformity when it comes to our own biology. Yeah. Because you a bunch of different kinds of people. We have to have it be as, even if we optimize for this world, um, the world will change.

Speaker 1:          01:49          There's no good and bad in evolution. There's just well suited for a particular environment. If that environment changes, the best suited person for your old environment may be the least suited person for the new environment. So even if we have things that seem real, like really great ideas now, like optimizing health. So if you have sickle cell disease, you're probably going to die and you're going to die young. And it's going to be excruciating pain, excruciatingly painful. And so you would say, well, let's just get rid of sickle cell disease, which we can do. But if you are a recessive carrier of the single of the sickle cell disease gene, you don't have it. You're just carrying it and you have a pretty significant risk of passing it on to your kids, but you also have an additional resistance to malaria. And so we are probably are almost certainly carrying around all kinds of recessive traits, maybe even ones that we don't like that are harming us now.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Um, but that could be some protection against some future danger that we don't yet understand or how are haven't faced. And so the challenge is that diversity has just happened to us for 4 billion years now we're going to have to choose it. And that's a big, it's a big challenge for us. So essentially we were going to have without doubt, some unintended consequences, some unintended domino effect, things that are going to take place that we really can't predict. We just have to kind of go along with this technology and see where it leads us as it improves. Like if you go back and look at surgeries from the 1950s comparison to surgery of 2019 giant leaps, I mean, I would never advise someone to get their knee operated by a 1950s physician. Right? Right. Yeah. Right. But that's kind of someone's going to have to be an early adopter when it comes to these genetic therapies.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Yeah, no, I agree with you. But where I would slightly, or I would add to what you're saying is these technologies, they're going to happen, they're going to play out, and what's at play now is not where these technologies are going to advance. They will, it will do it. They will advance in a way that is going to just blow people's minds. What's at play is what are the values that we are going to weave into the decision making process so that we can get a better outcome than we otherwise would have had and that that's what, in my view, that's the real, the important issue. Now.
