00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's say that we have
two parallel lines.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.980
So that's one line
right over there,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.830
and then this is
the other line that

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.650
is parallel to the first one.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.630
I'll draw it as
parallel as I can.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.460
So these two lines are parallel.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.000
This is the symbol
right over here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.740
to show that these two
lines are parallel.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.920
And then let me draw
a transversal here.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920
So let me draw a transversal.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.630
This is also a line.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.550
Now, let's say that we know
that this angle right over here

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.740
is 110 degrees.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.780
What other angles can
we figure out here?

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750
Well, the first thing
that we might realize

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.440
is that, look, corresponding
angles are equivalent.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.632
This angle, the angle
between this parallel line

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:45.090
and the transversal,
is going to be

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.370
the same as the angle
between this parallel line

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.730
and the transversal.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.640
So this right over here is
also going to be 110 degrees.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.660
Now, we also know that
vertical angles are equivalent.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.040
So if this is 110
degrees, then this angle

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.580
right over here on the opposite
side of the intersection

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.681
is also going to be 110 degrees.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:04.680
And we could use that
same logic right over here

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.340
to say that if this
is 110 degrees,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.576
then this is also 110 degrees.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:09.950
We could've also
said that, look,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.910
this angle right over here
corresponds to this angle

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.920
right over here so that they
also will have to be the same.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.360
Now, what about
these other angles?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.190
So this angle right over
here, its outside ray,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.277
I guess you could
say, forms a line

00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:26.610
with this angle right over here.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
This pink angle is supplementary
to this 110 degree angle.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.580
So this pink angle plus 110
is going to be equal to 180.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.990
Or we know that this pink angle
is going to be 70 degrees.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.430
And then we know that it's a
vertical angle with this angle

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.320
right over here, so
this is also 70 degrees.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.620
This angle that's kind of
right below this parallel line

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.910
with the transversal, the bottom
left, I guess you could say,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.520
corresponds to this bottom
left angle right over here.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.141
So this is also 70 degrees.

00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.140
And we could've also
figured that out by saying,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.992
hey, this angle is supplementary
to this angle right over here.

00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:05.700
And then we could use
multiple arguments.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.289
The vertical angle argument,
the supplementary argument two

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.350
ways, or the corresponding
angle argument to say that,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.940
hey, this must be
70 degrees as well.
