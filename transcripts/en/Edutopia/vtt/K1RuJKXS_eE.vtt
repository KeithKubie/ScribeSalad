00:00:08.146 --> 00:00:10.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Hello, Doctor Greb.

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:11.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Hello, Cora.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:12.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These students

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:15.806
at New Jersey's Montclair State
University are practicing a

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:16.896
classroom greeting.

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:18.106
&gt;&gt;Man: Hello, Laura.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:19.906
Now do I-- ?

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:22.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's part of the fun
and excitement of becoming the kind

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:26.116
of teacher the school describes
in its portrait of a teacher.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:28.496
&gt;&gt;Ada: One of the things
that sets us apart is

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:30.416
that we do have a very clear vision

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.536
for what we believe constitutes good
teaching and learning and schooling.

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:37.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So why do activities
in your classroom like this?

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:40.906
&gt;&gt;Ada: Learning to teach takes place
over the course of an entire career,

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:45.316
and what we are committed to
do is to prepare our students

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:50.266
to be excellent beginning teachers
who know how to continue to learn

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.186
and grow and develop as teachers.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Everyone look at
me, everyone give me the sign.

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:57.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Montclair
has developed a network

00:00:57.716 --> 00:01:01.656
of some twenty-five partner school
districts in the area, where students

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:06.936
like Andrea Mayernick can get their
first exposure to the classroom.

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.206
&gt;&gt;Andrea: They really push
hands on, jump right in there,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.756
get your feet wet,
because in the end,

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:14.716
that's where you need
the most experience.

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:16.726
You learn the most from practice.

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:18.546
&gt;&gt;How many hops till twenty?

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Mayernick student
teaches at Bradford Elementary School

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.306
with her cooperating
teacher, Serena Swain.

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:28.136
&gt;&gt;Serena: You're going to
guess or take an estimate

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:31.316
of how many pennies you
can grab with your hand.

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:35.206
&gt;&gt;Andrea: I'm in the first grade
with Miss Swain and it's just been

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:39.296
such an amazing experience to
just interact with the children

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:42.296
on a daily basis and
to be with Miss Swain.

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:43.866
She's an amazing mentor.

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.456
&gt;&gt;Serena: I don't know if this
surface is really good for grabbing,

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.636
so maybe use a slate
or a book, something.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:51.496
&gt;&gt;Andrea: The preparation, I need,

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:54.826
and it's really given me the
confidence that when I take

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:56.556
over my own classroom, I can do this.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:59.756
I'm capable, and I can do it well.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:03.246
&gt;&gt;Fran: You can't learn how to
teach in a vacuum and reading

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:06.216
about teaching in a
book, watching a video,

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:09.386
albeit might be very interesting
and helpful, you've gotta roll

00:02:09.386 --> 00:02:10.786
up your sleeves and
you've gotta get into it.

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:14.026
We want them to see the complexity of
what it means to be in a classroom.

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:16.306
&gt;&gt;Joe: And let's count back fourteen.

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:19.356
&gt;&gt;Student teaching,
well, it's a journey.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.196
I sped a lotta time at home
doing lesson plan preparation.

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:26.946
I observe my cooperating
teacher a lot, trying to pick

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.356
up on her style of teaching.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.026
&gt;&gt;Who could tell me what
these are, [inaudible].

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:31.916
It's something just like this, only--

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:33.916
&gt;&gt;And all the support
that Montclair State has

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:37.586
to offer has been great too, because
you need a lot of support for this.

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:39.246
&gt;&gt;So what numbers do
we have to subtract?

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:42.756
&gt;&gt;Naomi: One of the things I'm trying
to teach Joe is, sometimes you have

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:44.306
to be flexible within your planning,

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:46.216
and so I let him see my
lesson plans as well.

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:49.366
They're certainly not as
thought out and as detailed,

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.666
because you just don't have the time.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.786
If I spent three hours planning every
lesson, you know, I'd have no life.

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:58.216
&gt;&gt;Fran: Your lesson was
incredibly well planned.

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:00.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once a week, student
teachers meet with their professor

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:04.566
and cooperating teacher to get
feedback on their progress.

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:07.436
&gt;&gt;Naomi: You know, aside
from the emotional benefits

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:10.856
and positive feedback that you
gave to them, when you're talking

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.726
about difference, maybe write the
actual number model on the board.

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:16.506
So instead of-- and explain what
that is, that you're subtracting

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:18.006
from the higher number
to the lower number--

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.636
&gt;&gt;Joe: I go home at the
end of the day smiling,

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.006
even though I'm stressed out, even
though I know I still have an hour

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:25.666
or two at home planning,
I feel good about it.

00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:27.006
&gt;&gt;Who can tell me what a mile is?

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:30.476
&gt;&gt;Man: So using this panel
right here, we have control

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.516
over the whole room, so we
can turn the lights down--

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of their
emphasis on technology,

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:40.236
Montclair created several classrooms
of the future where students

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:43.806
and recent graduates can try
out tech-infused lessons.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.976
&gt;&gt;Man: This controls
everything in the classroom.

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:48.236
Now I'm actually gonna put it
up on the vacuuming camera,

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.036
so you can see what we're looking at.

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.096
&gt;&gt;Ada: And when our graduates
are out in the schools,

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:55.176
they're always welcome to bring
a class here, if they don't have

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:56.756
that capacity in their school.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:01.016
And we work with the teachers
in our partner schools as well,

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:03.716
so that their comfort level goes up.

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:07.126
&gt;&gt;Man: Okay, so you're gonna vote on
which president you wanna research,

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:09.336
and each student's gonna
come up with one clue.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To play an
historical WebQuest game,

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:15.596
this fifth grade class was divided
into two adjoining classrooms

00:04:15.596 --> 00:04:17.436
that were linked by a teleconference.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:20.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So where do you
think might be a good place

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:23.486
to start searching for
information on James K. Polk?

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:24.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Google.

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.496
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Great place to
start, what do you think?

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:28.786
&gt;&gt;Student: You would
do Wikipedia too,

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:32.176
because it has a lot
of the information.

00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:33.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, yes--

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:37.756
&gt;&gt;Ada: People will often say,
"Aren't you teaching your students

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.136
about technology that
they're not gonna have access

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:42.196
to when they actually go
out in the classrooms?"

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:46.636
That may be true to some
extent but what we've found

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:50.766
and what the research shows is
that there's a lot more technology

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:53.846
in schools than teachers
actually know how to make use of.

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:57.146
The students may, but the
teachers are not that adept.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so we are going
to come up and read our clues.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:04.776
&gt;&gt;Student: He only served
on term as President.

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:09.946
&gt;&gt;Student: He lost an election
in the early nineteen hundreds.

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:14.396
&gt;&gt;Ada: By raising our students'
comfort level with trying

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.756
out new things and with doing
different things, they learn how

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.546
to have their students create blogs.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.386
They learn how to teach
their students

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:24.646
to make digital stories,
as a literacy strategy.

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:26.946
So they're not intimidated
by what's there.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, so
our guess for President,

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.536
we're gonna say it all together.

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.626
&gt;&gt;All: James Polk.

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:37.216
&gt;&gt;Ada: And then we hope that they
will advocate for more technology

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:38.996
in the schools that they teach in.

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:40.956
&gt;&gt;Amanda: We're a lot more
concerned with getting

00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:42.996
through the curricular
goals and standards.

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:46.636
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Montclair believes that
new teachers need to be prepared

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:49.196
to face the challenges of
their profession head on,

00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:52.706
and when necessary, become
advocates for change.

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:54.636
&gt;&gt;Fran: Teachers have
to have a voice.

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:56.816
Right now, standardized
tests are a reality.

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:58.946
The question is, how
do we deal with them?

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:01.556
Yes, we do have to prepare the
students for some of the tests,

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:04.756
but we also have the obligation
to advocate for something

00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:06.766
that we think may or
may not be appropriate.

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:11.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So I think [inaudible]
would be going for all students.

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:13.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the school's
urban teaching academy,

00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:15.156
students study everything

00:06:15.156 --> 00:06:20.066
from culturally responsive curriculum
design to school finance issues.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.216
&gt;&gt;Ana: What I'm hearing, you're
taking a political strategy.

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:24.246
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:26.036
&gt;&gt;Ana: We can't change
it all overnight.

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:29.746
There's going to be political
resistance to it, and that's part

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:33.426
of the struggle with
equalizing funding.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:37.116
&gt;&gt;It's important for them to
not only see the problems,

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:41.346
but begin to envision possibilities
for bringing about change.

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:46.376
And in order to be an agent of change
in schools, you have to be informed.

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:48.446
If you don't know how
schools are funded,

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:52.386
if you don't know how monies are
distributed, you cannot put pressure

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.786
and act in ways to bring about
the changes that are needed.

00:06:57.136 --> 00:07:01.416
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I will never be, you know,
absolutely ready, because teaching is

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:04.186
like this never ending journey--

00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:05.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At weekly
support group meetings,

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:08.486
the student teachers learn
to lean on one another.

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:11.896
&gt;&gt;Fran: A lot of times, new teachers
are reluctant to ask for help,

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:14.536
because they think that it
doesn't bode well for them,

00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:15.406
they should know everything.

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:18.106
And we wanna let them know that you
can't know everything, you know,

00:07:18.106 --> 00:07:20.086
and how to get assistance
when you need it.

00:07:20.426 --> 00:07:22.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The last thing
would be, what's the difference

00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:25.316
between what you estimated
and what you actually got.

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:28.286
&gt;&gt;Ada: I don't believe that
good teachers are born.

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:31.416
I believe that we educate
people to become good teachers.

00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:35.766
Students come to us already with
a love of learning, and our job is

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:38.886
to help them translate that love
of learning and a desire to work

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.546
with children or young
adolescents and a desire

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:43.096
to make a difference in society.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:48.006
We need to take that and develop
it into a person who has the skills

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:51.386
and the strategies and the
knowledge to achieve that,

00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:53.166
because it isn't so easy.

00:07:53.396 --> 00:07:54.786
It's actually quite difficult.

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:59.186
