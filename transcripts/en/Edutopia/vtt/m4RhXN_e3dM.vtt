&gt;&gt;Class: I am a Concourse Village
Scholar, destined for success!

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:13.976
Educated by the best teachers on earth!

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.026
&gt;&gt;Alexa: What we're doing at our school
is we're all working toward the same

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:18.176
goal, we're all speaking
the same language.

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.576
We're able to have common
conversations across all grade levels,

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:25.566
so that it doesn't matter what
class your child ends up in,

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:27.736
every parent can rest assured knowing

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.566
that their child is receiving
a high quality education.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:36.956
&gt;&gt;Class: My achievements will leave
a lasting impression on the world.

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:49.636
[ sound of school bus ]

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:53.546
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Concourse Village Elementary
School is located in the South Bronx,

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:58.896
and we are categorized as the poorest
congressional district in the nation.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.656
However, by visiting our school,
you would never think that,

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:05.826
and that's something
that I'm really proud of.

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:09.226
When I was a teacher, it was about who
was the best teacher in the building.

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:13.366
And every year the children
needed to re-learn a new system,

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.776
a new language, a new structure.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.186
And it didn't benefit them in any way.

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:22.026
I wanted to create a school
where teachers felt community,

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:25.906
where everyone knew the children,
where we felt like a family,

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:28.936
and where systems were in place
for everyone to be successful,

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:30.976
not just the students,
but also the teachers.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:31.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good morning!

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Good morning!

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.176
&gt;&gt;Alexa: In 2013, I walked
into a situation

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:39.276
where the school that
existed was being phased out.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.756
So I did inherit the children
from the phase-out school,

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.976
and there was a major deficit
across all content areas.

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so what
does increase mean?

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.086
&gt;&gt;Alexa: We looked at
the reading levels,

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:53.806
and we saw that they had a low
literacy rate, and research said

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:57.886
if they're not reading on or
above level by third grade,

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.716
the likelihood of them ending
up in prison increases.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:05.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Two, one, begin!

00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:07.106
[ class begins Collaborative Reading ]

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:08.576
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So the first
year was very challenging.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:12.606
We trying to come up with a plan, and
see, "Okay, how are going to make sure

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.976
that all the children are reading on
grade level, so that they're prepared?"

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:15.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Thoughtful readers...

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:16.036
&gt;&gt;Class: Thoughtful readers...

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.486
&gt;&gt;Student: ...summarize what
they learned from the text.

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.066
&gt;&gt;Class: ...summarize what
they learned from the text.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.006
&gt;&gt;Alexa: When I was a reading
specialist, I did a lot of research

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:29.396
on reading programs and
what really worked.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:33.596
Immediately, Collaborative Reading was
a tool that I brought into the school,

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:36.136
because I knew that it
would align us across grades

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:37.976
and support creating great readers.

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:47.976
&gt;&gt;Class: Pete the cat was walking down
the street in his new white shoes.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.776
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Initially, a lot of people
did not understand the concept

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:51.796
of Collaborative Reading.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.936
So ensuring that all teachers
have professional development

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:57.926
and understood the research
behind it was vital.

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:00.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So the first thing
that we do is to make sure

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.976
that we know what the
question is asking, right?

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.466
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Once the teachers
started to see the progress,

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:09.466
and as soon as reading levels started to
spike up and our children were starting

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.126
to feel really proud and
confident, they were onboard.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:17.936
Today, we infuse literacy at all costs,
at all times, in all content areas.

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:20.156
So you'll see literacy in art.

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:24.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What would it feel like
to be on the street in this collage?

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.686
Provide evidence from
the work to support.

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:31.796
&gt;&gt;Alexa: In math, you will see children
engaging in the 3-Read Protocol.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.596
&gt;&gt;Student: The gist of the story was
each round they get a certain amount

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:36.266
of points.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.096
&gt;&gt;Alexa: And they'll use the
Problem-Solving Procedure

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:40.516
to annotate text.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:42.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So do we agree
with her so far?

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.086
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Another great practice

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:48.976
that is implemented schoolwide
are the Participation Cards.

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:51.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Remember to use
your Participation Cards

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:52.976
to agree or disagree with Owen.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:53.666
&gt;&gt;Alexa: These practices

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:57.156
that are consistent staples are
what allows us to create success.

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:01.166
Regardless of what grade
the child is in,

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:02.656
and how they progress
throughout the school,

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:05.816
the child still has the
same consistency.

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:07.586
When the situations are predictable,

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.946
the children feel a lot
safer, and so do the teachers.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:12.806
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So have a great weekend!

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.016
&gt;&gt;Alexa: We have a model
that we're a community

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:16.906
of one, and no doors are closed.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.196
No one is an island here.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:20.726
And we're sharing best
practices because we want

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:21.936
to be the best we can
be for our children.
