&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.190
So have you ever had the experience of making
friends with somebody and then later discover

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.180
that he's a famous rock star? [laughs]

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180
[laughter]

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.340
So I had that experience with our honored
guest today, Salman Ahmad.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.021
I met him at a United Nations and I was impressed
with his talents, his personal kindness, and

00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:32.369
his compassion. And so we sort of became like
instant friends.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.730
And then I discovered that he's a famous rock
star. It's like a member of the biggest band

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.690
and long lasting rock back in South Asia called
Junoon and he's a national Pakistani icon.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.350
And beyond being a rock star, Salman is also
an eminent humanitarian. He's a United Nations

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.360
Google ambassador. He played the first ever
rock concert in war torn Kashmir, and he's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.310
the first Pakistani musician ever to perform
at a Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.509
He is also helping to bring peace between
Pakistan and India and he's working to help

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.279
Pakistan's three million displaced people.
Such an amazing human being.

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:28.740
And my friends, please give a warm welcome
to my friend, Salman Ahmad.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.439
[applause]

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.991
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Thank you.

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.991
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: Thank you.

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:38.991
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Thanks for having me. Thank
you.

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:39.991
[sound of ticking]

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:40.991
Thank you and peace be upon you.

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:47.770
I've heard my friend Meng saying that the
culture here is of the "yes" culture, and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.590
we don't ask for permission but we ask for
forgiveness. So I shall begin this talk with

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.620
asking your forgiveness as well.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.759
[pause]

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:12.069
This is a time, 2011, the world is in flux;
cultures are in flux; there's a collision

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.260
of cultures happening and I find myself as
an artist born in Lahore Pakistan. Anybody

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.459
from Pakistan out there?

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.459
[pause]

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.520
So for anybody from India out there?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.819
So as you know you guys are all at Google,
but most of the career choices you get growing

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.709
up in Pakistan or India, like the ones I got,
were two choices: doctor and doctor.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.819
[laughter]

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.159
And that was drummed into me even before I
could learn how to say, "Mama" or "Papa."

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.390
Ami, Abba.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.469
And so my life has been, growing in a culture
with certain do's and don'ts but thinking

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.180
completely out of the box.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.879
My earliest memory, when I was growing up
we used to have family weddings in the backyard;

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.730
no five star hotels, no community centers,
backyards. And at our family weddings there

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.019
used to be Qawwali music. Anybody heard of
Qawwali music out there?

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:32.650
So my earliest memory was at a wedding where
I see two rows of musicians, a front row of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.689
lead singers with harmoniums, and a back row
of Tabla players and hand clappers; strong

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.459
hand clappers.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.930
And I was maybe six, seven years old but what
struck me was that the melody and the rhythm

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.230
it did something to my heart; went through
my ears and it connected with me, the vibrations

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.379
connected with me in such a way that it created
curiosity.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.299
[pause]

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.560
What is that? What is that?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.680
And one of the earliest melodies is of a poet
from South Asia, a renaissance man from the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.120
12th century -- his name was Amir Khusro and
Hazat Amir Khusrau, created, was the father

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.030
of Qawwali music. And his sole reason for
listening to a lot of Bhajan music which was

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.580
around at that time, I mean that's what he
grew up with was listening to Hindu devotional

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.880
music, the Bhajan music. His mother was Indian,
his father was Persian, so he had a lot of

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:49.740
diverse cultural influences: Arabic folk poems,
Persian melodies and he fused Bhajan, Arabic

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.040
folk music, Persian poetry, and out of that
came Qawwali.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.360
But although he was using existing building
blocks off elements that which were already

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.509
around, he came up with something completely
new and which took over the subcontinent.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:15.069
As you know, the region which is now India,
Bangladesh, and Pakistan, Afghanistan very

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.240
diverse, so many different languages, so many
different faith traditions, ethnicities, yet

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.600
through music, the communication of music
he was able to bring Hindus and Muslims and

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.280
people from other,-- later on in the Sikh
tradition as well together in unity.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.460
And the concept of unity was the reason. I
mean he didn't wanna be number one on MTV,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.190
he didn't wanna be Facebooked or Twittered,
he was just making this music 'cause he felt

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.949
it in his soul.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.880
And as a six year old, when I was listening
to this melody --

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.880
[plucks guitar string]

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.449
I have an electric acoustic which is not plugged
in so if you can't hear the chords --

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.990
[strums guitar]

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.530
forgive me.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.530
[laughs]

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.389
[playing guitar and humming]

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.069
So Amir Khusro came up with this melody --

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:18.650
[playing guitar and singing in foreign language]

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.410
[playing guitar in background]

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.169
And as he played--

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:38.090
There was this pulse to it which goes like
this.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.729
[playing guitar and counting]

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:58.000
One, two, three four. One, two, three, four.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:14.800
So he asked people who ever were coming together
to just connect with the pulse. And I'll ask

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.849
you as well.

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:16.849
Two, three, four.

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:17.849
[playing guitar]

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:18.849
Put your hands together.

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:19.849
[sound of people clapping to music in background]

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:20.849
[playing guitar and singing in foreign language]

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:21.849
And as you just did, accelerated with the
beat as one.

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.710
[playing guitar and people clapping to music
in background]

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.289
[playing guitar and singing in foreign language;
tempo increasing]

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:32.530
Your turn.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.479
[Salman Ahmad and audience singing in foreign
language]

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:38.479
Everyone.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.060
[Salman Ahmad and audience singing in foreign
language]

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.259
[Salman Ahmad clapping; audience clapping
and singing in foreign language]

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.830
[Salman Ahmad singing in foreign language
and audience clapping]

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:01.310
Keep it going.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:35.890
[Salman Ahmad singing and audience singing
and clapping]

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:53.180
[audience clapping and singing]

00:08:53.180 --> 00:09:14.790
[Salman Ahmad singing with audience]

00:09:14.790 --> 00:10:02.340
[Salman Ahmad playing guitar and singing with
audience who is clapping]

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.560
So that --

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.820
[applause]

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.400
Well, thank you for coming, coming along on
this experiment.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:22.380
But what music does is that complete strangers
facing each other can attune, synergize, and

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.120
have empathy for each other.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:32.730
And I've now been -- I graduated from medical
school and I told my parents, "Give me one

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:40.240
year to play music." But I didn't tell them
how many days in that one year. So they played

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:48.231
along and then they realized it's not gonna
happen to be a Sharif doctor.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.580
[laughter]

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:58.380
And on this journey, as I've felt about the
Qawwali, when I was 11 years old my family

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:05.520
moved to the States, to New York. And for
the first two years I was there, I moved at

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:13.390
the age of 11, first two years I was there,
my two best friends were TV and radio.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:19.020
And it seemed like, how do you make sense
of this culture which is so, so different

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.390
from where you grew up? Until one day a kid
in school by the name of Danny Spitz, who

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:34.600
went on to form the heavy metal band Anthrax,
he went to my high school. And he said, "Listen

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.000
Sal, you need to do something. You have to
get cool."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.380
[laughter]

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:51.200
And cool? So he said, "I have this ticket
in my back pocket." Danny was always, he was

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.770
selling something, so he said, "I have this
ticket in my back pocket. You can have this

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:03.320
red ticket. And it's for Monday night at a
show at Madison Square Garden and if you come

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.660
to this show, you will become cool." It was
that simple.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.700
And now I'm thinking in my head while he's
putting this ticket, there is my mother, conservative

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.930
Pakistani woman, sending me to a rock concert
in Madison Square Garden at the age of 13,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.580
is not gonna happen.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:29.080
But there was a whisper in my heart. Everybody
has a whisper in their heart, a passion, right?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.000
My whisper said, "Get the ticket."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.580
So I bought the ticket off of him and went
home and I told my mother that this rock concert

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.980
is happening and the entire school is going
to --

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.980
[laughter]

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.290
to see this rock concert and there's only
one ticket for a Monday night and I bought

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.680
this ticket.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.000
So my mother Shaheen -- she looked into my
eyes and she said, "If you do drugs, I will

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
disown you."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[laughter]

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.290
[pause]

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:02.670
Then she drove me to Madison Square Garden.
And I tell this story in my book, "Rock &amp; Roll

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.980
Jihad" as well. And as I got off three blocks
away from Madison Square Garden, I walk on

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.410
the pavement and I saw thousands and thousands
of kids long hair, torn jeans, peace signs,

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.830
and an expression which said, "dazed and confused."

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:26.030
And as I walked into the Garden it says, "Led
Zeppelin Live in Concert." And I didn't know

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.480
what Led Zeppelin was. It could have been
the Bay City Rollers for all I was concerned.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.510
But what was interesting was this cultural,
this community because for the first hour

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.420
there was no band out there, there was just
like these layers of smoke everywhere --

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.020
[laughter]

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.260
which smelled kind of funny as well.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.600
[laughter]

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.090
And so I was like this, almost like watching
it as a scientist of what happens [chuckles]

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.090
at a rock concert.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:03.170
So after waiting for about an hour the lights
go down and these four guys come up on stage.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:11.050
One of them has this two-headed guitar with
dragons painted on his pants and he starts

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.050
playing something like this.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:23.790
[strumming guitar Led Zeppelin tune]

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:29.950
And as he plays in, the drums come in and
the keyboards come in. All of a sudden everybody

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.990
starts screaming, "Kashmir!"

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.490
[laughter]

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.990
[pause]

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.160
Now if you come from South Asia --

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.750
[laughter]

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.140
you know that that is nothing to cheer about.
[laughs]

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.860
[laughter]

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.350
Yet, but for those three hours that I stood
in the 63rd row watching Led Zeppelin perform,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.010
it transformed me.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.450
Here was something, I was a complete cultural
outsider, didn't know what the songs were

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:05.300
about, what the lyrics meant, but I just intuitively
understood; just the way I understood Qawwali

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:13.830
music. That this is something very, this is
familiar, this is powerful.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:20.860
And so sound vibrations always stuck with
me as a teenager that sound vibrations are

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.160
not to be dismissed lightly, that this is
yet entertainment.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:36.750
I've followed my path, the whisper I'm talking
to you about, there's a saying by the poet

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:42.390
Muhammad Iqbal he said and I'll translate
into English, he said, "That whisper in your

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:49.870
heart has strength. That whisper in your heart
has strength. It may not have wings but it

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:55.230
has the power to fly." [Speaks in Hindi].
That whisper in your heart.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:01.670
And my whisper was saying that, "Yes, you're
stuck, you have all the reasons not to become

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.360
a musician. You have all the reasons not to
follow your heart, you have all the reasons

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.600
not to follow your passion, but this is who
you really are."

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.080
And I think once you start listening to the
whisper, it becomes louder and louder and

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:24.180
louder. And as I went through my career, and
my book is based on what I'm talking to you

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:30.600
about, I understood also that when you see
with the heart, all the masks fall down. Music

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.830
allows us to see with the heart.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.510
And recently in the last, all my life, social
service because I went to med school, my wife

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:48.380
Samina who's here, is also a doctor. We understood
that social service, healing has to be part

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.340
of whatever we do in our lives.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:56.560
So I've always tried to sort of balance arts
and culture and social service and our non-profit

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:06.250
organization SSGWI. There's a website for
it as well SSGWI dot org, uses arts and culture

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:14.709
to build dialog, to communicate and talk about
all kinds of things from India, Pakistan,

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:19.600
conflict resolution to HIV and AIDS and I
wanted to, I hope we're not running over time.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.939
I just wanna show quickly two of the kind
of videos that using arts and culture we've

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:26.939
done.

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:35.000
The first is titled, Alvida. And it's about
a Pakistani woman who lives with HIV and AIDS,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.470
lost her husband. This is a true story. Lost
her husband and then found herself ostracized

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:47.259
by a community in which there's great stigma,
there's great discrimination. And it was because

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:51.831
she stood up, she listened to the whisper
in her heart and she realized, "If I run away,

00:17:51.831 --> 00:17:54.460
where can I run away?"

00:17:54.460 --> 00:18:01.460
And her story was so empowering, so powerful
that I did a video for that.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:06.870
This is titled Alvida.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:12.159
[guitar music playing]

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:17.450
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

[guitar playing]

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.909
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:29.789
meri zindagi mein na sakoon hai na karaar
hai

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:49.190
mere paas bas teri yaad hain
tera pyaar hain alvida aa~

00:20:49.190 --> 00:21:06.840
alvida alvida aa~
mera saath jo diya mere dost shukriya

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.130

&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:45.649
teri chaahaton ke rahenge aaise silsilay

00:21:45.649 --> 00:22:03.299
kaise kahu yeh raaz tujhe
mera dil de aawaz tujhe

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:26.240
yun hi rahe tu mere baad bhi

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:35.059
alvida aa~
alvida alvida aa~

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:59.759
mera saath jo diya mere dost shukriya
mera saath jo diya mere dost shukriya

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:05.049
[guitar music fades]

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:06.820
[applause]

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:13.870
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Thank you.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:23.830
So this is an example of using arts and culture
to start a dialog, a difficult dialog. HIV

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:36.200
and AIDS is not only in Pakistan but India,
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, is a preventable

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:43.000
disease. But to communicate prevention is
the best cure, is very difficult. So we have

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.759
to think out of the box ideas. A lot of young
people in colleges saw the video and this

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:53.019
became number one on MTV they see.

00:23:53.019 --> 00:24:00.129
And so it gets -- just like movies and books,
music and music video allows us this sort

00:24:00.129 --> 00:24:02.070
of platform to start a dialog.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:08.610
I want to give you another short example of
that. During the summer, the greatest single

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:16.070
natural disaster on the face of the planet
was the floods in Pakistan. And it was bigger

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:23.399
than Haiti, tsunami, and the Kashmir earthquake
put together, yet it got zero coverage, very

00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:28.049
little coverage in the global media.

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:37.100
So I thought, "What can I do?" I mean, and
I looked at the tools that we have today,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:43.029
Facebook, Twitter, email, and I sent out this
sort of mass email to all the people that

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:47.659
I knew saying, "Look this is happening. It's
not being covered in the media. What can we

00:24:47.659 --> 00:24:48.659
do about it?"

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:55.110
I had written a song and I said, "A song is
a great place to start," [chuckles] and two

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:00.999
days later I got a lot of emails from people
saying, "We wanna help support this." But

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:08.029
one of them was from Peter Gabriel, the people
who I, one of the artists that, who really

00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:12.090
inspired me when I got out of college and
he said, "How can I help? I wanna do this."

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:19.940
So just from using social media, a digital
communication, Peter and I worked on this

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.230
song. This is a song called "Open Your Eyes"
and him coming on board doing this song with

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:32.759
me meant that now CNN did a whole program
on the floods in Pakistan, Al Jazeera did

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:40.769
a half an hour program on the floods in Pakistan,
Canadian television, BBC, and media channels

00:25:40.769 --> 00:25:42.909
in South Asia.

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:50.040
So it's -- I think if you don't act, sometimes
if you feel overwhelmed that this is so large,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.889
what can I do? But if you don't act, nothing
will take place. But if you take a step, it

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:59.149
starts a chain reaction.

00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:07.309
SSGWI is pretty much right now it's a start
up, but we've experienced 20 years of chain

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:12.009
reactions. Massive sort of chain reactions
and you never know what's gonna happen, what

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:14.879
door will open up, who's gonna walk through.

00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:20.139
This is "Open Your Eyes". Each single download
of this song from iTunes is – it's less

00:26:20.139 --> 00:27:17.960
than a dollar -- will go to flood relief

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.049
in Pakistan.

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:24.499
[guitar and synthesizer music playing]

00:27:24.499 --> 00:27:27.769
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:32.129
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:36.499
[guitar and synthesizer playing]

00:27:36.499 --> 00:27:38.679
[guitar playing]

00:27:38.679 --> 00:27:45.220
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad and Peter Gabriel: [singing]

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:51.769
Open your eyes
Open your heart

00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:58.309
Open your heart
Open your eyes

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:04.860
Open your eyes
Open your heart

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:11.399
Open your eyes
Open your heart

00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:15.759
[guitar and synthesizer playing]

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:16.850
[pause]

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.129
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Okay so --

00:28:20.129 --> 00:28:24.629
[pause]

00:28:24.629 --> 00:28:34.980
so after 20 years of seeing how empowering
arts and culture is: music, poetry, films,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:43.600
books, Samina and I -- we focused our attention
on using arts and culture to help communicate.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:50.769
We live in a world today – 2011 - in which
by the end of this year, there'll be seven

00:28:50.769 --> 00:29:00.059
billion people on the planet. And we are so
interconnected whether we wanna be or not.

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:08.269
So diseases like HIV and AIDS, global warming,
issues of global warming, terrorism, nuclear

00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:15.360
proliferation, they don't know any borders.
And these are all gonna be poverty, poverty

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.350
alleviation, none of this knows any borders
and the way we're gonna be able to make the

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:27.769
world a better place in the 21st century is
if we communicate solutions.

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:35.259
And so SSGWI is very much about communication,
finding solutions and creating a space, a

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:42.369
happy space, where everybody's saying, "Um
pun panama" and clapping in time.

00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:46.799
So it's only when we see with the heart, all
the masks fall down.

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:47.799
Thank you so much.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:48.799
[applause]

00:29:48.799 --> 00:30:00.629
Okay, so if there's any -- by the way I was
instructed to inform you by Samina that we

00:30:00.629 --> 00:30:08.580
have about seven DVD's and I think about six
books to give away. So whoever asks the first

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.899
13 questions [laughs]

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:12.399
[laughter]

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:18.970
that's I know an unfair way of doing this,
but the book is available. It's on Simon Schuster

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:27.110
dot com as well as on Amazon and all the proceeds
from the DVD will go to SSGWI and flood relief.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.110
[pause]

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:32.309
&gt;&gt;male #1: I'd love to hear, I don't know
if you're in for this more by Western musician

00:30:32.309 --> 00:30:42.940
[unintelligible] but I'd love to hear like
what [unintelligible].

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.251
&gt;Salman Ahmad: Sure, it's a great question.

00:30:46.251 --> 00:30:53.710
You know since the age of 11, I was growing
up in America, went to junior high and high

00:30:53.710 --> 00:31:01.899
school, I listened to everything from Zeppelin
to the Beatles to Santana and then progressively

00:31:01.899 --> 00:31:10.409
jazz, blues, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, just
soaking it all up.

00:31:10.409 --> 00:31:19.659
Now days I listen to Radiohead, Sigur Ros,
and I try to soak up as much as I possibly

00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:29.980
can but not just from rock but from opera,
jazz. My Desi or my South Asian influences

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:36.929
are, one of them is like I told you the story
when I was six -- Qawwali, I connected with

00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:39.389
it unconsciously at the age of six.

00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:47.400
But then later on one of the greatest, perhaps
the most influential Sufi singer of the 20th

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.580
century was Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.929
And I had, I tell his story in the book of
how we connected and this was when I was right

00:31:55.929 --> 00:32:03.919
out of college and to be, have him as a mentor
and see him. It was interesting -- this happens

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:09.019
a lot in South Asia that you look at western
music and you say, "Well, that's western pop

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:16.429
culture," and this is Desi music, but he was
 -- Nusrat broke the mold of the traditional

00:32:16.429 --> 00:32:21.529
Qawwali singer 'cause he collaborated with
Peter Gabriel. He collaborated with Eddie

00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:28.990
Vedder of Pearl Jam; collaborated with Mike
 -- one of the greatest albums really if you

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.379
get a chance to listen to is "Night Song"
with Michael Brook.

00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:41.989
And I saw that people who listened to rock
music like, rock singers like Robert Plant

00:32:41.989 --> 00:32:51.059
and even Jeff Buckley found Qawwali to have
the same intensity as the blues did. Which

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:57.510
I listen to it the same way, they have the
same emotional intensity. So my work, and

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:05.470
then obviously Bollywood, I listen to a lot
of old Bollywood music which is great.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.210
[laughs]

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.950
[laughter]

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.369
If you can just allow for the guy running
around the trees and --

00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:13.369
[laughter]

00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:14.369
[laughs]

00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:17.700
It's a circle. Yeah.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:24.850
&gt;&gt;male #2: [unintelligible]

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:38.290
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Yeah, that's a great question
again. Because the cultural influences that

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:47.210
were available in Pakistan when I was like
a child, you had much more coming in from

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.799
the West.

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:55.990
It was, look my mother went to a school called
Home Economics. It was set up by the Ford

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:01.629
Foundation. So there were American teachers
teaching in Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad and

00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:11.940
it was a much more outward looking culture;
but a very strong home grown culture as well.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.250
But rock music and all that was available
when I was very young. I didn't know that

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:23.110
much at that time, but in the 80s there was
a military dictatorship and a military dictator

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:32.230
by the name of General Zia came and although
he was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:37.760
those 11 years of military dictatorship completely
took the cultural vision of that country into

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760
another age.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:46.980
I write about that in great length. It was
very isolated. There wasn't really a cultural

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:53.240
vision. I mean all the culture he thought
that was permissible was basically the holy

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.530
book, the Koran, and that's it.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:03.370
And so Pakistan over the last 63, a little
over 63 years, has been a country where there's

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:10.700
been a tug-o-war happening between the forces
of I call progression and the forces of regression.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.120
And that tug-o-war is happening as of now
as well.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.890
[pause]

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:21.200
&gt;&gt;male #3: [unintelligible]

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:29.020
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Okay, so he wants to know
about the experience of performing in Kashmir.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:34.600
Does everybody know the political back story
to Kashmir?

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600
[pause]

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:45.950
It's this, a beautiful ethereal place in South
Asia where since partition of India into Pakistan

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:52.340
and India, there's always been sort of this
conflict.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:58.280
And when we went for the first time -- our
bend toured India for the first time in '98

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.950
 -- we got so many emails from Kashmir, from
Srinagar of teenagers wanting us to go and

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:08.970
perform there. And I asked the promoter, we
were doing a tour all across India, can we

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:16.040
go up and do a gig in Srinagar? So he looked
at me; he said, "Uh okay. Don't let your idealism

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.620
make you run off a cliff. It's never gonna
happen in this lifetime," he said. And this

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.990
is '98 when he said that. And I said, "You
know what? We'll see about that."

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:34.650
But it took 10 years. Ten years later we got
an opportunity from the South Asian Foundation,

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:41.370
again arts and culture based non-profit which
said, "Look we wanna start building bridges

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.090
and we think music is the best way to move
forward and especially the kind of music you

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:49.580
guys play. So will you come and perform?"
And I was a non-brainer. I said, "Yes."

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:56.370
But as soon as that got published in the news
in India and Pakistan, I started getting death

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:01.400
threats from militants. They said, "If you
land in Srinagar, you will be shot on sight."

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:07.070
So I kept that information from the rest of
the band. [laughs]

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.070
[laughter]

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:14.001
I said, "Yeah, look it's gonna be great. It's
May, it's gonna be beautiful. We're playing

00:37:14.001 --> 00:37:20.220
at this place called the Dal Lake." Anybody
been to Srinagar out there?

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.480
So let me describe this place to you. It's
a beautiful lake surrounded by the Himalayan

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:33.400
Mountains where legend has it that Ravi Shankar
gave George Harrison his first sitar lesson.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400
[laughter]

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.220
And that's where our stage was gonna be.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.440
So I said, "It's worth dying [laughs]

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440
[laughter]

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.580
to do this gig." [laughs]

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.580
[laughter]

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:49.740
And we landed in Srinagar and we got off from
the airport to the hotel in four bullet proof

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:56.600
Jeeps. And they were driving at 100 miles
per hour and there was like this sort of the

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.070
whole city was under siege.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:04.890
And what had happened was college students
who wanted to come were prevented from coming

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:11.280
by this barbed wire all around the place.
And until the day of the show, we didn't know

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.570
if the show was gonna happen. But an amazing
thing happened and I tell this, this is the

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.860
last chapter of my book also.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:22.470
Teenagers just decided they're gonna jump
over barbed wire. They're gonna get to this

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:29.790
place no matter what, and brave the bullets,
and there was obviously a lot of military

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:38.090
security presence as well. Literally guns
and roses because there are so many diverse

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.260
flowers there but so many guns.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:46.480
Yet when the music started, it seemed like
that the sun came out. Everybody was singing,

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:55.550
dancing, and it, I don't wanna sort of exaggerate
what arts and culture can do. For those two

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:05.010
hours, a door opened, a door of possibility
opened. And for me it crystallized again that

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:13.560
if we wanna start making this world better,
safer, we need to communicate with each other.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.321
And it was probably the most important concert
of my life -- that one, yet.

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:20.770
[applause]

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.270
Thank you. Thank you.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.820
&gt;&gt;female #1: [unintelligible]

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.380
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [laughs]

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.930
&gt;&gt;male #4: [unintelligible]

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:37.490
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Okay.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.670
[laughter]

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.180
Okay, so let me do this. How much time do
we have?

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.180
&gt;&gt;Chade-Meng Tan: [unintelligible]

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.180
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: So I'll finish with Sayoonee.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.180
Okay.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:53.100
&gt;&gt;male #5: I was wondering if you have any
thoughts on [unintelligible]

00:39:53.100 --> 00:40:04.640
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: So great question. Recently
last week on the 5th of Jan, Governor, my

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:11.810
namesake Salman Taseer was shot down, killed
by a person who disagreed with his views on

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.820
the blasphemy law in Pakistan.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:20.530
The blasphemy law very quickly is a manmade
law created by the same military dictator,

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:30.060
General Zia, who in order to segregate other
sex, Muslim sex, decided that if anybody's

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:36.420
gonna insult Islam or the Prophet of Islam
that there's zero tolerance and there's a

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.490
death penalty.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:44.650
And what happened recently was there's a woman
in Pakistan, Asia Bibi, who not that there's

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:51.810
any proof but the fact is somebody's accused
her of blaspheming, and so there's an automatic

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:52.810
death sentence.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:58.350
And what this Governor was trying to do was
to question, to look at, start a debate on

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:03.570
the blasphemy law. And just because he wanted
to start a debate, this man came and shot

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.810
him 27 times.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:18.161
So what I think, I think very clearly, and
again I'm not some -- I'm not a politician

00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:24.770
and obviously I'm not a theologian, but I
feel that Islam, that's my faith tradition,

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:34.020
it provides great platform for debate; has
for the last 1400 years. In the last 1400

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:41.830
years, there's never been anybody put to death
for blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:49.691
So in 1400 years all faith culture which has
now 1.5 billion of faith -- a tradition which

00:41:49.691 --> 00:41:57.850
is 1.5 billion followers, why is it that this
particular law which is a manmade law still

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:03.860
 -- isn't there a better way to sort of get
positive discourse rather than putting people

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.240
to death?

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.810
&gt;&gt;male #6: [unintelligible]

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.380
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Yeah.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.950
&gt;&gt;male #6: [unintelligible]

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:20.520
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Yeah.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.090
&gt;&gt;male #6: [unintelligible]

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.660
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Yeah.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.240
&gt;&gt;male #6: [unintelligible]

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:38.320
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Well you know Martin Luther
King said it well. He said, "It was the appalling

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:44.661
silence of the good people." It wasn't so
much of the bad people, the rank core of the

00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:48.060
bad people, I'm paraphrasing, but the appalling
silence of the good people.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:55.600
So I think the first step is to recognize
what you just said. That this is goes against

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.610
everything that human rights stands for, goes
with everything that Islam stands for.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.970
There's a line in the Koran which says, "If
you take one life it's like killing the whole

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:13.330
of humanity." And 99 percent of the verses
in the Koran start with, "In the Name of God

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.360
the most compassionate, the most merciful."

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:25.600
So my way would be to have a culturally sensitive
dialog. Not people accusing, finger pointing,

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.561
but talking about areas where we agree and
disagree. There has to be a serious dialog

00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:31.561
about this.

00:43:31.561 --> 00:43:39.900
Right now in Pakistan the situation is, there's
a great political turmoil going on. And people

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:47.880
just like here, after the recent sad events
in Arizona, what started happening was this

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.870
sort of finger pointing going on.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:54.350
And I thought that speech the other day that
President Obama made was a great speech where

00:43:54.350 --> 00:44:01.960
he said, "We can disagree with each other's
ideas, but not question their love for our

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.740
country," or in Pakistan's case the people's
love for faith.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:15.240
I think a lot more people, artists, religious
leaders, writers, politicians -- you need

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:21.220
a basically a critical mass of people coming
together and isolating that. This is actually

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.660
a very deep question.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.780
&gt;&gt;male #6: I know.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.330
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Yeah. Difficult.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.470
&gt;&gt;male #7: [unintelligible]

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:37.920
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Could you speak a little bit
louder?

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.070
&gt;&gt;male #7: [unintelligible]

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:51.960
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: What have been my experience?
Well I've give you a very simple. My mother's

00:44:51.960 --> 00:45:00.830
family comes from Patiala which is in India,
it's in sort of Eastern Punjab. And my father's

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:07.230
family comes from Lahore. And throughout my
whole life when I grew up in Lahore, Patiala

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.390
was a place that my grandparents told me about
'cause that's where they lived for 300 years.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:16.570
And so they would tell me about the City of
Patiala and the music and the cricket and

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:21.340
the food and the jokes and the humor. And
so there was a picture in my mind as a child

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.560
of this place of fun.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:30.820
So when I toured India, I got a chance, we
got a chance to play in Patiala. And I actually

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.750
was taken to the house where mother was born
in. And when I saw that house it, these are

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.030
visceral things; our connection to culture.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:47.350
I couldn't just take a picture of it and go
back home. I needed to do something with it.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:55.150
And so I wrote a song. Then I asked one of
India's great classical singers, Shubha Mudgal,

00:45:55.150 --> 00:46:01.750
if she would sing on this song with me. And
so this song called "Ghoom Tana", not only

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:07.550
did we record this song, but we shot the entire
video in Patiala and in Lahore.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:13.150
And the house, it's on YouTube, it's called
"Ghoom Tana". It's shot in my mother's home.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.060
I mean well where my mother was born in, the
house that my mother was born in.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:22.750
So the experience is that -- look -- when
we take a step towards another, they take

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:30.080
many more steps towards you. Yes, there are
bad people everywhere. There are people who

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:36.400
just have very fixed views, inflexible ideologies,
but why let them take center stage?

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.370
Right now what's happening is you have extremists
who have the loudest voices, who get covered

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:47.010
in the news the most. They're on the front
page everywhere screaming at each other, where

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:51.810
there's a huge silent majority which thinks
about these things in a very different way,

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:59.050
but they don't make themselves heard. And
so my experience is that this catalyzes that

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.150
communication.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.150
[pause]

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:10.660
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:17.870
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: So collaborations yes.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:26.060
So aside from Peter Gabriel and Shubha Mudgal,
and I did a song with Melissa Etheridge as

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:34.060
well. She's written the intro to my book.
I mean I've collaborated with lots of very

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.560
well known and not so well known musicians.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.600
And like I said musicians, there's three C's.
If you're -- when we sit together if you're

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:52.910
a musician, there're three C's that come.
One is communication, compassion. Out of that

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:58.010
communication and compassions comes creativity.
And the interesting thing about jamming is

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.120
that we don't really know where we're going.
[chuckles] It's not like here's a road map

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.390
and if you hit an A chord, I'll go there.
It's like what do you wanna say? And you say

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:10.780
something and then there's a response. And
then there's a counter response and out of

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:20.270
that comes music and a deep dialog. That's
what I've got from whoever I've collaborated

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.930
with.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.590
[pause]

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:41.850
&gt;&gt;female #2: [unintelligible] How can we hold
the door open [unintelligible]?

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:51.140
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Okay, so great question. How
can we sustain the dialog, the sort of these

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.660
glimpses that you get at concerts and people
coming together?

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:02.120
I mean there's been great over the years,
like you look at Live Aid, look at Live Eight,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.810
stuff that Bono and Bob Geldof has done.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:16.420
Yet people think that just because artists
came together and did a show that that's enough.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.620
And so you can move on. But that's just opening
the door. You see artists can only open the

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.250
door; people have to walk through those doors.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:32.290
Now a lot of you here, I mean this is Google
Earth. [laughs] You have the velocity here,

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:40.460
the connectivity here, to amplify the voices
who wanna change the world for the better.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:46.291
And that's what I'm talking about as a collective,
but also on an individual level you can do

00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:52.800
a lot. We're, we don't need CNN, we don't
need the New York Times, or Al Jazeera or

00:49:52.800 --> 00:50:03.670
whatever, we have our own networks. And we
need to use those networks wisely.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:12.590
I mean you can connect with me on Twitter,
I'm Sufi Sal, S-u-f-I S-a-l and look I'm here

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:17.520
to be educated. If there's some ideas of how
we can amplify the voices of unity we're there.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:23.410
And I have a lot of music friends all around
the world who are just a touch of a button

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.410
away.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:25.410
[pause]

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.430
&gt;&gt;male #7: [unintelligible]

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:31.990
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: Last question. You got one?
[laughs]

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.990
[laughter]

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:36.820
Ahhh. We have very few ladies asking questions.
So --

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.430
Yeah, you had your hand up.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.240
&gt;&gt;female #2: [unintelligible]

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240
[laughter]

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.640
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [chuckles]

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.640
[laughter]

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.590
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: So when I played at the Nobel
Peace Prize ceremony I go to my mother, "You

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:55.220
know we played at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony."
She said, "Beta, son, when are you gonna become

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.000
a doctor?"

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.590
[laughter]

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.180
[applause]

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.010
Thank you so much. Thank you. [laughs]

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.010
[applause]

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:10.640
&gt;&gt;Samina: Yeah, hello to everybody. I would
like to thank Meng for inviting us here. It

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:17.461
was such a pleasure to meet you in New York
at the U.N. TED and thank you to Zeeya as

00:51:17.461 --> 00:51:24.800
well and Nabil who drove us here. It's always
a team effort. We're so delighted to be here.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.530
Thank you so much. And Google is so dear to
us. We have attended two zeitgeist conferences

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.620
as well where Salman has performed.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:38.040
This particular trip is special. We have a
concert on Sunday at the Spangenberg Theatre

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.250
in Palo Alto. And it's called a Unity Jam.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:48.130
So one of the things that SSGWI does is also
to collaborate between Jewish, Christian,

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:53.370
and Hindu artists and we do this activity
once a year. It's usually on Martin Luther

00:51:53.370 --> 00:52:01.601
King Day, so if anybody is interested in seeing
a klezmer musician or like a klezmer artist

00:52:01.601 --> 00:52:10.770
group called Common Chords perform with Junoon,
please come at seven p.m. in Palo Alto Spangenberg

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.790
Theatre. It's called Unity Jam. We would love
to see you there.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:22.210
And on another note, do go on SSGWI dot o-r-g
and check out if you have an interest in helping

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:27.280
out in our projects. We do interfaith work
using art and culture, but we also work in

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280
health and education.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:34.170
I just came back from Pakistan on the 6th
of January and I'm working on two projects

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:39.190
there. One is the Women's Wellness Initiative
which is teaching the Pakistani woman how

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:43.100
she can take care of herself, mind, body,
spirit.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.201
Because that particular woman that I'm talking
about does not have access to health like

00:52:47.201 --> 00:52:52.910
all of us do. She is illiterate, she doesn't
have access to a good hospital and doctors,

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:58.980
so the concept is to do workshops for this
woman and to empower her so that she can raise

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.960
a happy, healthy family where the children
are not going out to join the Taliban's. And

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:10.100
she has confidence as a woman, has high self
esteem, and teaches tolerance to her community

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.860
thereby becoming a community leader.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:17.800
So it's a wonderful program. I really feel
preventative medicine is the future of Pakistan,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.470
and of all the other underdeveloped countries
who don't have access to health care. So support

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.500
us on that.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:27.510
And the other project that we're doing is
called Build a Village. We've already identified

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:33.190
a village in Sin, in Nata. I visited those
people, they are 20 families; they've lost

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:38.180
their homes; they've got nowhere to go. And
this project is all about building a holistic

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:44.600
village for them which will not only provide
shelter, but will also make education, health

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.600
accessible to them.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:51.140
So really, once again, Meng thank you for
giving us an opportunity to talk about our

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.540
work. And thank you for coming here. Thanks
a lot.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.540
[applause]

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.540
[pause]

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:04.660
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: So we were talking about arts
and culture. The first time I saw Samina,

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:12.440
I was 17 years old and she was singing a song
and that song connected me. So it works. [laughs]

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.780
[laughter]

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:22.400
Okay, so Sayoonee. Sayoonee, the word means
soul mate. And this is a song which really

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:28.460
opened up my eyes to India from a cultural
standpoint because we were touring the country

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.550
and wherever we just sang this song, it seemed
like you made more and more friends. So it's

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:37.480
an easy job.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.330
So if you come to the show day after tomorrow,
we'll do this with the whole band, but right

00:54:41.330 --> 00:55:34.650
now I'll play you a little part of this.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:55.750
[playing guitar]

00:55:55.750 --> 00:56:17.640
[audience clapping in time to music]

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.640
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.040
Sayoonee, Sayoonee
Chen ik pal Nahin

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.160
Chen ik pal Nahin
Chen ik pal Nahin

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.230
Aur koi hal Nahin

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.230
Sayonee, Sayoonee

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.230
[guitar]

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:26.230
Kon morae muhar
Kon morae muhar

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.230
Kon morae muhar
Koi Sanval nahin

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.230
Ohh

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.610
Chen ik pal Nahin
Chen ik pal Nahin

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.730
Chen ik pal Nahin
Aur koi hal Nahin

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:32.730
Sing with me.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:36.470
Sayoonee, Sayoonee

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:40.590
Your turn.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.720
&gt;&gt;audience singing:

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.840
Sayoonee, Sayoonee

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:55.030
&gt;&gt;Salman Ahmad: [singing]

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.090
Sayoonee

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:59.160

Thank you.
