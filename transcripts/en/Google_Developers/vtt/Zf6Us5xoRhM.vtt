[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:06.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.690
ELISABETH BARGES: Thank
you very much to be here.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.090
Very happy to have this
discussion with you tonight.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.010
So maybe a few words
about each of you, maybe

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.660
starting with Ludwine, because
I have your name on my paper.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.520
No, nice to see you Ludwine.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.530
We already know each other.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.945
A few words about you--
so actually, you're

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.080
a data engineer at
Leboncoin, right?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.170
LUDWINE PROBST:
Yes, from tomorrow.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.610
I start tomorrow on my new job.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.890
ELISABETH BARGES:
OK, congratulations.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.010
LUDWINE PROBST: Thank you.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.860
ELISABETH BARGES: Yes, congrats.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.376
OK, and Sophie
Bled, can you-- so

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:52.280
you're co-founder of Gloomywood.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.980
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
Yes, you said it.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.870
ELISABETH BARGES: OK.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.550
Nothing else to add
about what you did?

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.145
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.020
ELISABETH BARGES: Please
use your microphone.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.500
It's working.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.870
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Hello?

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.209
ELISABETH BARGES: Yes.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.500
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: So Gloomywood
is a very young studio,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.850
created one year ago.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.950
And we are focusing on
our first video game.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.220
It's "2Dark," and we hope
it will be a success.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.570
And it's very exciting.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.910
We are supposed to be at
the end of production,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.480
but everything is not finished.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.990
But it will be amazing.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.086
ELISABETH BARGES: OK, great.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.930
And what about Emily?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.110
You're running Women
Who Code, right?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.860
EMILY REESE: Yeah.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.280
I run Women Who Code, which
is an organization here

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.727
in Paris for women who
already work in technology.

00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:38.310
And that's only in the evenings,
though, when we have meetups.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.730
And then during the day, I
teach French and English code

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.094
courses, how to build
websites and design websites.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:46.510
And I've been living in Paris
for about a year and a half.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.680
But as you can hear,
I'm from the US.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310
ELISABETH BARGES: OK,
thank you very much.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.370
Melanie, you are co-founder
of Atelier [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.590
I will say it in French maybe.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.690
MELANIE CHRISTIN: 801,
if you want, in English.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.720
ELISABETH BARGES: Yeah.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.692
MELANIE CHRISTIN: We are a
small indy game studio company,

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:09.960
and we found the company over
the success of our first video

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.750
game, that is Transformice.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.160
It's a massively
multiplayer browser game.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.750
And now we have 10 employees,
and we just run the company

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.584
and make more games.

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:22.000
ELISABETH BARGES:
Very impressive.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.120
Congratulations.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.940
So maybe to start
the discussion,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.150
I will start with something
inspired from the talk we just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.670
listened from Camille.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.580
Can I ask you,
maybe to you, Emily,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.370
the moment when
you were thinking

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.010
that you found your way?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.660
EMILY REESE: Yeah, I
guess the most recent time

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.550
that I've been
thinking I'm lost and I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.299
need to find where I am and
arrive at a place was when

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.590
I was trying to move to France.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.364
I think--

00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:54.530
ELISABETH BARGES: Of course.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.924
EMILY REESE: I came here-- huh?

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:57.090
ELISABETH BARGES: Of course.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.540
EMILY REESE: Yeah, it's
actually very hard,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.610
which I think as Americans we
don't recognize all the time,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.901
to move to a different country.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.080
So I had no visa or
rights to come here.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.050
I had to find a job
and be sponsored.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.840
And I think as women,
there are a lot less women

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.730
that travel abroad
internationally and live

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.650
internationally than men.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.505
And I think as I've
been researching online

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:18.380
for other women going
through the same thing,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.527
adjusting to life
in a new country,

00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:22.860
it seems to be there are a
lot of women that follow men,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.240
like the man has a job, so
he goes to a new country,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.070
and the wife goes
along with them.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.230
And so navigating that, and
then also be in technology, when

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980
you're looking for a job,
and like Camille was saying,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680
you feel like you're
not good enough.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.440
And you're also looking for
a job in a foreign country.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.064
It's a lot of factors
at the same time,

00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:42.750
and you feel like you're
not worthy of being there.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.740
But I would say this
has been the greatest

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.560
personal inner success
that I've ever experienced.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.060
And it's just a
visa in my passport.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.980
It's nothing special.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.090
But getting a job
in another country

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.690
and living in a
different culture

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.370
and adjusting to
those rules was worth

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.170
the months-long struggle
and perseverance

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.472
of being able to build
technology in a new place.

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:03.430
ELISABETH BARGES: Sure.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.300
I perfectly understand
the difference

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.710
between countries [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.840
Maybe we also heard a little
bit from the talk of Camille

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.420
that it can be-- she talked
about the imposter syndrome,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.490
that we also have the default,
maybe sometimes, or some women,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.670
not to be proud of our
success, to share them,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.900
and to brand a
little bit ourselves.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.310
So maybe a question
to you, Sophie Anne.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.700
What is your position about
it regarding yourself?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.579
How do you advocate
for yourself?

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.120
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
Well, I have to say

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.630
I'm not good at this game.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.370
But I know I have to improve it.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.890
And the point is, sometimes you
just have to force yourself,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.150
because if you don't
advocate for yourself,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.560
the only person will
do it is your mother.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.682
And it's not enough.

00:05:11.682 --> 00:05:12.890
ELISABETH BARGES: Good point.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.710
Fair point.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.627
Do you have concrete actions
you are trying to do right now?

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:17.960
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Yes, I'm here.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.950
ELISABETH BARGES: Yeah, OK.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.210
Fair point.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.390
Fair point.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.390
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: So I
stay there in the office,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.020
either in my desk.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.540
ELISABETH BARGES:
Very fair point.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.995
Maybe I would like to also
have another point of view,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.510
[INAUDIBLE] Emily?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.616
Oh, sorry, Melanie, excuse me.

00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:33.544
Melanie, excuse me.

00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:34.472
MELANIE CHRISTIN: I
knew that would come up.

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:34.971
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:36.120
ELISABETH BARGES: Melanie.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.900
MELANIE CHRISTIN: What am
I doing to promote myself?

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.358
ELISABETH BARGES:
Yes, yes, please.

00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:42.050
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Well,
I use Twitter a lot.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.820
I'm not sure that counts.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.120
I'm not sure this works.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.900
ELISABETH BARGES: Yeah, it is.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.350
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Yeah, it's
very difficult for a woman

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.040
to advocate for herself, because
it's often taken as bragging.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.080
And self-assurance is
not well seen in women,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.150
because people think that
they are braggy and stuff.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.110
But we must do it.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.780
This is really, really
important for us to do it,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.800
because we need to
inspire the youngest,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.020
to show-- we need really
to force ourselves,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.090
like Sophie Anne said, to
advocate for women in tech

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.300
and to show the youngest
that it is possible

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.020
and that they shouldn't
stop themselves

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.912
from going into this field.

00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:33.370
ELISABETH BARGES:
I agree with you,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.580
and I also think that--
and I can apply this

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.250
to myself, that we probably
sometimes also need

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.850
to force ourselves to
connect with others,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.710
because it's also part of
branding to meet people

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.150
and say, yes, I'm doing this,
blah, blah, blah, et cetera.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.030
And so it's something where
I know that in each event

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.889
I come, I force myself to
speak at least three people,

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:00.430
I don't know.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.690
So sometimes it's not a
very-- it doesn't follow up

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.430
or anything.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.060
But it's a good
exercise, I think.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.440
And maybe a question to Ludwine.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.620
So you said to us that you're
going to take a new job very

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.860
soon-- tomorrow.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:27.515
So maybe a word about,
in your situation,

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:29.950
and regarding your experience.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.730
I know that you had a tough
moment in your career.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.336
And I would like to
know how you kept your--

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:40.780
if you did-- your
kept your confidence

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.540
and trust in yourself?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.530
LUDWINE PROBST: Yes.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.170
So the past year, I was-- yeah,
it has been very hard for me.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.540
I was in burnout mode, so
I quit everything-- my job,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.560
the city, Brest.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.100
And I came back to Paris.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.300
I was also very involved
in an association,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.840
but it was not really good.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.090
So yes, I quit everything.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.430
And then I was thinking
about, what can I do?

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.810
What can I do now, because
I don't have anything else?

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.550
And I worked so hard
to have all of this,

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.650
and now I have nothing.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.660
And I thought about
when I was a child,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.540
and I thought about my dreams.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.570
And I had a dream, and one of
my dreams is pretty common.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.020
It was about traveling
across the world.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:40.130
So because I had nothing to
lose, I decided to leave Paris

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.010
and to travel in Asia.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.210
So I'm just coming
back from Asia,

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.740
where I have been three months.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.100
And because I wanted to add
something very personal,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.870
I decided to meet tech
communities in here,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.370
and especially I wanted
to meet women in tech.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.944
I was curious about, OK, what is
being a developer in Malaysia,

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:06.640
in Nepal?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.270
Do they have the
same technology?

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.130
Do they use the same technology?

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.850
What kind of challenge
do they have?

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.260
What kind of startups
do they create?

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.290
And how many women are
working in tech in the here?

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.650
So as you can imagine,
it was very exciting,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.960
and it was awesome.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.730
I met inspiring women and men.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.820
And I don't know.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.790
I called this project
Tech Beyond Borders,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.810
because I wanted to learn
about other people in tech.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.350
And--

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.885
ELISABETH BARGES: So maybe
the tip in that situation,

00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:53.350
a difficult situation, was
to really go deep in yourself

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.170
and to find the
resource in yourself?

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.770
LUDWINE PROBST: I
think when someone,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.430
you are in a bad situation,
when you have nothing to lose,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.880
you can take risks.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.810
And I did.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.510
I was really sad,
and I decided just

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.460
to create something
positive with this travel

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.810
and to come back with--

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:22.913
ELISABETH BARGES:
With a lot of energy.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:24.371
LUDWINE PROBST: I
just want to say,

00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:26.250
if you are in a bad
situation in your life,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.170
it's not so bad, because
you can create something.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.800
Sometimes if you're
in a bad situation,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.350
if you have nothing to lose,
maybe it is at this time

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.980
that you can make
a big decision.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.734
For me, it was the case.

00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:43.650
ELISABETH BARGES: Yes.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:50.620
And I heard recently a very
successful entrepreneur,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.610
a woman, and when she
explained her story,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:01.660
she says that when she
heard a lot of, no, you

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.200
should not do that, you should
not create this company,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.680
this is a bad idea, this
is, et cetera-- very

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.950
negative opinions, so she said,
OK, so many people told me

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.660
it's a bad idea.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.910
Let's just try.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.785
And I was-- yeah,
I mean, she was--

00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:19.410
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: It
couldn't be worse.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.480
ELISABETH BARGES: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.990
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: It's
just it couldn't be worse.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.573
ELISABETH BARGES:
People depressed me,

00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:27.610
so I won't be more
depressed than I already am.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:33.180
So maybe Emily, you seem
to have a lot of energy.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.310
Did you-- not when you
came to France, maybe

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.570
another situation,
but maybe a moment

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.730
where you felt it was
a hard moment for you,

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.640
and you-- as Ludwine
said, what was your method

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.510
at this moment to try
to feel again your trust

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.630
and energy in yourself?

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.466
EMILY REESE: I think
of my past few years

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.340
as being like a series
of different struggles

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.923
and then coming out
on the other side.

00:12:00.923 --> 00:12:05.120
So before coming here to
France, I-- back story,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.537
I did not study, even in school,
didn't do any sort of master's

00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:10.370
in computer science,
could not have told you

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.870
what HTML stood for-- nothing.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.740
And I did my
masters in the arts.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.410
I was an artist and studied
art history and architecture.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.600
And my first job after
getting my masters

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760
was at Kickstarter,
which at the time

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.650
was relatively known in the US,
but we didn't operate anywhere

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.740
outside the US.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.500
And we had only had a handful
of really successful projects,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.010
so it was mostly
small-scale artists

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.014
and musicians and filmmakers
using the platform.

00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:37.180
So when you're working on
something really inspiring

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.096
like this, and you're
seeing that a website is

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:41.080
able to change people's
lives completely,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.330
like they're able to live
their dreams or this project

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.850
that they've had
in mind for years,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.980
they do it thanks
to just a website.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.080
So I thought it was
really important to learn

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.124
what this tool was that was
enabling people to live out

00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:54.540
the things that
they wanted to do,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.040
that they wouldn't have been
able to do without just typing

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.150
their stuff on a keyboard and
making a Kickstarter project.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.127
So I taught myself
how to code, which

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:04.210
in hindsight, to say the
sentence "I taught myself

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.790
how to code," is annoying,
because everyone says that once

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.290
they learn.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.706
And it makes it
sound really easy,

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.160
like it wasn't a problem at all.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.720
But when you're
coming from nothing,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.272
you're starting totally
from zero, that's

00:13:14.272 --> 00:13:15.480
imposter syndrome to the max.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.420
I was 23 at the time, and I just
finished a masters in a field

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.330
that I was really
good at, and then went

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.788
from being really
good at something

00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:24.590
to being completely
at amateur level--

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.140
amateur in the English sense,
not in the French sense, which

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.330
means beginner.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.574
And yeah, so just
pushing through that,

00:13:31.574 --> 00:13:32.990
and then having a
support system--

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.670
I know Camille was saying that
we have a tendency to attribute

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.310
our successes to luck,
which I would have said

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.750
was the case, because I
already worked at a startup.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.208
I already had access
to a code base

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:43.040
and developers who
kind of showed me

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.270
how to do this type of thing.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.640
And then I switched to
the engineering team

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.470
six months later.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.011
So if I hadn't been
in that position,

00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:49.970
I asked myself all
the time, would I

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.300
have been lucky enough
to end up where I am now?

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.652
But I think it's not luck.

00:13:54.652 --> 00:13:56.860
It's just being in the right
place at the right time.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.229
And if you're not in the
right place at the right time,

00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:01.270
you actually kind of are.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.362
You just find another key to
a different door that ends up

00:14:04.362 --> 00:14:05.570
taking you to the same place.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.800
So I would say, I don't know.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.560
Finding your way
is-- you never even

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.520
know that you're
finding your way,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.061
because you're always just doing
what you're doing every day.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.424
But you're actually on
a path, and you just

00:14:15.424 --> 00:14:18.090
have to look far ahead enough to
see where that path might lead,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.320
and then just stick to it.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.590
ELISABETH BARGES: Thank you.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:27.890
Another topic where we may--
I don't know, I'm not sure,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.600
but we may have
some-- I don't know,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.730
some difficulties,
which is negotiating.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:42.720
I think there are figures
about the way women are not

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.440
negotiating their salary.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.090
But apart from the
pure salary question,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.800
I would like to maybe ask
to you about that question.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.610
How in your company--
because you have a company,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.610
so you have employees,
and you have, of course,

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.360
negotiation discussions
about, I don't know.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.910
So what is the way you
are dealing with that?

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.120
Is it something difficult
for you, or not at all,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.394
or can you tell us about this?

00:15:12.394 --> 00:15:14.560
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: For me,
it's one of the best parts

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.290
of the job, because I like to--

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.090
ELISABETH BARGES:
Oh, interesting.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.770
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: I
like to find-- for me,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.380
a good deal is a
fair deal, so you

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.072
have to understand
what the other wants,

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:33.532
and where you are ready to go.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:37.130
So it's not only with
negotiating salary.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.810
It's also in a commercial
negotiation, so for everything.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.660
The best way is,
first, to know what

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.060
you want, what you are willing
to go so far with concession,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.550
what is your goal.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.470
Also, listen to the other
party, what they want.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.860
What is their motivation?

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.914
What is the key point?

00:15:57.914 --> 00:16:02.925
And you have to listen to
people and try to understand

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:03.990
where they want to go.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:11.043
And after you see what could
be the strategy, to have

00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:14.670
the-- each party is happy.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.710
This is the challenge, to
make each parties happy.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.510
And sometimes you
have to take the time.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.202
And I think that's-- when
you go to a breaking point

00:16:25.202 --> 00:16:28.920
in negotiation, you
have to have, oh,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.960
let's see that next week.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.020
Let's take the time to
just keep the door open.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.190
And after, you come
back a week later,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.080
and sometimes you
have just reconsidered

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:45.160
things, reconsidered with
another angle, and it fits.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.640
ELISABETH BARGES: So it's more
negotiations for your company

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.590
than for yourself, right?

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.304
I mean, do you think you
will have a different--

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.970
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: I
think it's the same.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.790
I think that the basis
of the negotiation for me

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:05.960
is just to understand
the point for each party.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.691
And this is horrible,
even in commercial,

00:17:08.691 --> 00:17:12.079
trying to interpersonal
things, to have

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:21.130
to understand what is the deal
and what does really matter.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.860
Why is this person in front
of you, in your office saying

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.270
this, this, this, this?

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.430
What does she feel?

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.690
What does she want, really?

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.620
And sometimes what she wants
is not what she's saying.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.300
So you have to go further,
the first sentence,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.642
and to take time.

00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:44.330
ELISABETH BARGES:
And still regarding

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:50.950
the fact that you
are managing people,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.640
what are your considerations
to hire someone?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.340
Do you have an ideal,
or a candidate or team

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.040
you want to build within your
company regarding-- I mean,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.380
your strengths and maybe
the things that you're

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.654
looking for within candidates
and future employees?

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:16.930
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Well,
the first, of course,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.730
is the skill and the competence.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:26.160
But after-- my goal is to have
a happy team that fits together,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.880
that can interact together.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.500
They will be happy to go
and happy to be themselves

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.030
in the morning, to have coffee.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.120
It's just because you are
working eight-- sorry, seven

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.753
hours a day.

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:41.926
ELISABETH BARGES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:41.926 --> 00:18:43.300
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
So the best way

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.540
to have good work is
to have a good team,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.015
and a happy team which is
not-- oh, no, not this job.

00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:51.230
I don't want to go.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:57.216
But people who are happy
together and happy to exchange

00:18:57.216 --> 00:19:00.490
and to build something
together, because we

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.990
are making video
games, but it's not

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.990
the video game of one person.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.390
It's the video game,
in fact, of the team.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.930
And this is what is
very important for me.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.340
ELISABETH BARGES: So
together, everybody

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.206
around a project, and to
have a common vision of this,

00:19:15.206 --> 00:19:16.900
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Yes, yes.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.316
ELISABETH BARGES:
Melanie, I don't

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:21.240
know if you want to add a word
about this, as a co-founder,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.830
also, of your company?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.410
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Yeah,
I manage also 10 people,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.000
so I'm in kind of
the same situation.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.070
I've had some management
problems earlier last year,

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.840
and it really took a
toll on the company.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.300
And I really want to
talk about it so people

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.080
can avoid it in any way.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.365
I'm really bad at
management, really.

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:46.740
ELISABETH BARGES: What does
that mean, you're really bad?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.090
I mean, I know a
lot of bad managers,

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.040
and they are managing.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.034
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Nobody
complains about you, Melanie.

00:19:55.034 --> 00:19:57.450
MELANIE CHRISTIN: You're not
talking to the right persons.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.330
I don't have a lot of empathy.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.790
I find it really hard to
read other people's emotions.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.380
This is something
really personal.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.350
So I wanted to tackle out of the
that the stereotype about women

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.530
being more sensitive and
more caring and stuff.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.765
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: We agree.

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:18.390
MELANIE CHRISTIN:
This is not the case.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.150
Really, this is not.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.770
I don't always understand
what someone is telling me

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.150
when they are telling me
something, because of course--

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.910
and it's not always
what they are saying.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.460
They don't always think
what they are saying.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.090
You have to read
beyond the lines,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.470
and I am really bad at that.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.862
And it created a lot of tension
in the company last year.

00:20:42.862 --> 00:20:46.050
And we didn't build
any company culture.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.750
We just let people roam free.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.450
And it was very bad from
a management perspective.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.690
People didn't feel they were
included into the company.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.740
They felt outside of it.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.420
They didn't feel included.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.750
And so we are making
things better.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.910
We are taking care of everyone.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.760
We are doing meetings one
to one every other day,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:21.100
and little perks and stuff, and
just talking a lot to people

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.600
so we don't have a bomb
coming from nowhere that you

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.782
didn't see, because it
can really harm you a lot.

00:21:29.782 --> 00:21:30.740
ELISABETH BARGES: Sure.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:41.010
And maybe it leads me to ask
you about, as you describe it,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.547
some vulnerabilities
we can all have,

00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:50.520
and maybe what can you
share with the audience,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.000
maybe, Ludwine, about that
question-- about understanding

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.970
yourself, your weaknesses,
your vulnerabilities,

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:07.850
and try-- I don't know,
to use it or to ignore it.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.402
I don't know, but how
do you deal with that?

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.005
LUDWINE PROBST: So I
started coding at 26,

00:22:16.005 --> 00:22:20.150
and like Emily, I didn't
study computer science.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.570
So I had a lot of complex.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:28.370
I felt like impostor's
syndrome, as Camille told.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.350
And for me, I find help
with women communities.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.440
So I joined Duchess
France four years ago,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:44.110
and it helps me a lot, because
I had a space, a safe space

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.470
to share my experience
with other women

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.490
and to learn from
those women, because I

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.000
wanted to talk at conferences
about technical stuff.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.870
But because I was
really scared, I

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.800
decided to organize
an event with women.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:09.980
So in this way, I had to
present and to give talk myself.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.890
So it was very motivating
for me and challenging.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.680
So for me, I think women
communities are very important,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.570
and you have a lot of women
communities in Paris-- Women

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:31.100
Who Code, Ladies of Code,
Duchess France, and others.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:38.370
So if I have an advice, maybe
join one of those communities.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.760
Maybe it can help.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.220
ELISABETH BARGES: Yes, we
know that dedicated events,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.700
like for example dedicated
events for women,

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.480
women feel more comfortable to
come to these kind of events.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.980
So I think it's really
important and useful

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:03.220
to have specific events,
because it seems that women are

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.930
more engaged and
willing to come,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:14.870
even if we can wish to have not
this situation always, but just

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.310
a transition one.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:23.350
Maybe I would like to conclude
with something more light--

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.970
lighter, and more about
your hobbies and yourself.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.630
Can someone tell me about
what books you're reading?

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.390
Ludwine again?

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.223
LUDWINE PROBST: Yes.

00:24:36.223 --> 00:24:40.120
For me, it's "Resonate"
from Nancy Duarte.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.900
It's a book about how
to make a nice speech,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.310
how to catch your
audience, because I

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.510
want to share my story,
my trip in conferences,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.770
so I want to learn and
make a nice speech.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.290
So this is my book.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.130
ELISABETH BARGES: Someone else?

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.550
The microphone.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.760
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
For me, actually, I

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.800
have a graphic novel.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.014
In fact, it's the bio
of Olympe de Gouges,

00:25:13.014 --> 00:25:16.350
which is a great figure
of the French Revolution.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.013
ELISABETH BARGES:
Very interesting.

00:25:18.013 --> 00:25:20.650
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: And,
well, she had a bad hand,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:25.960
but she did a lot of amazing
things for women of this time.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.522
And she stated the
rights of women.

00:25:28.522 --> 00:25:29.980
ELISABETH BARGES:
Very interesting.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.240
Thank you very much.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:38.510
And maybe another personal
question, about the sites,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.600
websites you like to visit,
I don't know, every day,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.880
each morning.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.380
Emily.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.380
EMILY REESE: Yeah, sure.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.700
ELISABETH BARGES: Don't
say Google, please.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700
EMILY REESE: Google.com.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.890
The "New York Times"
is the best money

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.880
I spend every month for
a digital subscription.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.588
I don't need the thing
in paper, but just

00:25:57.588 --> 00:25:59.610
being able to go to that
every day keeps me away

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.654
from the kind of
clickbait headlines

00:26:02.654 --> 00:26:04.070
that we're so used
to seeing, like

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.940
10 things that you must know
about this horrible crisis.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.200
So I think it's good to
invest a little bit of money

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.761
every month in some good
journalism-- keep you grounded.

00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:16.010
And then A List Apart, for
anyone who doesn't read it,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.051
is for people who are
building things on the web.

00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:20.770
It has a tendency to
go towards design.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.230
But there are great articles
written all the time

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.910
on building websites
for everyone,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.520
and not just for a
certain type of person.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.380
Like you can imagine
the photo of someone

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.620
sitting out in the
grass with their laptop,

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.920
and they're smiling, and you
don't know how they have Wi-Fi,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.869
but they're on the
website, and it's cool.

00:26:37.869 --> 00:26:39.410
You imagine that as
your target user.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.510
But A List Apart, a
lot of their content

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.860
focuses on making websites that
make people feel things and is

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.800
for someone who's
not your target user

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.217
normally, like someone who's
had a really bad day, someone

00:26:50.217 --> 00:26:52.591
who just went through a really
difficult life experience,

00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.760
and they end up on your
site, and you have a chance

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.820
to connect with them.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.490
The way that you design your
page makes them feel something.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.040
And if you can write technology
and write code and build

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.810
in that same way, where
you feel something

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.680
and the person on the
other side feels something,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.330
I think that's what
creative technology is.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.246
And I think that's the
direction we should go.

00:27:09.246 --> 00:27:11.800
So I recommend reading both
the "New York Times" and A List

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.967
Apart.

00:27:12.967 --> 00:27:14.300
ELISABETH BARGES: OK, thank you.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.004
And what about
apps, mobile apps.

00:27:17.004 --> 00:27:19.100
Melanie?

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.373
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Yeah, as
I said, I use Twitter a lot,

00:27:22.373 --> 00:27:26.350
so It's kind of always
open on my phone.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:31.070
Also, my most lifesaving
app must be Google Maps,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.320
because I get lost all the time.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.160
And so this really
changed my life.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.230
To have a GPS in my pocket,
and I can go anywhere and not

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.970
get lost, this was
really a life changer.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.510
And I use a lot also
an app called Day One.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:51.480
It's a journaling app that
I enter every evening what

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.260
has been going on in my day.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:28:00.260
And it keeps it synched
between all my devices.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.670
And you can add photos.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.710
So you can do researches,
like when was that,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.840
at what time was this event?

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.610
I can't remember.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:14.250
So you can search by tags,
or just some keywords.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.630
So you can find your journal
entries from that day,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.010
so you can remember
what happened

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.920
and have photos linked to it.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.970
And it's all private.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.760
So I like it to remember
everything that I've done,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.704
to learn from it.

00:28:28.704 --> 00:28:29.870
ELISABETH BARGES: Thank you.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.140
And I have a personal question.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.540
It's not-- you are not prepared,
but it's really simple.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.889
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Oh my god.

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:39.430
ELISABETH BARGES:
But I'm sure you've

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:45.630
seen this kind of movement of
people waking up very, very

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.540
early, like 5 o'clock
in the morning,

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.960
to start with, I
don't know, meditation

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.550
and then running and then
breakfast and then reading

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.020
newspaper and then
starting to work.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.916
Well, it looks
really amazing to me.

00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:05.140
I'm not really prepared to that.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.060
But I just would like to test,
to you as great entrepreneurs,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.950
great tech leaders, what do you
what do you feel about this?

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.070
Are you practicing this?

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.920
Yes, you are.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.500
EMILY REESE: A little bit.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.709
I like waking up really
early, going for a run.

00:29:21.709 --> 00:29:23.750
Being active is really
important when your job is

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.650
sitting in front of a computer.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.390
That's the thing that I like
least about development,

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.723
is you're sitting there all day.

00:29:27.723 --> 00:29:29.577
So wake up early,
have some coffee,

00:29:29.577 --> 00:29:30.660
get started with your day.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.243
I don't know, it's
really nice to just

00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:35.010
have some time with yourself
before going on the internet.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.030
MELANIE CHRISTIN: Yeah,
I walk to my work,

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.680
but that's not going to happen.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.150
I mean, I'm not going
to wake up at 5:00.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.912
This is not physically possible.

00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:44.995
ELISABETH BARGES: Ludwine?

00:29:44.995 --> 00:29:49.470
LUDWINE PROBST: No, I'm
more a 20 minutes person.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.050
I mean, I just need 20
minutes, and then I go to work.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.220
So yes, no.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.510
ELISABETH BARGES: OK, and you?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:04.970
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: Well, can we
negotiate 5:00 to go to 7:00?

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.910
So 7:00, it's just my breakfast
time, listening to news

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.370
and trying to
organize all my day.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.370
So I just-- the time for
me, because I usually

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.860
end very late with meetings
and things like that.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.680
So early morning is my time.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.520
ELISABETH BARGES:
So not the majority,

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.850
but the movement is gaining in
France, so I'm really afraid.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.850
SOPHIE ANNE BLED: I'm
doing yoga in the evening.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.100
ELISABETH BARGES: Yeah, great.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.950
I mean, yoga is great,
but not at 5:00.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:33.780
That's my only--

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.700
SOPHIE ANNE BLED:
Not at 5:00, no.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.050
ELISABETH BARGES: OK, thank
you very much to all of you.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.430
A big round of applause, and
I hope it was interesting.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.980
