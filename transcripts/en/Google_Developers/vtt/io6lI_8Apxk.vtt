00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.860
MALE SPEAKER: So welcome back.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.650
We're at Devoxx here with Tim
Bray, who just gave a keynote,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.810
big Google keynote.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.980
And Tim, welcome.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.030
You insisted on the
responsibility of developers

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.240
to take care of their own users
on the web because the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.540
web is maybe not such a
safe place after all.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.500
So what are their
responsibilities?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.310
TIM BRAY: Well, there's the
obvious ones that they think

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.400
about all the time, about having
a good user experience

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.500
and good performance
and so on.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.170
But what I was really worried
about today was more of the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.570
security things because, as I
said, it's a dangerous place.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.470
The most basic security of all
is keep your users' private

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.530
stuff private.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.770
And the most basic thing
you can do to achieve

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.670
that is to use HTTPS.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.610
HTTPS is there.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.310
It's available.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.400
It's off the shelf.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.800
It's free on the client.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.430
It's cheap on the server.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.780
I think basically people who
don't use it are skating a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.110
little close to the edge.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.930
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so how
about passwords?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.490
Is that something you--

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.600
you want to say something,
I know.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.950
Password management tools--
should we be using them?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100
Should people be storing
somebody else's password?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.430
Is it a good business
to be in?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.400
TIM BRAY: Yeah, well, on your
own passwords, I personally

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.130
use a product called 1Password,
of which there's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.870
many competitors.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.430
There's LastPass and
KeePass and so on.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.780
And so I have two passwords in
the world that I care about,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140
my personal Google password,
and my 1Password password.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.000
And that's a good
place to be in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.810
And I recommend those tools, but
they're kind of high tech

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.700
and kind of geeky.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.620
And I don't think non-geeks
are really

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.960
going to be wide adapters.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.250
And anyhow, typing a password
in on a mobile device is a

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.390
horrible experience.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.760
Nobody should ever
have to do that.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.110
So I think we should try and
stop using passwords as much

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.950
as possible.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.620
And to the extent you have
to use passwords, I think

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.710
ordinary application developers
just shouldn't do

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.820
that because they're hard
to manage, and it's

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.730
easy to make a mistake.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.050
And the penalty for making a
mistake and leaking passwords

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.730
is really very high.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.140
So if you can possibly
avoid doing

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.500
that, I think you should.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.760
MALE SPEAKER: So security's
hard.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.570
It's actually even boring,
I would say.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.110
I mean, other people think
it's exciting.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.115
TIM BRAY: It is hard,
and it's boring.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:08.750
MALE SPEAKER: It's boring?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.030
So where should people start?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.570
I mean, should they go back to
school and learn math and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.760
cryptography?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.310
TIM BRAY: Well, they should
learn how to turn on HTTPS.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.650
You can do that just by
reading web pages.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.780
That's the first thing.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.380
In terms of actually managing
people's identities, there are

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.260
identity providers.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.080
You can go to Facebook.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.750
You can go to Google.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.515
You can go to Twitter.

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:29.990
You can go to AOL,
microsoftlive.com.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.550
There are a lot of people who
will manage the task of doing

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.590
passwords and authenticating
people.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.030
And usually hooking them up is
not so terribly difficult.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.460
And I totally recommend
using those.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.150
MALE SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.210
Well, anything you want to
add about-- what are the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.370
responsibilities
for developers?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.100
Security is important.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.080
It's not an afterthought.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.170
Obviously, HTTPS is something
you should do.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.930
TIM BRAY: You know, I would
think that, right at the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.180
moment, if you could
do two things.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.740
If you turn on HTTPS and get out
of the password business,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.220
you've gone 80% of
the way there.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.700
Then you can start worrying
about other things.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580
MALE SPEAKER: And you will be
talking here, and people will

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.340
catch you on Parleys about--

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.740
you want to say maybe
a word about that.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.050
TIM BRAY: Nicolas Garnier and
I will be doing a session on

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.230
OAuth2 and OpenID Connect and
what developers can actually

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
concretely do right now today
in ordinary web apps, both

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.870
JavaScript heavy browser apps
and standard backends like

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.900
Rails and Django and Java to
make things more secure.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.160
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.280
So if people are really
interested in the technical

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.030
side and the security side,
OpenID Connect, and OAuth2

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.560
would be the two that people
should look at.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.500
That's the ones we're
investing at Google.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.280
TIM BRAY: Those are the
ones that Google

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.030
is betting on, anyhow.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.160
MALE SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.940
Well, thank you.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.190
TIM BRAY: Thank you.
