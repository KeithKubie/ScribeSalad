part of our training is to know what

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
part of our training is to know what
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630
part of our training is to know what
type of suture that is and and how many

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
type of suture that is and and how many
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.870
type of suture that is and and how many
knots it requires to have a good strong

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880
knots it requires to have a good strong
 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.000

of knot tying is something that we've

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
of knot tying is something that we've
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020
of knot tying is something that we've
we've learned since we were medical

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
we've learned since we were medical
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.990
we've learned since we were medical
students interested in surgery so when

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
students interested in surgery so when
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910
students interested in surgery so when
you see a medical student over in the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
you see a medical student over in the
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.979
you see a medical student over in the
corner just learning this we're putting

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
corner just learning this we're putting
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.889
corner just learning this we're putting
all of this pattern so that we don't

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
all of this pattern so that we don't
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.010
all of this pattern so that we don't
even have to think about how our time

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020
even have to think about how our time
 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.270
even have to think about how our time
there's so many different ways you can

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
there's so many different ways you can
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970
there's so many different ways you can
tie your knot one way is what we call a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
tie your knot one way is what we call a
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.720
tie your knot one way is what we call a
square knot this comes down as a perfect

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
square knot this comes down as a perfect
 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.910
square knot this comes down as a perfect
circle that would be considered a square

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
circle that would be considered a square
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500
circle that would be considered a square
knot and that's one of the most durable

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
knot and that's one of the most durable
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.619
knot and that's one of the most durable
knots if you pull it here then you can

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
knots if you pull it here then you can
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.110
knots if you pull it here then you can
convert it into something that you can

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120
convert it into something that you can
 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.109
convert it into something that you can
slip down so when you see people

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119
slip down so when you see people
 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.030
slip down so when you see people
practicing these in the background we're

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
practicing these in the background we're
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.760
practicing these in the background we're
having our brain laid that that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
having our brain laid that that
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.550
having our brain laid that that
circuitry down to our hands too we

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
circuitry down to our hands too we
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.410
circuitry down to our hands too we
automatically are saying I want this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
automatically are saying I want this
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359
automatically are saying I want this
type of knot and we just able to perform

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
type of knot and we just able to perform
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940
type of knot and we just able to perform
it as a surgeon and particularly as one

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
it as a surgeon and particularly as one
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890
it as a surgeon and particularly as one
that's dealing with delicate tissues and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
that's dealing with delicate tissues and
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.070
that's dealing with delicate tissues and
babies it's never perfect you strive for

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
babies it's never perfect you strive for
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.030
babies it's never perfect you strive for
that but you never stop practicing
