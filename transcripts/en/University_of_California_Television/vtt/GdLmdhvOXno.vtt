00:00:01.742 --> 00:00:04.492
(powerful music)

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.090
- Welcome to a Conversation With History.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.870
I'm Harry Kreisler of The Institute

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.470
of International Studies.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.520
Our guest today is T. M. Scanlon

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.010
who is the Alford Professor
of Natural Religion,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.000
Moral Philosophy, and Civil
Polity at Harvard University.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.350
He is the 2008 Howison
Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.360
His publications include
What We Owe to Each Other,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.753
The Difficulty of Tolerance:

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.030
Essays in Political Philosophy.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.519
Professor Scanlon, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:04.352
- Thank you.

00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:05.300
It's a pleasure to be here, Harry.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.990
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.810
- I was born in Indianapolis
and spent the first,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080
I guess, almost 20 years of my life there

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.627
before I went east to go to college

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:17.070
and sort of never returned.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.050
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.710
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.660
- Well, my father was a lawyer.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.810
And he loved the law and the Constitution.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.910
So legal questions,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.400
questions of legal policy

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.990
were an important part of
the dinner table conversation

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.020
as I was growing up.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.120
And he and my mother had also
both been quite interested

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.580
in philosophy as undergraduates,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.770
although that wasn't their major.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.190
But it certainly had a big impact on them.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.720
So the idea that there was
this subject called philosophy

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.710
was something I knew about even though

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.030
I never read a philosophy book
or it never appeared to me

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:56.160
as something we talked about much.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.660
So when I went to college, I
saw these courses, philosophy.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.840
So I thought well, Mom and
Dad used to talk about that.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.020
It sounded interesting to me.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.487
I'll give it a try.

00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:07.200
- And before you went to
college, give us an example

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100
of the kind of discussion you would have

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.460
around the table about
some constitutional issue.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.767
- Well, my father,

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:18.530
he was a litigator and he
sometimes defended libel suits.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.080
So he was very devoted
to the First Amendment.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120
So we often talked about
the First Amendment.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.080
And one particular moment I remember

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.440
that had a huge impact on me.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.960
I was going for a walk with my father

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.130
sometime in the early 50s.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.550
And we were arguing about
an article that had appeared

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.783
in the Indianapolis Star, which
was a client of my father's.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.090
He always had to defend them,
although he wouldn't have

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.110
defended their politics which
were very different from ours,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.920
very very conservative.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.860
And they had had a
particularly misleading series

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.977
of articles on some
subject I don't remember.

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:50.590
And I was incensed by this.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.840
My 11-year-old anger was
up and I said to my father,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.120
how can they be allowed to
publish this kind of thing.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.810
It's misleading people about
these important questions.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.927
And my father said, "But who's to decide

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.140
"what they can publish
and what they can't?"

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.700
And I felt as if I'd been
turned to stone on the moment.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.072
I was so ashamed of myself.

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.570
This was a really interesting,
difficult question

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.403
I couldn't answer.

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:13.236
I had no idea.

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:17.209
I felt caught between the sense
that it's a very bad thing

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.440
that this sort of thing is out there.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.480
But this reply seemed absolutely right.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.950
And so the tension between these ideas,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.610
the obvious rationality apparently
of restricting expression

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.680
versus, on the other hand, the idea

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.100
that really wasn't proper really stuck me.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.377
And it's something I
continued to think about.

00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:38.930
And I suppose, I don't
know how many years later,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.190
20 years later or something,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.620
when I was first writing
on political philosophy,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.566
that was the first thing I wrote about.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.320
- And as a young person,
before you went to college,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.830
were you engaged in debates and arguments?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.840
Did you bring a philosophical bent

00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:57.300
to your way of thinking
early even before college?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.860
- I suppose I was drawn
toward abstract thinking.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.590
But I was mainly interested
in math and science.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.100
I suppose mathematics
was my main interest.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.840
And so, I think I had a
bent for abstract thinking,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.214
but I didn't really think about philosophy

00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:14.350
in the usual sense.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.410
I wasn't occupied with
paradoxes or the sort of thing

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.270
that one might have been thinking about.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.430
- And as a young person, any mentors

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.630
other than your parents
who shaped your thinking?

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.870
High school teachers or something?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.703
- Well no.

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:28.290
The high school teachers
that had the biggest impact

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.470
on me, again, were my math
teachers who inspired me

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.290
to work hard.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.860
And they got me sort
of interested in logic

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.570
because we did proofs
and things like that.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.240
And I found that, proofs
in geometry for example.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.580
I wasn't so interested in geometry,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.750
that is, the structure of space.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.940
But I was very interested in the idea

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.970
that you could prove things,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.420
and the puzzle of discovering proofs.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.480
So it was natural that when
I went into philosophy,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.410
one of the main things I
got interested in was logic.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.230
And that was my main subject of inquiry

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.830
for the first 10 years or so
that I was in the subject.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.460
But they didn't really
turn me on to philosophy

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.960
in a direct sense, no.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.950
- And where did you go to
do your undergraduate work?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.040
- I was an undergraduate at Princeton.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.210
And then I went to England
for a year to Oxford,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.140
really just taking a
year out to try to decide

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.190
whether I could take the
plunge and become an academic

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.350
which seemed to me a very strange
choice of life at the time

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.270
rather than go back to
Indiana and practice law

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.120
which is what I'd always been
assuming that I would do.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.370
Then, I decided philosophy was something

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.540
I couldn't give up.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.520
So I went back to the
U.S. and went to Harvard

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.590
to be a graduate student.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.880
And then after just a few years

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.120
went back to Princeton to teach.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.290
So I followed a very small circle.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.290
- And what was it about
philosophy that drew you in?

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.150
Was it this base in
logic and argumentation

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.940
that you had brought to the table?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.010
- Well initially.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.080
It's a good question.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.140
I don't fully know the answer.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.037
Certainly initially, questions about logic

00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:57.660
and the structure of
argument were the things

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.450
that most appealed to me, the
technical side of the subject.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.300
In fact, I wasn't interested
in moral philosophy at all.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.670
I suppose I was a kind
of logical positivist,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.440
as that was a popular but
already much criticized doctrine

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.053
when I was a student.

00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:13.430
But I was rather skeptical
of whether there was

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.090
anything interesting
to be said about moral

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.260
and political questions from
a philosophical point of view.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.680
So I only took a moral philosophy course

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.770
because I was told I had to.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.720
It was a requirement for graduation.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.304
When I took it, I thought it was terrific.

00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:24.840
(laughs)

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.080
I really got engaged with the questions.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.610
Although in the beginning, I
was mainly interested in them

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.080
sort of from a technical point of view.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.670
I thought that formal decision theory

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.531
and welfare economics
were a way of answering

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:43.230
questions of social philosophy
and individual morality.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.320
And that's what my first teacher

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.370
in the subject had been into.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.030
And he really turned me on
to that side of the subject.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.740
But after a year or two of
working in it in that way,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.090
I became sort of frustrated with the ...

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.910
I loved the formal techniques,
but I found the results

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.494
a little bit arid, and I
thought there was more to it.

00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:01.919
So I then broadened out and
got interested in other things.

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.030
- I think our audience
would be curious to know

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.070
what exactly a philosopher does.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.880
And a way I like to get at this problem

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.970
is to ask you, for the
benefit of the students

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.250
who might watch this, what are the skills,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.460
the temperament required to do philosophy

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.740
as you're helping us understand

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.310
what it is a philosopher does?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.660
- Well the skills, I think,
are a taste for analysis

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.300
and skill at drawing distinctions,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.230
the patience to keep doing it,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.200
and the tolerance for a
fair amount of frustration.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.280
Because it is inherently difficult.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.690
It's no accident, I think,
that philosophical questions

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.670
are difficult in this way.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.110
Philosophical questions,
to my mind, are questions

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.710
that are raised by some
way of understanding life

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.900
and the world that we're
naturally drawn to use,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.100
but which can't be answered satisfactorily

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.290
using that method.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.050
So for example, if religion
is an important way

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.670
of understanding life and the world,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.840
then the question whether God exists

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.640
is an important philosophical question.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.130
It's a philosophical question
because religion raises it.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.020
Everything depends on
whether there is a God.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.570
But answers within a religion presuppose

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.403
that there is a God.

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:19.030
So you don't discover
whether there is a God or not

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.173
by reading scripture.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.700
So similarly, if science
is the important way

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.280
of understanding life and the world,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.290
then it's a philosophical question:

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.000
what's the difference
between a chance regularity

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.670
and a genuine law of nature?

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.090
And how can you tell
that you're seeing one

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.990
rather than the other by
simply looking at a finite

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.420
number of experiments?

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.110
Everything about empirical science assumes

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.811
that that's true, that
science doesn't just discover

00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.920
coincidental regularities.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.150
It discovers kind of
how nature really works.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.180
And it does that by inferring
from a certain number

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.100
of carefully constructed experiments.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.820
So those questions are questions

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.560
that science presupposes and depends on,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.110
but they can't be answered
in the laboratory.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.760
So they're philosophical questions.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.680
So philosophical questions are questions

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.220
that are, in this sense, external

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.170
to some normal way of thinking.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.380
Because they're external,
there isn't an obvious way

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.630
of how to answer them.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.513
So the philosopher is a bit at sea,

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:18.180
out there in the void, so to
speak, trying to synthesize,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.720
trying to make up or find
some grip on these questions.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.520
And there are also philosophical questions

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.240
that don't come from some
established system of thought

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.580
like religion or science,
that are just perennials,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.260
like do we have free will?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.230
How do we understand our
idea of moral obligations

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.063
to each other?

00:09:36.063 --> 00:09:38.585
We come to, we're taught, we learn,

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:42.200
we develop some sense
of what our obligations

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.460
to other people are.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.690
And we can reason using those
commonly understood standards

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.090
about what we ought to do
and what we ought not to do.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.810
But there is a question: why
should be care about that?

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.400
Why should we be willing to sacrifice

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.830
in order not to do something that's wrong?

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.410
That's not gonna be a
question that's answered

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.680
within the ordinary moral principles.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.280
Because those principles presuppose

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.510
that there is something important there,

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.680
but it isn't obvious what it is.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.560
So philosophy then takes
up the task of trying

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.020
to give an explanation of
why these are something

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.970
we should care about.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.471
And that's a task of
philosophy that's as old as,

00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:16.610
you know, as old as the Greeks.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.310
It's what Socrates and Plato were doing

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.530
and all of their successors.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.638
So philosophy is difficult because

00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:26.750
it is external in this way.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.810
And for that reason, it requires patience.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.540
Because students tend to get frustrated.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.560
'Cause there isn't an obvious answer.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.470
They say, "What's the answer?"

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.640
So well, here's a plausible answer.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.750
Here's the reasons why it
seems like a good answer.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.100
But of course, there are difficulties.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.804
And you're not a good
philosopher unless you're also

00:10:42.804 --> 00:10:45.100
always looking around
to find the difficulties

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.710
with what you've said.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.670
But not everybody has a tolerance
for that kind of tension.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.190
- So if I can try

00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:56.413
to cut into some of
what you're saying here,

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.510
what is it you as a philosopher

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.880
makes personal choices about the problems

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.723
that you're gonna address?

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.030
Do you have any thoughts
about what has led you

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.500
to particular topics?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.550
For example, problems
of political philosophy?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.140
- Well as I said earlier, I got interested

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.390
in problems of freedom of speech

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.180
because they were a topic of conversation.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.763
They just seemed inherently
puzzling and important.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.260
But I also was interested in questions say

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.480
about the foundation of mathematics

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.030
which didn't come up because of ...

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.740
So it's hard to say
exactly what makes one ...

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.130
There are many things out
there that are puzzling.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.370
And it's hard to say what draws you

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.470
to one particular puzzle
rather than another.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.513
I suppose it has to be
a puzzle about something

00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:41.510
that you really care about.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.840
And it also has to be something that you

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.450
feel able to say something about.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.250
There are questions about let's say

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.293
the metaphysics of time or
other things which are puzzles,

00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:53.480
but I don't feel like I
got a real grip on 'em.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.150
So I tend not to be drawn to those.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.870
- But an area that you decide on,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.230
do you wind up researching
the area in order ...

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.140
Because what you're trying to do

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.600
is formulate the right questions

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.600
for a particular subfield or endeavor.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.610
- Well, people divide about this.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.970
And one can be embarrassed by the answer

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.193
one finds oneself giving.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.254
Of course, when you think about a field,

00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:27.910
if it's a questions in philosophy,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.840
there are a lot of smart
people have thought about it.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.840
And it certainly makes sense
to go see what they had to say.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.300
Some people think that's
the main thing you wanna do,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.540
develop an understanding
of how this developed,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.810
what Kant had to say about it,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.850
what criticisms there
were, have that lens.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.950
And that's certainly a very
important form of inquiry.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.060
I'm a little bit embarrassed to say that,

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.457
although I've learned an
awful lot by studying Kant,

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:54.083
Mill, Hume, other people in
the history of philosophy,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.710
I tend to wanna just go in
and think about it myself.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.650
So,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.440
I am drawn to just get the bearings

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.260
and think about these
answers as possible answers.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.940
But then, when it comes down to it,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.020
you gotta decide yourself.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.130
So you have to at some
point switch off the reading

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.530
and just start thinking and scribbling.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.163
- And what does creativity
in philosophy look like?

00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:25.210
- Well, it isn't, I think, on the whole

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.730
just flashes of insight.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.800
It comes out of noticing things

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.890
that other people haven't noticed

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.360
because you've been
putting your mind's eye

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.913
on them more carefully,

00:13:39.255 --> 00:13:40.730
and being willing to consider objections

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.950
to what one would normally say

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.450
more seriously and more penetratingly.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.870
So I think that the real
original bursts of creativity

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.220
in philosophy come to others
who haven't made the discovery

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.380
in a certain sense as a revelation.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.980
But also saying yes of course,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.780
I actually was somehow
aware of that already.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.300
That is, a good philosopher finds things

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.420
in the materials that are
really available to everybody

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.290
which once a person says
them, you think oh yeah.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.600
Right.
There was that problem there

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.260
and I was kind of turning
my eye away from it.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.110
So I think insight in philosophy comes

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.650
from careful attention to the questions

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.650
as they present themselves to us.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.650
- And in reading your essays
in The Difficulty of Tolerance,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.653
which I will show our audience,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.140
it seems that in this process, clarity,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.980
both in the sense of
the way you're thinking

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.980
about the problem, but also the expressing

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.740
of that clarity so the reader will come

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.180
to the same insight
that you're leading to.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.360
Both of those are very important.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.360
- That's certainly the
most important thing.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.930
And then one goes back
and rereads one's essays,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.500
the thing that one is
most dissatisfied with

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.230
is that one hasn't been
as clear as one thought

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.580
one must be.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.720
And so, the constant drive
to try to make it clearer

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.870
is one of the most important things.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.790
That's right.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.100
- And this book has a collection of essays

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.919
essentially on political philosophy

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:23.083
as a subfield of philosophy
and of your work.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.190
What is distinctive about

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.800
that focus of your attention?

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.240
- What's distinctive
about political philosophy

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.073
as opposed to other kinds of philosophy?

00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:35.940
- Yeah, yes, yeah.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.710
- What's distinctive about
it as I see it is that

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.280
it has to do with our
relations with each other

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.653
that are mediated through
the institutions we share.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.290
Moral philosophy has to do, by my likes,

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.510
primarily with what we owe
to each other as individuals.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.472
And a lot of those are just questions of

00:15:55.472 --> 00:15:57.430
am I gonna tell you the truth?

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.410
Am I gonna kick you?

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.857
Am I gonna keep my appointment?

00:15:59.857 --> 00:16:02.290
Questions like that
which don't necessarily

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.710
depend upon larger scale institutions.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.640
Although they may have different effects

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.070
because they take place
within such institutions.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.300
But some of what we owe to each other,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.590
we owe to each other as participants

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.660
in large scale institutions.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.833
We pay our taxes.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.890
We vote.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.250
We take part in political processes.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.400
And we feel obliged to
obey and accept the results

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.970
of those processes, and to not interfere

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.220
with other people's participation in them.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.250
So the question, well we're
born into these institutions.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.080
We just find them operating around us.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.900
Why should we accept them?

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.470
What demands can we make on them?

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.970
If people think they're being
treated improperly by them,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.840
when is it appropriate
for them to complain?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.270
When are their complaints justified?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.840
So those are, they're
moral questions in a sense,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.763
in a large sense,
because they're questions

00:16:47.763 --> 00:16:49.250
of what we owe to each other.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.730
But they're not just, so to speak,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.430
questions of personal interaction.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.170
They're questions about the
conditions of our participation

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.563
in large scale systems of cooperation.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.870
- Now when you are
dealing with these issues

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.433
of political philosophy,

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.410
the rigor, the logic is still required.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.093
But you're dealing with
an area of passion,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.560
where people have very strong views

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.347
that aren't always driven by logic.

00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:22.850
How do you reconcile those tensions?

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.530
Or does your background in philosophy

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.460
make it easier for you to do?

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.530
- Well I don't know if it makes it easier.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.120
It imposes a kind of discipline on me

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.500
about focusing my attention.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.070
But I guess I would
register just a little bit

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.300
of skepticism about this
contrast between logic

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.300
on the one hand and the
emotions on the other.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.180
Logic of course, it's a formal subject,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.260
operates according to definite rules.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.920
And you can turn it into a
mathematics like calculus.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.770
But let's not think about
logic, but as a reasoning

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.600
more broadly when I'm drawing inferences

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.650
about whether I'm really seeing a chair,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.600
or a person, or a blackboard,
or when I'm reasoning

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.760
about what's likely to happen.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.150
Is it gonna rain or something like that.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.010
That's reasoning in a looser sense.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.990
So I'm responding.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.320
I take certain evidence
as grounds for drawing

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.930
a certain kind of conclusion.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.100
I can take evidence as grounds
for drawing a conclusion.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.330
I can take facts such as
the fact that I told you

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.740
I was gonna be here as a
reason to do something.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.130
I think both of those things are reasoning

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.590
in exactly the same sense.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.980
Even though the second
one motivates me to act

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.270
maybe in a way that the first doesn't

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.840
in a more direct and obvious way.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.690
So I think and even when we
are, as people might say,

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.330
acting out of emotion, when
people act out of emotion,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.470
they're acting for a reason.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.540
If I'm angry at you,
that means I'm inclined

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.240
to take the fact that you wouldn't like it

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.570
if I said something as a reason to say it.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.710
So I think we can't understand emotions

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.000
without looking at them
as you might say complexes

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.700
of tendencies to see things as reasons.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.160
So I think that the idea
that when I'm reasoning

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.280
about whether it's gonna
rain or about whether

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.900
I should go to Berkeley
or not, that's one thing.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.710
But acting on emotions is something else.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.755
I think the idea of
responding to what we see

00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:13.380
as reasons, either
consciously or unreflectively,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.030
is common across these domains.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.960
And there's not a big
separation as is often suggested

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.590
by the use of the terms.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.210
- In this collection,
you direct your attention

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.060
to a number of really important problems

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.980
in political philosophy: human rights,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.760
freedom of expression,
tolerance, urgency, and so forth.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.500
And I'm just curious.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.933
In this realm, is it
more important to go back

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:45.849
and look at what the great
philosophers have said

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:48.520
as you carve out your position?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.820
Is this an area where you
find yourself doing that

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.380
more of the time than in
other areas of philosophy?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.730
- Well, as I said earlier,
one can be a barist

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.563
by the answers one finds in this.

00:19:58.563 --> 00:20:00.379
But I think the answer is no.

00:20:00.379 --> 00:20:02.208
(laughs)

00:20:02.208 --> 00:20:05.270
I think for some reason,
I don't know quite why,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.840
but my writings and moral philosophy

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.390
have paid more attention to
the great writers of the past,

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.090
particularly Hume, Kant,
and to some degree Aristotle

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.580
I think as the main exemplars,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.340
than what I do in political philosophy

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.860
which tends more to just
look at the questions

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.100
or to deal with the way
they've been presented

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.983
by more recent figures, such
as my teacher John Rawls,

00:20:25.843 --> 00:20:27.760
and look less back.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.980
I don't know why that's true.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.530
But it just does seem to
me to be a matter of fact.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.770
- Now, what led me to look
at these particular essays

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.250
was which I gather were
written from the 70s

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.410
to the early 1990s.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.480
They deal with a number of issues that

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.400
in the post 9/11 world are,
you know, have come back

00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.483
in a very powerful way and so on.

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.790
Before we get into some of your ideas

00:20:55.790 --> 00:21:00.450
on some of these issues, I'm curious as to

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.363
how you think your ideas,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.350
once they've been put down,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.780
are affected by the
changing times basically?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.020
For me, it struck me that
everything you'd written long ago

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.190
still applies today.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:22.190
And I'm just sort of
curious as to what extent

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.600
there is any impact in
the relevancy of the times

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.713
on what you do,

00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:31.450
and would want to impel you to go back

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.503
and read this stuff and
see if it still stands up.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.630
- The first article that I published,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.580
which is the first article in that book,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.060
is called A Theory of
Freedom of Expression

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.710
which I wrote in the early 1970s.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.860
It begins with a quote
from Justice Holmes.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.040
It said, "When you see
that speech is gonna cause

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.410
certain harms, there's nothing
more rational than trying

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.520
to restrict speech in order
to prevent those harms."

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.797
But he then says, (laughs)

00:21:57.797 --> 00:21:59.647
"When we understand how history works

00:21:59.647 --> 00:22:01.820
"that we see that we have to hold back."

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.560
He was talking about cases that arose

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.730
around the time of the First World War,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.960
and anarchist agitation, and so on.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.040
But as cycles of political
controversy come around,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.210
if they raised essentially
the same questions

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.700
about is Congress
entitled to act to prevent

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.520
perceived serious harms at the expense

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.530
of limiting citizens'
rights to participate

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.292
in the political forum to
express their ideas, or whatever.

00:22:27.292 --> 00:22:29.510
That's a perennial question.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.950
And it's not surprising
that it keeps coming back.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.360
So I was thinking about it in the context

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.980
of the Vietnam War reading
someone who had written about it

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.820
at the time of the First World War.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.840
And now we've got another war on.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.030
So national security issues
are again on the forefront.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.010
So those similar questions come back.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.314
But they don't always
come back in the same way.

00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:55.110
Another way in which questions
of freedom of expression

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.110
frequently arises has to do
with sex and social mores.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.190
So restricting pornography or literature

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.480
that's thought to be obscene or offensive

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.380
is another perennial topic.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.163
But at the time I wrote that essay,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:19.070
and even the subsequent follow-up
to it in the later 1970s,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:23.270
the main forums in which that demand

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.593
that expression on sexual
matters should be limited

00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:29.120
was mainly coming from people who wanted

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.690
to prevent sex from being discussed.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.630
There was a sense of sexual
repression was the way

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.280
the pro-speech side would
have described the worry.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.500
But by the time you get to
the later 1970s and beyond,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.580
it's coming from feminists
who are worried about it

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.350
as a question of equality.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.590
So if we wanna preserve a social outlook

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.960
in which women are respected,
we need to restrict expression

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.880
that perpetuates stereotypes, or suggests

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.650
that women want to be dominated
or are properly dominated.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.530
And similar questions
come up about hate speech

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.090
with respect to racial equality.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.790
So the idea that we
need to restrict speech

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.770
in order to preserve a
certain social outlook

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.300
is a perennial.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.760
But exactly what the issue is,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.870
whether we want to prevent people

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.810
from being too concerned with sex

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.023
or whether we want to preserve equality,

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.070
those things may change.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.740
And so one has to think about
them in a different way.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.690
- And so the role of a philosopher,

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.910
and his contribution really,
is to define these problems

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.140
in such a way that these
waves of different groups

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.140
who come forward do not
undermine our basic understanding

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.840
of the principles that are at stake.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.880
- Well one has to refine our understanding

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.780
of the principles that are at stake

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.620
in order for us to see how
we can, on the one hand,

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.750
do justice to the claims
that people are making,

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.030
but still somehow explain
how we can preserve

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.710
a climate of open discussion
which we think is important.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.520
How should we understand the
values that are in conflict?

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.470
And here's the thing that's
always on the agenda.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.290
What kind of judgment are we making

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.840
when we're saying although
this value is important,

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.560
restricting expression for that reason

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.713
would violate a right.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.517
And therefore, that draws a line.

00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:17.318
What kind of a judgment are we making

00:25:17.318 --> 00:25:19.040
when we appeal to a right?

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.530
That's the underlying question
that keeps coming back.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.960
- So help us understand
now for our audience

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.200
what you came to see as
the important dimensions

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.040
of freedom of expression.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.780
And we're in this realm
of political philosophy

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.450
where we're talking about our relations,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.960
people's relations with
their institutions.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.920
- Right.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.370
Well when I first thought about it,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.663
I thought in this first article I wrote,

00:25:46.663 --> 00:25:50.900
I was very taken with the
idea of individual autonomy.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.530
It's important for citizens
not only to be able

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.530
to make up their own mind
about important questions

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.900
about life and politics,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.110
but also to have their
relations with each other

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.940
and with government defined

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.490
by the idea that they are autonomous.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.250
So I thought that recognizing
other people's autonomy,

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.970
recognizing citizens'
autonomy drew a sharp line.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.640
It's incompatible with
seeing citizens as autonomous

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.780
for government to decide
this can't be published

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.580
because it might lead them to
draw some false conclusion.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.413
Right?

00:26:20.413 --> 00:26:22.270
Whether the conclusion's
false is up to them to decide.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.220
That's what it means to
treat them as autonomous.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.300
Later on, I came to think
that that restriction

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:32.300
on the way speech can be
restricted was too tight.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.280
And one should adopt a more you might say

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:38.250
I don't know if I wanna say practical,

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.230
but a more instrumental view
that the main reason why

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.620
government can't have unlimited power

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.950
to restrict speech has to
do with the dangerousness

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.020
of giving governments that power.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.860
And so, we were properly more willing

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.060
to allow a government say
to restrict some kinds

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.410
of false advertising
than we are to allow them

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.850
to restrict what they take
to be false political speech.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.200
Because government is,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.090
one might assume although
this isn't always true,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.460
somewhat less partisan
and less untrustworthy

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.010
and less likely to abuse its power

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.070
in the realm of false
advertising about products,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.150
about how dangerous your
lawnmower is or something,

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.410
or how long your car is gonna last,

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.021
than it is in the realm of deciding

00:27:23.021 --> 00:27:26.410
what are true answers to the
basic political questions

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.243
of our times.

00:27:27.243 --> 00:27:28.789
So I thought that my original idea that

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:33.070
it's autonomy that sets
the limits was too rigid.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.630
And one needed to take into
account the question of

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.040
how dangerous is this?

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.730
How dangerous is it for government

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.330
to have a power of a certain sort?

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.440
So there's a lot of drawing
on historical experience

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.150
from past governments
to see what would happen

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.803
if government had the power to do this.

00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.640
When we think there's a right,

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.390
what we think is it's too dangerous

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.480
for government to have that power.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.440
So they don't have it.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.588
That is to say, we have a
right that they don't do it.

00:27:57.588 --> 00:27:59.750
- And going back to this idea of autonomy,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.430
you make this important distinction about

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.670
the information that people
need so that they can

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.460
really be an independent agent

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.230
versus, you know, helping
somebody with the means

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.531
to take action which the
thought might lead them to.

00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:17.583
- Right.

00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:21.397
A friend of mine said, when
I was writing about this,

00:28:21.397 --> 00:28:24.437
he said, "Well I hope you'll explain why

00:28:24.437 --> 00:28:26.697
"people can't publish their recipe

00:28:26.697 --> 00:28:28.397
"for making nerve gas at home."

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.390
So I incorporated that (laughs)

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.417
into my article.

00:28:35.417 --> 00:28:38.110
And so I think people are
entitled to the information.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.820
They shouldn't be blocked
from having the information

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.120
they need to make political decisions.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.980
But I don't need to know
how to make nerve gas

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.020
in my sink in order to
decide who to vote for.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.310
So I thought in that original article,

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.140
and to some degree I still think that,

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.500
information about technical matters

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.850
isn't necessarily something
that can't be restricted.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.530
Whereas information that
just might lead me to decide

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.120
that single-parent health
care was a good thing,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.710
or was a bad thing, isn't
something government can restrict

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.360
because they think I might
do the wrong thing with it.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.900
- Now in the wake of 9/11, we developed

00:29:16.933 --> 00:29:21.150
a new scenario of the possible
threats to the United States

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:26.150
which one could argue provide
an opening for the state

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.640
to make a new case

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.320
with regard

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.540
to what its domain should be

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.250
with regard to freedom of speech.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.930
One thinks of the notion
of a surprise attack,

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.774
the notion that you're dealing
now with terrorist groups

00:29:44.774 --> 00:29:48.143
that might have access to
nuclear weapons and so on.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.873
In light of these changes,

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.560
what impact,

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.670
or what intuitions do you have

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.840
about how you might change your thinking

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.840
on matters of free expression, if at all?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.320
- Well, as I said earlier,
these seem like new questions,

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.180
but in a sense, they're old questions.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.590
Although I think what
changes is not so much 9/11,

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.593
but new technology changes
things to some extent.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.150
One of the most important
things we'd wanna protect

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.950
in protecting freedom of expression is

00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:32.720
the people's opportunities for advocacy,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.210
and people's opportunities to find out

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.520
whether other people agree with them

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.853
about the propriety of
particular political actions.

00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:44.470
It doesn't seem to me that
the state is threatened,

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.360
that al-Qaeda presents a
worry in that dimension.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.250
Although Muslim imams may make

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.000
inflammatory statements,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.562
but it seems to me that that's something

00:30:56.562 --> 00:30:58.130
you gotta live with.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.963
I think that's an old question.

00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:00.750
I think it's a settled question.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.210
I don't think 9/11 changes it.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.540
Although it gets us more excited about it,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.240
just the way at the time
of the First World War

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.170
people were excited about
anarchists making speeches.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.600
And I think there's a general tendency

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.760
of the government to exaggerate the degree

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.410
to which they need to
protect us by restricting

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.150
people's simple statements of advocacy.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.350
There's another question,
on the other hand,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.800
which is the communications
between conspirators.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.310
So maybe they do need
to be able to restrict

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.770
the way people can
communicate with each other

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.980
if they're actually

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.930
in the process of carrying out a plan.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.160
I think that's not an
issue of freedom of speech.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.422
It may become an issue of privacy.

00:31:42.422 --> 00:31:45.620
And there it does seem to me,
again, that's a separate area.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.453
But it's settled.

00:31:46.453 --> 00:31:48.010
You need to have some kind of prior cause.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.600
You can't just start listening

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.310
to everybody's
communications with everybody

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.880
because you're gonna fish around and see

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.500
if you can find somebody
who's in the process

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.230
of developing a conspiracy.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.110
But where there's probable cause to think

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.510
these people might be
engaged in a conspiracy,

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.680
it seems to me it's not an
issue of freedom of speech,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.720
that they might be able to do it.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.950
Nor I think is it an issue of privacy.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.560
But the main question where
freedom of speech comes in

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.960
is this area of public advocacy.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.140
And I think that the risks

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.100
that public advocacy
might turn more people on

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.480
to being against the government

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.640
is a risk that we simply have to accept.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.120
- Now how bound are these discussions

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.120
by the kind of polity that you
are talking about basically?

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.190
And how do you think about those matters?

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:38.240
Because your essay on human rights

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.300
is making an effort to
sort of think about well,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.081
what are the circumstances under
which one should intervene?

00:32:46.081 --> 00:32:50.423
And what we're talking about,
is it universal or is it not?

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.250
- Your question raises
two difficult issues.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.450
One is relativism.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.700
And the other is the
permissibility of intervention.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.060
I think it's important to keep
these two things separate.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.050
The first is, I believe
in an open society.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.830
I think that defensible
institutions have to be ones

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.760
that the citizens to whom they apply

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.780
and who are asked to accept and obey them

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.890
can object to, can raise
questions, can protest against.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.410
That seems to me a basic requirement

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.200
of the legitimacy of institutions.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.477
And I'm inclined to say
that's universal, right?

00:33:18.477 --> 00:33:21.810
That isn't just a parochial
view about institutions.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.550
It's a view about what people
can demand of institutions

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.370
as a condition for being
willing to accept them

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.210
and go along with them.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.160
They have to be able to protest.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.670
So, I'm not a relativist about that.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.250
Now the exact form that
protest needs to take

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.320
or the exact form the
political institutions take,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.010
there's a certain range
for variation there.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:43.010
But I think that there's a
fairly strong universal truth.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.310
Now, we hear there's some other society

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.840
where people aren't allowed to protest.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.120
That properly changes
our view of the authority

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.270
that that government has
to speak for those people.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.510
But it doesn't immediately
follow that we can go out there

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.350
and tell 'em they've got
to do something different.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.310
Well, we can tell them.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.310
I think we can say we don't think that.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.440
Your citizens, it seems
to us, have a good case.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.220
But can we cut off their oil?

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.740
Can we stop trading with them?

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.060
Can we send in the Marines?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.030
Those are all much more
difficult questions.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.640
So I think one wants to
separate the question of

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.490
do these standards apply
from the question of

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.230
what role do outsiders have

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.770
in intervening to try to change people

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.480
in one direction rather than another.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.720
But in addressing that question also,

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.860
it's important to remember that they

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.820
don't all have the same
view about these things.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.136
Relativism is often put
in a we versus they.

00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:33.810
Of course, we think that human
life is special or sacred.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.370
We think that people have these rights.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.540
But of course, in this other society,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.650
they don't think.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.063
But they are almost never
unanimous about this.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.580
The portion of they
who've been put in jail

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.560
for their political beliefs
don't normally think

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.030
that it's okay to put people in jail

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.338
for their political beliefs.

00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:51.564
(laughs)

00:34:51.564 --> 00:34:52.810
So in deciding what's right and wrong

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.620
about what's happening in their country,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.500
you gotta take into account
the claims of the people

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.410
who are in jail as well as
the people who are outside it.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.760
But that said, there's
still a further question

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.240
about what are we able or
entitled to do about it?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.200
Sometimes, we are able to do something,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.670
maybe by expressing disapproval,

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.490
maybe by withdrawing trade.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.330
But those are difficult questions

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.680
although those questions also are asked

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.700
within a universal moral framework

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.460
about what's permissible
to do to somebody else?

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.770
When are you permitted, or even required,

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.500
to intervene to protect somebody
against horrible treatment?

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.904
And when are you required
as an outsider to stay out?

00:35:26.904 --> 00:35:29.030
That's a general moral question

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.100
that applies across boundaries.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.900
- As I listen to you and
as I look at your essays,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.270
I'm struck by how relevant this all is.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:41.520
And what's in the back of
my mind is the question

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.780
how does philosophy make an impact?

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.290
In other words, obviously,
you make an impact

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.510
on the field of philosophy,
on the students you have.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.320
But I must honestly say
as I was reading this,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.130
I said hey, you know, more
people should be reading this.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:03.130
Because it has a cleansing
quality on the mind

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.660
as you think about the issues
that you're actually reading

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.790
in The New York Times.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.280
- Well, I'm extremely pleased
you'd say that, Harry.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.060
And of course, it's a
matter of frustration.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.060
In the early 1970s, some friends of mine

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.060
and I got together and founded a journal

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.220
called Philosophy in Public Affairs.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.340
And it's amusing, or maybe embarrassing,

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.770
to go back and read the
preamble that we wrote

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.890
in which we said something
like what you just said.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.930
That we think that
philosophy has something

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.820
to contribute to moral issues
that are centrally concerned

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.840
with the issues of our time.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.492
And we, by founding this
journal, we want to,

00:36:36.492 --> 00:36:38.280
on the one hand encourage philosophers

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.550
to address themselves more
to these practical issues

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.750
than they have before.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.220
And second, to bring their
thoughts to a wider audience.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.460
Looking back, I think we even said

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.560
philosophy has something in
agreement to the understanding

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.080
and even the resolution of these issues.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.340
That seems wildly optimistic looking back.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.820
But looking back now,
whatever it's been now,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.060
35 years,

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.760
I have to say that I think we
were really quite successful

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.593
on the first front.

00:37:04.593 --> 00:37:06.010
That is, philosophers did,

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.360
not simply as a result of what we did,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.050
but partly because of
the spirit of the time,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.520
come to turn their minds much more

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.460
in succeeding decades
to practical questions.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.050
I don't think we succeeded
very well in getting people

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.310
outside the philosophical
community to attend to.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.180
I think that the
subscriptions of that journal

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.680
never got beyond 3,000, I believe.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.260
It was cited in a few Law Review articles,

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.320
but not much beyond there.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.580
So it's hard to crack that frontier.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.700
I've written a few things in
The New York Review of Books,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.730
maybe in a few other journals like that.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.550
But I don't know that they've
gotten a very wide audience.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.230
I once participated with a similar group,

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.230
the same group of folks, in
writing an amicus curiae brief

00:37:51.198 --> 00:37:52.031
for the Supreme Court.

00:37:52.031 --> 00:37:53.950
This was in the case
about assisted suicide.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.590
And I'd done a similar thing earlier

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.160
with another group of people in a case

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.350
having to do with academic
freedom and freedom of speech.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.540
And that one, the one
about freedom of speech,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.420
was seemed to be never noticed by anybody.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.040
But the one on assisted suicide
got a fair amount of play.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.240
It's sometimes referred
to, often negatively.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.970
And a couple of magazines actually

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.080
mentioned it in their stories.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.980
Reporters called me up about it.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.990
But I was struck by the fact that

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.090
when the reporters called me up,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.940
they never wanted to ask me
why do you guys think this?

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.380
Or why do you guys think that?

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.107
Rather, the only question
they wanted to know was

00:38:25.107 --> 00:38:27.250
who do you guys think you are

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.783
that you should be
pronouncing on this subject?

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.940
Which I thought was a
little bit surprising.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.750
- So it's really their attitude toward you

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.970
as opposed to the
substance of your position.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.650
- These pointy-headed
academics getting up there

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.020
trying to tell us what to do.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.433
That seemed to be the attitude.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.610
- In one of the essays in this collection

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.610
that also struck me was this
one as we just talked about,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.953
the one on human rights.

00:38:58.101 --> 00:39:01.513
And is there anything that
one would like to add now

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.810
in the face of ...

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.600
You know, if you look at the 90s

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.550
and the emphasis of human rights,

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.720
and how would the political
process in essence

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.840
corrupted some of the
basic insights we had

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.900
about human rights and
turned it into a notion

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.880
of really changing societies
that couldn't be changed.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.713
- That's right.

00:39:24.713 --> 00:39:26.200
- And you addressed that in your essay.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.520
- Well I do, although only in
one paragraph or one sentence.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.600
And I wish I said, look even if you think

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.630
it's permissible for people to intervene,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.440
that people who are torturing people

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.740
and throwing them in
jail don't have a right

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.780
not to be interfered with,

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.330
still, we've got to
look at the question of

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.130
how effectively could we intervene.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.650
And that may be a very important barrier.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.330
I think I said that in
more or less those words,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.990
although it was buried in
one particular paragraph.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.778
If I were writing it again,
I might puff that up.

00:39:49.778 --> 00:39:52.230
But I would, if I were
writing that essay over again,

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.770
and sometimes I wish I could,

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.410
I certainly would say something different

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.280
for a couple of reasons.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.400
That essay was really a kind of product

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.883
of the late Cold War.

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:07.340
It came to be in an
interesting way having to do

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.930
with your previous question
about how philosophy

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.580
can become influential.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.477
A friend who was running
an Institute for Philosophy

00:40:14.477 --> 00:40:17.130
and Public Policy at the
University of Maryland

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.670
organized a series of working groups

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.450
bringing together people from the Academy,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.240
mostly philosophers and
political scientists

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.760
and some economists,

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.910
with decision makers of
various sorts from Washington:

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.633
congressional staff people,

00:40:29.939 --> 00:40:32.986
in this instance on human rights,

00:40:32.986 --> 00:40:34.980
some congressional staff people,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.420
actually a couple of people from Congress.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.830
I think Harkin was there,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.190
'cause he'd written this amendment:

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.730
the Harkin Amendment
which restricted the sale

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.440
of weapons to countries that engaged

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.390
in systematic violations of human rights.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.220
And also, there was a procurement
officer from the Pentagon

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.180
who participated in this.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.090
So we met four times over
the course of several months,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.050
arguing about it.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.698
And then we wrote papers for a volume.

00:40:57.698 --> 00:40:58.546
And that was it.

00:40:58.546 --> 00:41:00.160
That was what it was from.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.340
So when I was talking there

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.240
about Human Rights as a Neutral Concern,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.793
that's the title of that essay,

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.320
this was what, the early 1980s I guess,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.770
I was still thinking about the East/West,

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:15.823
the Soviet Bloc,

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.090
and a NATO dichotomy

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.090
that is that human
rights were being accused

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.680
of being an expression of bourgeois values

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.360
as against the proper economic rights

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.150
that were supposedly being recognized

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.570
in socialist countries.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.403
And so I was trying to argue about

00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:35.840
how human rights really
are concerns that span

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.530
that disagreement about
there may be disagreement

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.400
about economic policy, but
there shouldn't be disagreement

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.320
about whether it's alright
to put people in jail

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.080
without any kind of due
process and things like that.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.640
So that was my idea of the
neutrality of human rights.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.720
But if you fast forward
now to our own time,

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.450
the Cold War is over.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.410
Human rights are now being
charged with a kind of

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:55.490
lack of neutrality.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.940
But that's not the dimension along which

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.260
neutrality is being disputed.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.140
It's rather cultural differences

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.490
between Asian values and Western values,

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.590
or between societies organized
along religious lines

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.652
and societies that are not.

00:42:10.652 --> 00:42:14.140
So the relevant dimension
around which the neutrality

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.660
of human rights might be challenged

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.250
is quite different now than it was then.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.170
And also, we've had more
experience with intervention,

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.020
as you say, so I would highlight it.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.780
Although I firmly believe
that's a paragraph

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.680
that was important.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.720
I'd highlight it more if
I were reading it now.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.130
So those are two examples
of the way in which change

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.560
of events can certainly
change what one would say

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.720
and what one would
emphasize if one were trying

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.610
to write about a question philosophically.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.080
- Do you feel impelled at all
to try to rewrite the essay?

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.820
Or is it something that ...

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.160
- Well, I thought when
I was putting together

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.370
this collection, I thought
should I try to rewrite this?

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.160
Or write in an afterword?

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.610
And of all the essays in that book,

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.670
I was most tempted to do that
with respect to that one.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.480
But several people I knew who had written

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.560
follow-on essays that referred to that

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.670
had basically made the central points

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.740
that I would have made.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.490
And so I would have had
to go back and discuss

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.323
what they had said.

00:43:08.323 --> 00:43:11.020
And again, I think it would
have fitted a little oddly

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.853
in the volume.

00:43:11.853 --> 00:43:15.610
So I decided to leave it
as it was and live with it

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.470
and think that maybe later
I'll write another essay

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.840
which I do hope to do.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.940
I just gave a seminar
with a political scientist

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.590
and Amartya Sen, an economist at Harvard,

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.740
on rights and human rights.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.900
So I'm thinking about it again.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.107
And I might write something else.

00:43:28.107 --> 00:43:29.980
- One of the other essays in here,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.920
interestingly enough,
and again, I must say

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.880
the topics you touch on in this book

00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:38.670
have come to the fore again even though

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.190
they always exist through time.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.392
It's just they before us more powerfully.

00:43:44.392 --> 00:43:46.080
You talk about tolerance.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.367
And tolerance "is a recognition
of common membership

00:43:49.367 --> 00:43:51.787
"that is deeper than these conflicts,

00:43:51.787 --> 00:43:56.407
"a recognition that others are
just as qualified as we are

00:43:56.407 --> 00:44:00.500
"to their contributions
or definition of society."

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.840
Are you pessimistic

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.290
about the way we act on tolerance

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.490
based on the insights
that you give us here?

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.393
- Well, I'm pessimistic maybe,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.743
but perhaps at a different level.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.670
What I said in that essay
was that the main issue

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.324
of tolerance is that we all care about

00:44:24.324 --> 00:44:26.680
what kind of society we live in.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.410
And tolerance arises out of the fact

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:30.880
that that society belongs to all of us.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.870
None of us has ownership of it.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.450
And recognizing that it's
other people's society

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.910
just as much as ours involves recognizing

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.490
their entitlement to participate

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.490
in the evolution of its mores,

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.720
to dress the way they want to dress,

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.550
to engage in the kind of sexual life

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.730
that they want to engage in,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.820
to be religious or not
religious as they choose.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.050
All those things are private
decisions in a certain sense.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.390
But they have a public dimension.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.390
And if a lot of people
make one choice or another

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.223
along with those dimensions,

00:44:58.223 --> 00:45:01.300
it changes what society
is like for all of us.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.430
So I wanted to say that
tolerance is a difficult doctrine

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.780
to accept because it
involves putting ourselves

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.100
in the hands of our fellow citizens,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.830
and recognizing we gotta
live with these people.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.530
And so we're gonna have to let the society

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:18.160
go the way the most of
them decide it's gonna go.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.430
So, I can be pessimistic about that.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.390
I can say I'm firmly
committed to tolerance.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.460
But I don't like the way that society

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.410
becomes more and more and
more saturated with sex.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.700
And more and more people
are talking about it

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.533
or are concerned about it.

00:45:32.533 --> 00:45:33.730
I don't like that change of events.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.940
But, you know, I can't
go out there and tell 'em

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.420
what they can put on the billboards

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.420
or what they can write in the magazines.

00:45:40.678 --> 00:45:44.653
I have to accept that I
don't own the society.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.960
And now society's becoming more religious.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:47.793
I'm not religious.

00:45:47.793 --> 00:45:50.580
So living in a society
in which I'm an outsider

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.690
in a certain way is not comfortable.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.700
And maybe it'll evolve to that point.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.030
But living in an open society
involves taking that risk.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.840
That's the price of really being connected

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.480
with your fellow citizens
at the deeper level

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.500
in which you recognize
them as fellow citizens

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.654
who own this thing just as much as we do.

00:46:10.654 --> 00:46:14.080
So I'm always worried about
the consequences of tolerance,

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.670
but I'm firmly committed to
accepting the consequences.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.460
You were asking more
about am I worried that

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.530
people are gonna become less tolerant

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.520
and try to impose on me.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.850
Well yes, that's always a threat.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.800
That certainly is a threat.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.110
But I think we've done pretty well.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.020
The demand that people be prevented

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.420
from living the lifestyle they want,

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.740
expressing the values they want

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.220
because it's gonna have a bad
effect on social mores is,

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.770
as I've said, something
that's always being raised.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.150
But so far, I think we've
done reasonably well

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.010
at beating it back.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.710
And so, one always wants to be worried.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:52.031
That's what the ACLU and
organizations like that are for.

00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:53.770
And they're necessary.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.710
Because one always has
to be worried about that.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.900
But that's a different kind of pessimism.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.210
I'm not so pessimistic.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.620
I'm hopeful on that.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.670
Although I just have to
keep my fingers crossed

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.690
on the other front about
where it's gonna lead.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.530
- So I guess, is it fair to say that

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:14.530
philosophy's stake in this is
clarifying what the issues are

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.500
with regard to something like tolerance,

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.950
helping us understand,
defining the questions

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:25.950
so we see what the problem
is in the bigger picture?

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.120
- See what the problem is
and see why a certain answer

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.720
is one that we should rest with.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.522
As you said properly, philosophers have,

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:41.360
anybody has a responsibility
to try to participate

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.230
in public discussion.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.602
And maybe, philosophers
have thought a lot about it.

00:47:45.602 --> 00:47:46.435
You think it would be a good thing.

00:47:46.435 --> 00:47:48.060
Many people may not think that.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.110
They ought to try to get
their ideas out there.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.270
Having said that, it may be
an embarrassing thing to say

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.030
that philosophy is to a very high degree

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.880
a first-person subject.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.890
I write about tolerance because

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.910
although I wanna be tolerant,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.490
I think but look, it's got this price.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.280
If we're at all gonna be tolerant, then

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.120
what kind of society are
we gonna be living in?

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.400
So I feel that tension.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.750
And I wanna get an answer to the question.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.550
Given that I think it has this cost,

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:15.097
why am I so concerned with it?

00:48:15.097 --> 00:48:18.000
And that goes back to my
interchange with my father

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.720
when I said how can they
let the newspaper say

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.870
this kind of thing.

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.920
People are being systematically misled

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.880
about this subject, and that's gonna have

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.100
very bad political consequences.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.378
And my father said, "Who's to decide?"

00:48:30.378 --> 00:48:32.330
(laughs)

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.370
So, similar I might say about tolerance.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.410
Who's gonna be the police?

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:38.060
Are we gonna say that
somebody can just say,

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.610
okay, now we've got the society we want.

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:41.360
You can stop thinking
about how you want to live.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.540
You got to accept this.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.920
No, we don't want anybody
to decide that way.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.753
Well,

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.613
why not?

00:48:47.613 --> 00:48:48.820
Can we say more about that side of it

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.970
to make us see more clearly

00:48:52.172 --> 00:48:54.952
why that's the right side to come down.

00:48:54.952 --> 00:48:58.040
And then think about all the
objections you can raise.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.610
And how can those objections be answered.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.770
So we're really trying
to answer a curiosity

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.920
that comes from within.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.070
- If students were to watch this program,

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.980
and they find your discussion

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.380
of your own career interesting,

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.030
how would you advise them
to prepare for the future

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.090
either as a philosopher

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.830
or as somebody who draws philosophy

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.280
into their way of thinking,

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.000
whatever that might be, and profession?

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.978
- Well, studying philosophy,

00:49:28.978 --> 00:49:31.300
for the topics we've
just been talking about

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.130
in political philosophy,
studying political

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.130
and constitutional
history is a very good way

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.860
to get a sense of the form that
these questions have taken.

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.470
And I think that they come more alive

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:40.970
for people often when they read them

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:43.580
not directly in the context
of a philosophical theory,

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.620
but by seeing how they played out

00:49:49.225 --> 00:49:51.580
in actual practice.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.550
So if you read one of Anthony Lewis' books

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.140
about the First Amendment

00:49:57.319 --> 00:50:01.420
or about the rights of the
accused, Gideon's Trumpet,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.610
that gives you a feeling
of the way in which

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.150
rights play out in actual
historical context.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.040
I think that gets you going.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.795
But then the next step is
to try to think about it

00:50:11.795 --> 00:50:13.670
in a more theoretical way.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.890
And at that point, it's
probably better to read.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:17.240
What you need to do is
read some philosophy.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.780
Or better, get into a
class where you can argue

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.920
with people who wanna argue
about it philosophically

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.470
so you can get some
experience in doing it.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.410
- And you seem to
emphasize at the beginning

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.420
of our discussion your
background in logic and math,

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.470
that learning to think about things

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.830
other than the things you
wanna think about really.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.663
- Right.

00:50:36.663 --> 00:50:38.215
Well of course, those were
things I wanted to think about.

00:50:38.215 --> 00:50:39.256
(laughs)

00:50:39.256 --> 00:50:42.860
That was kind of an indulgence,
sort of like doing Sudoku.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.710
Pure pleasure thinking about

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:47.170
whether you can find a proof of something.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.480
I think studying that sort
of thing is great discipline.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.540
It's something some people enjoy.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.373
Some people don't.

00:50:51.373 --> 00:50:54.120
It isn't essential for doing philosophy

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.440
although maybe it helps a little bit.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.640
But a lot of people do
philosophy who aren't

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.980
drawn to those technical questions.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.030
- Now in terms of your
lecture here on campus,

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.360
and what your current research is on,

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.080
I guess you're working
on the problem of blame.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.560
Is that ...

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.180
- Yes, it's embarrassing
enough to be sitting

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.807
next to somebody on an
airplane and they ask you,

00:51:13.807 --> 00:51:14.640
"What do you do?"

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.105
And you have to say you're a philosopher.

00:51:16.105 --> 00:51:19.497
It carries it to an extreme if they say,

00:51:19.497 --> 00:51:20.499
"What are you working on?"

00:51:20.499 --> 00:51:21.520
And you say, well for
the last couple of years,

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.696
I've been thinking about blame.

00:51:22.696 --> 00:51:24.370
(laughs)

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:27.193
They really start edging
away from you on the seat.

00:51:30.486 --> 00:51:34.079
- Well if you were flying
jetBlue, you (mumbles)

00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:35.640
- That's right; that's right.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.860
But I partly got into this by thinking

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.010
about questions of free will.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.800
That is everybody thinks,
or many people think,

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.760
that in order to be blamed for something,

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.040
we have to have done it freely.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.980
And that raises the question:

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.510
are we really free in a relevant sense?

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.220
So that's a deep philosophical,

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.770
familiar and deep philosophical question.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.610
It seems to me though
that in order to address

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:55.790
that question, you gotta first get an idea

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.130
about what blame is.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:58.844
'Cause we don't think that in order

00:51:58.844 --> 00:52:02.100
for people properly to
say that you're ugly,

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.740
or handsome, or that you
have a nice singing voice

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.890
or whatever, you've got
to have freely chosen

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.650
to have those merits, or
demerits as the case may be.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.110
So something particular
about the kind of appraisal

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.560
that moral criticism or praise involves

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.423
that it seems to entail the condition

00:52:20.423 --> 00:52:22.720
that that kind of criticism
is only appropriate

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.750
if the person has control over whether

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.160
they are like that or not.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.430
Why should that be true?

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.140
So that's the sort of
question that leads you

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.810
into asking what are we
doing when we're doing this?

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:34.890
And there are various
candidate answers out there.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:38.040
And I didn't find many of
them very satisfactory.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.567
So I got interested in the
question of thinking about

00:52:40.567 --> 00:52:43.543
what blame really amounted to.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.053
Then that led to a lot of thinking.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.850
And it changes in mind
over a period of years

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.530
thinking about it.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.390
- Well I know that we'll
look forward to your book

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.470
when it comes out.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:59.280
And people will watch the lecture.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.150
But in the meantime, I
wanna thank you very much

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.510
for being our guest today

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.530
and giving a sense of philosophy.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.670
And let me show the book
that we talked about,

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:12.234
The Difficulty of Tolerance:
Essays in Political Philosophy.

00:53:12.234 --> 00:53:13.338
Thank you very much for this.

00:53:13.338 --> 00:53:14.323
- Thank you, Harry; I enjoyed it.

00:53:14.323 --> 00:53:15.990
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.791
for this Conversation With History.

00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:21.541
