1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.160
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.900
<v 1>All right.
We are on location at the blaze studios here in Dallas,</v>

3
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.580
Texas.
And I'm sitting across from Mr [inaudible],

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.290
Glenn Beck or sir,
how's it going?
My man.
Good to see you.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.060
Thank you for letting us do an on location shoot.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.960
<v 2>Not a problem.
I know you're here for about 10 minutes and then you're,</v>

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.850
I think you're going to probably be on the moon and then a stop at the Mars and

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.240
<v 1>you know a little bit about traveling a lot.
Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.440
So I'm in between a thousand things here.
Uh,
yeah,
it's,
it's pretty cool.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.490
I want to spend a lot of time talking about this book here,
addicted to outrage.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.890
Um,
but let's just do everything.

12
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.891
So right now we're about two and a half weeks away from this mid term election.

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.690
I suspect something completely bananas over the next two and a half weeks.

14
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:52.250
I mean,
you can already just see between,

15
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.290
between the cabinet stuff that we've been dealing with,

16
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.810
the general outrage and all the things you're writing about here.
So here,

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.080
I just said this to a group of friends the other day.

18
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.260
<v 2>I think at this point a spaceship could appear.</v>

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.550
Okay.
And,
and hover over New York City and to be like,
Huh.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.690
I mean I don't know what would surprise me now.

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 1>Well we'd be arguing about the gender pronouns at the aliens.
Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.110
<v 2>I know.
I know.
It's,</v>

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
it's absolutely insane how everything is,

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.820
everything is upside down.
Everything is upside down.

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.870
<v 1>Do you think,</v>

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.780
do you think we're in a unique time because that's one of the questions when I'm

27
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.690
out there with Peterson,
often people say,
okay,
it's,
you know,

28
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:37.710
everyone says we've never been more partisan and were angrier than ever and all

29
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:41.010
of these things.
But does something about this seem unique?

30
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.880
<v 2>Yeah,
I I'm a,
I'm a glutton for history.
Yes.
And uh,</v>

31
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.310
it,
it,
we have been in perilous times before.

32
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
I don't think we've hit the civil war,
uh,
confrontations yet,

33
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.580
but we are approaching it.

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.520
<v 1>Do you think we really are?
Cause I do,</v>

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.610
cause I'm actually worried about the amount of people I used to see this on

36
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.790
Twitter all the time.
People saying,
oh,
civil wars come in,
you know,

37
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:09.410
like it's like murmur about what would be the most horrific possible outcome of

38
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:09.860
all that.

39
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.200
<v 2>So remind me to talk about the window cause I think we have a window right now.</v>

40
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.390
Um,
but we have been,
uh,
we've been worse.
I mean,

41
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.030
if you look at Jefferson and Adams,
you know,

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.890
Adams Adams was called a Hermaphrodite by Jefferson Jefferson.

43
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.920
Jefferson.
Uh,
his campaign,
uh,
um,

44
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.560
called him a hermaphrodite.

45
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
Adam said back that if you elect Thomas Jefferson,

46
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.270
there will be blood in the streets and the heads of our children and your

47
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.090
daughters will be on Pike's into every town.

48
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.190
So we've had rhetoric like this.

49
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.660
<v 1>Ironically,
I'd be thrilled to vote for either one
would be like,</v>

50
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.690
I'll take either,
I don't care heads on pikes,
that would be fine.

51
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.100
But it all does go to,
in the last couple of weeks,

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.311
<v 2>you know,</v>

53
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:04.630
there was this Hillary Clinton Lion on CNN talking to Christiane Amanpour about

54
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.480
how we can't be civil because these,
these people,

55
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.350
meaning the Conservatives or Republicans are so against our values.
I mean,

56
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.090
this is dangerous stuff.
Here's the difference.
Um,

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.610
we have been in these places before,

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.370
but we knew our founding documents.

59
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.200
We knew who we served or who our God was.

60
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.940
And I don't know who our God is now.
I mean,
is it money?
Is it fame?
Is it anger?

61
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.420
I don't know what our God is now.
Um,
we knew,
wait,
can you wait,

62
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:36.640
let me pause you there for a sec.
So when you,

63
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.100
when you say that about what the founders believed now,

64
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.800
they were also saying separation of church and state the whole time.

65
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.801
So if you were just laying out what they believed when you say we knew who our

66
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.950
guide was,
um,
so George Washington,

67
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.790
they did believe in the division of Church and state.

68
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.210
Clearly I do too.
Yeah.
Um,

69
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.560
that just means if you're an atheist,
you're an atheist.
We're friends,
we're cool,

70
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.890
let's get along.
But if you're a god person,

71
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.680
you'll do your God's thing.
You do your atheist thing.

72
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.210
Do we have what Adam Smith called moral sentiment in common?

73
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.080
Yes.
Capitalism,
uh,

74
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.380
has lost the first volume of Adam Smith.

75
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.170
The second volume is wealth of nations.

76
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.520
The first volume is moral sentiments.
And that says,
look,

77
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.930
this is an invisible hand and the market is powerful and it will create whatever

78
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:36.100
you want.
Be careful what you ask for.

79
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.780
Make sure you are always tempering the moral sentiment.

80
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.260
Make sure that you're good,
decent,
fair minded people.

81
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.690
We've lost that.
We're losing it,
I should say.
Um,

82
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.700
and I'm concerned,
and I talk about this a bit in the book.

83
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.650
I've seen this coming for almost two decades and I have been warning against it.

84
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.800
And for the very first time I'm at the place where I'm on the air now saying,

85
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.790
this is the time.
This is the time that I said would come.
Yeah.

86
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.800
And now is the time for you to remember who you are.

87
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.250
Um,
and our outrage is taking us away from it.

88
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.410
So as I've looked at this for so long,
I have,

89
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.040
I have studied revolutions.
I have,

90
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.020
I've studied giant movements of chaos.
I,
I can tell you about,

91
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.790
you know,
uh,
the,
um,
I think it was the red month,
uh,

92
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.330
in the 1930s.
Like,
I can show you what's happened,

93
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.790
but there were three people in four people in grand movements that have gotten

94
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.560
it right.
There was Abraham Lincoln,
there was Martin Luther King.

95
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.470
There was Gandhi.
Then there's Bonhoeffer,

96
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.600
Bonhoeffer.
Do you know who Dietrich Bonhoeffer was?
I don't think so.

97
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.370
Bonhoeffer lost.
Okay.
Bonhoeffer was a,

98
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.640
um,
a,
uh,

99
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.480
pastor I think Lutheran in Germany.
He,
uh,

100
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.280
was on the air when the fear of declared he was fear he was taking,

101
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:23.260
his broadcast was cutting short because he was doing a broadcast called the

102
00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:26.900
[inaudible] principle.
This is wrong.
Don't go this way.

103
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.300
He on Kristallnacht.
The very next morning he was shopping in those stores,

104
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:35.750
those Jewish stores,
um,
pacifist.

105
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.360
He tried to turn the Germans back and say,
stop it.
Stop.

106
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:44.330
Stop.
You're going the wrong way.
He couldn't do it.

107
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.410
He eventually escaped from,
uh,
Germany was in New York,

108
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.200
not here very long as he felt guilty.

109
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.130
How can I leave my country when it's in this much trouble?
He went back.

110
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.300
He realized there's no,
the noise has stopped.

111
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:03.080
This guy may be violence is the answer he was involved in.
Um,

112
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.930
one of the attempts to kill,
um,
Hitler,

113
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.620
he went to a concentration camp.
He died.

114
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.790
He was executed like five days before Hitler died.
Here's the thing,

115
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.670
if you read his writings,
he's gone to,
he's Jesus.
He's Martin Luther King.
He's,

116
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.710
he's,
he's got it and that every,
read them and read them and read them.
How,

117
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.910
why did he fail?

118
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.290
Silence in the face of evil is evil itself not to stand is to stand.

119
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:35.330
He's got it.
Love one another.

120
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.510
Don't stop playing the organ so you can hear the,
the train going down.

121
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.630
Twits okay.

122
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.240
He failed because Germans had already gone over the cliff.

123
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.640
They had because of World War One,
then the treaty of Versailles,

124
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.590
then the 1920s,

125
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.100
they had already lost their Judeo Christian principles.

126
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:02.720
They had lost their center.
Remember,
if it wasn't for England,

127
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.670
Gandhi would have failed.

128
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.350
People think of Gandhi is starving himself to get the British to comply.
No,

129
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.890
he starved himself to say to his own people do not rise up in anger.

130
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.970
They were this close to losing and he knew it.

131
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.060
He was appealing to the sense of decency and fairness of the British culture.

132
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.050
So he knew the people because of their Judeo Christian worldview would see this

133
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:37.070
oppression and go,
that's wrong.
If we have a window and it's closing,

134
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.180
if we give into our anger,
our outrage,
and we say,

135
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.830
you know what?
I can't take it anymore.
We will lose.

136
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.960
And that window of the Judeo Christian values will close and then we're done.

137
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.830
Yeah.

138
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.890
It's so interesting because one of the themes that keeps coming up as I'm on

139
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:56.190
this tour is people

140
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 1>keep asking me about this.</v>

141
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.690
How much worse is it going to get before there's some sort of reset and all of

142
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.280
these things?
And it's like,
man,

143
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.370
I don't want two months from now or four years from now to look back at right

144
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.330
before the 2018 elections and go,
boy,

145
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.380
weren't those the good old days because we've gone on on the train to hell.

146
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.960
So do you think there's actually no way to stop it at this point?

147
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.820
Do you think that,
no,
I think they understood behind it.

148
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.120
<v 2>So here's,
here's the scenarios that I'm looking at right now.</v>

149
00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:24.790
If I'm war gaming.
Yeah.
Okay.
None of these,

150
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.610
I know the prediction business always works out.
So let's see here.
I got it.

151
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.930
So if you're wargaming yeah,
let's look at the next election.
What happens?

152
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.490
Well,
the Democrats probably gonna win the house.
Okay?
They win the house.

153
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.030
You know,
they're going to at least subpoena his tax records.

154
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.930
He's not going to give up tax records that'll be brought to the supreme court.

155
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.290
Remember that marker number one,
that's day number one.
Day number two,

156
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.150
they don't have any place they can go on impeachment.
They have to impeach him.

157
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.720
Even if they don't have anything.
They've already said it.
They have to do,

158
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:58.920
they have to do it.
It'll be the senate that will throw,

159
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.330
they'll throw it to the senate.
That's where the trial happens.

160
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.280
So impeachment just means or taking you to court.
Okay?
So that's day number two.

161
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.470
Day number three,
uh,
Trump has already filed with the Supreme Court saying,

162
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.130
I'm not,
I'm not testifying,
I'm not turning over my tax records.

163
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.020
I'm not doing this.
Okay.

164
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.670
Well Cavanaugh has already said he's already seen that that's a distraction the

165
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:24.430
president shouldn't have to.
So day number three,

166
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.200
when Trump has brought it to the Supreme Court,
then the house says,

167
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.260
wait a minute,
Cavenaugh should recuse himself.

168
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.840
We are looking at a year where,
uh,

169
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.160
the three branches of government,
the administration,
uh,

170
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.190
plus the house and the Senate,
both of them will be fighting with each other.

171
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.580
They'll be fighting with this branch and there'll be fighting with the supreme

172
00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:51.460
court.
When Cavenaugh doesn't recuse himself,

173
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.370
they will file articles of impeachment for him.

174
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.460
<v 1>And they're,
they're leading all of these ideas already.
I mean,</v>

175
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.020
these ideas are trickling out of this.

176
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.150
<v 2>Yeah.
So now you have the press.</v>

177
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.060
The fourth branch already in chaos has,

178
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.950
has absolutely no credibility at all.
It's deranged.

179
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.840
And that pushes which you would call the fifth branch for the first branch,

180
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.310
the people into the streets.
How do you solve that?

181
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.090
<v 1>All right,
so before we get to the streets,</v>

182
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:24.890
can I give you the one option that I think maybe saves us from all of that,

183
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.670
which is that the Republicans win,
or at least hold in the mid terms.

184
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.910
Thus finally as long shot is,

185
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.360
this is finally the Democrats go,
okay,

186
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.610
we've got to drop identity politics.

187
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:42.630
We've got to get away from this socialist Democrat,
Democrat,
socialist.

188
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.321
Not that I,

189
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.840
there's no evidence that they would ever look in the mirror if anything,

190
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.610
they've only doubled down every time.

191
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.260
But I see that as the only outlet to where you are.

192
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.760
<v 2>So I think if you have,
if they don't win the house,
if you win the house,</v>

193
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.670
God forbid if they win the house and the Senate,
then it's chaos.
But if you win,

194
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.700
if they win the house,
the Democrats,

195
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.700
that scenario is going to play out in some form or another.

196
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.770
So that just gets worse and worse and worse.

197
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.880
I was talking to a friend of mine just last night about this and he said,

198
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.350
you know,
just exactly what you said,
and I followed it up with what you said.

199
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.761
Show me the,

200
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:20.170
I know there's no evidence I am Spartacus is all of a sudden going to say,

201
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.200
okay,
I'm not Spartacus.
Yeah.
You know,

202
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.420
I'm the carpenter from,
you know,
from Nazareth.
Now,

203
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.590
<v 1>wasn't that the danger all along and this,
this is directly linked to your book.</v>

204
00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:34.560
I mean,
I remember before the election I kept saying,
yeah,

205
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.020
this is when I still considered myself on the left.

206
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:40.410
And someone that had basically only voted Democrat my entire life.

207
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.430
I think the one time I voted Republican was a Bloomberg's third term in New York

208
00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.310
City after he had flipped like 87 times over or something.

209
00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:49.980
I'm not even sure if he was a republican at that point.
Um,

210
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.680
but that I kept saying before the election,

211
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.590
if you keep calling Trump Hitler,

212
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.760
then no matter what he does and no matter what reality is,

213
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.120
you'll never be able to get yourself out of that little thing place you've

214
00:13:03.121 --> 00:13:06.300
painted yourself.
And that's where we are.
So,
you know,
it's crazy.

215
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.960
<v 2>I lived this,
I lived this.</v>

216
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.370
I said,
I'm the guy who got in so much trouble saying,

217
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.320
I think Barack Obama may be a racist.

218
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.490
Now I immediately corrected it in that on the spot and said,

219
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.330
that's not quite right.
I now understand.
I explain it in the book.

220
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.300
I now understand how to express that.

221
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.460
I wasn't up on anti colonialism.
I certainly wasn't up on postmodernism.

222
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.150
I wasn't.

223
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.380
So I'm hearing all these terms that mean nothing to me and yet they're always

224
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:42.610
attacking groups to me and to a lot of people in the country.

225
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.130
That's the definition of racist.
Okay.

226
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.140
But I didn't understand the difference.
The other part,

227
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:54.010
the other part of it,
okay,
it's now social justice.
Okay,

228
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.150
well social justice seems wrong to me.
That's how I defined it then.

229
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.750
That was so divisive when I said that.

230
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:06.070
And I was really at the time struggling to figure out what is happening.
How is,

231
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.600
who is this guy?
Um,

232
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.200
and I got more and more strident,

233
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.150
<v 3>uh,
and</v>

234
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.080
<v 2>didn't make a lot of friends on the left.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

235
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.380
it didn't work.
It didn't work.

236
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.970
My base got stronger,
my bass learned things.

237
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.870
But my base also as things went on,

238
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.760
got more and more angry as did I,
why isn't this working?
Well,

239
00:14:34.761 --> 00:14:39.470
because you cannot call people names and expect them to come over.

240
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.860
We have,
I just saw new poll today that shows,

241
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.620
I think it's 8% of the American public.

242
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.510
8,000 people interviewed 8% of the American public is the die hard.

243
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:55.490
Progressive.
Radical.
Okay.
Um,
the,

244
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.540
uh,
the never give up conservative.

245
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.980
Traditional conservative is about 29%.
Okay.

246
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.330
They're both on the edges.
27,
29%,
somewhere in that area.

247
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.980
Still on the edges.

248
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.360
The vast majority is now being called the exhausted class and it's the class of

249
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:23.120
people and I'm in this guys,
it doesn't have to be this way.

250
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.380
I don't,
I'm tired of this.
I know.
Not Everybody is a racist.

251
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.330
Not everybody is a homophobe.
This the stop it.
Stop it.

252
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.050
The cabinet Jordan Peterson got into trouble and I tweeted,

253
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.810
I tweeted back to him.
I think this might be the first time I disagree,

254
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:44.750
but I put I think because,

255
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.970
<v 1>well for people that didn't see it,</v>

256
00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:50.260
basically he said that would probably be best.

257
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:52.980
And he did this in a tweet,
which is never the best way to do it.
Idea.

258
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.801
And He's already,

259
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:57.460
he's already had his mayor Koch on that and released a correct not correction,

260
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.300
a clarification in a blog form.
Uh,

261
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.030
but basically he said the best outcome would be the cabinet gets confirmed but

262
00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:05.110
then steps down.

263
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.070
And what he meant was that wasn't saying the Cavenaugh did do anything or didn't

264
00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:09.461
do anything.

265
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:13.150
But if there's any chance for a little bit of healing where everyone gets a

266
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:17.050
little egg on their face but also gets a little bit of dignity to walk away with

267
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.700
and the country doesn't come apart at the seams.

268
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:21.940
That was what he tried to do in a tweet.
And in his blog posts,

269
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.600
he's acknowledged that trying to do that in a tweet,
probably not the best thing.

270
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.490
<v 2>Trying to do that in a tweet.
Um,</v>

271
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.870
where the people who are reading it are generally all about politics and tearing

272
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:34.760
each other apart.
Yeah.
Bad idea.

273
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.910
That's why I put I think because knowing Jordan the little that I do,

274
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.550
yeah,
he's a deep philosophical thinker.

275
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.910
So my,
my feeling was,

276
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:50.530
and it turns out it was right that he's looking at that and saying,
okay,
in,

277
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.280
in a normal world,

278
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.580
in a good world where we're all really trying to do the right thing.

279
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.690
And if we really were all trying to do the right thing,
I agree with him,

280
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.440
it would have been the best thing to have Jordan say or to have Kevin.

281
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.210
I'll say thank you.
Thank you.

282
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.610
Now let's bring the country back together.

283
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.330
Nominate somebody else and let's go through.

284
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.730
But the other side would have gone through exactly the same thing.

285
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.890
You would have rewarded them in the end.
Cause I got it.

286
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.450
Because we're talking about the machines of destruction.

287
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.040
So reality doesn't play a role.
At some point,

288
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:33.100
this 70% of America is going to stand up and say,

289
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.260
shut up.
Both of you

290
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.330
<v 1>shocked how many people in that 70% are just afraid to do that because when we</v>

291
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:45.760
do these meet and greets after the Peterson events,

292
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.820
I think the number one question I get asked is what can I do?

293
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:54.930
I'm afraid to speak and I cannot,
I mean I see this,
you know,

294
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:58.400
from people that I'm sitting this close to and I see this look in their eyes a

295
00:17:58.401 --> 00:18:02.340
fear.
And it's like,
I don't think I'm that brave.
I don't know why I'm doing this.

296
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:04.320
I don't,
I'm just doing it.
I can't explain it,

297
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.910
but I don't wake up every morning and I'm like,

298
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.120
what am I going to do today to fight Google and fight the political powers?

299
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.670
And I'm just like,
I'm just doing what I think is right.
That's it.

300
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.940
<v 2>That,
so that goes to,</v>

301
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.960
I brought my family thousand 11 to Auschwitz and I did it again because I see

302
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.010
over the horizon I think.

303
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:32.030
And we stood outside of the gates and um,

304
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.740
we had a prayer and then I said,
okay,

305
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.120
we are here because we have to look at the ugliest thing man has done.

306
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.390
And we have to decide who we are,
who we're going to be.

307
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.590
Because if you weren't prepared,

308
00:18:55.591 --> 00:19:00.330
and I don't mean prepare for that kind of stuff,
I mean really know who you are.

309
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.730
You will not stand when the jackbooted thugs come down the street.

310
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.120
You have to know who you are and what you believe.

311
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.660
So I had them read a story of the righteous of the nation.

312
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:17.100
They could pick anyone who saved Jews and really try to get into their head.

313
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.070
I lined up and uh,

314
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.040
a just a family kind of conversation with this sweet woman.

315
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.990
She just died I think last week.
She's 90 years old.
She was a Christian.

316
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.350
She was 16 years old.
When she saved the first Jew.

317
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.640
Her whole family did it.
It was remarkable.

318
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.240
Um,
and we,
we talked about it.

319
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.300
Two things I learned on that trip.

320
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.400
One as we were leaving,
I said to her,
look,

321
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.490
I have a responsibility that's different than most because I speak to so many

322
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:57.480
people.
And I said,
I believe that people have that tree of righteousness in them.

323
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.570
I think they have that goodness.
They want to do the right thing.

324
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.490
How do I water it?
She told me something so profound.

325
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.090
It's so game changing.
She,

326
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.280
she looked at me so puzzled and she said,
you misunderstand.

327
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.000
The righteous didn't suddenly become righteous.

328
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.380
They just refused to go over the cliff with the rest of humanity.

329
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.290
All you have to do is remember what you've always believed was true and they

330
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:31.590
just stand and just go,
hmm,
no,
you guys are crazy.

331
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.640
You don't have to be a hero.
You're not a hero.
She was looking at me.

332
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:38.580
She wouldn't let me film or she only let me take one picture of her.

333
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.390
She wanted to nothing because she's like,
I'm not a hero.

334
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.380
I just remembered what was right.
That's remarkable.

335
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.520
Do you that the default position

336
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.590
<v 1>of humanity is to cower?</v>

337
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.860
That is that in these moments it seems like it's a lot easier to cower,

338
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.360
right?
I mean,
even now,
like that's the thing.

339
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:01.510
When people say this to me about w how do I get brave or whatever,

340
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:06.200
it's like we live in the freest place in the history of the world.
Need bravery.

341
00:21:06.201 --> 00:21:06.850
And if you're,

342
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.480
if you're afraid now imagine the second that thing gets turned a little bit

343
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.710
about how afraid you are going to be.
So it seems like,
like fear and,

344
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:17.890
and I'm sure there's a psychological component to this that fear does something

345
00:21:17.891 --> 00:21:20.320
in the brain that may be bravery or,

346
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.860
or maybe it really is about just knowing what you are and what your,

347
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.610
<v 2>let me tell you two stories.
Um,
uh,</v>

348
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.690
first fear shuts your brain down.
Okay.

349
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.310
It's shuts reason down.

350
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.260
You're in fight or flight and that's a good thing because you don't want to be

351
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:41.060
going,
well I don't know.
Should I hit him a little harder?
You're just swinging.

352
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.100
So fear and anger really bad and that's why we're addicted.

353
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:48.600
Outrage.
We will swing yet.

354
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.500
Got To get shaped that or your won't think it's biological.

355
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.100
Two stories.
Um,

356
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.700
the other person we met with in Poland was the chief rabbi and he said,

357
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.260
I think it was 7,000.
There were 7,000 people that stood.

358
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:11.760
And I was,
I mean when you,
have you been out with,
no,
I have it.

359
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.930
When you go,
there's churches.
I mean a block away.
Yeah.

360
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.910
There were houses everywhere and they're old.

361
00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:22.230
They were there and why I left there and I was enraged.

362
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.650
I remember crying and,

363
00:22:25.651 --> 00:22:29.310
and looking at the houses and screaming in my head,

364
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.210
where the hell were you?
Where were you?

365
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:34.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

366
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.560
<v 2>I meet with him and I said,</v>

367
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.330
how out of all the millions of people,
and he said,

368
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.780
<v 4>yeah,</v>

369
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.620
<v 2>yeah.
You're thinking,
that's a small number.</v>

370
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.810
You said that's an incredible number of people.
People,

371
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.940
you're in a scary movie.

372
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.350
You look away when something like this is coming.

373
00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.620
It is human nature to look away or to dismiss and you,

374
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.630
it's,
it's,
it's um,

375
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.830
we have this gift of fear that warns us,

376
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.220
but we use logic and sometimes we use it just to protect ourselves because Dave,

377
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.310
I don't think people are afraid of standing.

378
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.660
I think they're afraid of knowing the truth.

379
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.160
You look at the people who stand,

380
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.580
the people who stand are the ones who are going,
you know,

381
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.480
I learned something new.
I learned something.
It's changed me.

382
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.220
They're not standing.

383
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.710
You're not standing cause you're brave and I'm going to take a stand.

384
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.160
You're saying,
wait a minute,
I just scales fell off my eyes.

385
00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:47.430
I just learned something.
When you are inquisitive.

386
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.650
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

387
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.600
<v 2>When you are based in,
wait a minute,
I I really want to know.</v>

388
00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:00.200
You have already prepared to,
yeah,
but do you really,

389
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.710
you and I,
I know you know this.
I think we've talked about it.

390
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.180
I went through it and you went through it.

391
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.540
You do come to a point to where you're saying,

392
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.340
if I take another step,
yeah.
Everything in my life could change.

393
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.280
My friends might change.
They might look at me differently.

394
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.870
And you take that step and say,
yeah,
I want to know the truth.

395
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.360
That's where people fail

396
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.040
<v 4>the,</v>

397
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.500
<v 2>if you can't take that leap,</v>

398
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.420
and that's why I really think you're seeing people like you.

399
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.230
You're seeing the inquisitive because that's in their nature to question

400
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.140
question,
wait a minute.
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make sense.

401
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.580
And if you're like that,

402
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.350
you most likely have already passed that line of uncomfortability because you've

403
00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:49.800
had things that you realize that you went,
oh crap.
Okay,

404
00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:52.950
well I guess I don't believe that anymore.
Yeah.

405
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.160
<v 1>You don't know how I could wake up and put stuff in my hair and look in the</v>

406
00:24:57.161 --> 00:25:00.190
mirror and go.
That's why I just don't know how I could do it,

407
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:01.740
but I know some people do it and then I get,

408
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.660
I think this is what Jordan would describe as sort of the slow road to hell.

409
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.500
You will just diminish yourself in diminish yourself every every day of your

410
00:25:08.501 --> 00:25:09.430
life until the end.
Yeah.

411
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.520
<v 2>You have to stop looking.</v>

412
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.760
You have to turn around because it will always present you with the option.

413
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.030
Oh,
you sought,

414
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.350
you looked out and you saw them just lining up a family of Jews shooting them.

415
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.000
Okay.
Now what do you do once you see it?

416
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.220
It presents you with the choice.

417
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.970
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

418
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.250
<v 2>Do I go back to sleep or do I stand</v>

419
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.700
<v 1>so I know every,
you know,
it's very easy to always be like,
okay,</v>

420
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:39.260
both sides are going crazy.

421
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:42.050
They're equally horrible and all of those things like that.

422
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:44.110
Sort of like the easy,
the easy way of doing it.

423
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.500
I'm not saying that that's what you're doing here,

424
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:48.230
but that's sort of the easy way to do it.
And we all fall in that trap sometimes,

425
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:51.530
right?
Because just for brevity sake,
sometimes it's easier to say that,

426
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.930
but it seems to me that for all the people that,
that absolutely despise Trump,

427
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.180
that,
that hate everything about the right,

428
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:01.850
the right basically has been in power for the last two years.

429
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.140
There's a lot of good things happening in the country related to economics and

430
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:07.940
the fact that we're not entering foreign wars.

431
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:11.150
And there's some interesting things happening with North Korea in a series of

432
00:26:11.151 --> 00:26:16.010
other things.
And the state has not used its power to silence anyone.

433
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.790
What I fear,
and this is why I don't think it's an even,
oh,

434
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:24.500
both sides are crazy thing,
is that the left is about state power.

435
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.480
And what I fear is they've said,
or half of the country's Nazis,

436
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.760
we cannot be civil with them because they're coming to get us.

437
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.710
And if these people took power,

438
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.970
well now we have everything that you just laid out because they don't mind using

439
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.400
the apparatus of the state,
right.
To accomplish their goals.

440
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:43.020
And I'm not saying Republicans are always write about this stuff and they,

441
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.160
they screw up all

442
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.830
<v 2>the little government things that they should care about.
And all of that,</v>

443
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.950
the left has become everything.
They said the tea party was okay,

444
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.740
that we weren't,
we weren't,
um,
they have become violent.

445
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.030
They have become unreasonable.

446
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.510
They want to silence people and they will silence people.

447
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:05.070
That's why you're seeing people start,
begin to stand up and say,
ha,

448
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.990
um,
however,
it's one of my fears with Donald Trump.

449
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.340
And the great thing is he says a lot and most of it never happens.

450
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.320
You know what I mean?
My fear is,
um,
he has said,
you know,

451
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:22.950
maybe we should look into the license of these companies.
You know,

452
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.570
I don't think he means it,

453
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:30.040
but you signal that to people on the right or the left your,

454
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.380
you're basically saying,
yeah,
that's on the,
that's on the field of play.

455
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.780
It's not on the field of play.
Um,

456
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.570
although there's an interesting libertarian argument whether the government

457
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:41.310
should be giving licensing.
No,
no,
no.

458
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:43.770
I don't think he should have licensed at all.
Right,
right,
right.
I don't,

459
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.680
I certainly don't want the government to say,
you know what,

460
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.090
you've been a little harsh,
so I'm going to look into your license.
No,
right.

461
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.590
Not at all.
Get him out of that.
Here's the,

462
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.570
here's the thing that people aren't thinking about.

463
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.320
Government is about to become,

464
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.470
unless it marries into it,

465
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:07.930
pretty inconsequential because it will never be able to keep up with technology.

466
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.740
So it was that the saving grace here?
No,
not,
not that.

467
00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:13.270
I was going to give Google a Lotta.

468
00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:18.330
The left is concentrating their power in silicon valley and that's where you can

469
00:28:20.651 --> 00:28:23.430
really silence people.
The guy who wrote,
um,

470
00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:28.120
IBM and the Holocaust,
um,
gosh,
I can't remember his name.

471
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.250
Really Brilliant Guy.
Well thought out.
Um,

472
00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.010
we were talking and um,

473
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.010
we were talking about how the Germans,

474
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.090
how they silence people and how they,

475
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.500
they coordinate people off and then just get smaller and smaller groups.

476
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.670
And then they eventually put you behind a wall in a ghetto.

477
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.653
<v 5>Well,</v>

478
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.340
<v 2>they would build the wall higher and higher so people couldn't hear or see.</v>

479
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.070
Isn't that what Google and Facebook are doing?
We're building digital ghettos.

480
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.580
We have the ability now you can speak all you want Dave,

481
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.480
but I'm changing the algorithm and you're not going to be heard.
I mean,

482
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.410
you look at what the deal with Facebook was.

483
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.630
I promote them.

484
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.790
I give them my 10 million listeners and I say,
Hey,

485
00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:29.600
you can find me at Facebook.
Let's communicate.

486
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.850
Then they take those listeners that said,
I want to hear from him.

487
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.690
Yeah,

488
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.220
and then they changed the algorithm and I can't communicate to my own people.

489
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.100
Yeah,
and know this is happening across

490
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.400
<v 1>the board.
You probably saw my insane tweet thread about all of that.</v>

491
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:48.010
I just started re tweeting all of these people,
real people,

492
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.990
not Russian bots and avatars.

493
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:53.590
I was taking purposely real people with real names or real pictures and they're

494
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.900
all saying they're unsubscribed.
There were people who pay.

495
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.280
It wasn't just the free people,

496
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.790
it was the people who pay for youtube red or youtube TV still getting

497
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:04.120
unsubscribed and it's like,
what did we all sign up for here?

498
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.660
But dare I do you like the biblical analogies?
I'll do one here.

499
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.220
There was David versus Goliath and I think Dave can take down Google

500
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.593
<v 2>this.
Dave,</v>

501
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.770
<v 1>I think there's a chance,
I mean,
I think that story,</v>

502
00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:19.050
I'm being slightly hyperbolic obviously,

503
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.990
but I think that these things have become so big.
I mean,

504
00:30:21.991 --> 00:30:25.560
this I guess is what the essence of the story was,
right?
That this Goliath,

505
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.040
this Google has become so big that it will crumble under its own,

506
00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:31.650
under the weight of its own crap,
basically.

507
00:30:31.651 --> 00:30:36.270
That there will be enough people inside the broken machine that will wake up

508
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.410
that help that individuals basically.
I hope all you got is hope,
right?

509
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.990
<v 2>Yeah.
And you're your three to five years away from it being a cage.</v>

510
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.660
I mean,
their behavior with China,

511
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.760
which I outlined in the book is pretty horrific.
Um,
what China,

512
00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:58.761
what the road China is going down is terrifying and Google is right there with

513
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:03.720
them.
Um,
and that is evil.
That is evil.
They say don't be evil.

514
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.470
Well that is the definition of it.
Um,

515
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.320
and if they just slowly,
you know,

516
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.860
the guy who closes the door on the gas chamber was most likely a guy that was

517
00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:19.890
fixing trucks before the war and a normal guy,

518
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.800
you don't suddenly become evil.
You slowly move into it.

519
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.150
It,
especially if you're surrounded by a group of people that are all absolutely

520
00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:35.151
convinced that they are right and the other voice is wrong and therefore we just

521
00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:40.461
have to filter them out with AI and the way they are gobbling,

522
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.050
um,

523
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.790
it's really disturbing and the problem is going to happen.

524
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.280
You know,
we're going to start hitting,
um,
massive job loss,
probably 20,

525
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:55.290
20,
20,
21,
22.

526
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.390
That's when you're going to really start to feel the effects of,
of Ai.
Um,

527
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.980
when that happens,
if you look at history and we know it,

528
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.160
all the politicians now are saying,
I'm going to get those jobs back from China.

529
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.620
You're not because they're leaving China because they're getting too expensive

530
00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:13.200
in China.
So you're not getting those jobs back.

531
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.260
And especially because a AI and robotics are are growing.

532
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:23.870
We'll have 30% unemployment by 2030 30% permanent unemployment.

533
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.940
So you look at this,
what to politicians always do?
They got to find a bad guy.

534
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.100
Well,
right now it's China,
but as soon as people realize that,
wait a minute,

535
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.920
it's silicon valley that's taking my jobs.

536
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.650
The politician then says it's those people,

537
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.990
those people that are building the robots.

538
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.340
Unless those people also see over the horizon and become buddy buddy with their

539
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:57.110
friends in Washington and they work together,

540
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.220
then you have a a surveillance state that I don't think we ever get out of.
