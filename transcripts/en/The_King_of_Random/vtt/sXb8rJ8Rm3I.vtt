00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.910
In this project we're using some ordinary
disposable diapers, to create an extraordinary

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.879
gardening gel, that's non-toxic, environmentally
friendly, and can cut your watering schedule

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.500
in half.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.640
For this project we'll need one of these disposable
diapers. New or gently used, it doesn't really

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.989
matter. Now most people know that a diaper
can hold quite a bit of liquid, but you might

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.819
be surprised to see how much. I just put over
4 cups of water in this thing, and you can

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.309
see that in just a few seconds, all the fluid
is completely absorbed, without a drop left

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.960
in the bowl. To see what's inside, let's go
ahead and rip it open, and dump the contents

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.179
into a bowl. You can see that if we add a
bit more water and mix it together, we've

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.620
got ourselves an amazing, fiber rich hydrogel.
I tried packing some of this stuff into an

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.660
airtight bag and freezing it overnight, to
make an improvised ice pack that won't leak.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.060
Now, you can use food coloring to change the
color of the gels, but when working with plants

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.880
it's best to leave it clear. This way, your
plants won't turn funny colors as they grow.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.740
One adult sized diaper makes over 12 cups
of hydrogel, and the small pieces of cotton

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.700
wadding break apart and mix right in. Now
we're gonna need some all purpose potting

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.010
soil that you can get at any home improvement
store, and a large mixing bowl to dump it

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.900
in. Add equal parts of dirt and gel, then
begin working the two together until they're

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.520
thoroughly mixed. Now you've not got a super
absorbent, super soil that's light and fluffy,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.490
and perfect for your potted plants. Go ahead
and throw a little soil into the pot first,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.160
then help your plant get comfortable. To hold
it firm in place, just keep packing more soil

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.080
until everything sits tight. You can finish
up by giving the plant a bit more water, and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.740
now with the super crystals in your soil,
your plant can go twice as long between waterings,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.340
saving you time, and resources. If you're
looking for a lazy way to get your seeds started,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.440
just dump them into a batch of the grow dough,
and give it all a good mix, or you could even

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.690
just sprinkle the seeds on top. Fill a container
of your choice, add a bit of water, and find

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.380
a place that you can set it and forget it.
Over the course of a week, your seeds will

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.840
automatically sprout and begin to grow, without
any extra effort, or any extra water.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.000
In the event of an extreme overwatering like this,
you might expect that your plants would drown,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.730
or begin to rot. But with the hydrogels infused
in the soil, you can see how the excess water

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.310
is quickly absorbed, keeping the soil damp
and fluffy, and possibly saving your plants

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.870
as a result. Now the reason this mixture will
hold so much liquid is because of these super-absorbent

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.450
water crystals. They'll hold over 500 times
their weight in water, and if you want to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.500
separate them out like this, try ripping apart
the wadding in the diaper, and shaking it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.950
upside down over a piece of paper. The cotton
fluff should blow away, and you'll be left

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.800
with just the crystals. This diaper gel can
work on your existing plants as well. As the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.740
gel expands and contracts, it will naturally
aerate the soil as it does. Just grab a knife

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.360
and a spoon, and gently nestle them down between,the roots, and spread them apart to form a

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.520
gap. Now you can drop some gel down to the
roots, work the soil back together, and continue

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.760
around the pot until all your water-gel is
used up. For one final idea, you can help

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.489
preserve your fresh cut flowers, by adding
sugar, vinegar, and a bit of bleach to some

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.470
warm water. This will create a homemade flower
food, and when you add your slush powder,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.140
you'll see it absorbs the solution and slowly
grows up to 60 times its size. By agitating

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.920
the gel you can create an awesome effect that
looks like crushed ice. Not only does it look

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.560
cool, but it's slowly releasing water as the
flowers need it, and feeding them at the same

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.340
time. The gel is completely non-toxic. It's
biodegradable, and environmentally friendly,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.970
so it's a great option for working into your
garden. Not only will this save you on watering

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.020
costs, but it will also last quite a few seasons
before it needs to be replaced. Well now you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.780
know how to take an ordinary diaper, and convert
it into a super absorbant potting soil, that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.110
will help keep your plants happy, and hopefully
keep you happy as well. If you liked this

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.530
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
