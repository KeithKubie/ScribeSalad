In the last lesson, we looked at solving problems and writing expressions. This

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:07.587
time, we're going to look at solving inequalities. We can use inequalities to

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.497
compare values. We can figure out what amount is less than or greater than some

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.332
other amount. Before we start solving inequalities, let's look at an equation

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:20.375
and think aobut how many solutions there are. For this equation, figure out how

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:26.240
many solutions there are, and think about how do you know. Choose one of these

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:26.860
answers.
