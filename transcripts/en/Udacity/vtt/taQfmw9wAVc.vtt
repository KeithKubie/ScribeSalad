00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.100
Yeah, so my process for
sort of putting myself,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.680
the methodology I like to think of
here is this sort of outside in view.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.270
This is, you look at what your

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.450
product looks like to people
outside of your organization.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.578
Most companies think about it
from inside out perspective.

00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:19.446
That is,
oh we have these legal requirements, oh,

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.690
the tech team can only build this.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.470
The design teams, and you add up
all of these different ideas and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.020
thought processes, which make a lot of
sense within the bounds of your company,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.130
but don't make a lot of sense when
somebody's looking at it externally.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.340
This is why you find simple forms, like
a Contact Us form, including 20 fields,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.600
because this one came from legal,
that one comes from marketing.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.578
You have five things like this because
the database is structured this way.

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:46.911
And one very common technique,
not common but

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:52.553
very useful technique that you can have
to force yourself to think outside in,

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:57.890
is to actually have somebody role
play the role the role of a form.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.670
And what do I mean by that?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.690
If you give someone a form,
and you act like a human, and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.070
they only are able to respond
with what the form says.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.560
So as an example you can say,
hi, I'm Luke.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.320
I'm trying to decide whether or
not I want to get a loan with you.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.730
First name.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.030
Okay, Luke.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.530
Last name.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.770
Wroblewski.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.720
Gender.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.890
Male, right, you can really start to
see how it doesn't make any sense as

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.050
a conversation.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.960
If instead you were to make
that a real world conversation,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.690
you'd say something like, hi,
I'm looking to maybe get a loan.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.180
Oh, well what are you trying to buy?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.870
Oh, well I'm trying to buy a home.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.489
Is this your first home?

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.680
And, very naturally,
you can weave that process through.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.400
And to go back to the original answer,
this name-value pair in the database,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.240
it is not a human interaction.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.040
It is a process of telling a machine
the requires fields it needs to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.650
process a document, which generally
is not how we think about the world.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.430
So that role playing can go a really
long way to helping people see

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.620
almost the silliness, if you will, for a
lot of the interactions we have online.
