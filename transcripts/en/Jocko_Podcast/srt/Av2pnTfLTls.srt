1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,080
Jocko hindsight is 2020.
But here's a crazy thought.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,470
North Korean soldiers would have ended
up with a better life like South Korea if

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:15,961
they did not fight as they did in the
50s when should a soldier question his

4
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:20,140
leaders values?
That is not a crazy question at all.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,660
And the answer is very straightforward.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,070
A soldier should always question their
leaders, not just their leaders values,

7
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:30,220
but their leaders plans, their leaders
strategies, their leaders vision.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,470
You should question everything
that your leader is telling you.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,870
And if you see something is wrong,

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,090
then you should raise
your hand and call it out.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,410
And I would say not only is it
something that you should do,

12
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,880
it's actually your duty.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,530
It's actually your duty is to
raise your hand as a soldier.

14
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,830
And I'll tell you this doesn't
only apply to the military,

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,510
it applies to any organization.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,370
And it might sound like I'm encouraging,
um,

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,410
mutiny or rebellion.
But actually the opposite is true.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,370
If you have a team that
questions the leader,

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,230
the leader doesn't become weaker,

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,440
the leader becomes stronger if he's a
good leader, if he's on the right path,

21
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:12,251
if he's doing the right thing,

22
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:15,850
he becomes stronger because everyone
starts to understand why things are

23
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:18,190
happening.
They understand the vision more fully.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,390
If the leader doesn't have a good vision
and he's getting questioned and he

25
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:25,030
can't answer the questions, yeah,
you might have a mutiny on his hands,

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,520
but it's not because the people are
asking questions because he doesn't know

27
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,354
what he's doing.

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,590
So the leader can't see everything and
he can't solve every problem or have

29
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,040
every idea. But the collective mind of
an organization can make that happen.

30
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,040
And that's why as a leader,
if I'm in a leadership position,

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,280
I want my subordinates to question me.
I want them to question me.

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,860
And like I said,
if I don't have a good answer,

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,350
I either need to find one
and if I can't find one,

34
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:57,340
then maybe I'm actually doing something
wrong. That's entirely possible.

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,060
And now from a,

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,780
if we want to talk about like a moral or
an ethical perspective than absolutely.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,670
Okay.

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,670
There was a group of high ranking soldiers
in Nazi Germany that tried to kill

39
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:15,920
Hitler and unfortunately they failed,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,410
but they did the right thing
and try in trying to kill them.

41
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,510
They did the right thing,
like not only did they questioned him,

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,940
they knew he was wrong and they
said, okay, we're going to kill him.

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,110
Now do you put yourself at risk
when you ask these questions?

45
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,650
Because I'm sitting here saying, yeah,
I want my subordinates to ask questions.

46
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,410
There's people that don't want
their subordinates to ask questions.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,060
Not good leader, not good leadership.
That's not a good way to lead.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,980
I'm sorry, I'm telling
you the truth. I mean,

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,680
and so it's so there's a risk as if
you're a leader doesn't want you to ask

50
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,960
questions and you raise your hands
and ask a question and you do it in an

51
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,050
untactful way and you do it in
a way that offends your leader.

52
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,670
Well then you might end up getting fired.
Or if you try and kill Hitler,

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,880
you might get killed yourself because
that's what Hitler did well after his

54
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,714
assassination isn't happy.

55
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,090
You wouldn't killed a bunch of people
including romble his best general.

56
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,110
Okay.

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,160
Cause he thought he was involved in it.
So you are definitely taking a risk,

58
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,440
but then you have to ask
yourself what is the alternative?

59
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,980
So in a moral or ethical situation,
what's the alternative?

60
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,480
And I'm not saying there's no alternative
cause sometimes maybe you'd be better

61
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:21,620
not trying to kill Hitler,

62
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:26,270
but rise in the ranks and
get to a situation where you
can have more control and

63
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,610
mitigate the damage that he's
doing to the country. Right.

64
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:33,470
That's a possible consideration to take.
Maybe you say, okay, you know what Hitler,

65
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,290
I'm going to be your guy and I'm going
to, you know, I'm going to do things.

66
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,400
So that way you can rise up in the ranks
and be in a position where you can stop

67
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,570
his bad decisions.

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,933
Okay.

69
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,500
As opposed to if you try and kill him
and you fail you, you, you want me to,

70
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,540
obviously once you're dead, you don't
have any influence. Over the organization.

71
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,600
Same thing if you're in a business where
there's something going on and you want

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,380
to raise your hand,
and yet if you raise your hand,

73
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:59,490
you know that there's a risk that you
might either a get fired or you might get

74
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:02,730
demoted or you might get put out of
your leadership position and now you're

75
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,700
letting down, not when, now you can have
an influence over the scenario anymore.

76
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,710
So that's,
that's something to consider as well.

77
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,090
Takes a significant level of moral
courage to stand up in those situations.

78
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:22,230
And
you have to be tactful.

79
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,040
I think that's important to say. You
have to be tactful. You have to have,

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,430
you don't walk in and just start
questioning your leadership immediately.

81
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,590
You have to build the
relationship force first.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,070
You have to grow your
trust between each other.

83
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,410
And then once you have that,

84
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,650
you can then tactfully bring
up questions and try and get

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,290
yeah

86
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,740
to the bottom of why things are
happening and why things are being done a

87
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,880
certain way or another way.
Hmm. Question your leadership.

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,060
And if you're a leader, don't get offended
when you get questioned to be happy.

89
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,950
Be Happy.
Even when your kids do it.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,340
Even when your kids do it, especially
when your kids do it. Yeah.

91
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,120
Cause you always want to take that easy
out. Just do what I told you to do. Yeah.

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,900
Yeah. Do it. I'm a dad. Yeah. It's, it's
different than, it's not what I said.

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,550
Cause you caught yourself. I like that.
Well Dang self policing over there.

94
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,310
Outstanding.
Uh,

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,200
what about when they always add the kids?
Wouldn't they always say why?

96
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,070
And then he was thinking, you gotta be
careful of, I'm speaking from experience.

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,820
You know how you know though? This is old
school. Like, Oh why? Oh because of this.

98
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,320
Why, why, why?

99
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:36,330
And then it gets fun to them just to say
why they don't even want to know why it

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,160
now. It just becomes the game. Then
what? Just shut it right down one though.

101
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,490
That's when you should keep, oh
it's me against, you know. Oh No,

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,530
just go Jujitsu on them. Hmm. You, they
ask why you asked them a question back.

103
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,150
Why do you think it goes that
way? And then they'll say,
well, I don't know. Well,

104
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,260
why?
Why don't you know,

105
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,490
just one sweep sweep,

106
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,190
I'm going to do good one.
Yeah, that's really good.

107
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,280
Actually speaking from experience,
I got four kids.
