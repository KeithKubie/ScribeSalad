00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.820
Vsauce!

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.820
Kevin here.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.630
The folks behind the new show Timeless asked
me to talk about time travel, and coincidentally

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.639
I’ve just finished building my time machine.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:24.500
It’s a little rough around the edges but
if I can get it to work I can conquer time.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.210
Why would I want to do that?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.789
Well, exploring different periods in human
history allows us to experience firsthand

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.329
the aspects of humanity that have changed
and the ones that haven't.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.539
But until I get this thing working - time
machines are a great device for storytelling

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.129
because time travel is something you already
do in your mind.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.780
OoooOOoooh.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.079
No really.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.969
Chronesthesia is the ability to remember the
past and to imagine the future as a guide

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.389
for making decisions in the present.

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:03.539
Hypothesized by experimental psychologist
Dr. Endel Tulving as the only memory system

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.439
with a special relationship to time, this
Mental Time Travel process consists of two

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.439
parts.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.780
The first is like watching a movie in your
head.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.689
It includes the setting of the event, the
actors involved, and what happened.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.399
The second is the subjective time it all takes
place whether it’s past, present or future.

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.350
Being able to travel through time mentally
allows us to learn from past events and project

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.780
how to react in the future.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.450
This is especially helpful in social situations
- altering behavior based on how things went

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.119
in the past, making friends and making enemies.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.619
Human survival has depended on mental time
travel by planting seeds for future harvests

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.679
as well as formally educating the young to
lead communities tomorrow.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.690
Or as Tulving puts it, “The kind of culture
that Homo sapiens have created over the past

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.509
40,000 years or so can be produced only by
individuals whose intelligence includes conscious

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.319
awareness of the future in which they and
their progeny will continue to live and survive."

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.670
The third little pig that built his house
out of brick was really good at this.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.620
But mental time is subjective - you can’t
exactly tell someone to meet you somewhere

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.400
at the time you’re thinking of in your head.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.220
External time-keeping requires some form of
measurement.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.780
Like a girl disguised as a lamp by a magic
reindeer hiding from the moon.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.670
For most of human existence, the moon was
a critical time-keeper.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.720
Folklore of the Chukchi of North-East Siberia
told that after successfully eluding its pursuit,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.170
the girl captured the moon and made it promise
to stay in the sky and mark time with its

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.420
cycles.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.739
The phases of the moon helped guide seasons
and months while the position of the sun helped

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.580
chart the day.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.099
Sundials processed the sun’s movement by
making a clock out of shadows.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.079
Which works well unless it’s cloudy or unless
it’s nighttime - which is why we started

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.860
stealing water.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.290
Clepsydra comes from the ancient greek kleptein
meaning steal and hydor meaning water.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.209
Water clocks kept time by measuring the flow
of liquid between vessels.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.830
In Ancient Persia, a bowl with a hole in it
was slowly filled after being placed in water;

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.519
in Ancient Egypt, a stone vessel consistently
dripped into a container with markings that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.370
approximated the hours.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.959
The phrase “don’t muddy the waters”
may originate from getting dirt in water clocks

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.100
and messing up their timing.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.099
But for thousands of years, most people didn’t
know what time it was the way we do today

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.829
and they didn’t need to.

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.390
Basic circadian rhythm was enough - no one
needed to know when it was exactly 7:17pm.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.469
Early clocks served specific purposes.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.269
Water clocks informed priests when to perform
daily rituals in Egypt, they were used as

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.409
timers during legal trials in Athens, and
they managed a farmer’s water usage for

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.349
irrigation in Persia.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.109
The impetus to develop mechanical clocks came
during the Middle Ages and was largely astronomical

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.170
- measuring the movements of the stars.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.170
Not everyone was cuckoo for clocks.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.980
Resistance to breaking down life into tiny,
structured bits was documented by Roman playwright

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.200
Plautus in 195 BC.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.450
The gods confound the man who first found
out

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.980
How to distinguish hours!

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.410
Confound them too,
Who in this place set up a sundial,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.740
To cut and hack my days so wretchedly
Into small portions!

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.820
Plautus would’ve hated alarm clocks.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.260
Sundials and water clocks simply split day
and night into 12 parts.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.340
Fixed-length hours and minutes were conceived
for celestial calculations by Greek Astronomers,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.810
but mechanical clocks featuring them weren’t
around until the end of the 16th century.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.470
And public, synchronized clock time wasn’t
part of daily life until the 19th century.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.020
An era when the magic of myths met the machinations
of science.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.180
The Industrial Revolution brought with it
a new world of science, technology, specialized

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.470
labor, discovery, and machines.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.990
Suddenly the curiosity of common people was
pointed at the possibilities provided by science.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.630
And they wanted to read stories that allowed
them to travel to an imagined future of scientific

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.470
wonder.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.080
Describing the impact of science on imagination,
George Cary Eggleston wrote in 1874, “The

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.620
appetite for the marvellous is a universal
one, and from the earliest dawn of literature

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.780
until now there have always been wonder stories
eagerly read of all men.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.930
Ours is a scientific age, however, an age
of easy unbelief, a question, doubting, faithless

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.330
age, and we do not readily accept, even in
the half-hearted, constructive way in which

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.810
fiction must be believed to be enjoyed, any
thing not borne out by hard-visaged fact.”

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.150
A culture in futuristic warp-drive, seeing
land conquered by train, water conquered by

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.660
steamboat, even hot air balloons had an 1833
newspaper dreaming of, “time in perspective

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.590
when our atmosphere will be traversed with
as much facility as our water...”

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.400
These advancements made time measurement more
important.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.080
In 1817, Welsh social reformer Robert Owen
campaigned for an eight-hour work day with

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.610
the slogan, "Eight hours labour, Eight hours
recreation, Eight hours rest."

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.720
So if human life is suddenly carved up by
a clock, why not invent something that can

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.820
conquer time?

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.630
Before clocks and machines flooded civilization,
time travel tales like Memoirs Of The Twentieth

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.680
Century written by Samuel Madden in 1733 imagined
life in a different time, but lacked a scientific

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.170
vehicle to navigate it.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.991
Today, stories from The Time Machine to Timeless
continue to captivate and inspire but the

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:09.830
very first time machine was lost in time.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.870
Seven years before H.G. Wells' legendary book,
there was The Clock That Went Backwards.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.410
Written in 1881, it’s the first story that
uses a device, in this case a Grandfather

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.350
clock, to transport humans through time.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:32.240
The concept of time machines required a convergence
of science, imagination and the sun.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.570
A newspaper called The Sun...not the fireball
star.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.630
Edward Page Mitchell was Editor of The Sun,
a New York City newspaper with the largest

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.510
circulation in the world at the time.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.000
Endlessly creative, Mitchell wrote the first
stories involving scientific teleportation,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.340
Artificial Intelligence, faster-than-light
travel, freezing and reviving a lifeform,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:05.610
a peaceful alien, surgically altering personalities,
the invisible man and a time machine.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:12.870
The problem is the one thing his revolutionary
stories didn’t include was his name.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.810
All but one of his short stories were printed
anonymously at a time when there was no international

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.160
copyright law so stories were easily stolen
and reprinted.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.600
The only reason anyone knows of Mitchell today
is because science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.750
spent three years painstakingly poring over
microfilm and piecing together his stories

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:39.069
for 1973’s The Crystal Man: Stories by Edward
Page Mitchell.

00:08:39.069 --> 00:08:45.810
Moskowitz went back in time to save Mitchell
for the future, but it didn’t work.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:52.709
His book is out of print, hard to find, and
is also becoming forgotten.

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:56.589
Being forgotten is easy for a person not looking
for glory.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:09:02.610
In 1916, Mitchell received an offer to leave
The Sun for the prestigious New York Times

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:08.110
and declined, content with the publication
that allowed him freedom to publish his stories.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.170
When he retired from working in the city that
never sleeps, he moved to a secluded farm

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.610
in Rhode Island.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.500
His isolated property spanned 40 miles with
Mitchell describing it as, “an enclosure

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.360
of tree-tops, unbroken by human habitation.”

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.790
He not only cast aside modern life, he spurned
modern conveniences like electricity, gas

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.889
and central heating.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:36.199
All that was there - was time.

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:42.220
All he brought with him was his wife and his
collection of six thousand books.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.360
His love and his imagination.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.050
When Mitchell died following a heart attack
in January of 1927, a two-page obituary in

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:58.550
Literary Digest, the leading news magazine
of the day, described him as, “hardly known,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.420
even as a name, to the general public.”

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.290
Edward Page Mitchell was the invisible man.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:12.589
Yet the waves of influence that emanate from
his creations continue to travel through time

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:15.029
and inspire us today.

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:25.089
Proof alone we have the ability to change
the future even if no one knows who we are.

00:10:25.089 --> 00:11:39.759
And as always - thanks 

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:51.060
for watching.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:12:24.959
I want to thank Timeless on NBC for producing
this video with me.

00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:30.689

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:34.680
I need to go figure out what happened to my
time machine.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.250
So yeah.
