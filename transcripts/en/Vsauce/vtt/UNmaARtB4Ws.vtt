00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.060
Can you find the hidden giraffe?
And this cat doesn't need glasses.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.100
It's episode 48 of IMG!

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.960
Bobby Neel Adams takes a photo of a person

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.580
as a child and then has them replicate the
pose as an adult.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.060
He then rips the photos to fit.
The effect is haunting and cool.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.560
But this is just lonely.
Pareidolia is when you see something of significance,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.109
a face, a pattern, in something random.
But if you put the face there, you're like

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.370
gnomers.
Prefer dogs?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.370
Well, Buzzfeed showed off the scariest dog
pictures possible and to alleviate your fear,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.570
here is Maddie the Dog.
On things.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.900
Maddieonthings.com
Name brand arm tattoos are a smart idea and

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.690
so is eating healthy.
Wait, whaaat... is this guy so excited about?

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.249
Hmmm.
I also don't know what's going on here and

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.790
okay, I guess we'll have to remove all the
art inside.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.670
ThumbPress brought us a subway map of rock'n'roll,
which genres and intersections do bands exist

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.730
on.
They also showed us how not to be a good parent,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.000
though a leaf blower to the face is pretty
fun.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.800
Thousands of Braille products, many of which
you've never... seen before?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.840
These items cast the shadow of a city and
these glass paper aeroplanes cast a combined

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.100
shadow that resembles a city on the bay.
Oh, and these water bottles add definition

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.660
and shading to cast the shadow of a man's face.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.440
Photographer Hal takes photographs of couples
shrink-wrapped in plastic.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.480
He must act quickly or they'll suffocate.
Seriously, this is real.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.200
As are these celebrity names.
Jon Stewart's real name is John Leibowitz.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.590
Ralph Lauren's original name was Ralph Lipschitz.
But the craziest of them all?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.090
Michael J. Fox.
His actual, original name, and I'm not kidding,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.370
is Michael A. Fox.
But now, Chevrolet's speedometer designs from

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.070
1941 to 2011.
Now where is this guy on TV looking?

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.799
Mmmhm.
Well, what about him?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.400
Oh, come on!
TV people even photobomb kids kissing.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.020
See?
Bread shoes.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.140
Remember those scary dogs?
Well, dogs and cats can also be loving companions.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.060
Enjoy.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.840
Now here's a question.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.700
How big is a million dollars?
I mean, what would having a million dollars

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.870
look like?
According to this great study, it's only about

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.310
5 reams worth of paper.
Heavy, but enough to carry around yourself,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.659
if you used $100 bills.
This, however, is what 206 million dollars

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.839
in cash looks like.
About the size of a king mattress.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.700
Painting on brick is one thing, but letting
it drip like rain is another.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.889
Sam3's street art asks the question, "when
you look into the sky, what's looking back

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.239
at you?"
Now, if you're afraid of getting caught painting

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.799
on buildings, do it like this.
Jim Denevan goes even larger.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.480
By driving around on a dry lake bed, very
very exactly, he manages to carve mathematically

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.499
impressive circles into the Nevada landscape.
Large enough to be seen from space, but temporary

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.859
enough to be quickly washed away by rain and wind.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.600
MoIllusions had this this week.
A blue shape that seems to tick every time

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.660
the gap between the red and blue shapes disappears,
though the blue shape never moves.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.840
It's caused by ambiguous figure-ground segregation.
Eric Tabuchi went on a French-American road

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.640
trip, finding stores with American city names
without having to leave France.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.580
Or his own bedroom.
The entire book isn't photographs, it's Google

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.150
Street View screenshots he took on his computer.
With the Internet, why go anywhere?

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:20.529
Tabuchi also collected the alphabet from trucks.
Now, planking is too flat.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.840
We want twists and turns.
You know, like Takanori's bonsai trees houses.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.240
Finally, David Aday cuts pictures of people
into fun little shapes and then pins them

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.030
to walls to make the person complete again.
Except in a separated kind of way.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.470
Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for more.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.310
And as always,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.730
thanks for watching.
