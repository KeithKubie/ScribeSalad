00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
Humans don't have fur like many of our ancestors, but our bodies still have the ability to adapt to cold weather.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.160
However, when pushed these mechanisms can fail leading to an extreme breakdown.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.170
So, what actually happens to your body and brain when you freeze to death? Hypothermia occurs

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
when the core body temperature drops below 37 degrees Celsius,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.829
so in the event that the body is exposed to extreme cold, within minutes signals are sent from the skin to the hypothalamus

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.260
producing what is known as the Thermoeffector

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.020
Response. First, the blood vessels in our skin narrow,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.090
allowing the body to maintain its core temperature by reducing the blood flow on its surface, known as Vasoconstriction. Additionally, brown adipose tissue,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.009
located throughout the body, also activates using high levels of glucose and lipids to produce heat via a process called Nonshivering

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.860
Thermogenesis.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.099
But, if all else fails our body undergoes Shivering Thermogenesis as a last-ditch effort

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.180
By constantly contracting our skeletal muscles, our body induces shivering in an attempt to produce enough heat to prevent hypothermia.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.080
However, if you remain exposed to the cold, within 30 minutes

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.330
you could get frostbite, which is when your skin and other tissues literally begin to freeze.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.360
Developing ice crystals endanger your cells by damaging their cell membranes, causing Intracellular

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.689
Dehydration, due to water leaking out from them. The cells then begin to die and the ice crystals continue to expand,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.239
damaging neighboring cells. In response, the body tries to prevent frostbite in our skin through Vasodilation,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.629
which allows increased blood flow to warm the skin cells.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.360
However,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.869
this runs counter to the Thermoeffector Response, which again works to maintain our core temperature through

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.400
Vasoconstriction. As a result, our body goes through cycles of Vasodilation and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.039
Vasoconstriction, thawing and freezing our skin over and over again and causing even more damage.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.359
But, our skin isn't the only spot that will freeze under extreme cold temperatures. If you're in extreme cold, windy weather your

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.040
corneas can freeze too, the protective layer of tears covering the cornea can dry,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.489
making your eyes sensitive to light and causing eyelid spasms.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.119
Luckily, your corneas can thaw if you get yourself out of the cold quickly,

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.829
but if frozen long enough,

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.009
you can cause permanent damage. Now, several factors, including body composition,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.510
clothing, temperature, and the environment determine how quickly your core body temperature drops.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.710
For example, heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.859
Those who were submerged in the icy waters after the sinking of the Titanic may have lasted only 15 minutes,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.510
this is because during the advanced stage of hypothermia your organs begin to fail,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.749
your breathing rate slows, you lose coordination, your heart rate begins to slow down, and your body even stops shivering.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.669
One of the last symptoms of advanced stage hypothermia is delirium, a survey of cases in which death was caused by hypothermia found that in

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.210
25% of the cases,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.460
the victims had undressed before they died. In one case, victims had neatly folded their clothes beside them and froze to death in the snow.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.859
Why would this happen? One theory

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.290
is that the brain damage that results from the extreme cold

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.069
causes people to think that they're burning up, so they strip naked and cool down. Another theory suggests that the muscles that cause Cutaneous

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.980
Vasoconstriction in our blood vessels get exhausted and cause blood from our core to rush to the surface of our body,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.039
resulting in a hot flash. This is all pretty bleak,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.349
but if you find someone who appears to be frozen to death, you may want to warm them up. An aptly named paper,

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.740
No One is Dead Until Warm and Dead, chronicles a patient with hypothermia caused by drowning with no signs of life.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.000
This patient was successfully resuscitated with a 3-hour bypass surgery used to warm his body. Though parts of his body required

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.649
amputation, in 11 weeks he successfully recovered with normal neurological function.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.650
Just remember, when the temperature starts to drop,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.549
do everything you can to stay warm, because your body can only do so much to fight the extreme cold.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.709
