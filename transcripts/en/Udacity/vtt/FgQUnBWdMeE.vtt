00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.700
Alright, you're in trouble Sara. You've gotta, you gotta get the 64 over.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm working on it. I have to get the, the 16 up to 64 status so I can.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.610
&gt;&gt; oh.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, I might actually lose this.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.740
&gt;&gt; You're going to lose.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.880
&gt;&gt; Sara, this looks bad. This is looking pretty bad.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.490
&gt;&gt; Wait, before you lose on camera, let's do our introduction.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.990
&gt;&gt; No, look.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.120
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'm going to say hi.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.820
&gt;&gt; Well, slightly better.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.600
&gt;&gt; All right, fine. Hi, I'm Andy.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.880
&gt;&gt; And I'm Sarah.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.540
&gt;&gt; And I'm addicted

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.400
to 2048. No, I'm actually an Udacity instructor

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.769
&gt;&gt; Who's also addicted to 2048 [LAUGH].

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.060
&gt;&gt; Who's also addicted to 2048.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I am Sarah. I am

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.120
a software engineer and, of course, a developer here.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.910
&gt;&gt; And as I have mentioned, a lot of people at our office

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.690
are really addicted to this game and we decided it would be a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.460
good way to start experimenting with

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.100
short courses, making really small course that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.780
hopefully, a lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this course isn't going to teach

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.320
you how to play the game. It's not

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.520
even going to teach you how to program the game.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.270
Instead, we're, we're going to talk about how to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.230
modify the existing code to make it your own.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.390
&gt;&gt; Right. And I actually went through this experience on my own about a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.250
week ago. I'm a pretty novice programmer.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.870
I've learned what I know through Udacity classes

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.340
actually on the job and going through this code base and looking at how

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.590
the HTML and the CSS and the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.230
JavaScript interacted. That was a really valuable experience.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.330
So I'm actually really excited to share this with

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.170
you guys and make our own versions of 2048.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the thing that makes

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.330
this project especially useful as a teaching aid

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.910
here is that it's an open source project,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.900
meaning that anybody can look at all the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.910
code. They can take it and modify it. They could push their changes back to the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.700
original but most people are just sort of

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.170
making their own like fun thing. In fact,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.570
there are a couple of them that have made it pretty big.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.160
&gt;&gt; Should we take a look?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's look at a couple of those.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.380
&gt;&gt; All right.
