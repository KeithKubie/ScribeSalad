00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
[Captions by Y Translator]
How much electric
charge can you get

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.940
from a Van de Graaff generator?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.440
And if you let
that charge build-up,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.480
what's it going to do
when it starts shocking stuff?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.940
[Music]

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.540
This is a Van
de Graaff generator.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.380
Now this is not one
that we built,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.392
although that may be
a future project.

00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:24.622
So this is one that we
just bought online,

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:27.681
and we're going to have some fun
experimenting with it today.

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.342
For those of you who don't know,

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:31.140
a Van de Graaff
generator is something

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.780
that lets you use
static electricity to build

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.600
up some surprisingly
large electric charges.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.202
The construction
is pretty basic.

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:39.150
Let's go over that.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.102
First of all,
we have this over here.

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:42.281
This is just a wheel.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:44.954
When we turn this wheel
with its handle over here,

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:46.419
it twists this smaller wheel,

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:47.649
and this smaller wheel is

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.900
what's actually doing
the important stuff.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.890
As you can see,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.291
this smaller wheel is
on a gear attached

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.001
to this white rod in here.

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.750
So when I turn that wheel,
that white rod starts spinning.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.105
Attached onto that rod
is this thick rubber band.

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.080
As it twists,
that rubber band goes up.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.700
It's going past this right here.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.816
This is an electrode
in the shape of sort of a comb.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:10.453
You can see

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.450
that it's got all
of these little teeth

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.600
that are metal,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.350
and it's just being held
on this plastic sheet,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.650
and that's just hold it
where it's supposed to go.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.850
Up here at the top

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.450
our rubber band goes
around a clear rod,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.452
and there is a second comb.

00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:26.450
This comb is attached
to this top piece,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.380
which is a metal plate,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.820
which has this connecting
point up at the top.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.520
That as you can see fits nicely
into this dome shaped bell.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.540
Turning this wheel,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.157
and spinning all
of the moving pieces

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.920
in here starts generating
static electricity.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.360
With our two combs,
one of the top,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.050
one on the bottom
that's attached to this bell,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.973
all of the electricity
gets built up

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.000
in this metal partial sphere.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260
It's not a perfect sphere,
but it's generally ball-shaped.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.420
These things are really cool

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.660
because although they
have pretty low current,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.400
they can have
extremely high voltage.

00:01:58.404 --> 00:02:00.992
These desktop models
can probably generate at

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.620
least a hundred thousand volts.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.792
So with all of that,
the principal is pretty simple.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.512
You turn this wheel down here,

00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:09.676
and it generates
static electricity up top,

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:12.841
which you can then sometimes
direct towards other things.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.900
Or you can just
touch it, like this.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.500
[Music]

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.640
Or you can just put your hands
near it like this.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.832
This is an interesting
phenomenon to try

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:28.008
and catch on camera,

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:29.750
because it can
easily be so quick

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.650
that it happens in between
the frames of our camera.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.950
While filming this,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.750
it's maybe one in 10
of the sparks is actually

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.000
getting caught on camera,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420
which means I just had
to shock my hand quite a bit,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.250
but that's what happens

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.980
when you're playing is
Van de Graaff generator.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.280
So you're going to get zapped.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.519
I can also try

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.501
and make this sparks jump
from our large ball

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.480
to this smaller ball over here.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.140
I think probably most people

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.551
have tried rubbing
a balloon in their hair

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:55.564
until it builds up

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:59.016
a static charge to see and stick
to the walls and stuff.

00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:01.227
Well, we have a sort
of amplified version

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:01.992
of that here.

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:03.340
Just gonna take our balloon.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.280
We're going to start cranking,
see what happens.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.200
[Music]

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.940
That was like one rotation.

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:14.620
How far away I can get
and still had it get pulled in?

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:24.320
[Music]

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.360
So the balloon sticks,
and then once I discharge it,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.200
the balloon just
drops right down.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.540
One of the best ways
to really show off

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.450
the effect is to let it run
through your hair a little bit,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.150
and I don't have a ton of hair,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.040
but this should still
be fun to watch.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.800
[Music]

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.920
It also likes to jump the bridge

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.980
through the air into your hair
really easily so...

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.800
It's quite a big jolt
onto my scalp.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.140
[Music]

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.880
So you can see

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.050
how it's transferring
the sparks over to my hand.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.540
It zaps it pretty well.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.800
At least sometimes
you can see it.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.050
But there's another way
you can do this as well,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.722
and that's instead of causing
sparks to jump little by little,

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:10.452
you can build the charge up,

00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:13.717
not just in the bell,
not just in this metal bell,

00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.238
but actually in myself.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.560
So if I have my hand
on the bell directly,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.960
and I'm insulated
from the ground,

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.440
which I'm doing right now

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.188
by wearing my high
quality Proto putty shoes.

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:26.100
It seems a very good insulators.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.069
I am insulated.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.386
However, the frame
of this bench is not.

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:31.520
So if I put my hand on here,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.680
and turn the wheel a little bit,

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:35.553
I'll start building up a charge
that will then discharged

00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:37.652
as soon as I touch
the edge of that bench.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.652
It can be a big discharge.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.660
Oh!

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.180
Man, like you do
these ones right here,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.740
and you only feel it about
as far as your knuckle.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.542
But when I do it like this,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.550
my body can hold so
much more charge.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.250
I feel it all the way
through my arm,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.992
and my whole body
jumps involuntarily.

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:01.442
Now, something else I
think is pretty interesting,

00:05:01.442 --> 00:05:03.450
and I discovered this
while playing around

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.750
with the Van de Graaff
generator earlier today.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.674
If I take this powerful magnet,

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.350
and I put it near the bell,
I'm now off the ground again.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.500
I'm in both of my rubber shoes.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.780
If I turn the wheel
with the magnet near the bell,

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:16.750
there's no sparking.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.651
There's no shocking,

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.950
and it doesn't seem
like it's doing anything at all.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.982
But if I touch
the metal railing...

00:05:23.442 --> 00:05:24.784
It gives me a jolt.

00:05:24.784 --> 00:05:27.213
So it's charging
me up the same way

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:28.669
as if I have my hand

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.900
on the bell by putting
the magnet near the bell.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.676
So I have not yet had
time to do research

00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:36.587
into exactly what is happening.

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:37.474
But it appears

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:38.834
that the electric field

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:41.960
generated by our Van de
Graaff generator is somehow

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.150
using the magnetic field
to transfer the electricity

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.850
into me without
having any sparks.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.160
That's pretty cool.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.740
I had my camera man
turning the crank,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.460
and I was building
up so much charge

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.980
that it was actually
shocking me through my feet,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.380
through the Proto putty shoes
into the floor.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.078
And so now, I'm standing
on a wooden board to see

00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:03.000
if that offers
even more insulation.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.400
All right, charge me up.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.420
[Music]

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.240
I can feel it.

00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:12.989
All my arm hairs
are just getting tingly.

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:16.320
[Music]

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.520
Now, I'm going to
attack my cameraman.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.420
Oh, very quickly
building up charge.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.720
I feel like Thor,
and I want to hammer.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.740
So that works too.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.900
All right here goes.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.780
This is scary.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.080
Holy cow.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.540
What?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.500
Oh my gosh.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.700
Oh, that was crazy.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.300
Okay.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.340
We're getting some crazy
big shocks by having

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.150
my cameraman turn this
while I'm really well insulated.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.823
So we have this little
gallium metal cast Lego figure,

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:56.250
and I want to see
if we can shock that.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.480
Okay, so this is
kind of weird like,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.000
if I go over here
on the shelf,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.361
I get a giant zap.

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:05.899
But if I go
to the gallium figure,

00:07:06.262 --> 00:07:09.193
it just makes
a hissing, fizzing sound.

00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:14.292
Sounds a lot like Tesla coil.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.419
So that just zapped me,

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.275
but it's a pretty
small zap compared

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.180
to the charge up for a bit.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.240
[Music]

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.050
We were trying to grab
some footage of shocking

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.680
a small gallium cast Lego man,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.440
because we thought it would be
fun to make me look like Thor.

00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:33.337
But we discovered

00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:35.511
that something about
the gallium is causing

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.340
some weird things to happen.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.040
Rather than getting shocked
with a long arc of electricity,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.389
it actually started

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.700
emitting plasma out
of the Lego man's head.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.980
I could smell the ozone,
and if I got close enough,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.760
I could see
the tiny purple sparks.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:51.650
It was really hard to capture
on a regular camera,

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.829
but we did use a modified GoPro
with a zoom lens added

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:57.420
that didn't have
an infrared filter,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.560
and we were able to see
it a little bit more.

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:02.444
Strangely, through the
little gallium man,

00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:04.480
while it was arcing plasma like that,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.040
the actual electrical
discharge was very small.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.180
Touching the metal rim
of the workbench gave

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.329
me a huge jolt and caused
a spark several inches long

00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:15.080
that was very visible.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.380
If I touch the gallium Lego man,

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:18.078
rather than the
really big jolt,

00:08:18.078 --> 00:08:19.650
it was just a pretty small one.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.512
Similar to when I

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.000
was putting my knuckles close
to the bell at the beginning.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.700
One of the most popular
projects we have ever had

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.360
on our channel is showing
how to build a laser blowgun,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.940
and we have turned that
into a kit that you can order,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.834
and if you act quickly,

00:08:30.834 --> 00:08:32.450
you can still get it
in time for Christmas.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.550
That kit comes with everything
you could possibly need.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.820
We have got a glue gun,
PVC pipes, decals, a laser,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.100
everything that you need for
your own backyard adventures.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.135
So my initial
reaction the second

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.600
that we open those kits was just
how much we provided for you.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.840
It's nearly everything
that you need,

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:50.148
and it's amazing quality.

00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:50.948
It's really fun.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:52.290
We didn't help plan this out.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.885
So when we opened,
it really was just

00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.000
like us getting the kit
for the first time.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.679
I was especially impressed

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.180
that it comes like with a glue
gun and glue sticks and stuff.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.440
I was not expecting that.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.979
Everything you need,
it takes probably what,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.820
15 to 30 minutes depending

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.140
how quickly were working to get
your blow gun up and ready,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.200
and then maybe a little bit
longer if you're trying

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.520
to fine-tune the laser,

00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:12.850
which it even comes
with everything for that.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.340
Like to zero in that laser
so it's perfectly accurate.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.840
It worked crazy well.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.740
I also really like the fact that

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.458
although it comes
with the supplies

00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:22.133
and equipment to make
the nail darts,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.480
the paper cone at the back.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.388
It's like the perfect size

00:09:24.388 --> 00:09:26.350
that you can use
in miniature marshmallows,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.450
and so you can have

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.780
like a laser assisted
marshmallow blow gun fight.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.480
Or blowgun marshmallow wars
in your kitchen or studio.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.060
There might still be
marshmallows all over the place.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:43.612
Possible.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.272
Just maybe.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.080
We've got a couple
hundred in stock,

00:09:46.088 --> 00:09:47.750
but we do expect
them to go fast.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.600
So if you want for yourself,
or a friend or family member,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.017
now is the time to get it.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:53.704
If you guys decide to go all out

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:55.523
and bedazzle one
of these things,

00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.370
or just make it look really
really cool, we want to see.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.250
Send us pictures.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.782
There's lots of ways
you can decorate.

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:02.299
You can use paint,
you can use tape.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.950
I guess you
could use a bedazzler,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.040
if you really want gems and--

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.441
What is the bedazzler?

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:09.860
It puts like rhinestones on it.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.220
I don't know
if it works on PVC,

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.900
but someone should figure out
how to make that work.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.715
Anyway, lots of ways to make
this blowgun your own,

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:18.442
modifying what we
have in the kit.

00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:19.244
Very cool stuff.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.858
The link for one of these kits
is in the description.

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:22.482
Have fun.

00:10:22.482 --> 00:10:22.998
Be safe.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.352
Build something cool.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.360
Guys, that's it for today,
but the fun doesn't end.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.336
We've always got more
for you see.

00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:29.282
That box up at the top
will take you to our last video.

00:10:29.282 --> 00:10:30.290
You should go check that out.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.304
The other box will show you

00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:32.975
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.360
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe to our channel.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.880
That way you never miss
out on our video.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.695
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:38.820
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.700
Talk to you then.
