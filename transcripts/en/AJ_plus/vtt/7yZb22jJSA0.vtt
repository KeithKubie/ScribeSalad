00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up in, like,
suburban Rancho Cucamonga.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.410
It was a lot of being bored

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.300
and figuring out what to do with myself.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.520
I learned to juggle
knives, I was in a band,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.530
I did puppetry, I played baseball.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.720
My favorite movies were
'The Shawshank Redemption'

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.983
and 'About a Boy' and 'Forrest Gump'.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.870
For a lot of executives,
in the first 30 seconds,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.510
they think I'm gonna talk with an accent

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.440
or they think I'm not gonna
know about normal things

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.290
like, there's this little
sparkle of amusement.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.130
"Different than what I thought

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.988
a regular Muslim person would be like".

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.110
When I got into UCLA Film School,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.830
I was so incredibly excited,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.310
but I didn't have any connections.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.430
I was just like, well, I'm gonna
try it and see how it goes.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.740
People are always
telling these sob stories

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.780
about immigrants, things
like 'The Namesake',

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290
but the stories I grew up
hearing were hilarious.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.500
So, I was like, I wanted
to do something with that.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.700
[Movie Clip]: "Listen to me, Sami."

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.280
"To be a great tiger hunter,"

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.277
"you must become the tiger."

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.570
'The Tiger Hunter' is
my first feature film

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.940
about a young man who comes from India

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.990
on this big quest for success in America,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.360
and it was all kind of based on truth.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.170
I interviewed my dad,
I interviewed my mom,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140
I interviewed the aunties
and uncles in the community.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.973
It's called 'The Tiger Hunter'

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:08.520
because my grandfather was a tiger hunter.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070
He has the exact same mustache.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.450
It was all kind of based on truth.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.160
My dad, when he came into this country,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.540
all of his roommates
only had one epic suit.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.150
They'd be like, sitting in
their underwear at home,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.460
scheduling their interviews around

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.596
the availability of the suit.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.150
[Movie Clip]: "Ketchup!"
"Well, I was hungry."

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.400
I tried so many strategies
to raise money for my movie.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.700
It was like pulling teeth.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.730
First, I tried South Asian doctors.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.190
And then, film school people were like,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.940
"Okay, try dentists, because
dentists have doctor"

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.070
"in their title and they
wanna have that respect"

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.220
"like doctors have, but they don't".

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.600
I sent thousands of those e-mails.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.433
They're cold e-mails.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.440
They'd be like, "Hey,
I'm doing this movie."

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.400
"I don't know if you'll get
your money back or not,"

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550
"but you and I could enter
the industry together."

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.493
"How about that?"

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.970
And then, when my executive
producer called and said,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.400
"Alright, I'm in for X amount of money",

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.340
I think I was just jumping
up around my house.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.120
I ran into my parents' room and of course,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.240
their response was like,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.800
"Don't count it until it's in the bank".

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.633
I thought it was gonna be a little movie

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:00.550
and it suddenly became a very big movie.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.930
My sister-in-law, she's like, "Oh my god,"

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.450
"you have Danny Pudi
and all these people",

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.700
and then Kevin Pollak was on board,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.875
then Napoleon Dynamite, Jon Heder.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.370
I was like, "Okay, now I'm
getting a little nervous".

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.830
We had this huge crew,
everyone's running around

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110
with their walkie-talkies,
and you look out

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.546
and you're like, "This is my set".

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:14.820
Like, "I'm making a feature film",

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.810
and there is no feeling like that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.900
that I think I've had, ever.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.290
The cool thing that ended up happening

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.060
is that our crew became
very, very diverse.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.840
We had black people, we had
Asian people, we had women,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.570
we had a Sikh guy, we had Hindu guys,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.300
we had Pahari people.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.100
We came in out in 50-some
theaters across the country.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.490
Awesome reviews in things
like The New York Times.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.940
We would be playing in
the middle of Virginia

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.730
and it was just such an amazing thing

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.780
to see them laughing along
at the exact same parts

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.903
that, like, some Indian uncle
would be laughing along with.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.030
I wanna do something good in the world

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.080
and that's sort of why
I chose this profession.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.200
People don't usually think
this profession is for that,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.169
but it totally can be.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.900
Like, it can be a total game-changer.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.350
And now there's people helping me,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.140
people with suits who get things done.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.383
I got attached to direct
this major Disney feature.

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:03.890
There's less executives
who, when I walk in,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.020
have that 30-second window
where they're surprised

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.270
by everything I say that
is not with an accent.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.724
And that is progress.

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.641
[Clip]: (audience cheers)
