00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.570
People call me old and smelly, but apparently
that’s not something scientists want to

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.570
recreate.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.450
Their loss.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.210
Hey there nosy viewers, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.420
Have you ever wondered what the world smelled
like centuries ago?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.190
Everything probably smelled a little different,
and some smells just aren’t around anymore.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.450
For example, what about flowers that have
long since gone extinct?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.020
It’s a shame we’ll never get to know their
scent.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.020
Or will we?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.940
Well, scientists are actually working on unearthing
old frozen flowers from the Ice Age, but to

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.390
understand how those smells are coming back,
you need to understand what a fragrance, or

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.390
smell, is.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.680
Take something like a rose.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.629
For a perfume or a body wash to contain the
scent, roses are grown and picked and then

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.469
their essential oils are extracted, which
contain aroma compounds.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.499
These are chemical molecules that bind to
receptors in our noses.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.319
The receptors then send signals to our brains,
which interpret the compounds as smells.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.249
In fact, you can extract these compounds yourself
at home by running steam through aromatic

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.729
plants, then collecting and cooling the steam.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.119
For a long time, perfume makers would use
this process, but it has huge problems, mainly

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.009
that it depends entirely on crop yield, which
can vary year to year, and be relatively unpredictable,

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.219
and in some cases, unreasonably expensive.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.409
So instead, scientists have developed a new
method of creating smells, almost from scratch.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.260
See, the reasons plants have any smell at
all is because their DNA contains genetic

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.670
code that tells it to use enzymes to create
specific types of aromatic chemicals, which

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.100
are used to attract pollinating insects.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.789
In roses these chemicals include citronellol,
geraniol, nerol, farnnesol, linalool, eugenol,

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:36.789
and rose oxide.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.329
It’s a complex smell.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.540
But the fact is, the rest of the rose and
it’s genetic coding doesn’t really matter

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.100
for perfumeries; they don’t need the complete
list, they just need the part that makes smells.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.640
So, what scientists have done is take yeast,
yes, the one from beer and bread, and genetically

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.649
engineer it.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.880
Normally, yeast consumes sugars, and farts
out alcohol and carbon dioxide in a process

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.510
known as “fermentation”.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.420
But this yeast’s DNA is altered to mimic
the mechanisms in plants that create aromatic

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
compounds.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.159
So, instead, the yeast eats fatty acids and
farts out good-smelling chemicals.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.980
That’s a huge deal for scent creation, because
it leads to a more consistent, cheaper and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.470
more efficient product.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.390
But what is even cooler, is looking at recreating
scents where we may not have the living specimen,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.950
but we do have its DNA.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
That’s what a company called Ginko Bioworks
is trying to do, using extinct plants that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.790
may be difficult or impossible to regrow,
altering yeast to match these extinct DNA

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.790
sequences.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.030
Unfortunately, this is a really lucrative
and proprietary area, so they haven’t released

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.100
exactly how they’re genetically altering
the yeast in question.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.030
But the science behind the concept is decades
old and has been used more and more in recent

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.470
years as an alternative to the traditional
method.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.840
Soon, you might just be able to buy a perfume
that smells like flowers from another time.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.290
We can’t do DNews episodes without our sponsors.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.510
Thanks to Kay Jewelers for sponsoring this
episode.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.700
For 100 years, every kiss begins with K.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.130
So we can find out what extinct flowers smell
like but what about space?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.130
What does space smell like?

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.930
You can find out by watching this video right
here.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.370
And what's your favorite smell?
