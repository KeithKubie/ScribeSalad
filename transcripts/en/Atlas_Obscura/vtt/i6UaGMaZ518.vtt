00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.173
- I'm Michael Inman.

00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:14.760
I'm curator of rare books at
the New York Public Library,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.890
and today, we're looking
at the Hunt-Lenox Globe

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.360
which is not only the
second-oldest surviving

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.090
terrestrial globe, but
also the oldest known globe

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.523
to depict the Americas.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.020
The origin of the globe is still

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.380
somewhat shrouded in mystery.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.130
As far as we know, it was
created probably in France

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.233
or possibly Italy, roughly
between the dates 1505 and 1510.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.560
There are a number of details on the globe

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.043
that I find interesting.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.870
It's a little bit hard to make out,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.180
but here you have a sea monster,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.341
here at the end of my finger,

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.230
I can move that down slightly,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.100
as well as a ship.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.500
These are just two examples
of the kinds of details

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.270
that are hidden in the globe, in a sense.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.430
The more you look at it,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.640
the more these things do pop out.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.380
And it's here at the end of my finger

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.060
that we see, just below the equator,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.100
the Latin phrase, HC SVNT DRACONES,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250
"here be dragons," or "here lie dragons."

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.190
So, today, when you see
a map that's pretending

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.890
to be ye olde map and a ship sailing

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.810
off the edge of the world,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.370
and it says "here lies dragons,"

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.593
that phrase derives solely
from the Hunt-Lenox Globe.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.120
Then we have here South America.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.770
No North America, however.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.850
You see the land mass cuts off right about

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.060
where today's nation of Panama is located.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.700
So, the Isthmus of Panama.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.980
Nothing beyond that point is depicted.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.890
Well, the New York
Public Library has about

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890
55 million items in its collection,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.900
and certainly, this is one
of the great treasures.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.930
It has that treasure status because it is

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.920
a completely unique object,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
and it speaks to Europeans'
knowledge of the world

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.783
just shortly after the time
of Columbus's initial voyage.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.790
When working with something like this,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.100
it really does, for me
anyway, remind me of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.430
my tiny, small, little,
individual place in history,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.990
and the fact that I'm just
part of the long continuum

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.300
of people who have
interacted with this object,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.650
and that it will be around long after I

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.173
and all of us are gone.
