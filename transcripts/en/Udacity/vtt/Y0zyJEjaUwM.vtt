00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.390
Okay, so that's cool. It actually worked, and we put the picture in, but.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.660
&gt;&gt; Right, and so, in the future, when people come back

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.600
to this, they'll see what you posted and when, but also,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.160
if you go to your Home tab, anyone that is following

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.890
this record would see that post come up in their feed.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.420
&gt;&gt; So, you can see, right here. Yeah.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.450
&gt;&gt; So any information that I've decided was relavant to

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.250
me will basically just always show up in this feed.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.420
&gt;&gt; Right. One other thing,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.810
remember we added that thing earlier to do feed tracking on specific fields.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Why don't you just, you know, just

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.050
to see what that look like, try it out.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.159
&gt;&gt; So change maybe the crowd capacity to take a thousand more people.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.396
Andy Brown changed Crowd Capacity from 5,000 to 6,000.

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:42.400
&gt;&gt; Really useful, right?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.900
&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.810
&gt;&gt; And anyone following this, again, would see that too.
