beifong<00:09:25.079><c> stuff</c><00:09:25.649><c> I</c><00:09:25.769><c> definitely</c><00:09:26.130><c> wanted</c><00:09:26.370><c> to</c><00:09:26.459><c> see</c>

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
beifong stuff I definitely wanted to see
 

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
beifong stuff I definitely wanted to see
what<00:09:26.910><c> that</c><00:09:26.940><c> was</c><00:09:27.240><c> and</c><00:09:27.570><c> get</c><00:09:27.690><c> that</c><00:09:27.839><c> resolved</c><00:09:28.380><c> and</c>

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:28.529 align:start position:0%
what that was and get that resolved and
 

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
what that was and get that resolved and
then<00:09:29.209><c> so</c><00:09:30.209><c> I</c><00:09:30.240><c> like</c><00:09:30.570><c> that</c><00:09:31.010><c> even</c><00:09:32.010><c> though</c><00:09:32.070><c> it</c>

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.130 align:start position:0%
then so I like that even though it
 

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.250 align:start position:0%
then so I like that even though it
wasn't<00:09:32.310><c> but</c><00:09:33.209><c> it's</c><00:09:33.389><c> it's</c><00:09:33.750><c> still</c><00:09:33.930><c> there</c><00:09:34.110><c> it</c>

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't but it's it's still there it
 

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.939 align:start position:0%
wasn't but it's it's still there it
still<00:09:34.470><c> works</c>

00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:34.949 align:start position:0%
still works
 

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.670 align:start position:0%
still works
I<00:09:35.550><c> thought</c><00:09:36.540><c> the</c><00:09:36.690><c> resolution</c><00:09:37.170><c> for</c><00:09:37.320><c> giving</c><00:09:37.589><c> up</c>

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
I thought the resolution for giving up
 

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.170 align:start position:0%
I thought the resolution for giving up
saying<00:09:37.860><c> good</c><00:09:38.010><c> morning</c><00:09:38.040><c> that</c><00:09:38.490><c> has</c><00:09:38.760><c> a</c><00:09:38.820><c> little</c>
