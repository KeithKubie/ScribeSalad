00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:31.630
We’d bet that the vast majority of people
reading this, regardless of gender, race or

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.040
socioeconomic background, carry the same few
basic items with them at all times; a phone,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.330
some keys, a few dollars, a debit card, and
maybe some I.D are all items you’d reliably

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.989
expect to find if you asked an average person
on the street to turn out their pockets.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.059
But what would you find if you asked a millionaire,
or even a billionaire, to do the same thing?

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.989
As it turns out, it would appear you’d find
they’d produce more or less the same or

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.400
less from their pockets as the average Joe.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.379
For example, Bill Gates rarely seems to carry
cash at all, or at least rarely admits to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.379
doing so.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.159
Gates is frequently asked by both journalist
and the people he meets how much money he

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.299
carries around with him on a daily basis and
in most every interview we found, Gates’

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.970
stock response is that he seldom carries either
cash or a wallet with him.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.590
An exception to this was a preamble Gates
did to an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.060
where he pre-emptively answered some of the
more popular questions he’s found himself

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.759
being asked in the past, including “How
much do you have in your wallet?”.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.079
The answer to which, at least at that moment
in time, was a single, crisp $100 bill.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.020
It should be noted that the next question
Gates answered was “Can I have a million

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.740
dollars?”, which he tactfully answered by
explaining he donates the bulk of his money

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.130
to needy causes.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.310
This question, and Bill’s desire to answer
it ahead of time, likely explains why he rarely

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.100
carries cash, or at least doesn’t admit
to doing so.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.569
After all, nobody can ask you for money if
it’s well known you never carry any around.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.189
Gates is by no means an outlier and it’s
an observable phenomenon that the ultra-wealthy

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.079
rarely seem to feel the need to carry all
that much cash (or even a wallet at all).

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.750
Reasons vary from billionaire to billionaire,
but the most common given we found is that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.219
they simply don’t need to.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.039
Billionaires are inevitably flanked at all
times by an army of assistants and aides who

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.330
can take care of things like restaurants bills
and tips on their behalf, so the need to carry

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.860
physical currency, credit cards, or even necessarily
ID, is diminished somewhat.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.159
On the credit card front, it’s also worth
noting that in more recent years credit and

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.040
debit cards have become more of a status symbol
than physical currency in some circles; to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.500
quote Vanity Fair on the matter:

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.719
Possessing two or three of the right cards
bound together by an ordinary rubber band

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.700
now conveys a level of distinction greater
than that of any cash-filled Louis Vuitton

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.280
wallet or purse.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.609
The fact of that matter is that cards like
the hyper-exclusive American Express Centurion

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.930
card – which as we’ve mentioned in another
article, can literally be used to buy anything

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.129
that’s for sale, even if it costs hundreds
of millions of dollars – convey more about

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.739
a person’s wealth than even the crispest
stack of hundred dollar bills.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.480
Another reason the super-rich don’t need
to carry much cash around with them is that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.769
their fame largely makes it unnecessary, whether
they have any aids with them or not.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.349
For example, prior to becoming President,
Donald Trump admitted that he didn’t carry

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.240
a wallet because people usually gave him stuff
for free; in his own words from a 2013 interview:

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.090
“You know it’s very sad.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.930
I go to a restaurant and almost every time
they say, ‘Mr. Trump, it’s on me,’ the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.390
owner: ‘Mr. Trump it’s on me, no charge,
Mr. Trump,’ no I never need cash.”

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.999
This isn’t to say Trump doesn’t sometimes
carry cash.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.689
In keeping with his penchant for showmanship,
Trump did formerly claim to carry around a

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.209
few hundred dollars at any given time – or
at least he did prior to becoming president.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.859
He stated this was mainly just in case he
needed to hand out tips, rather than the money

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.889
being used to buy something per se.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.310
Beyond money or a wallet, Trump also claimed
he usually only carried around two cell phones

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.530
(an iPhone and a Samsung), which we presume
one was for personal use and the other a business

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.530
phone.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.959
How much this has changed since becoming president
isn’t clear.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.909
Continuing the trend, even before ubiquitous
credit and debit cards, the likes of Howard

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.569
Hughes, John Lennon and even Elvis, reportedly
seldom felt the need to carry cash.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.439
In Elvis’ case, many of his trademark suits
were even made without pockets.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.829
In regards to each man, while their reasons
for not carrying money varied (Hughes was

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.670
supposedly scared of being robbed, for example,
and was generally surrounded by an army of

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.150
assistants anyway), their fame made this decision
a relatively easy one to live with.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.340
For instance, like Trump after him, John Lennon
famously expressed puzzlement at the fact

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.919
that the wealthier and more famous he became,
the less he was expected to pay for anything.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.500
To wit, biographer Philip Norman stated, “he
discovered the strange truth that the richer

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.789
one becomes the less obligation there seems
to pay for anything.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.110
Clubs he visited pressed free drinks on him,
restaurants automatically waived bills, guitar

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.199
makers sent him their choicest new models
simply for the glory of his patronage.”

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.530
This segues into another thing previously
alluded to that the obscenely rich seldom

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.530
seem to carry- I.D.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.889
Although they likely do own passports and
driving licenses, in interviews we trawled

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.330
through in which the rich and famous were
asked to turn out their pockets, few of them

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.430
seem to bother carrying any form of identification
on their person.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.460
The most likely reason why being, to paraphrase
an obscure band this author likes, that their

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.979
face is the ticket.

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.590
A notable outlier to this is the Queen, who
goes so far as not even having a passport

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.270
or driver’s licence.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.400
But as we’ve mentioned before, while her
face may be one of the most recognizable in

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.280
the world, the reason she doesn’t have them
is not because she’s famous, but because

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.389
she simply doesn’t legally need them to
travel or drive, regardless of where she is

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.389
in the world.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.710
(For the reasons why, see Why Doesn’t the
Queen Need a Passport?)

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.660
Speaking of the Queen, although nobody but
herself knows exactly what she carries around

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.389
with her in her purse, we do know that she
similarly never bothers to carry cash except

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.360
on Sundays, when she traditionally carries
a crisp £5 note to place in her church’s

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.599
collection plate.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.590
Other items the Queen has been observed putting
into or pulling out of her purse, handbag

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.039
and pockets include lipstick, pens, napkins
and on one occasion, a suction cup she attached

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.810
to the underside of her table that she then
hung her handbag on (which is kind of brilliant,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.810
actually).

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.690
More unusual items the Queen is said to carry
with her include personal knick-knacks, dog

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.740
biscuits, and random mints she hands out to
strangers.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.900
Going along with the theme that the richer
you are, the less likely you are to have to

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.580
pay for something, one of the more curious
items carried by a billionaire we stumbled

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.409
across was a special card carried by Warren
Buffett that lets him have unlimited McDonald’s

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.930
forever at certain McDonald’s.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.070
More specifically, as we’ve talked about
before, this card is good for free food for

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.780
life throughout Omaha McDonald’s and is
one of a few items Buffett claims to carry

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.780
on his person.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.470
Other items the famously spendthrift billionaire
likes to carry include an original green American

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.360
Express card from 1964, pictures of his family,
and a lucky signed $50 bill from a bank his

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.240
investment firm Berkshire Hathaway used to
own.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.110
Curiously, Buffet is unique amongst billionaires
we researched in that he’s the only one

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.490
we found that admits to regularly carrying
change.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.389
You see, Buffett nearly always eats breakfast
at the McDonald’s near his house in Omaha

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.520
on his way to work, and, curiously, despite
literally having a card granting him unlimited

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.530
McDonald’s for life and billions in the
bank, says he pays for the breakfast with

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.849
exact change.

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.979
We assume he perhaps does this to avoid calling
attention to himself or otherwise being delayed

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:06.080
on his way to work by producing his free McDonald’s
card.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.889
But, unfortunately for us, in the interview
where he mentions carrying exact change for

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.069
this purpose, the interviewer didn’t ask
him why he doesn’t just use his free McDonald’s

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.069
card.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:18.009
Whatever the case, Buffett also carries a
few dollars with him to pay for the cans of

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:23.320
Coca-Cola he drinks at the office, something
he does despite owning about a 10% stake in

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320
Coca-Cola.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.080
(Bill Gates also once noted in a letter concerning
his charitable foundation that Buffet and

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.500
he were once visiting China together and decided
to grab a bite to eat.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.699
Naturally, the pair of billionaires decided
to dine at McDonald’s…

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.800
It was at this point that Buffett produced
coupons to help reduce their bill…)

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.130
Another billionaire who kindly admitted to
the monetary contents of his wallet in an

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.960
interview is Elon Musk, who stated he only
had about $40 in his wallet at the time.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.949
In conclusion, thanks to their fantastic wealth,
the uber-rich paradoxically seem to have less

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:58.330
need for carrying cash, credit cards, or even
ID than us lowly mortals, whether because

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.719
their army of assistants takes care of these
sorts of things for them, or simply because

00:08:01.719 --> 00:09:45.910
they are less expected 

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:59.260
to 
pay for 

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:17.320
things 

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:29.320
when 

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.150
they go out.
