Now, of course we know that there is obstacles we face when trying to solve

00:00:02.987 --> 00:00:07.590
problems, that make them very difficult to solve. Two common obstacles to

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.113
solving problems are fixation and functional fixedness. Fixation is the

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:17.973
inability to break out of a mind-set and think about a problem from a new a

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:24.784
fresh perspective. And functional fixedness is being fixed on seeing things as

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:30.495
we're used to seeing them. And being unable to see unusual uses for everyday

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.725
things or procedures.
