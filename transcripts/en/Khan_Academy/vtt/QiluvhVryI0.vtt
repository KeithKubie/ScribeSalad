00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:05.770
Voiceover: The fair value of a futures
contract is the price of the contract

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.461
at which a buyer of the
stock would be neutral

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:12.665
between buying it on in
an actual stock exchange

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:16.497
and actually buying the stock and
agreeing to buy the futures contract.

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:20.114
Or a seller of the stock would be
neutral between selling it right now

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:24.257
in the actual exchange
versus agreeing to go short

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:27.284
or agreeing to be on the selling
side for a futures contract.

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:30.821
The fair value attends to be
quoted for the front month

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.463
or the next expiring futures contract.

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:37.045
Next expiring futures contract.

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.645
To see how this works, why
someone would be neutral

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:46.577
between say, buying something now
for a $100 and agreeing to buy it

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:50.031
maybe next month at a
$102, think of it this way.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.006
If they want to just hold that stock
a month, or two, or three from now,

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.964
they could pay a $100 right now
or they could take their $100

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.411
so they could either just buy it right now

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.466
or they could stick it maybe
in the money market account.

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.643
They could get some interest
for the next few weeks

00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:10.327
and then they could buy
the futures contract.

00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:16.654
If they got interest of $2, if they kept
that $100 say in a money market account

00:01:16.654 --> 00:01:21.437
for the next, until the actual
contract date for that futures contract

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:22.486
they'd be neutral.

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:26.491
I could spend a $100 today or I could
put a $100 in a money market account,

00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:30.653
get $2 in interest and I'm not going
to worry about the dividends right now.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.088
If a dividend happens then, obviously
you would want to pay less for this thing

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:35.735
where you didn't get the dividend.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:39.324
Assuming no dividends, you say well or
I'd be willing to pay a $102 for that.

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:44.854
If this was only a $101, if the price
of the futures contract was a $101,

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:48.233
then you say, "Wait, if the price
of the futures contract is a $101,"

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:53.182
"I would rather put my money in a money
market account, get $2 of interest."

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:55.824
"And buy it in a month for a $101."

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.730
I'll essentially get an
extra dollar if I do that.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:07.400
If the price is at a $103, you say,
"Well gee, if I want to hold that stock"

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.671
"a month or two from now. I'm
way better buying it right now."

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:14.412
Or another way to think about
it if the price is at a $103

00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:15.913
and I'm a seller of the stock.

00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:17.963
Instead of selling it today for a $100,

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.858
let's say I really need a $100 right now.

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:23.565
I'm better off borrowing a $100 right now.

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:29.405
Paying maybe $2 in interest and then
selling it a month later for a $103.

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:33.641
The fair value is the price which
a buyer or seller is neutral

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:37.603
between buying and selling the stock
or entering into a futures contract.

00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.403
I'm going to go a little bit
more detail in the next video

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:44.921
but it's main use is an
indicator of what's likely
to happen once a market opens

00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:50.845
and that's because futures markets
trade have much longer trading hours,

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:53.699
sometimes 24 hours than
traditional stock markets.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.895
If you could imagine, if the
price of a futures contract

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.004
is trading below its fair value,

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:01.631
the only reason why that would happen

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.467
is if a lot of people are actually
expecting, once the market opens

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:07.739
that the stock price is going to go down.
