- [Announcer] Tonight, the
roast master general, Jeff Ross,

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.570
 finally comes off the judges
 bench and into the arena to

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.105
make his battling debut.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.874
 Roast master, what's
 your strategy tonight?

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.809 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.244
 He's going against this guy.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.346
 NBA all star, Blake Griffin.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.481 align:start position:0%
Blake, you ready for this
tonight? It's going to get ugly.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.317
- Wait, it can actually
get uglier than Jeff?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.886
 (audience laughs and cheers)

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.387 size:88% position:44%
 - Roast battle, starts now.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.024
 (hip hop beat)

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.804
- I've been preparing to
do my first roast battle

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.872
and I've been watching
these battles for years,

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.841
 and I've got to admit,
 I have a new respect

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.409 size:84% position:42%
  for the battlers.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:47.246 size:88% position:44%
  The crap is psychological,
  challenges in your head,

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:51.050
 of when to hit, when to take
 the joke and when to attack.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.585 size:88% position:44%
  It's a lot to think about.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.120
 - I don't have a lot
 of comedy experience,

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I just enjoy comedy.
 I watch comedy.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.157 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I love standup, comedy
 movies, TV shows.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.726 align:start position:0%
 I'd watch the comedy central
 roast for a long time.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.928
 - Blake's a champion,

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.597 align:start size:88% position:13%
he's a championship
level basketball player

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.100
 and guys like him have
 been talking smack,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.734
 taking jokes since he's a kid.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.571
So I do think he's kind
of a smack talk expert.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.406 size:88% position:44%
 - All the trash talk you do
 in the NBA is just kinda of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.209 size:84% position:42%
  like, one on one, no one
  else is really listening,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.945
 so this is a little different
 when you're onstage in front

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.114 size:84% position:42%
  of a crowd. Mic'd
  up for a tv show.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.083 size:84% position:42%
  - Getting judged by my
  pals is going to be tough

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.519 size:88% position:44%
 but it's another thing that
 battlers have to go through

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.453
 all the time.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.122
 We're big roast battle family.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.325
So even though I'm rising to
the challenge of doing my first

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.426
 roast battle,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.361
I still feel very much at home.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:36.929 size:88% position:44%
 Like this is my home court.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.664 align:start position:0%
 - I feel like I'm the
 underdog in this situation,

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.166
 I don't know.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.968 align:start position:0%
 I don't really see it as much
 pressure but the pressures

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.236
 is on me. I'm ready.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.370
 (whish sound)

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:47.006 size:84% position:42%
  (audience chants) Battle.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.508 align:start position:0%
  - [Announcer] Whose
  ready for the main event?

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.977 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.846
 Our challenger is no
 stranger to slams.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.849 size:88% position:44%
 He was an NBA rookie of the
 year, slam dunk champion,

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.085
 and a five time NBA all star.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.388 size:88% position:44%
 Los Angeles, please welcome
 back, for one night only,

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:06.392
he's tall and ready to
ball, Big Blake Griffin.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.227 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.331
 (intense music beat)

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.083
 And his opponent, from
 New York, New Jersey,

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.920
 weighing in at way
 more than he should,

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
 he's roasting everyone
 from criminals,

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.724 size:88% position:44%
 to the president of
 the United States,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.660 size:84% position:42%
  which is actually
  the same thing.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.596
Please welcome from brick city,

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.833 align:start position:0%
 the ball buster, our roast
 master general, Jeffery Ross.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:51.003 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheers and claps)

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.439
 (soft music)

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:19.699 size:88% position:44%
 (beat and cheers intensify)

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:40.353
 - [Audience] (chants) Battle.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:47.260 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - [Announcer] Oh
 they're ready baby.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:52.298 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Blake, it's home
 court advantage, why'd
 you challenge Jeff?

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:55.201 align:start position:0%
 - Honestly man, when it
 comes to this, whether it's

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
 basketball or
 something like this,

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.204 size:88% position:44%
 I always want to go
 against the best.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
 So I asked like ten people
 and none of them could do it,

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:02.208
so here we are.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.010 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.613 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Jeff, why'd you accept
Blake's challenge?

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.583 size:88% position:44%
 - Because I am the
 Lebron of roasting.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:12.652 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.221 align:start position:0%
  Which is still better than
  being the Blake Griffin

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.422
 of basketball.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:22.094
 (audience groans and cheers)

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.397
 - Alright. Jeff, you
 know the rules because

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.065 size:88% position:44%
  you invented them.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.769
 But for Blake's sake
 and for Pete's sake,

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.470 size:88% position:44%
  here are the rules
  of roast battle.

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:33.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Rule one, original
  material only.

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:35.841
 Rule two, no physical contact

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.209
and Blake, I am the ref.

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
No bitching, no
moaning, no complaining.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.482
 (audience cheers and laughs)

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.218
And after every battle,

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:47.553
we hug.

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:50.056 size:88% position:44%
  Jeff, Blake, who
  wants to go first?

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.123 size:88% position:44%
 - I would love to go first.

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:54.060 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.363 align:start position:0%
  - Okay. Blake Griffin,
  Peter Griffin, let's roll.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.832
 (bell dings)

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Just real quick,
 before we get started.

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Honestly, I have
 some unfortunate news

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.240
to share with you guys.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:11.043 size:88% position:44%
  After working for
  24 hours straight,

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:13.179 size:84% position:42%
  Jeff's makeup girl just
  hung herself in the back.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.848 size:88% position:44%
 (audience gasps and laughs)

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.683 size:88% position:44%
 Yes you're ugly is what I--

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.553 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.257 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Blake I'm just glad
 to see you healthy

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.792 size:84% position:42%
  and ready for the season.

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Everybody talks about
 your busted knees,

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:31.230 size:88% position:44%
  no one talks about
  that busted face.

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:33.899 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:05:33.932 --> 00:05:36.168
 You look like Morgan
 Freeman bleached.

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:39.972
 (audience laughs and cheers)

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.748 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.785 size:88% position:44%
  - That was a good
  shot. A good shot.

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:55.187
 Honestly, I feel like
 you could get hurt,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.289
but the only way you
can get inside of a gym

00:05:57.322 --> 00:05:59.392 align:start size:88% position:13%
is if you literally
****ed a guy named Jim.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.362 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start size:88% position:13%
  (audience cheering
  and screaming)

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:17.643
(whistle sound)

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.848 size:88% position:44%
  - No, listen guys. Listen.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.551 align:start position:0%
 It's a roast battle, so
 Jeff's going to take a couple

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.686
 on the chin tonight,

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:28.921 size:84% position:42%
  but Jeff,

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:31.857 size:84% position:42%
  I'm honestly--I'm
  a gracious guy,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.326 align:start position:0%
 so I'm going to let you
 decide which one of your chins

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:35.161
you take it on.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:37.630 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:42.301
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.303 size:84% position:42%
  chins in my bank account.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.473
Chins in my bank
account, chins--

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:50.509
 (audience joins in and cheers)

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:55.214
 - Blake, good luck
 in Detroit. (laughs)

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:58.551
 That's the whole joke.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.985 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.754 size:88% position:44%
  No no no, hold on.

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.889
 Good luck in Detroit
 Blake, you know what,

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.691
I think you're just white enough

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.326
 not to get shot by the cops.

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.696
(audience moans)

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.265 align:start position:0%
 But be careful because
 you're now the worst shooter

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:15.334 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in the most violent
 city in america.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:19.705
 (audience groans and cheers)

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:24.744 align:start position:0%
Blake lives matter. Blake lives
matter. Blake lives matter.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:28.414
(baseball themed music)

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.382
 - That's good man. And make
 sure the joke is really good

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:34.253
 considering you look like the
 only Neo Nazi Jewish person.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.454
 (Jeff laughs)

00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:36.956 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.892
 Jeff, you're so ugly, today I
 realized for the first time,

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.628 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that Jeff Ross looks
 like Darth Vader

00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:44.497
after they took his helmet off.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.332 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.968
 (lion roaring)

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.339 size:88% position:44%
  - Blake your half Haitian,

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:56.075 size:88% position:44%
  so it's no wonder all your
  teams have been a disaster

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:58.511 size:88% position:44%
 with no leadership,
 begging for help.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.314 size:84% position:42%
  (audience groans)

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:07.186 size:88% position:44%
  Yeah. What do you got, you
  ****ing space jam alien.

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:10.056 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:14.426
 (cartoon kick sound)

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:17.463 size:84% position:42%
  - Jeff, it's really funny
  that you bring that up.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.598 align:start size:88% position:13%
  You're such a bald
  piece of shit.

00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:22.601 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:08:22.634 --> 00:08:25.271
It honestly looks like
we both got ****ed over

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.238
by the clippers.

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:30.009
 (audience cheers and laughs)

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:51.897 size:88% position:44%
 - Blake, I do hope someday
 you come back to California

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.766 align:start size:88% position:13%
 to pursue your show
 business dreams,

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.701 align:start size:88% position:13%
 because you never
 know when Hollywood's

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:57.336 size:88% position:44%
 going to be looking
 for a leading man

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:58.638
that looks like

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:01.841
 Patrick Ewing ****ed

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.310
 a Chucky doll.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.011 size:84% position:42%
  (audience groans)

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.980
 You look like Pippi

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:11.951
- That's better. That's
better. That's better.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:12.885 size:84% position:42%
  - You look like--

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.086
 [Blake] Oh, we're still going

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:16.255 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - An albino that
 God cooked too long.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.991 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:21.193 size:88% position:44%
 - That's good. That's good.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:22.761
- [Announcer] Last joke.

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:26.765
 - Jeff, you know, when people
 talk about the best basketball

00:09:26.798 --> 00:09:28.233 size:88% position:44%
 player of all time,

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:31.070
they refer to them as the goat.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:34.173
 And when people talk about
 the best roast master of all

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.775
time, they refer to him
as Anthony Jeselnik.

00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:40.212
(audience cheers loudly)

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.397
 - Alright buddy, you
 want to get personal,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.932 size:88% position:44%
  I'll get personal.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:04.370 align:start position:0%
 Blake, everyone knows you
 recently dated Kendall Jenner.

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:07.139 size:84% position:42%
  (audience groans)

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:08.741
 But what they don't know is,

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.843
 I heard she broke up with you
 because she caught you staring

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.444 size:88% position:44%
  at her dad's tits.

00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:16.215
 (audience groans and cheers)

00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:24.690 size:88% position:44%
 And just like the clippers,

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:29.361
 Kendall eventually traded you
 for another basketball player.

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:30.195
 Man.

00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:33.065 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:40.239
Man, dude, the season
hasn't even started yet

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:42.808
and your ex is already
leading you in rebounds.

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.479 size:88% position:44%
 (audience groan and cheers)

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.252
 - Wait, no take a lap.

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:01.794
 I'm not going to lie, that's
 really really really funny.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.830
 But like real quick,
 let's just talk about,

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:06.065 size:88% position:44%
 real quick,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.766
 about the last girl
 that Jeff Ross ****ed.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:11.570
 (audience groans and cheers)

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:29.855
The last girl that Jeff
Ross ****ed, let's see.

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:30.723
Okay so,

00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:39.165
 so, if Jeff is 89 years old.

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:45.738
 Wait, no, for real guys, let
 me just think for a second.

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:50.509 size:88% position:44%
  The last girl that
  Jeff Ross ****ed.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:57.015 size:84% position:42%
  Guys, can I get a second.
  Stop, this isn't a joke.

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:58.550 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:02.621
 We're thinking about the last
 girl that Jeff Ross ****ed.

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:05.491 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:08.794
 Have you ever ****ed anyone?

00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:11.263
 Ever?

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:15.834 size:84% position:42%
  - Blake--

00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:16.702
- Wait.

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:20.940 size:88% position:44%
  The last girl that
  Jeff Ross ****ed.

00:12:21.973 --> 00:12:25.578 size:88% position:44%
  (audience cheering loudly)

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.947 size:88% position:44%
 - That's all I got.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.782 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:32.251
 (bell dings)

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:42.060
 - Oh my god. Sound the
 buzzer, this was over.

00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:43.228 size:88% position:44%
 - You killed me. That hurt.

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.163
 - No.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.697
- I have had sex, you know that.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.536 size:88% position:44%
  - (laughs) I don't. I just
  don't know that, for sure.

00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:54.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't know who wins,
but I want a rematch.

00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:58.544 size:88% position:44%
  - We go toe to toe and we
  come back and do it again.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.045 size:88% position:44%
  It's a heavy weight fight.

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:03.015 align:start position:0%
 - We just saw love city and
 slob city go one on one.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:06.518
 Judges, I get to pick
 who goes first here.

00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:08.220
 Anthony, who scored?

00:13:09.654 --> 00:13:11.390 size:84% position:42%
  - This is so tough, Jeff.

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.660
 I always describe you as my
 brother from another mother,

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:18.330 align:start size:88% position:13%
but Blake, you came
out here as an amateur,

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:19.698 size:88% position:44%
 an amateur roaster,

00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:22.234
 and you gave it the
 respect it deserved.

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:24.603 size:88% position:44%
  I like how you pointed out
  that I'm the best roaster

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:25.637
 of all time.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.841
(audience claps)

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.108 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A lot of people
 don't get that right,

00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:32.744
 so I appreciate that you did.

00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:34.479
 And you had some great jokes.

00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:38.383
 My only concern, I hope your
 hands are okay because you

00:13:38.416 --> 00:13:39.818
knocked him out

00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.287 align:start position:0%
 like he was a trainer on
 your own team. And that was--

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.691 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.025
It was amazing.

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:49.494
 I vote for Blake, sorry Jeff.

00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:52.064 size:84% position:42%
  Don't take it personally,
  but it is very personal.

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:54.566 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:56.134 size:88% position:44%
 - [Announcer] Blake
 Griffin, one vote.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.438 size:88% position:44%
  Jeff Ross, no votes. Nikki
  Glazer. Who do you like?

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:01.940
 - I thought this was
 going to be so easy.

00:14:01.973 --> 00:14:05.177 size:88% position:44%
 You know, like it's
 Jeff ****ing Ross.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.981 size:88% position:44%
 It's Jeff Ross, the
 greatest at this.

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.182 size:88% position:44%
  And Blake Griffin,

00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:13.585
I cannot believe how
hot you are. But also--

00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:17.189 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:18.023
 - Yes

00:14:18.056 --> 00:14:19.291
 - That was distracting

00:14:19.324 --> 00:14:20.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - We didn't know
 you could be funny.

00:14:20.592 --> 00:14:23.428
 We've only seen you in
 your Kia commercials.

00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:25.030 size:88% position:44%
  So we didn't know.

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:27.900 size:84% position:42%
  (everyone laughs)

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:32.838
 - Blake, you came out
 with such a dark joke

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:35.340
 about Jeff's make up
 girl hanging herself,

00:14:35.373 --> 00:14:36.976 size:88% position:44%
 which I just loved.

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:39.745
- [Blake] Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:42.614
And then ****ed a guy named Jim.

00:14:42.647 --> 00:14:45.217
And then the last joke,
I loved what you did.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.453
You turned the style on it's
head, you definitely tried some

00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:49.955
different stuff.

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.090
 You sat on the ground and you
 let that last joke just sit

00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:54.793
and ****ing sit and sit and sit.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.164
But I was so impressed.

00:14:59.197 --> 00:15:02.734 align:start position:0%
 This should be so much easier
 than it is, but then Jeff.

00:15:02.767 --> 00:15:04.202
 - It's just Nikki,
 Nikki makes it hard.

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:05.137 size:84% position:42%
  - I know.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.571 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:08.874 align:start position:0%
  - Jeff, I loved that
  you're dressed like JFK jr

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.342
 at his dad's funeral

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:13.111
(audience yells)

00:15:13.144 --> 00:15:15.580 size:88% position:44%
  (gun shot)

00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:17.149
 It's adorable.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:20.218 size:88% position:44%
  (audience whistle)

00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:23.522 align:start position:0%
 Jeff, you brought it the whole
 time and then when you got

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:25.457
into the Kendall stuff,

00:15:27.258 --> 00:15:28.894 size:88% position:44%
 with the dads tits.

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:31.931 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I mean, that was
 just another level.

00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:37.503
Jeff Ross, you ****ing
won this. You won Jeff.

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
 It was close
 though. It was hard.

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.074
- One for Blake Griffin,

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.709 size:88% position:44%
  one for Jeff Ross.

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:45.777
 Pete Davidson. You're
 a thinkly ambiguous,

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.213
just like Blake Griffin.

00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:49.681 size:84% position:42%
  - Thanks.

00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:51.049 align:start position:0%
 - You going for the home
 team or big homie Jeff Ross.

00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:53.618
- I thought Blake did a
****ing fantastic job.

00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.087 size:84% position:42%
  It's annoying how

00:15:56.921 --> 00:15:58.123 size:84% position:42%
  talented you are.

00:15:58.156 --> 00:15:59.224 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I've always said
 this to my friends.

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:01.193
 I hope we can be friends too.

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:03.362
No, you're sick. I'm a big fan.

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:06.531 align:start position:0%
But that last joke lasted
longer than any of your seasons

00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:07.766
and I was like--

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:10.102 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.238 size:88% position:44%
 That shit like that
 was long as ****,

00:16:14.439 --> 00:16:17.275
 but you did as good
 as you could ever do.

00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:18.977 size:88% position:44%
  I wouldn't be able
  to do that good.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.280
Also Anthony Jeselnik is
the best roast joke guy

00:16:22.313 --> 00:16:23.115
 of all time.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.483
Him and Geraldo.

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:27.052 size:84% position:42%
  So that was true.

00:16:27.085 --> 00:16:30.989
 But Jeff, you look like Jack
 Black in school of crack rock.

00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:33.859 size:84% position:42%

Sorry, I'm on mushrooms.

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:45.804 size:84% position:42%
  Anyway, Jeff, seriously,
  you had me ****ing dying,

00:16:45.837 --> 00:16:48.473 size:88% position:44%
  also when you shot
  it and it went in

00:16:48.506 --> 00:16:50.475
 and I've never been
 happier for a person.

00:16:50.508 --> 00:16:55.514
 I wanted that ball to go in so
 ****ing bad. I was like yeah.

  You won. Jeff won.

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:02.120
 He did. But like, Blake did
 as good as he possibly could

00:17:02.153 --> 00:17:02.954 size:84% position:42%

  it was his battle.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.395

It's really fun having you man.

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I appreciate it.
 Thanks for having me.

00:17:28.913 --> 00:17:31.550
It was a pleasure to

00:17:32.617 --> 00:17:34.119
