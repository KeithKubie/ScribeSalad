LAURA DECOOK: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.380
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.500
My name is Laura DeCook
and I'm a brand specialist

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.050
on the YouTube operations team.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.310
I also want to extend a
big welcome to all of you

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.130
on the live stream
across the globe.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.340
Last fall, I had the pleasure
of meeting our guest today, Mr.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.430
Don George, at an event
sponsored by adventure travel

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.080
company Geographic Expeditions
for the organization Room

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.260
to Read.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.170
For those of you who don't
know what Room to Read is,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.970
it partners with
local communities

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.080
throughout the developing world
to build libraries and develop

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.200
literacy skills among
primary school children.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.580
Now, a little bit
about our guest.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.230
"National Geographic" has called
Don George a legendary travel

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.680
writer and editor.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.700
Don has been exploring
new frontiers

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.110
as an author, editor, and
adventurer for almost four

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.000
decades.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.530
He's also an acclaimed teacher,
speaker, and tour leader,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.320
visiting more than 90
countries on six continents.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320
Don has published
hundreds of articles

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.030
in dozens of magazines and
newspapers around the world.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.950
He's been travel editor at
the "San Francisco Chronicle,"

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.720
and global travel editor
for Lonely Planet.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.980
He's the author of "Lonely
Planet's Guide to Travel

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.010
Writing," the bestselling travel
writing guide on the planet.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.160
Don currently is editor at
large for "National Geographic

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.870
Traveler," special features
editor for BBC Travel,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.650
and editor of Geographic
Expeditions' literary travel

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.000
blog.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.080
He has received dozens of awards
for his writing and editing,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.050
including 10 Lowell Thomas
awards from the Society

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.930
of American Travel Writers.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.960
He consults globally in
travel and social media

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.620
and hosts a national series
of onstage conversations

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.150
with other prominent
travel writers.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.820
Don's newest book, "The
Way of Wanderlust-- The

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.710
Best Travel Writing
of Don George,"

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.930
spans 24 countries
on six continents,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.250
beginning with the 1977 tale
of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.210
and ending with the 2015
story about exploring

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.790
the jungles of Cambodia,
my personal favorite story.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.740
It is a must read for
any traveler lover

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.520
and truly dives deep into
the heart, mind, and soul

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.009
of the global wanderer.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430
Without further ado,
I'm extremely honored

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.530
to introduce Mr. Don
George to all of you.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.217
Please give him a warm welcome.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:18.193
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:25.439
DON GEORGE: Thank you, Laura.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.105
Hello, everyone.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.470
Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.400
I was hoping maybe five
people would show up,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.840
so I'm kind of blown away right
now to see a room full of you.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.900
Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840
I want to begin
by thanking Laura

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.230
very deeply for inviting
me to speak here

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.780
and for coordinating this
event and for spreading

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.220
the word so wonderfully.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.960
I want to thank
Google for having

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.500
me here and for putting on
this great series of talks--

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.090
what a wonderful thing to do.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.230
It's really a great honor
and pleasure to be here today

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.030
and to talk to you all.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.550
I'm going to share
my love of travel

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.590
and hopefully hear about
your love of travel

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.630
and try to give you
some good information

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.050
and some inspiration
too, I hope.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.770
I wanted to thank Google
for everything that it does.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.690
I want to thank you
for the great products

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.130
that you create,
which I use every day,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.690
which everyone I
know uses every day

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.960
and pretty much everyone
around the planet, I think,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.130
almost uses every day.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.480
And truly, you
have done something

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.430
to bring the world
closer together, which is

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.677
what I think travel does too.

00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:44.760
But in your own way, you're
all bringing the world

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.350
closer together, and I
really appreciate that.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.963
And the world, I think,
appreciates that, so thank you.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.796
On behalf of the world,
thank you very much.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.970
I've been extremely
fortunate to spend

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.660
my entire professional
life doing

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.230
two things I love the most,
traveling and writing.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.300
And as Laura mentioned, I
recently published this book.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.110
It's a kind of
culmination of my career

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.020
to date, "The Way
of Wanderlust--

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.570
The Best Travel
Writing of Don George."

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.810
It brings together 35 of
my best stories and essays

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.594
from 40 years of world wandering
and 38 years of publishing.

00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:29.010
So what I thought
I would do today

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.600
is talk briefly about my
career as a travel writer

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.870
and the book itself.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.390
I thought I'd read a couple
of pieces from the book,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.510
just to give you a little tiny
sense of what the book is all

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.940
about.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.590
And then I thought I would just
open the floor to questions.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.380
So I hope that you've come
prepared with questions,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.550
because I really love
interacting with an audience.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.330
I love hearing why you're
here, or what questions you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.850
brought with you here.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.560
And I think that
that often produces

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.800
the best stories and the
best interactions of all.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.530
So I'll tell you a
little bit about my life

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.730
as a travel writer, and
we'll go from there.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.450
I didn't start out to
be a travel writer.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.340
I wanted to be a poet, which
is a pretty practical goal.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.300
Poets make a really good
living, I understand.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.720
My parents were thrilled when I
announced that to them one day.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.010
So in high school and
college-- in college

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.660
I studied French, English,
and American literature,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.580
and then I minored
in creative writing.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.250
And I would tell people
I wanted to be a poet.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.100
I thought probably a
more practical route

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.270
was that I would be a
professor, the tweedy professor,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.934
the kind of professor that I had
grown up with as role models.

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.350
Because when you're a student,
those are your role models,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.570
your tweedy professors.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.570
So I thought that's what
I would do with my life.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.820
But I went to Princeton
on the east coast.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.910
And in the spring term
of my senior year,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.810
I just realized I
didn't know what

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.180
I wanted to do with my life.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.840
I had no idea, and
I really just wanted

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.510
to postpone the decision
as long as I could.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.305
So while my friends
were applying

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:10.680
to medical school and graduate
school and business school

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.890
and getting jobs
at banks and having

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.900
all kinds of
practical career paths

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.220
they were laying the pavement
for, I didn't know what to do.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.090
And I ended up applying to the
Princeton French department

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.200
for a summer work
abroad fellowship, which

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.410
I got to live in Paris, and I
worked as a translator in Paris

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.780
for the summer.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.650
And then I applied
to the Athens college

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.690
in Athens, Greece for a one
year Athens college teaching

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.770
fellowship.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.920
And I won that, somehow.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.930
And so my year after graduation,
I went to Paris first

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.072
and then I went to Athens,
and I spent a year abroad.

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:50.530
And that's when
everything changed.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.420
And I thought I would read a
little bit, just a little bit

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.340
from the introduction
to my book about how

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.030
things changed for me.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.350
"I took my first
serendipitous step

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.120
on the path to becoming
a travel writer

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.832
the summer after I
graduated from Princeton.

00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:06.290
While all my friends
were preparing

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.420
for graduate school, law
school, business school,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.430
or medical school, or
starting jobs with banks,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.890
I arranged to go to
Europe for a year,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.560
first to spend the summer
in Paris on a summer work

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.010
abroad internship and then to
teach in Greece on an Athens

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.090
college teaching fellowship.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.000
When I set off for
Europe, I was thinking

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.920
that year would be
a brief interlude

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.240
between undergraduate
and graduate schools.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.810
But then one sun-dappled
June morning in Paris,

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.700
the course of my life changed.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.890
As I had every morning for
the previous two weeks,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.200
I took the rickety old filigreed
elevator from my apartment

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.490
right on the Rue of Rivoli,
looking onto the Jardin de

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:55.790
Tuileries and stepped into the
street, into a sea of French.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.070
Everyone around me
was speaking French,

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.730
wearing French, looking French,
acting French, shrugging

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.300
their shoulders and
twirling their scarves

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.660
and drinking their cafe creme,
calling out, Bonjour, Monsieur

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.700
Don, and paying for "Le Monds"
or "Le Nouvel Observeteur"

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.280
francs, and stepping
importantly around me

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.340
and staring straight
into my eyes

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.790
and suddenly smiling in a
way that only the French do.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.260
Until that time, I had spent
most of my life in classrooms.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.429
And I was planning after
that European detour

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:38.340
to spend most of the rest
of my life in classrooms.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.350
Suddenly, it struck me.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.920
This was the classroom.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.150
Not the musty, shadowed,
ivy-draped buildings

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.810
in which I had spent
the previous four years.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.870
This world of wide boulevards
and centuries-old buildings

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.140
and six-table sawdust
restaurants and glasses

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.110
of vin ordinaire and fire eaters
on street corners and poetry

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.030
readings and cramped
second-floor bookshops

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.230
and mysterious women who smiled
at me so that my heart leaped.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.270
And I walked for hours
restless under the plane trees

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.240
by the Seine.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.630
This was the classroom.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.980
Hungry in a way I'd never been
before, I gorged on Paris.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.740
I marveled at Moliere
at the Comedie-Francaise

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.410
and the Ballet
Bejart in the park.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.610
I idled among the
secondhand shelves

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.150
at Shakespeare and
Company, eavesdropping

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.480
on poets and poseurs.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.570
I immerse myself
in Manet and Monet

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.140
and the Musee d'Orsay, got
lost in the ancient alleys

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.640
of Montmarche and the Mare,
savored the open-air theater

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.880
from a sidewalk seat
on the Champs d'Elysee

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.610
and conjured Hemingway
on Rue Descartes

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.774
and in Les Deux Magots cafe.

00:09:53.774 --> 00:09:55.940
At the end of that summer,
I rode the Orient Express

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.870
to Greece and settled on the
campus of Athens College.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.250
As it turned out,
my fellowship duties

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.605
were to teach five hours of
literature and writing classes

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.800
a week.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.100
I also had to write occasional
speeches for the college

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.080
president and write and edit
articles for the school's

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.920
quarterly alumni magazine.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.540
This left me uncharted
expanses of free time, which

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.380
I exuberantly filled reading
Plato by the Parthenon,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.160
sipping ouzo on
bazouki-brightened nights

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.130
in the Plaka, communing with
muses among the red poppies

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.080
and wide columns of Corinth, and
exploring the beaches of Rhodes

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.420
and the ruins of Crete.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.370
Winter and spring vacations
afforded the time to venture

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.970
even farther, and I
wandered footloose

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.550
through Italy,
Turkey, and Egypt,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.430
intoxicated with the newness and
possibility of this unfurling

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.770
world.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.960
My wanderlust bloomed.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.440
Every moment seemed unbearably
precious, every outing

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.590
an exhilarating lesson
in a new culture, place,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.100
and people, full of
thrilling sights and smells,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.860
tastes, and textures, creations
and traditions, encounters

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.260
and connections--
a whole new world.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.200
That year changed my life.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.210
And as the end of
the Athens school

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.590
approached and the question
of what to do with my life

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.310
loomed again, I
found the courage

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.150
to relinquish the student
hand me down desire

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.540
to become a tweedy
professor and chose instead

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.870
the uncharted path
of becoming a writer.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.740
I had no idea where
that path would lead.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.440
I just knew that I wanted to
walk it, wild and wide-eyed,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.000
daring to dream."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.970
That's how I became
a travel writer.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.600
That's the beginning of how
I became a travel writer.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.110
I got a master's degree
in creative writing.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.860
Still didn't know what
to do with my life.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.210
I won a two-year
fellowship from Princeton,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.150
a Princeton in Asia fellowship
to go teach in Japan

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.660
at a school called International
Christian University, which

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.684
had bilingual, lots of
English language classes.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.600
That's where I'm at my
wonderful wife, Kuniko,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.220
who's in the audience, and
who changed my life again.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.190
And I fell in love
with Japan and started

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.580
to write some travel stories.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.870
And when I came back at
the end of that fellowship,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.490
I came back to
the United States,

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.010
decided to settle
in San Francisco,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.760
because I'd never thought about
living in San Francisco before,

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.300
but it seems like a congenial
and cosmopolitan place.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.230
And I got here and through
a very incredible series

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.090
of serendipities that would
require a couple of bottles

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.530
of wine for me to really
adequately tell you about,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.050
I ended up getting a job as
a travel writer for the "San

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.140
Francisco Examiner," the
"Examiner" and "Chronicle."

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.590
And I did that for a year, and
that really changed my life.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.850
I never changed
course after that.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.200
I became a travel writer.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.950
That was in 1980, and I've been
a travel writer and editor ever

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.640
since then.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.630
I was at the Examiner
Chronicle for 15 years.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.150
From there, I moved to a startup
at that time called salon.com.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.060
Do you all know Salon?

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.200
Yep, a startup.

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:23.130
I was the wanderlust
editor for Salon.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.210
I started the Wanderlust
Travel Site on Salon.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.920
And that was a really heady,
wonderful, exhilarating time

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.880
when-- you may be
familiar with this notion,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.670
but we were writing
the rules, basically.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.190
It was the Wild West
of internet publishing.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.340
And we were one of the
first people there,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.580
and we were making it
up as we went along.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.530
And it was really, really fun.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.230
I left Salon after
six years and I

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.720
went to work with
my good friends

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.640
Tony and Maureen Wheeler
at Lonely Planet.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.070
Does anybody know Lonely Planet?

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.320
Amazing, wonderful guidebooks.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.370
They asked me to become the
global travel editor there.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.210
I wrote a column
for their website.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.770
I edited one
literary book a year.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:10.100
I helped oversee the editorial
direction of Lonely Planet.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.030
And for better or for worse,
I was the public spokesperson

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.920
for Lonely Planet.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.920
I was the face of Lonely
Planet for about seven years.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.755
And it was wonderful.

00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:23.450
It was a really magical ride
with a great company that

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.330
believes strongly in
the power of travel,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.050
the transformational
power of travel

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.500
and why we all should
get out and see the world

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.970
and share ourselves
with the world.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.290
So I was absolutely in
tune with that message

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.050
and loved that job.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.870
In 2007, I decided
to spread my wings

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.990
and try life as a freelancer.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.010
And I immediately went to
work both for Geographic

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.880
Expeditions, editing their
wonderful website and blog.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.840
And I brought some catalogs
from Geographic Expeditions

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.930
around the table there.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.690
They're a really fantastic
adventure travel company

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.710
that travels all
around the world

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.190
and does it with great
heart and great soul

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.980
and great consciousness.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.860
They do a great job.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.500
So I'm very happy to be
affiliated with them.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.230
And then I also went to work
with "National Geographic

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.340
Traveler" as an editor at large.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.090
I write a column
for their magazine

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.400
and I write a column
for their website.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.800
And I love being affiliated
with "National Geographic."

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.240
It's one of the world's
great institutions.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.390
Wherever I go, the
farthest-flung corner

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.150
of the world, when
I see someone and I

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.900
say I write for the
"National Geographic,"

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.440
they say, oh my God, I
love "National Geographic."

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.660
We have a stack like
that in our garage.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.070
There's a lot of stacks of
"National Geographic"s all

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.278
around the world, apparently.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.640
So I'm really
honored and thrilled

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.510
to work with those
two organizations.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.350
And now I also work
with BBC Travel,

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.250
another fantastic global
brand and organization.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.270
So I feel incredibly blessed.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.240
I've been able to write and
travel, do the work that I

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.840
love, see the world that I
love, share me with the world.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.460
And it's just been a really
incredibly special journey,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.420
and it's still going.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.620
So I thought I would be
just a couple of pieces,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.010
short pieces from my book.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.290
The book was a long time coming.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.180
It was 40 years
coming, actually.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.039
But it took me still about five
years of even intensely working

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:25.330
on the book to put it together.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.690
I had about 700
articles to choose from.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.720
And so there was a
lot of reading to do

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.030
and a lot of condensing to do.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.410
And I ended up choosing the
articles that, to my mind,

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.724
reproduced two journeys.

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:38.640
There's always a journey
into the outer world,

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.090
but then in the
best travel stories

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.006
I think there's a journey
into the inner world

00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:42.740
at the same time.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.160
You talk about how a
place is affecting you.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.410
And there's this kind
of back and forth.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.160
So it's the record of two
contemporaneous journeys,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.420
outside and inside.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.650
And the stories in this
book try to do that.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.810
Some of the stories
are very short--

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.800
750 words, the kind
of column length

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.740
that I've been
writing all my life.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.645
The longest piece in
the book is 9,000 words.

00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:08.099
The Cambodia story that
Laura kindly mentioned

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.300
is 7,000 words.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.650
So there's a long-- there's
quite a wide spectrum there,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.837
from about 500 words
to 9,000 words.

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:17.420
I like to think that
it's a great book

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.040
to take on the
road-- easy to read,

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.920
easy to read in an airplane,
quick chapters that

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.531
go by easily, slide
down easily, I hope.

00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.530
I'm just going to read a
couple of those pieces.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.580
So the first one I'm going
to read is called "Ryoan-ji

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.400
Reflections."

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.320
And it's about the Ryoan-ji
Rock Garden in Kyoto, Japan.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.070
Has anybody been
there, by any chance?

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.171
OK, great.

00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:47.670
Great.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.190
And this was written
for a magazine

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.879
that I edited when I was
at the "Chronicle" that

00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:57.170
was published four times a
year called "Great Escapes."

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.070
And every issue of "Great
Escapes" had a different theme.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.910
The theme of this one
was sacred places.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.030
So I begin in this essay
talking a little bit

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.970
about other sacred
places, and then I

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.460
get to Ryoan-ji Excuse me.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.520
So this is "Ryoan-ji
Reflections."

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.340
"When I think of the sacred
places I have encountered

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.490
in my own travels, I recall
the Temple of Poseidon

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.740
on the cliff of Cape
[? Sunion ?] in Greece, where

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.650
I spent a wild night
huddled in my sleeping

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.560
bag among the moonlit
columns, surrounded

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.260
by tearing wind, the
crashing of waves,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.710
and ghostly, godly dreams.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.500
I think too of Bali, of the
lush, lovingly sculpted land

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.120
and the gentle people,
more profoundly imbued

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.020
with a sense of sanctity
of life as a holy gift

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.800
to be celebrated than
any other I have met.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.700
But most vividly of all, I
think of a simple plot of sand

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.010
and rocks and moss in
Kyoto-- the rock garden

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.650
at Ryoan-ji Temple.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.360
The guidebooks will tell you
that the rock garden was built

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.820
in the 15th century, probably
by a renowned Zen-influenced

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.580
artist named
[? Soami, ?] and that it

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.580
is considered a masterpiece of
the karesansui dry landscape

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.900
garden style.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.920
It consists of 15 irregularly
shaped rocks of varying sizes,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.675
some surrounded by moss,
arranged in a bed of white sand

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:40.210
that is raked every day.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.740
A low earthen wall surrounds
the garden on three sides,

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.790
overhung by a narrow
beamed wooden roof.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.790
On the fourth side,
wooden steps lead

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.620
to a wide wooden platform and
the main building of the temple

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.520
itself.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.740
Beyond the wall are cedar,
pine, and cherry trees.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.440
Such a description gives a
sense of the history and look

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.330
of the place, but to understand
its power, its pure presence,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.860
you have to go there.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.640
The first time I
visited Ryoan-ji,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.750
I was overwhelmed, first by
the spareness of the site

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:23.180
and second by loudspeakers that
every 15 minutes squawked out

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.430
a recorded message about
the history and spirit

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.490
of the garden to the busloads
of obedient schoolchildren

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.740
and tourists who filed through.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.650
But something held me there.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.160
Morning passed to
afternoon, and still I

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.180
sat on the well-worn
platform, staring.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.610
Kids in black caps, tiny
book-filled backpacks,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.500
and black and white
school uniforms

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.450
passed by, studying me
while I studied the garden.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.420
And adults in shiny
cameras in kimonos

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.180
clicked and clucked
and walked on.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.260
Clouds came and went,
and the branches

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.750
beyond the garden bent,
straightened again, bent again.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.780
I saw how the pebbly sand
had been meticulously raked

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.320
in circles around the
rocks and in straight lines

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.120
in the open areas, and
how those lines stopped

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.270
without a misplaced
pebble when they

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.460
touched the circular
patterns and then resumed

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.160
unchanged beyond them.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.600
I saw how pockets of moss had
filled the pocks in the stones

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.690
and how the sand echoed
the sky, the moss echoed

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.360
the trees, the wall and
roof balanced the platform,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.410
and the rocks seemed
to emanate a web

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.590
of intricate, tranquil
tension within the whole.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.420
It was an exquisite enigma,
telling me something

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.780
I couldn't put words to.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.380
And so it has remained.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.450
I've seen Ryoan-ji in spring
when the cherry trees bloomed,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.700
and in fall when their
branches were bare,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.360
in winter, when snow
covered the moss,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.650
and in summer when the cicadas
buzzed beyond the wall.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.850
I've been there among
giggling teenagers

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.410
and gaping farmers, bemused
Westerners, and beatific monks.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.880
By now, it has
become a part of me.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.980
And still, it eludes me.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.460
I love the place partly because
it is so emphatically not

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.930
a 10-minute tourist stop.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.070
Its dimensions defy the camera.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.130
I've never seen a true
picture of the place.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.610
And its subtle simplicity
defies quick assimilation.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.090
It makes you sit and
study, slow down,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:52.550
and stare until you really
see it in its particularity

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:57.020
and in its whole,
simultaneously.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.080
And yet, and here
the enigma expands.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.080
You cannot see all of
Ryoan-ji at one time.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.560
The rocks are so arranged
that you can see only 14

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.330
of the stones
wherever you stand.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:19.030
You have to visualize,
imagine the final one.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.280
How wonderful.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.800
It is in this
sense that Ryoan-ji

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.280
is for me the
essential sacred place.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.200
It is complete in itself.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.370
But for you to
completely perceive it,

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.050
you have to transcend
the boundary

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.220
between inner and
outer, to travel

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.840
inward as well as outward,
to find and finish it

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.810
in your mind.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.260
And the gigglers, the camera
clickers, and the squawking

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.460
loudspeakers are all, in
their exasperating reality,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.560
part of this completion.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.860
Beyond a great irony
of modern Japan,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:08.020
loudspeakers instructing you
to appreciate the silence.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.080
They embody a much
larger meaning.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.700
You must embrace them all--
the monks and the moss

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.550
and the trees, the
schoolkids and the stones,

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.100
to really be there, to be whole.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.600
Thanks.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.266
That's Ryoan-ji.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.150
So I hope that transported
you for a moment to Japan.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.240
I'm going to read one other
story, one other little essay,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.780
and then I'll just ask you
to tell me your questions

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.520
and we'll talk.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.590
But I wanted to share this one.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.285
It's about Stinson Beach Do
you all know Stinson Beach?

00:24:50.285 --> 00:24:53.210
It's a special place,
and it's a place

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.270
I go back to all the time,
as you'll hear in this.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.290
So this is called "A
Pilgrim at Stinson Beach."

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:06.630
"July 20, 2011, 11:30 AM.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.050
I'm sitting at the southern
tip of Stinson Beach,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.970
a glorious mile-long
stretch of sand that

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.540
borders the unincorporated,
population 650

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:21.160
hamlet of the same name in Marin
County, northern California.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.790
Stinson Beach is a ragged,
flip-flops, bikinis and board

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.660
shorts kind of town.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.130
And whether you're a Bay
Area visitor or resident,

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.830
it's a terrific place to stop.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.690
A couple of inviting
restaurants face each other

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.180
across the sole street,
famed Highway 1, that

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.990
runs through town.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.190
Both have sun-umbrelled
patios that

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:48.280
are intonations of heaven on a
balmy, blue sky day like today.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.440
There are arts and
crafts galleries,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.730
a quintessential little bit
of everything market, B&amp;Bs,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.210
and a beguiling bookstore
with a compact, ecumenical,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.060
and eminently
Marin mix of books,

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.520
ranging from Zen treatises
and Native American history

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.220
and culture to mainstream
mysteries and fiction

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.370
and a proud selection of
work by local authors.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:18.300
I love these riches, but
they're not why I come here.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.660
Stinson Beach is about an hour's
winding drive from my house,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.660
so it's not exactly an
on-a-whim destination for me.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:31.080
Rather, it's a touchstone place
where I come together myself.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.030
And today, I need gathering.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.710
So here I am,
ensconced on a rock

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.310
beyond an outcrop
of massive boulders

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.360
that separates this thin slice
of sand from the main beach,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.920
where a couple hundred people
are blissfully surfing,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.390
strolling, and sunbathing.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.000
I've been in this
spot for 20 minutes

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.160
and I haven't seen anyone,
except the teenage couple who

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.030
appeared holding hands,
literally just as I wrote--

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:05.290
I haven't seen anyone-- and
jumped when they saw me,

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.860
and now have
abruptly turned back.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.470
And I like it that way.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.900
In the 1980s and '90s when I
was the travel editor at the San

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.220
Francisco newspaper, I used
to make a pilgrimage here

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.940
every spring to write a column.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.280
This was the place where
I gathered my thoughts,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.870
looked back on the triumphs and
failures of the year passed,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.680
and ahead to the New
Year's goals and dreams.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.430
It's still a good place
to take stock of things.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.940
The simplicity of
the scene strips away

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:44.360
the veneers of life, reduces
the distracting complexities.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:51.080
Sea, rocks, sand,
sun-- that's it.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.260
This spareness helps me, makes
me slow down and pay attention.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.820
The roar and swash of the
waves echo in my ears.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.760
The salty sea smell
fills my nose.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.140
The sun warms like a hot
compress on my shoulders.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.210
My toes wiggle into
the wet, cool sand.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.470
The water white
froths in, spreads

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.960
into rippling fans
over the sand,

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.350
then rushes back
again and again.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.950
A seagull web-walks through
the waves, leaps onto a rock,

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.040
scans the water for food.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.070
It prances with oddly brittle
legs along the sand, flaps

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:36.580
to the top of a rock, and
imperiously surveys the waves.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.420
A slick, six-foot seaweed
pod washes onto the beach.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.790
A tiny insect scurries
over my keyboard.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:48.330
A neon green bug lands
briefly on my screen.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.270
I let the sea wash over me,
let the waves fill my head

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:59.060
and lungs, lose myself to this
inconceivably old and ageless

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.880
place.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.520
I think, this is the same scene
I witnessed two decades ago,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.740
quite possibly the
same rock I sat

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.380
on then, scribbling in my
journal as I tap into my laptop

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.740
now.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.680
And if I come back in 20
years, it will almost certainly

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.400
be the same still.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.390
But of course, much has
changed in those two decades.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.050
My children have
grown up and moved on.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.020
My dad and other loved
ones have passed away.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:36.420
New jobs, new places,
new books, old dreams.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.850
And suddenly, these
words flow into my brain.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.230
Where does it all come together?

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.810
What does it mean?

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.990
The sea swashing ceaselessly
scrubs the mind clean.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.870
I palm the rough, sandy surface
of the boulder to my left,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.890
warmed by the sun, cradling sand
in its pocks in green ridges

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:02.100
of moss in its cracks, etched
by wind, wave, and rain.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.670
Wisps like smoke from a
seaborne fire drift around me.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.590
And on the horizon, a
bank of gray-blue fog

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.730
gathers, curling at
the top so that it

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.510
looks like a frozen tidal wave.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.360
I think of the
tsunami in Sendai,

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.530
where my daughter
traveled recently and saw

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.410
the destruction
with her own eyes,

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.170
with a local man who was guiding
her broke down and cried.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:33.520
All those uprooted lives--
where does it come together?

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.710
What does it mean?

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.320
The waves push collecting
pebbles onto the shore, fan,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.720
recede.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.920
The seagull flaps away
unsatisfied, searching.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.090
Life is precarious,
uncertain, brief.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.100
There is a precious
precariousness

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.110
at the heart of all things.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.900
The sea swashing ceaselessly
scrubs the mind clean.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.920
The waves roar, splash in,
getting a little closer now.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.730
The tide is coming in.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:08.930
The blue pebble we inhabit is
turning in the celestial sea.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.620
Where does it come together?

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.910
What does it mean?

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.000
Focus.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.160
Enjoy the moment
while you have it.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.150
Enjoy your loved ones
while you have them.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.800
Recognize the gifts
the world gives you.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.280
Inhale the sea.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.390
Sink your toes into the sand.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.220
Let the ocean roar
silence your mind.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.540
Then take this simple
scene home with you--

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.660
sun, sand, rocks, sea.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.350
The sea swashing ceaselessly
scrubs the mind clean.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.890
What it all comes
down to, I think,

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:50.010
is the relationships you forge,
the experiences you embrace,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:54.930
the lessons you bestow,
the ideals you seed,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:59.870
the love you live and leave.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.230
Dedicate yourself to
creating something of value

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.760
with your days,
something that will last.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:13.460
The sea swashing ceaselessly
scrubs the mind clean.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.250
Where does it come together?

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.440
What does it mean?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:25.936
Sun, sand, rocks, sea--
a Stinson Beach clarity.

00:32:25.936 --> 00:32:27.430
Thanks.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:33.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.550
That's very kind.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.160
Thank you very, very much.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.870
So I'd love to open the
floor to your questions.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.820
How to become a travel
writer, the best

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.250
place to go in the world.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.600
AUDIENCE: So how do you balance
the actual writing process

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.970
with the traveling?

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.940
Do you write while
you're traveling?

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.710
How you stay in the moment
there and then come up

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.204
with these great
pieces at the end?

00:32:56.204 --> 00:32:57.120
DON GEORGE: Thank you.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.810
So it's an ongoing process.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.125
I take copious
notes on the road.

00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:05.050
I have a little notebook that
I carry it with me all the time

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.070
that-- I actually
have it right here.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.000
I literally carry it
with me all the time.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.676
It's this wonderful notebook.

00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:17.550
And in case I forget
what it is, it helpfully

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.490
says Notebook on the cover.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.770
So that's good.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.500
I got this in Japan
when I lived there,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.820
and I've loved them and
carried them ever since.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.197
This is number 14 that I'm on.

00:33:29.197 --> 00:33:30.780
So I carry these
with me, and I always

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.370
try to make time to sit
somewhere for an hour

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.560
and write about what's
happening around me.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.820
And then I also take notes.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.600
Frequently on the
road, I'll just

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.010
jot down little quick notes--
"blue poppies, gray field,"

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.670
something like that, just to
remind me where I've been.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.530
And I use my phone a lot.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.820
I'll talk into my
phone to record

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.830
my impressions of a place.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.870
And I use my camera
a lot, my phone.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.970
I use my phone a lot
again as my camera

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.709
to take photos so the limited
storage capacity of my brain

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:05.750
doesn't have to remember
what things looked like.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.090
I can do that with a photo.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.440
So I'm constantly
doing that on the road.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.199
And the other thing that I'm
doing on the road constantly

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.374
is trying to figure
out what the story is.

00:34:15.374 --> 00:34:18.040
I'm in a place and I'm thinking,
what am I going to write about?

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.000
What am I going to write about?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.340
What am I going to write about?

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.070
That voice becomes
annoying but essential.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.600
And I try my best
to embrace the place

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.150
and give myself
to it as fully as

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.300
possible and at the same
time to figure out what

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.540
the essence of the place is.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.780
What's the story for me?

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.810
What's the connection?

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.570
What's the passion point between
me and a place that might

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.580
develop into a bigger story?

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.830
And I just do that over
and over and over again.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.370
Been doing it for 40 years now.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.389
And one of these decades,
I'm going to get it down.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:52.489
And that turns out to be a
very fruitful coalescence

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.540
that I again can bring back
home and write the story.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.300
More in contemplative
reflection at home--

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.340
I really do the writing writing.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.480
But I have a lot of massive
body of notes to deal with

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.320
to help me with that.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.400
AUDIENCE: You been
to so many places,

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.390
and I wonder where
you going next,

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.486
and how do you
select those places?

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:14.230
DON GEORGE: Great question.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.320
Well, I'm literally
going next to Japan,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.620
which is not new to me,
but it's always new anyway.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.550
I'm actually going there
on March 26th with Kuniko.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.590
And we're going to
go to Kyoto and then

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.990
to the island of Shikoku,
where Kuniko is from.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.250
And it's partly pleasure
and partly work for me.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.450
I actually lead to
a small tour group

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.350
for Geographic Expeditions,
a group of eight people.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.240
So we're going to go
to Kyoto and Shikoku.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.010
I try to show them the wonders
of Japan through my eyes,

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.840
and they end up
showing me the wonders

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.740
of Japan through their
eyes, which is really nice.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.960
And so that's my next trip.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.800
How I decide where
to go is partly--

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.130
it's a mixture of the
outside world coming to me

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.880
and me going to
the outside world.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.210
A good example is I was invited
to go to the Melbourne Writer's

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.560
Festival.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.230
And I went there, and then the
Singapore Writer's Festival

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.090
invited me to go there,
so I went to Singapore.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.940
Or I knew I was going
to go to Singapore,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.340
and I realize that Singapore
was very close to Cambodia.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.310
And I'd always wanted
to go to Angkor Wat,

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.970
ever since I'd
been a child and I

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.860
think I'd seen a
photo of Angkor Wat

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.560
in "National Geographic,"
probably-- one of those stacks

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.970
in the garage.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.320
And I realized I could do that.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.040
From Singapore, it
was a quick flight,

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.870
so I made my quick flight.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.210
I did that myself,
and I ended up

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.130
writing about it for the BBC
Travel, a column that I edit.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.350
So Melbourne and
Singapore were invitations

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.960
from the outside world that
enticed me to go there.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.072
And I ended up writing some
things about that as well.

00:36:52.072 --> 00:36:53.780
And then the trip I
really wanted to make

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.310
was the one to Cambodia, which
I just put together myself

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.490
because it was so close.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.390
And I figured something magical
would happen in Cambodia,

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.180
and it definitely,
definitely did.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.392
And it was not what
I expected at all.

00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:06.850
And you can read
about in the book.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.640
It's the last story in the
book is my trip to Cambodia

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.920
and how incredibly
overwhelmed I was, and moved

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.801
beyond expression almost by
my encounters with the people

00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:18.300
there.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.960
And I got out into
the jungle, and there

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.220
was a temple in the jungle, and
I had my little Indiana Jones

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.370
moment.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.110
I was really, really a moving,
profoundly life-changing trip.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:34.250
So it's that kind of a balance
of the world coming to me

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.955
and me going out to
the world, I think.

00:37:35.955 --> 00:37:39.130
Did that answer the question?

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.870
Thank you.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.870
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering how can you

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.067
disconnect yourself or
connect to the places you

00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:48.150
travel when there's so
much technology around you?

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.899
Because when I travel,
it's so hard for me

00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:51.200
to stay away from your phone.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.949
I try to keep away
from it, but I'm always

00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:55.480
checking it for maybe
translations or directions.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.700
And then I check email.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.450
And it's just a disaster
every single time

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.340
I try to just let myself
go and enjoy the moment.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.030
DON GEORGE: Yes.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.483
You must work for a tech
company or something.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.910
Yeah, it's a huge distraction.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.710
It's really an incredibly
huge distraction.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.797
And so I make a very,
very conscious effort.

00:38:16.797 --> 00:38:19.380
It's the equivalent of, when I
was the spokesperson for Lonely

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.030
Planet, one of the
things I always

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.371
would say is that we at Lonely
Planet who publish guidebooks

00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.620
would like you to leave your
guidebook behind at least

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.910
one day of your journey
and go out and get lost.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.391
Because that's going to
show you a different place.

00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:33.890
We're happy that
with our guidebooks

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.410
we can help you
understand a place better,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.370
but you will understand
in a different way

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.290
if you leave your guidebook
in your hotel room

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.290
and go out and get lost.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.880
So please do that.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.190
And I feel the same way about
all the wonderful technology

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.500
that we have at our fingertips.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.350
I leave that in my hotel
room at least once, one day.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.600
And I just wander out and
get lost and immerse myself

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.290
in the place.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.960
And I tell myself that
I'm on assignment.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.820
And that sort of
liberates me from having

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:06.790
to update my Facebook or
answer email or tweets.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.960
I say, you know, you're here.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.750
Be here.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.350
Every time you post on
Facebook it's a bit of a-- it

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.630
takes you away for a
second from being here.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:21.130
And so I try to have moments,
protracted moments of time

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.460
when I'm without any
technology in my life at all,

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.890
except maybe my camera
and my phone as my camera.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.382
And so I immerse
myself in the place.

00:39:29.382 --> 00:39:31.090
And for me, that kind
of immersive travel

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.900
is really hugely important.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.800
Part of the wonder
of my Cambodia trip

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.890
was I spent a
homestay in a place

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.770
called Banteay Chmara
where there was no Wi-Fi.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.740
So when I first got there, I
said, and how's the Wi-Fi here?

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.630
And my host said,
there is no Wi-Fi here.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.790
Oh-- and I went, oh my
God, what am I going to do?

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.340
And then I thought,
that's wonderful.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.830
I have three days without Wi-Fi.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.020
I can just kind
of really be here.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.660
And it was.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.700
It was a great gift.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.800
And so I think you have to
give yourself that gift.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.950
And it is a gift.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.320
You get more out of
the place, I think,

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.186
when you're not
constantly thinking,

00:40:10.186 --> 00:40:12.810
how could I tweet about this or
how could I Facebook about this

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.650
or how could I send
an email about this.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.480
Sometimes it's good
to just be there--

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.800
be there, be there, be there.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.944
And I really strongly
recommend that.

00:40:21.944 --> 00:40:24.360
Because the technology's there,
and you'll always have it.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.120
But you'll only be in
Cambodia for a few days

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.430
or a few precious moments,
so make the most of it.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.026
Did that make
sense as an answer?

00:40:33.026 --> 00:40:35.650
So on your next trip I want you
to do that and send me an email

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.935
and let me know how it went.

00:40:38.935 --> 00:40:41.610
AUDIENCE: What advice would
you give her getting published,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.120
for someone just starting out?

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.710
There seems to be an overload
of information on where

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.710
to send things, who to--

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.980
DON GEORGE: Yeah.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.580
There is an overload
of information.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.260
I would be remiss
if I didn't mention

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.657
my book, "Lonely Planet's
Guide to Travel Writing."

00:40:56.657 --> 00:40:58.740
It's a book about how to
be a travel writer, so it

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.850
has a lot of information,
I hope good information,

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.220
about how to get published.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.790
But I think, as
you know, there's

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.147
the self-publishing route.

00:41:07.147 --> 00:41:07.980
You can have a blog.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.860
You can have your own website.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.340
You can publish
yourself that way.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.800
And that's great
and fine, and you

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.990
can grow a presence
and a platform

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.050
and reach people that way.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.800
The more traditional,
conventional route

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.500
is getting published
in newspapers

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.910
and magazines and websites.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:25.450
And I think the secret to doing
that is to target one or two

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.510
or three places that you really,
really want to appear in,

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.470
and just get to know
them intimately.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.480
So what I say in my
book is, you should

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.130
become the editor of the place
that you want to get published.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.588
In your head, you
should understand

00:41:37.588 --> 00:41:41.230
exactly why each story is there,
what its role in the picture

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.150
puzzle.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.670
Every editor has a picture
puzzle of their publication

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.360
in their brain.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.802
And if you can figure out
what that puzzle looks like

00:41:47.802 --> 00:41:50.010
and why that story's there
and why that story's there

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.680
and why that story's
there, then you

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.730
can come up with a story that
fits that picture puzzle.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.350
And then you could write a query
letter to the editor saying,

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.310
I have this great story about
Portugal that I want to do,

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.470
and it's about a homestay.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.887
And I've noticed you
enjoy publishing stories

00:42:04.887 --> 00:42:06.970
on homestays, and I think
this would fit perfectly

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.910
with your editorial mission.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.550
And that's the way
to do it, basically.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.090
Become the editor
of the publication

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.930
you want to get
into, figure out how

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.320
your story fits into
that picture puzzle,

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.700
and then send it off.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.160
The other way that
I should say too

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.743
is if you want to
write for magazines,

00:42:22.743 --> 00:42:25.990
the tried and true
route is to write

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.880
little tiny, 200-word
pieces that are

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.120
in the front of the magazine.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.390
That's what most people do--
the hot new hotel just opened

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.510
in San Francisco, and you do
four or five or six of those

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.722
and you develop a
rapport with an editor.

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.680
And then the editor says,
why don't you send me

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.570
a pitch for a larger story?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.389
We'd like to move you into the
middle of the magazine now.

00:42:45.389 --> 00:42:46.555
So that's another great way.

00:42:46.555 --> 00:42:48.471
And I know a number of
writers who started out

00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:51.110
that way, writing those
250-word little stories

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.946
and they develop
that relationship,

00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:55.570
and then suddenly they're in the
middle of the magazine writing

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.944
long stories.

00:42:57.944 --> 00:42:58.610
I hope it works.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.430
AUDIENCE: My
question is, as we've

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.610
seen a lot of political
and economic shifts

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.570
in the world over
the last few decades,

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.180
and you being a travel writer,
having doing this for 40 years

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:14.680
or so, have those
shifts affected

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.240
the way you observe a
place when you go there

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.985
or your writings in any way?

00:43:19.985 --> 00:43:21.990
DON GEORGE: Yes,
that's a big question.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:26.550
It's a great
question-- definitely.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.240
All those shifts really
affect me as a human being,

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.220
as a traveler.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.632
Some places that I went 40
years ago, you can't go to now.

00:43:34.632 --> 00:43:36.590
Other places that you
couldn't go 40 years ago,

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.570
you can go to now.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.890
I find myself in a
place like Dubrovnic.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.507
When I was in Dubrovnic--
the siege of Dubrovnic

00:43:45.507 --> 00:43:47.340
had just happened a
couple of years earlier.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:53.660
And so you could literally see
the damage done by the bombs

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.780
all around you.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.470
And I remember walking along the
walls that go around Dubrovnic

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.470
and looking at a stretch
of rooftops, roof tiles.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.452
And there were fractured,
scattered roof tiles.

00:44:04.452 --> 00:44:06.910
And then right next to them,
there were the new roof tiles.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.860
And that seemed like
such a poignant metaphor

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.700
for me of what had
happened there,

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.140
both the destruction
and the rebuilding.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.240
And I realized that
I, as a tourist,

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.110
putting dollars into that or
putting money into that economy

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.220
was part of that new roof tile.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.410
I was part of the
reconstruction of the place.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.135
And I think that that's a
huge part of travel for me,

00:44:28.135 --> 00:44:31.140
is what we do to
the places we go to.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.950
We could do bad or
we can do great.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.450
And as a traveler
going to a place that's

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:39.300
just come out of a period of
divisive war, you do great.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.057
And I was happy in
Dubrovnic that I could

00:44:42.057 --> 00:44:43.140
be a part of that process.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.340
And again, Mostar
when I was there,

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.055
you could see the
traces of bullet holes

00:44:47.055 --> 00:44:47.930
in all the buildings.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.700
I went to the cemetery
and the cemetery

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.180
there all these
fresh plots, people

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.660
who died in the recent war.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.570
And I just thought, thank
God that I'm here now,

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.320
that I can bear witness to
the rebirth of this place,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.140
that I can help that
rebirth, and that I

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.700
can tell the world about,
it's safe to come here now.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.380
Please come.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.880
Bring your money with you.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.700
Help build this wonderful,
beautiful, cultural center

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.840
back into the great
place it used to be.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.550
So that world is
constantly changing.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.720
There's always challenges.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.740
There's places you can't
go and places you can go.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.639
And I find that
my message always

00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.930
is affected by whatever has
happened in the place where

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:24.860
I've just been.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.575
And Cambodia was
an amazing example.

00:45:26.575 --> 00:45:30.510
This terrible, tragic civil
war that they had with Pol Pot.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.660
And to see the hope
and resilience,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.490
to see the opening
children's eyes

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.320
was incredibly moving to me.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.030
They had these bright, piercing,
wonderfully bright eyes.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.490
And I just thought, there's
the future right there.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.530
And how extraordinary it is,
one, that the adults around me

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:51.030
survived what they
survived and lived to tell.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.620
But how wonderful that the
children, the next generation,

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.640
are full of hope and
enthusiasm and energy

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.030
and they're going to make
the world a better place,

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.300
not just their country
a better place.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.883
They'll make the
world a better place.

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:04.780
And so my whole life has
been this wonderful kind

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.509
of interchange between
the world and me

00:46:06.509 --> 00:46:08.550
and what's going on
politically and economically.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.975
And travel makes such a huge,
profound difference in that

00:46:11.975 --> 00:46:15.780
and really, really helps make
the world a better place.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.660
And I think that as travelers,
we connect with people.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.470
We meet people.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.110
We understand that
there is no other.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.694
Before we go somewhere,
it's an other.

00:46:23.694 --> 00:46:25.484
And then we go there
and there is no other.

00:46:25.484 --> 00:46:26.180
They're like us.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.030
We're all the same.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.360
We're all in this
big boat together.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.140
And I think that travel, more
than anything else probably

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.990
paves the road for peace and
understanding and connection

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.760
among people.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.930
And that's why I've become a
travel evangelist, I feel like.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.840
This is my pulpit,
and I talk about,

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.950
get out there and travel,
because it changes

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.240
the world for the better.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.590
You become an agent
of great change.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.590
So that was a very long-winded
answer to your question,

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.780
but I hope that made sense.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.726
Thank you.

00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:55.860
AUDIENCE: When you
live in California,

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.410
it seems that everything
is recycled, organic,

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.800
and every other person is
either starting a charity

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.530
or supporting one passionately.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.970
But then you open up
the news or a newspaper

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.090
and you read about how
much we're consuming

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.640
and how bad everything
is, and everything

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.930
is being destroyed, basically.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.410
So with your years
of experience,

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.720
have you noticed
any kind of patterns

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:27.355
or what do you see when
you're out there, basically?

00:47:27.355 --> 00:47:28.910
DON GEORGE: That's
a great question.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:36.090
I think that the world
is-- evolution, I think,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.010
is workin- very, very,
very, very slowly.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:43.490
But the world is much more
conscious ecologically

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.930
now than it was 40 years
ago, when I started out.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.880
Still, there's such
a long way to go.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.390
But recycling has taken
root in places where there

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.990
was no recycling 40 years ago.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.840
The whole notion, for example,
of not using plastic bottles

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.180
has started to catch
on more and more.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.840
There's still such
a long way to go,

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.890
but people have stopped-- people
are more aware of not using

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.010
plastic as being a good thing.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:13.177
Environmental
stewardship-- not just

00:48:13.177 --> 00:48:15.760
leaving your trash behind when
you go out on a mountain trail,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.593
but making sure that
you pack out everything

00:48:17.593 --> 00:48:19.800
that you packed in.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.070
Those kinds of
principles and practices

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.990
are definitely spreading.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.990
And it's remarkably slow,
but it's still spreading

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.950
in the right direction.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.552
So I'm thrilled about that.

00:48:29.552 --> 00:48:31.010
On the other hand,
there are things

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.090
that are really sobering.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:34.220
We were talking earlier
about Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.860
I climbed Kilimanjaro in 1976.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.469
And there was still
a lot of snow.

00:48:39.469 --> 00:48:41.760
There was a really substantial
amount of snow up there.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.990
And recent photographs
that I've seen,

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.680
there's very little
snow left there.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.800
And that's sobering, scary.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.240
We're unleashing forces which we
know nothing about, basically,

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:53.740
I think.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.300
So that gives me a
certain amount of despair.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.280
But I counter that despair
by doing everything

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.300
that I can to make the
world a better place

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.090
and encouraging the people I
come into contact with to do

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.990
the same thing and to be
environmentally conscious

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:12.355
and do the right thing by the
planet and by the environment.

00:49:12.355 --> 00:49:15.550
And I do think that message
is definitely spreading.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:21.220
And it's easy to get
despairing, but I feel hopeful.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.890
In 40, years I feel the
planet's on the right track.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.259
Things are getting better and
better in a lot of places.

00:49:27.259 --> 00:49:28.800
People are more and
more enlightened.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.490
They're more and more
aware of the effect

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:31.910
that they have on the
world around them.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.200
And while there's an
extraordinarily long way to go,

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.207
at least we're in
the right direction.

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:38.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming today and sharing

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.220
your wonderful stories.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.010
I The first thing I want to say
is, I would argue that you did

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.020
become a poet
through your stories.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:45.770
They're wonderful.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.030
DON GEORGE: Thank you.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.571
AUDIENCE: Secondly,
I'd like to know,

00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:50.240
would you consider
returning to Google

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.610
and perhaps doing a brown
bag or workshop with us

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.730
and share some of the
awarenesses and knowledge

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.980
you've gained over your trips?

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.896
DON GEORGE: Thank you.

00:49:57.896 --> 00:49:58.469
I'm honored.

00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:00.010
If Google would like
me to come back,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.300
I would love to come back.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.529
I would totally
love to come back.

00:50:03.529 --> 00:50:08.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.550
That's wonderful.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:10.780
That's the best question yet.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.450
Well, I just want
to take a moment

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.800
to say thank you so very,
very much for being here

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.200
and for listening
so wonderfully,

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.970
attentively, and for allowing
me to share my stories with you.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.922
And if I can come back
and share some more,

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:26.880
I really would love to.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.930
But this has been a
great blessing for me,

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.260
so thank you very, very much.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.320
Appreciate it.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.270
[APPLAUSE]
