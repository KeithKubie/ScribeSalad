00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
We all want to lose fat and stay healthy.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.320
But with all these diet pills and plans, what does science have to say about weight loss tips?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.520
Let's get the obvious out of the way first. -Exercise-

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.820
Not only does the physical active exercise burn calories immediately

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.738
scientist recently found that it continues to burn fat while you sleep.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.740
During exercise your body uses up most of its available carbohydrates for energy and replaces them over the next 24 hours.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.740
In the mean time, it begins to break down your fat storage for basic functions such as walking, talking

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.200
and even sleeping. Don't skip meals. Especially breakfast.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.580
We've explained in our last video the science behind appetite.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.076
When you starve yourself, your body and brain create intense urges to eat high-calorie foods

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.676
as opposed to healthy options.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:45.436
Breakfast specifically  helps to keep blood sugar and hormone levels regular

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.821
and gives your metabolism a boost to burn more calories through the day.

00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:52.217
Adding more protein and low fat dairy to your diet helps as well.

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:58.378
Protein induces a large release of the chemical PYY, which goes to the brain and suppresses hunger signals.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:02.958
Simply adding 10% more protein to your food can keep you full much longer.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.500
Low fat dairy on the other hand contains calcium which binds to other fats you've eaten

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.200
and creates a soup like substance which can't be absorbed.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
Instead, your body excretes this soup and with it more  of the fat you've consumed.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.320
Speaking of soup, it's perhaps one of the best kept diet secrets.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.860
When you drink a glass of water with your meal, the fluid is easily absorbed before your food is digestid

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.340
which quickly brings down the stomach size making you feel hungry.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.780
Take that same meal and puree it in a blender and the fluids have a much harder time being absorbed quickly

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.720
this means your stomach stays expanded, making you feel full for longer.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.860
Count your calories. Studies show that people who actively document their food intake by using a journal

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.460
have drastic improvements over those who don't.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.700
Furthermore, knowing a coffee has 10 calories but a cappuccino has 100, gives you the opportunity

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.011
to structure your diet to eat more while taking less calories.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.288
And while it may seem trivial, reducing your plate size can drastically change your food intake.

00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:04.600
Studies show that a simple change from 12 to 10 inches can reduce the amount of food you eat by up to 22%.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.700
Our bodies have a hard time turning down food in front of us even when we're full.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.420
So the less food on your plate the better.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.440
Finally, sleep and stress play a large factor in how much we eat.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.333
Both sleep deprivation and stress levels increase appetite, making it harder to keep off the pounds.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.160
