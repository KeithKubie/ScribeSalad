00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:01.921
Voiceover:What I want to
do in this video is think

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.426
a little bit about what
numbers really represent.

00:00:05.426 --> 00:00:11.938
Let's say someone were to
write down the number 25.

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:14.177
So what does this really mean?

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:16.850
Well the five here, this
is in the one's place

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.570
so it literally represents five ones.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.538
And this two right over here, this is in

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:26.162
the 10's place, so let me write that down.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:29.088
That's the 10's place,
that's the one's place,

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.314
so this represents two 10s.

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:32.817
What do I mean by that?

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:35.186
Well another way to write this is this two

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:39.395
represents two 10s, just
let me write that down.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:50.734
This is equal to two 10s plus five ones.

00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:52.877
Now what are two 10s?

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.622
Well that's literally if
you can imagine a 10 being

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.431
a block of 10 things,
so you could imagine if

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:00.983
this was a 10 right over here.

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:04.794
Let me copy and paste this, so copy.

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:07.038
So this is going to be the same thing,

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:09.766
this is going to be
equal to, you have your

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:15.574
two 10s, so one 10 and two tens,

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.318
so you have your two 10s.

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.799
So that's your two 10s right over there,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.054
that really represents
20 plus your five ones.

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:28.070
Plus your five ones.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.942
Well if this is a one
right over here, and I'm

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:31.974
just representing it
as kind of one vertical

00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:34.695
bar, five ones are going to look like,

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:41.398
your going to have one,
two, I think you see

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:55.095
where this is going,
three, four, and five.

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:57.430
And so these are all different ways

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.151
of representing the same quantity.

00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:03.558
25 is two 10s and five ones.

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.878
This two is in the 10's place,

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:07.462
the five is in the one's place.

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:10.055
So two 10s plus five
ones, so you could then

00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:15.799
view it as two groups of 10 plus five ones

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.630
right over here.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.683
And what's this going
to be the same thing as?

00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:22.950
Well two groups of 10, this
is the same thing as 20

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.111
and this over here is equal to five.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:31.255
So once again, all ways to represent 25.

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:35.846
You can view this as two
10s plus five ones or

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:41.206
you can view this as 20,
let me write this down,

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:46.519
25 you could view because
this two is two 10s

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.730
that represents 20 plus the five ones.
