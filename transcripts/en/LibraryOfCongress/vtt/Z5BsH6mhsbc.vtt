00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:24.620
[ Music ]

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: So it is the
Asamblea de Artistas Revolucionarios

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:36.840 position:56%
de Oaxaca and they go by the acronym
ASARO and they sign as a collective

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.070
and this is partly as a way
to weigh the size of this.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.700
So, this is partly as a way
to be in solidarity together

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.060
but it is also a safety measure

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.450
because this group began during
the teacher uprisings in 2006.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.750
I am going to lay it down.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.050
It is a little difficult to--

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.100
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes,
you want to crumble it up.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
But they are very fresh

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.710
so these began during the uprisings
in 2006 and the artists signed

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.150
as a collective partly
as a safety measure

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.030
to keep some individual anonymity.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.330
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Oh that's right.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.790
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: But the
images are very powerful.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.490
They were meant to be
shown on the streets.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.880
They were meant to bring attention
to any number of different issues

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.180
that were important to the artists.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.130
So, artist's responses to an array

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.640
of different social
and political subjects.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.440
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And then,
so you are right this takes place

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.800
in Oaxaca and just like in the
other examples these are artists

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.690
that are saying something
to the public at large.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.290
And Oaxaca has a lot of art
recently that has been coming out.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.590
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Absolutely.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.600
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
I just meant some artists in,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.940
a great group of artists, the
Oaxaca, the Oaxacanos, in Seattle.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.730
There's a great group
of artists in Seattle

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.510 position:56%
and here we see doing a similar kind
of work but this is very different.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.180
And I am so glad to hear this.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.840 position:56%
And we are going to also perhaps
feature some of this work by ASARO--

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.140
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: ASARO

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.690
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
ASARO Asamblea

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.330
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Asamblea de
Artistas Revolucionarios de Oaxaca,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.270
so thankfully they're called
very concisely by ASARO.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.570
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: ASARO.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.800
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Can we talk a
little bit about the imagery here?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.100
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Sure
let's talk about the imagery.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.400
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: It is
really interesting in terms

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.190
of visual literacy because
it is a very poetic image.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.820
It is not a literal image.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.120
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.680
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: And you sort
of have to spend time with it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.830
and read it just the way you
would read a poem or a book.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's true.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.760
So, there's kind of like an
[foreign word] a close line,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.000
or it could be a rail,
or it could be a rainbow.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.300
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: I
thought a [foreign word].

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.610
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: A --

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.620
[ Foreign Language ]

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.180
Right. And there's the eyes and
there's a woman's face looking down

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.010
and she's very sad, serious,
troubled, solemn, in pain perhaps.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.600
And then there's a three
more [foreign word] hanging

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.820
and flowing in the wind or rain.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.490
And they are images of?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.790
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Angels.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.090
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Angels.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.390
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Three angels.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.690
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
there are two hands shooting

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.960
out of the earth or the darkness
and they are- What are they doing?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.560
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: It looks very,
it's an ambivalent image to me

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.840
because they look very vital
and they are reaching to the sky

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.160
but the figure is essentially
buried.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.250
And so you have all of these
clues that lead you to the idea

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.190
that this is maybe a
memorial or a mourning image.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.420
Although, there's, it's not titled.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.810 position:56%
It's not dated but we know it's from
around 2006 to 2009 so we know when

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.400
and where it was made and by whom.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.130
And we have these clues but you
can interpret it different ways.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.430
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.970
And even the buried
figure remains vital.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.280
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: And
the cacti and the mountains

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.890
and the rain also shooting stars,
you know, so lots of different --

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.650
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
the artwork is also vibrating.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.950
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Absolutely.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.680
It is really robust, this carving.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.920
Yes. I mean it is a
very classical image.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.800
We have images by Elizabeth Catlin
that are celebrating the laborer,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.470
the worker, the farmer, and the
title here they have given us some

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.620
from text you see very prominent
front and center dignidad --

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.920
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Dignidad.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.220
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Dignity.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.520
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Dignity.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.820
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
And then smaller--

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And smaller hidden figures

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.000
which say [foreign word].

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.300
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Yea.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.090
&gt;&gt; Struggle, fight
and what are those?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.390
Are those the corn?

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.690
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Maiz.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.360
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Maiz kind
of has a sense of being a grenade.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: It's true.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.380
They almost look like, yes
so it is a power image.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.800
They almost look like weapons.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.100
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Like weapons.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.560
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Yes, it's true.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.860
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yea.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.260
&gt;&gt; But every person can come
to these images and sort

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.630
of get something different
from them.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.770
And we know a little bit about, we
know a lot about the artist intent

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.750
but I love that almost
everything here, these are,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.820
sometimes they have documentary
elements or responding

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.760
to specific events in history and
time but they are poetic images.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.060
They are artist responses.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.360
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
They are poetic images

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.760
and they are beautiful.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.780
They take time to create and yet
they're looking out they want

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.600
to tell us something but
not necessarily for private.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.120
Who knows?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.430
Let's leave it open.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.730
Are they private?

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.030
Are they public?

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.330
Are they both--

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.630
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: These are
meant to be in the street.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.640
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: These
are meant to be in the streets.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.100
Now they are meant to be

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.570
out the streets again
throughout the United States.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.490
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
It belongs to every--

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.500
I mean we have been giving you
wonderful red carpet treatment

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.300
but this treatment is
available to anyone

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.600
who comes here as a researcher.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.430 position:56%
This collection belongs to everyone.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.990
It belongs to you, to you,
it belongs to everyone.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.550
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.680
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: You have been
creating new artwork and new poetry

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.000
on the spot, right
here, automatic drawing.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes, I have.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.600
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Responding.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes, I have.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.200
This one is called Give Power.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.500
And --

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.800
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
[Laughs] that was generous.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.100
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:[Laughs]
as a matter of fact,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.400
I think that was your line.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.700
Was that your line?

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.000
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: He asked me
to title it and of course I am

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.780
with a Poet Laureate of the
United States and I got nervous

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.730 position:56%
and I didn't want to provide a title
and I said you are giving me a lot

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.960
of power and so you are like that's
what we are going to call it.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.260
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.560
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Empowerment.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.860
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.650
We are not going to wait for to
write, we never wait to write.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.520
Always write right
there at the moment.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.020
If you wait to write,
something is going to happen.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.040
As a matter of fact,
write before you write.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.340
That's the idea.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:47.310
So it's called Give Power and since
today is an anniversary of 9/11--

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.040
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: That's right.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.520
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So here,
this a very, it's a drawing poem

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.520
and this is Give Power
and it is dedicated for

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.790
and then there is a
heart in a circle.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.910
So, I am going to leave
that with you.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.810
Perhaps it is dedicated
to love and to unity.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.630
And it has images like this.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:20.400 position:56%
So page one and two is la luna, la
vida and the last page is estrellas.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.230
The moon, life and the stars.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.950
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: And these
are reoccurring motifs for you?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.550
This is something you
carry with you, I think.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.920
&gt;&gt;Juan Felipe Herrera: I
think you got me on that.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.220
I think you got me on that.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.550
And then there is kind of a light
gray marker with a moon and kind

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.940
of like the sea anemone
and an energy ring

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.070
and some waves and
some Mayan numbers.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.370
And we made a book out of it.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.670
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Yes.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.970
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
We made a book out of it.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.270
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: On the spot.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: On the spot.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.870
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
You did it today.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Did it today.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.760
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Very quickly
and directly from your conscious

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.850
and subconscious emotions.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.140
It is wonderful and also poetry.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.870
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And we did some poems too

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.540
and I am just going
to show them to you.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.540
Here is a poem, it's called
Lantut [phonetic] 6 Green Method

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.150
and here's another one, it's
called Little Shoes on the Corner

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.900
and this has to do
with the prayer rug.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.200
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Right.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.630
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: It
has to do with a prayer rug.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.930
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Right.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.230
The Helen [inaudible] drawing.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.530
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.620
Little Shoes on the Corner, the
beta carpet, are you waiting,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:42.660 position:56%
fly with rebirth, prayer; for us all
come together, but how, two, two,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:49.880
two, two, two, two, two cultures,
banner, American, Arab how, how,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.980
how, how the buildings come back
up as we stand, color to color,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:03.000
Americas Middle East, together,
nontoxic, screen method.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.370
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: So beautiful.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.620
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
So we can do this anytime

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.340
and what else do we have?

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.260
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Let's
walk around the corner

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.900 position:56%
to Julia de Burgos [phonetic] is one
of the heroes in your recent book.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.000
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes, we
are going to walk around the corner

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.130
and to Julia de Burgos,
Puerto Rican poet,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.660
an amazing activist,
woman of her time.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.790
And we also have it in a multicolor
format done by, who is it--

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.090
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Antonio Martorell

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.390
from Puerto Rico and
printed in Ponce.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.690
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Antonio
Martorell from Puerto Rico?

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.670
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Brand
new acquisition, 2014.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.970
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: 2014?

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.680
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: This one is
2014 and it is again a combination

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.780
of digital and traditional
woodcut print making.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.590
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Digital,
traditional and then we have a lot

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.490
of material that we have
been just bringing out

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.860
and it is all available here.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.160
We have Octavio Rodrigues
[phonetic] with [foreign word].

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.480
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: [Foreign
word] series which relates

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.840
to your book of [foreign
word] poems.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.370
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's
right and that's Octavio Rodriguez

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.840
and then we have Yolanda
Lopez and she's talking

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.360
about farm work of women and--

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.840
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Woman's work is never done.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.320
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Woman's work is never done

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.700
with Alordes Worta [phonetic].

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.000
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Another hero.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Another hero

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.000
and then we have something
very magical.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.120
A Russian--

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.170
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Leanna Teescov
[phonetic] from Moscow and he,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.590
this is from a series that he
conceives of as a visual poem.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.910
It's called his private moon
series and you really --

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I like that.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.580
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Sort of
went deep into these images.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.960
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I like that
a lot because it is so dreamlike

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.540
and it is not, you know,
direct message piece.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.390 position:56%
It is something that you meditate
on and it is eerie and it is magical

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.450
and it is luminous and
it is multi layered

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.050
and with little poems
written on the side.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.730
Little poems written on the
side of a beautiful print

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.590
and all this material
is just so inspiring.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.130
And then we have this particular
artist that you mentioned to me--

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.490
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Robert Blackburn.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.790
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Robert Blackburn,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.060
another amazing silk screen artist.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.470
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: He is a
lithographer, color lithography

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.770
and that is what this is.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.640
This is called Girl in Red
and it is from 1950 and one

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.440
of the wonderful things is that
it was on exhibit at the Library

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.550
of Congress in our 1897
Historic Jefferson Building.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.550
We had national exhibitions
of prints for many years

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.280
and this work was hanging
at a Library of Congress

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.730
when it was fresh off
the press in 1950.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.040
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: In
1950, so see, that's beautiful.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.430
I am really inspired by that piece.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.730
It's beautiful.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.240
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: Well
he was another person,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.930
this Casa de Colores
idea was something

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.580
that he also took to heart.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.540
He grew up during, he grew up
in the WPA Harlem Arts Center,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.250
where he learned lithography first
as a very young, talented artist.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.000
And then he worked
at a master printer

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.340
at a legendary print making studio
called ULAE with Rauschenberg,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.080
Jasper, Johns, Frank and Faller.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's amazing.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.330
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: And he, in the
late 1940's, he made his own studio

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.490
which was open and his
concept was that it was open

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.380
to artists of all stripes.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.720
And also of different
levels of abilities

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.460
so you have master artists
working with artists who are coming

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.460
to print making for the first time.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.820
So, it was his own Casa de Colores,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.810
the print making workshop
in New York.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.110
You would have loved it.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.240
You would still love
it, it still existed.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.650
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I
would, I still love it and I am

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.010 position:56%
so glad you taught me all about him.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.440
And we also have Juan
Fuentes [foreign word] Chavez,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840
Juan Fuentes [inaudible]
Chavez, amazing print

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.630
and then we have [foreign
word] and Lydia Mendoza.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.220
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
You asked for music.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.540 position:56%
You asked for music, Tejano [assumed
spelling] music specifically, yea.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:13:00.090
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Tejana
music, pioneer from the 1920's,

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.050
Lydia Mendoza then
just kept on going.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:09.250 position:56%
And created so much great root music
or source music for the rest of us

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:15.500
that came along with guitars and
especially women song writers

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.940
and all the musical heritage that
we have for Latina's and Latino's

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.440
and of course, the public
at large, United States

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.280
and our truly American culture.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.890
Beautiful print by [foreign
name] and it is also here

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.380
in it's beautiful, radiant colors.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.580
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood: You are
making a really wonderful point,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.170
which is that all of
these connect to all

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.490
of the different artistic
languages so you can go

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.850
and listen to original music.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.430
You can go and listen
to poetry readings

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.110
by poets across time, you know.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.630
It goes on and on, this sort
of connections and layers.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.330
Thank you for bringing
your artists by

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.830
and your poets voice
to these materials.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.160
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.460
Thank you.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.760
Thank you, Katherine.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.060
This is really beautiful.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.360
I want to thank you
for inviting me over.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.660
