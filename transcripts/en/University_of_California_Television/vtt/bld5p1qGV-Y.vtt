00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
(wind howling)
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.387
(beeping)

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.460
(inspirational instrumental music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.510
- [Announcer] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.863
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.203 --> 00:01:17.620
(warm music)

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:24.406
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.180
- So as Alison mentioned,
we started talking

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.690
about imagination and in part
because I direct this center,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.600
the Arthur C. Clarke Center
for Human Imagination

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.670
here at UCSD where we're trying
to understand imagination

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.730
and then think about ways we
might more directly address

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.130
imagination as a phenomena.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.273
And so then this comes
around to thinking about,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.950
how might we think about imagination

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.920
and its role in human origins?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550
And I think we have
maybe at least two ways

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.490
to think about this that
we're going to be exploring

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.043
in today's program.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.790
So one is, what are the
dimensions of our imagination

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.050
that give rise to our humanity,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.600
and you know, these
particular characteristics

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.180
that allowed homo sapiens
to create our anthropic era.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.450
And another is the critical ways

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.980
in which our imagination creates knowledge

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.710
about things that are beyond
our ability to experience them.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.870
Whether it's about far off places

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.490
or far off time both in
the future and in the past.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.460
And so in particular, I'm very interested

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.860
and curious about how we
imagine something as distant

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.253
from our experience as
the origin of humanity.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.590
But it begs the question,
just what is imagination?

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.663
So imagination, it's kind of a mushy term.

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.810
It can mean so many things
that it might end up

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.070
meaning almost nothing.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.030
So is there a way we
can start to think about

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.160
how we approach understanding
the phenomena of imagination?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.020
So we might start by
looking at what smart people

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.960
have said about imagination.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.870
And so the kind of poster
child for a smart person

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.540
is Albert Einstein, right?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.560
And so Einstein said quite a few things

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.570
about imagination over his
career and just one of these is,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.840
imagination is more
important than knowledge.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.000
Knowledge is limited, but
imagination encircles the world.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.170
And so Einstein might have
been a pretty smart guy,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.970
but this actually says almost
nothing about imagination.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.310
It's very inspiring, but
the only think I really take

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.760
from this is that
imagination is extensive.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.270
So that's a characteristic
I can draw from it.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.750
So maybe someone who has a
little more stakes in the game

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.350
can give another kind of
shading of imagination

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.250
and Maria Montessori, an educator,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.360
so imagination is probably
a very important thing

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.930
for an educator to say something about.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.970
And for Montessori it was
imagination does not become great

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.910
until human beings, given
the courage and the strength,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.173
use it to create.

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:23.230
So she actually, that's kind
of, she's kind of coming down

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.520
a little negative on
imagination in this quote.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.020
You know, that creativity's
important to her,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.550
but imagination might be
a little bit frivolous.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.860
And Carl Sagan, you know,
another kind of smart person

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.180
gives us another kind
of even, maybe another

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.180
kind of warning about imagination.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.050
That it's gonna take us to
places, to worlds that never were

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.070
which sounds kinda scary, right?

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.890
But without it, we can't go anywhere.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.790
So he kind of redeems imagination.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.620
That well, in the end, we
probably actually need it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.660
even though we've kind
of, it's flown us off

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.943
to someplace that doesn't even exist.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.170
But I kinda start to turn to some things

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.320
that I think start to
shed a little more value

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.880
on imagination, and of course
the first one I pull up

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.030
is an artist, you know Mark Twain who says

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.580
that you can't depend on your eyes

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.280
when your imagination is out of focus.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.820
And now to me this start to
actually give us something

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.030
valuable to think about,
because it starts to connect

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.420
the imagination to our senses.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.510
And so there must be some relationship

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.650
between experience and imagination.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.660
And so I think Oliver Sacks

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.570
kind of puts a number of pieces together

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.140
that I think are really
critical to think about.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.360
That every act of
perception, is to some degree

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.010
an act of creation,
and every act of memory

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.220
is some degree an act of imagination.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.560
So we start to connect perception, memory,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.200
and imagination together
as interrelated phenomena

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.003
that are quite important.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.150
And so if we want to start to find,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.150
how might we think through
exploring that connection?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.230
And I think art is a really valuable place

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.980
to think about this.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.170
I think of art as this kind
of laboratory of imagination

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.050
for a number of reasons,
and one mentioned here

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.063
by the philosopher George Raymond.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.330
But art, for both how art is made,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.773
but equally as important
for how art is experienced.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.770
And so as an example we can start

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.110
by looking at this fresco
in the Church of St. Ignazio

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.010
in Rome and start to trace
through maybe a couple of ways

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.340
in which the imagination is
working to make this a thing.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.990
So first of all we note that
it's this trompe l'oeil.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.210
It's using this perceptual trick

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.410
that was figured out called perspective

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.000
that tricks us into thinking
that something is a space

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.580
when it's just a flat plane.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.400
And they do it here by
extending the trompe l'oeil part

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.740
is because they're extending
the architectural features

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.660
with this kind of imagined
architectural feature.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.340
And it's also then connects
that imagined extension

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.890
of this church into this
entirely imagined place

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.230
called heaven, and so it
situates it in a story space,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.520
which is this incredibly
powerful attraction

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.980
that we have to our
underlying cognitive need

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.770
to make sense of things.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.430
And it populates that space
with a bunch of figures

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.240
that look a lot like the
kind of sweaty, smelly things

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.010
that are standing all around
us on the floor of the church,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.370
but of course they're up there in heaven,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.100
but all of it's just made from
these little dobs of paint,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.253
right, these little
colored pieces of pigment.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.830
But our perception doesn't pay attention

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.023
to the small detail differences.

00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:53.470
We abstract from it an cohere it

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.810
into what we think is the
phenomena that it likely is

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.580
which is it's probably
like a person or an angel,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.950
a fictional person.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.140
And so artists always
exploit these capabilities

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.230
and deficiencies in our senses

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.820
to engage our imaginations
on so many levels.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.900
And so we all know about how cinema works.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.990
We don't actually see
things that are moving.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.160
We're just seeing static frames

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.750
that are shown to us so quickly

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.180
and with some ordered
coherency between them

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.760
that we can't help but
think that it's a depiction

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.070
of something in motion, so
it's depicting something

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.300
beyond what it actually is,
and this has always been

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.210
a desire and an operation of art.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.170
So in these cave paintings
from 30,000 years ago

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.680
the artists start to try
to develop methodologies

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.290
to show something that's beyond

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.080
the thing that's actually there

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.973
to show something in motion
with this static medium.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.470
And by doing that they
are directly engaging

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.470
our imagination as much as
they're engaging our senses.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.540
So art we can see is this collaboration

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.730
between our senses, our
memories, and our imagination.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.230
Which is also just the equation
for reality itself, right?

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.160
And so if we want to start to think about

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.550
how we might understand that, you know,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.290
we started to think about how
imagination is a phenomena

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.870
that takes us from one moment to the next,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.500
that takes us from those
moments to the near future

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.060
and then takes us from that near future

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.410
to think about the far future.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.010
We can also think of it maybe
as having different areas

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.530
that it kind of functions,
that goes from the neurological

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.580
to the cognitive to the social.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.660
That takes us from thinking
about our personal fate

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.313
to our local, global,
and even cosmic fates.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.810
So I follow the same mistake
that I just laid on Einstein

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.693
where imagination is
everything everywhere, right?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.140
But within this now actually we have

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.800
a little bit of a rubric
that we might be able

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.840
to explore some things in.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.500
And so later on today I think
you're going to be hearing

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.170
about a project that Alison is doing

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.260
that we're collaborating
on about thinking about

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.053
an underlying neurological
basis of human imagination.

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:22.590
And as we have said that there's this,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.700
as Alison was mentioning, it
would be an interesting thing

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.470
to be able to think about human
imagination comparatively.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.460
And so here's these great sculptures

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.087
by the Kennis brothers
depicting early homo sapian

00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:39.160
and neanderthals and you know,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.030
can we think about some ways
in which the homo sapian

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:49.030
differs in some capacities from
our cousins or early humans.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.010
You know, we know from early
humans, we start to see

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.520
this artifactual record,
the Venus of Willendorf.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.220
We see other examples that
go continuously back in time

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.680
and from other places
and even some examples

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.493
from very long ago.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.223
And whether or not these are kind of,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.200
we have always made little
fertility goddess figurines.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.010
Or perhaps we're always looking

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.803
for fertility goddess figurines.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.100
This idea that humans have
been making symbolic culture

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.260
for a long time is one
of the underlying things

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.020
that we think about with imagination.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.198
And even now we start to find new things

00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:39.830
that help to fill out that story.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.940
So seeing that they're a neanderthal,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.160
just things that we're now
attributing to neanderthals

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.060
as part of their symbolic culture.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.140
So might there be ways besides looking

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.110
at the artifactual records to
think about human imagination

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.300
by looking more directly
at the underlying biology

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.110
of these things, and so
Alison is like a magician

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.180
as far as I'm concerned.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.020
He has come up with these ways

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.820
in which he can do something
quite extraordinary,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.030
which is take human stem
cells, and on the left

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.080
we have human stem cells that
have grown brain organoids

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.260
and on the right we have those stem cells

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.620
but they've been coaxed
to have neanderthal genes

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.500
that then express neanderthal neurology.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.980
And so on the right we
have neanderthal brains

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.030
and so what we're looking
to do is then test them

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.190
in relationship to how what
kind of anticipatory responses

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.860
they may have to different
stimulating environments

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.380
and see what kinds of
differences they have.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.369
And you can already see
there are some morphological

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:47.383
differences that are quite evident.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.160
So not only looking at the
kind of neurological structure.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.650
I wanna give a very quick
example of something

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.470
at a little higher order to thinking about

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.920
at the cognitive structure
where we're looking

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.720
at other aspects that I think
are underlying components

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.480
of our imaginations and one
of them is spacial navigation.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.800
And so understanding how you are in space

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.240
and what space consists
of has obviously been

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.250
a very important part of
most species' survival.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.850
Here what we have started to learn

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.160
is that we have two mechanisms
of how we think about space.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.100
One in which we're egocentric

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.520
and we kind of think the world
reorients itself around us

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.390
and one that's allocentric
where we think the world is in

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.390
a fixed coordinate space and
we reorient ourself to it.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.740
We use both these mechanisms and in fact

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.720
when we switch between them
is a place where we really

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.570
have to open our eyes
and kind of re-understand

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.020
what our relationship to the world is.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.870
Now it turns out those
two kinds of experiences

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.790
excite different parts of the brain.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.070
And we can sense that with EEG devices.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.590
So we've been working with
a team of neuroscientists

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:05.590
to develop virtual words that
have kind of novel structure

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.740
where we can try to directly switch you

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.310
into going from one navigational
scheme to the other.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.260
And we do that by, well
you're seeing an example

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
in a video of this experience.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.860
You embody one of these avatars.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.330
You have a navigational task

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.100
you have to do in this environment

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.330
and we radically change
it in a very uncanny way

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.950
to try to keep you highly stimulated

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.210
in your spacial response to
making a coherent experience

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.333
from this environment.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.490
But of course, I'll maybe just wait

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.213
'til the last clip plays here.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.850
And doing that people have to,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.770
we sense what kind of
navigation they're using

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.460
and then try these tricks to trick them

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.983
to switch them into the other.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.010
But you know, I also want us to be aware

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.790
of this idea that we
only, it's easy for us

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.330
to study humans in a certain way,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.890
but we can also fall into
this kind of circular trap

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.860
of human exceptionalism, you know,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.743
that we're the only
thing with imagination.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.834
So I think certainly we are
are exceptional in many ways,

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:22.800
but trying to characterize and understand

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.740
where it makes sense
to kind of think about

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.210
what's different from
us versus other species

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.870
is a critical issue, so
for instance I know my dog

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.920
has this amazing imagination.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.040
You know, every time I
pretend to throw the ball

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.003
it imagines that I've thrown the ball.

00:15:41.037 --> 00:15:45.160
And I've done this with
that dog 1,000 times

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.820
but there's obviously something
about the anticipation

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.180
of throwing that ball
that it's more important

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.360
for him to fail 1,000
times because it allows him

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.821
to succeed just a little bit better

00:15:57.821 --> 00:15:59.983
the other few times that I do it.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.080
But you know, we may not even, you know,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.540
imagination maybe there's
even roots in things

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.570
that don't even have neurological systems.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.540
So this is a white blood cell navigating

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.260
through a complex environment
of red blood cells

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.680
trying to chase down a
virus and if you watch

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.910
how these microbes move,
they seem to at times

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.100
look to cut them off at the pass

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.730
and anticipate their moving
one way versus the other.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.830
And this is without any kind of neurology.

00:16:29.741 --> 00:16:32.620
So imagination is this
tricky thing to think about,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.070
just as all these other
phenomena like cognition,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.083
consciousness, to try to think about,

00:16:40.043 --> 00:16:41.950
we first of course
bring to these questions

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.000
our own experiences and understanding

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.090
and we have to be quite imaginative

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.800
to kind of think outside of that.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.080
And it can get us into some problems.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.300
So for a long time I think one
of the prevailing sentiments

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.990
of neanderthals was that they
didn't have a symbolic culture

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.010
and so this is from a recent exhibition

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.710
at the Australian Museum that talked about

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.300
that they lacked the depth of symbolic

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.020
and progressive thought
displayed in modern humans.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.320
And that was before kind
of a number of artifacts

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.300
were discovered that may
have kind of start to make us

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.800
have a more complex
relationship to that question.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.670
So in my work I try to think about things

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.933
that might be able to
augment our imagination.

00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:29.720
And we're starting to do a lot of things

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.170
with artificial intelligence.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.350
The fourth time around that
artificial intelligence

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.900
is suddenly the next big thing.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.900
But we're working with ways to think about

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.540
how to model aspects of human imagination

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.250
through things like genetic
algorithms and neural nets

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.140
and we bring to that a kind
of human-centric approach,

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.270
but in the end the effective
measures may cause us

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.560
to really come up with a
completely different kind

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.373
of imagination than a human-based model.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.070
So the last thing I want to
talk about in relationship

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.130
with this is then how
stories kind of work in this.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.980
And so we're the Arthur C. Clarke Center

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.980
and an aspect of that is
the value of science fiction

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.231
as this way to kind of cause us

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:21.620
to radically think about new
kinds of human conditions.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.350
And so some of the work we do with that.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.260
This is an example of a project we did

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.290
with a science fiction
author, Kim Stanley Robinson

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.820
and a performance artist Marina Abramovic

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.750
where we took Marina Abramovic methods

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.450
which take things that
usually take a few seconds

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.550
and try to extend them into experiences

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.350
that last over a few hours.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.650
And Stan Robinson's work
who's trying to get us

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.060
to understand what it would be like

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.470
to experience a phenomena
that lasted 1,000 years

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.290
like the travel to another star.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.310
And the ability to kind of
put these two temporal shifts

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.880
in relationship to each other gave people

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.412
a far more visceral understanding

00:18:56.412 --> 00:18:59.260
of the experience of temporality.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.040
And so these things like
stories and performance

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.210
and ritual art may have been things

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.200
that we think really discovered

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.010
once we started to extend
the day into the night

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.970
and then think about what
we do with that nighttime.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.980
We come up with ways to make better sense

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.330
out of everything that
happened in the daytime.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.270
And so these stories, why they sometimes

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.610
were completely fictional
and talked about worlds

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.040
that never were, sometimes
they actually brought sense

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.610
to things that we previously
wouldn't have connected.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.740
And of course as we move forward in time

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.020
we've just come up with
more and more proliferations

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.510
about those campfires
and more and more ways

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.973
to tell stories around them.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.623
Now it's often thought that
language came before art.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.500
But I have another theory that
I think language came about

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.151
so that art could be
critiqued and explained.

00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:58.990
(audience laughing)
And this is the artist

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.943
Joseph Beuys, he's trying to
explain art to a dead rabbit.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.230
So Picasso kind of gave us this idea that,

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.950
you know, he said that we all
know that art is not truth.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.550
Art is a lie that makes
us realize the truth.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.130
And so this is the
astonishing thing, I think

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.410
that our imaginations, our
ability to conjure meaning

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.340
from occurrences has given us this ability

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.130
to create all that we've created.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.040
And so how this happened
and where this will take us

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.360
couldn't be more important or
more exciting to think about

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.390
and I look forward to digging into that

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.408
for the rest of the day, so thank you.

00:20:32.408 --> 00:20:35.203
(audience applauding)

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:38.536
(warm electronic music)
