spin down that would be a 1 and that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
spin down that would be a 1 and that
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.029
spin down that would be a 1 and that
would be a zero but in quantum mechanics

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039
would be a zero but in quantum mechanics
 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.059
would be a zero but in quantum mechanics
it could also be in between zero and one

it could also be in between zero and one
 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.859
it could also be in between zero and one
so a bit one a bit zero can become a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
so a bit one a bit zero can become a
