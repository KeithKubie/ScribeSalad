00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.050
My name is David Plylar,
I'm with the Music Division

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.980
and I'm going to
be speaking today

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.010
about some very special
pieces from late Liszt.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.600
The historical Hungarian poets,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.230
i'm sorry the historical
Hungarian portraits,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.840
involves some poetry so
thats maybe the causes

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.260
of that slip there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830
It's also know as
the [inaudible],

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.430
these pieces were not published
during Liszt life time,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.940
in fact they were not published
at all until 1956 and then 57

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.470
and 58 and other parts
of it came to be.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570
The Library of Congress has
5 sources, sets of sources

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.060
of materials for these
pieces and they reside

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.470
in the Rosenwald collection
and in the Waters collection.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.490
Its interesting because
the creators

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.680
of the new Liszt edition
from Musica Budapest listed

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.040
as a secondary source but
there seems to be quite a bit

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.030
of primary source material
located in these items.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.620
And after this talk, I'll show
you some of those items if you'd

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.380
like up here on the stage.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.040
I pulled them up for you.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.260
The idea behind these pieces
is something of a memorial

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.510
to a major Hungarian
figures, both political

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.420
and writers and musicians.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.650
And I'd like to read from
somebody who sums it up well

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.300
and plays a pivotal
roll in the order

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.870
in which I put these
pieces, named [Lagoni?]

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.400
He writes: The character

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.790
of Széchenyi who's the first
piece, is proud and determined,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.200
unyielding, adimately
persevering, consummating,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
making its way firmly,
higher and higher,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.710
you'll actually hear
this in the music.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.400
It is here that the
cycle becomes more tense.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.490
Deák, which he places
as the second piece,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.380
reflects a basically
sunny personality,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.630
who brings about with
great creative force,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.840
a reconciled world around him.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
In parentheses "how many
yarns he had once spun,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.560
with how many cheering
turns to them".

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.780
And by this he wins his victory.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.870
The piece contains no
tonal funeral music at all,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.390
it is here that the cycle
is given some relief.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.110
So there's tension, relief.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.000
The tragic fate of Teleki, who
he's placing as the third piece,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.320
is an absolutely gripping dead
march above the booming of bells

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.880
in the [bostoottoenoto?],
which we'll talk about.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.060
It presents the upmost dramatic
contrast up to the serenity

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.640
of the Deák movement.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.300
Eötvös, the movement that
follows Teleki, pays respect

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.140
to the man of dynamism in
its prelude and postlude,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.260
and within this framework Liszt
recalls him in this nostalgic,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.050
nocturne sentiments that
lack any funeralial flavor.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.380
This is again followed
by an increase in tension

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.220
in the cycle, [inaudible], and
that opens with lonesome leads

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.470
of fourths and fifths, and
we'll talk about that as well,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.830
pointing afar and replete with
pain, before the appearance

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.060
of a reference to the poet
in the melody of two lines

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.310
of his [sosotte?]
above the tolling

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.520
of the f sharp [autonatto?]
in the base.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.610
The words being quoted there
is " the wide world holds

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.690
for you no other
place than this".

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.990
It ends with a string

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.830
but increasing clouded
closing section.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.040
I'll skip ahead.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.470
Vörösmarty is replete with
tension, Petõfi brings relief

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.580
but in a highly complex way.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.190
Instead of being
a character sketch

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.190
of the poet's personality,
it is an image developed

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.480
by Liszt himself of the
poet who died so young

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.790
on the battlefield,
leaving no trace.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.080
Perhaps for this reason, it's
the portrait in the cycle

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.110
with the most facets,
solitary in the prelude,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.680
elegiac in the principle
section but unfolds

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.480
out of this solitude,
consoled in the trio,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.030
passionate in the
very recapitulation

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.120
of the principle
section and petering

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.390
out into the distance
of the postlude.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.130
The last movement brings
profound and mournful grief,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.860
and again this is not a likeness
of Mosonyi but the memory

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.250
of him, as the case in
Petõfi's portrait.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.260
So that's kind of a nutshell
of the types of elegies

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.690
that are found in this
collection of seven works.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.160
But what that doesn't
necessarily get

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.450
across is the depth as is
typical of Liszt that he puts

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.910
into each particular piece, not
necessarily aligning very firmly

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.140
with a particular
character trait that one

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.940
by now might have forgotten,
but rather something

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.800
of substance itself
within each piece.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.200
And then he also constructs
something much more,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.760
kind of convoluted
across all seven pieces.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.740
And this is one of the
reasons that we're looking

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.650
at these pieces in
this particular order.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.920
I'm going to play these
pieces but I'm going

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.300
to explain a little bit
about each one before I do

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.660
in a new order rather
one that was proposed

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.080
in 1986 or so by [Lagoni?].

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.770
And the reason that
their brought about,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.150
why they were published
in the first place

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.950
in the wrong order is that
they were in the possession

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.640
of August [Guric?] who was a
student of Liszt and who was one

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.370
of the people whose
notes we used

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.040
about hit the master classes
at the end of Liszt's life

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.040
to learn a bit about what he
was doing and what he was up to.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.120
But in any case, they weren't
published for a long time,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.520
eventually the order
just got jumbled

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.330
but there is some evidence
in Liszt's letters,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.490
that he had a very
specific order in mind and I

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.890
in fact even think that
there's a particular piece

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.600
that sets the precedent for
the work as a whole in terms

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.120
of how particular motives
are going to be used.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.040
And I'll mention that
when we get to that piece.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.740
Five of the works
were composed in 1885.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.250
Two of them are slight
adaptations slash recompositions

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.040
of two earlier pieces,
one from 1870ish,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.890
1871 called Mosonyi's
[inaudible],

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.220
which is the funeral procession
of the composer Mosonyi,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.840
I'll speak a little
more about soon.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.530
And the other one is based on,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.090
originally had the name
[inaudible] Petõfi,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.880
and that was basically to
the memory of Petõfi,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:34.320
who is this major
poet who died in 1849.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.740
And you'll notice a lot
of these people were part

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.930
of this revolutionary
struggle in Hungary

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.660
and of particular importance
in the revolutionary years

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.770
and also post, in trying
to produce the government

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.270
and preserve Hungarian
culture and things like that.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.890
Every single one of these people
though is dead by the time

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.350
that Liszt writes these pieces
so they are memorial works.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.530
I'm going to not get up and down
so much because of a little bit

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.860
of a back problem so
I'm going to speak

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.140
from the reminder there
if you don't mind.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:26.050
Whilst looking at these
pieces in more detail.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.840
So the first piece that
we're going to look

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.630
at is called "István
Széchenyi".

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.470
And Széchenyi was a major
politician and writer

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.650
who was very important
to everybody

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.630
and had a very significant
impact in particular on Mosonyi

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.400
which we'll get to later
because of his suicide in 1860.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.920
It basically caused a
day of morning in Hungary

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.890
and Mosonyi responded with
a very intense funeral work

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.740
that actually ended

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.970
up catapulting him
to fame in a sense.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.370
We'll speak about
that in a minute

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.040
because that piece actually
relates very directly

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.900
to a different one
of the Hungarians

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.880
that we're going
to be looking at.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.050
One of the things though
that I want to focus on,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.650
is not so much Hungarian history
and Liszt ability to capture

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.660
that or capture a character
in a particularly concise way,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.760
even though that is a part
of what these pieces are

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.280
but rather I want to show some
of their shared components

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280
and also some of the
alternative versions that exists

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.470
in the Library of Congress
manuscripts that we have.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.840
And I'll explain why
some of these, I think,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.140
should actually be considered

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.660
to be the primary
versions of the piece.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.160
I can't know for sure.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.940
The the version that was used

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.710
on to produce the main
published edition is lost.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.020
So we don't have access to
that manuscript material

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.770
but at least we do have some
very compelling evidence

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.970
in our own collection which I
think is exciting to look at.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.940
It always makes for
an interesting,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.120
you know, look at these pieces.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.540
So as an example, I'm going play
how Liszt originally had this

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.470
in the copyist manuscript.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.510
He has this tendency

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:33.270
to use expository second
statements of an idea.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.810
So put out one idea, repeat it,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.960
then do another idea
and repeat it.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.290
This is how it was originally.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:06.010
[Music]

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.310
So you can hear how those
things are just a repeated idea.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.610
We have Liszt corrections
in-between the staves

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.910
so you can see where he
crosses out that secondary idea.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.210
[Music]

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:33.760
He crosses that out and
instead gives us this.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.620
[Music]

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.090
That particular idea
is an important one

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.060
across the set as well.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.860
And I think that's something
that I'll get to in a minute

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.150
about the types of motives that
you'll find in this whole work.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.270
I do want to say that
also what we do find

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.700
in this original copyist
manuscript is a simplified

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.470
version of the piece,
so we'll have an idea,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.750
I'll play how it was
originally written

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.510
and then how Liszt amended it.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:19.040
[Music]

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.100
So he basically creates a little
bit of a rhythmic complexity

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.850
and that comes into place,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.960
into play every time we hear
this material in a different way

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.070
and it actually serves to
propel the music forward

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.490
in an interesting way.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.200
With respect to certain ideas,
that I'm just going to bring

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.250
up now that you're going
to hear over and over again

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.900
in this entire set and
what's makes the argument

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.320
for considering it a cycle
to be a compelling one,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.620
are what I've been
calling fifths and sixths,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.920
they've been recognized

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.520
as having the following
fifth motive,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.140
but six played just
an important a roll,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.470
melodically and harmonically.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.580
We'll see them mostly
harmonically here,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.460
or sorry, melodically here.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.990
But then the other
thing to notice is

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.940
that all this is very
barren octave laden writing.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.590
It's very exposed,
that in itself is kind

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.660
of a motivic idea.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.220
Then we have certain
types of scales

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.420
that keep coming back
in a particular way.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.370
I won't go over those right now

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.890
but you'll hear them
very clearly.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:28.240
And also a compelling thing to
think about is these fifth ideas

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.360
and sixth ideas were added

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.460
after the copyist
version that we have.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.480
So originally it would have,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.370
I'll play what it would have
sounded like, going into,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.030
without the fifths included and
then I'll play just a little bit

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:49.510
of what it sounds
like with the fifths.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:14:05.010
[Music]

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.310
That's the Tristan cord.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.610
Sorry that's just a
little inside joke there.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.910
But, here's what it sounds
like with the addition

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.710
of the material that
was added later.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:33.040
[Music]

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.430
So the fifths, [music]
and the sixths, [music].

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.100
I'm not sure if that's [music].

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.670
The harmonic context
is not yet clear.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.230
It becomes clear in different
ways and at different points

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.140
but it's also highly mobil
and it depends on what type

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.480
of voice leading he's using as
to where he wants you to go.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.340
But he also often leaves it very
unclear as to what's happening.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.460
The last thing I'll show you
before I perform the piece is

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.560
that he originally had
a different ending,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.380
an entirely different ending.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.990
That just, all it does is
affirm D major like crazy.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.510
So heres that.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:40.070
[Music]

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.930
So in my opinion and
Liszt's I think as well,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.110
not the most compelling ending.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.130
So instead what he does is he
goes back and utilizes some

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.400
of the earlier added
material and some

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.350
of the introductory
material for this movement

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.770
as a way of closing it off.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.410
But he also it does
not end it in D major.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.260
You'll hear how he ends it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.560
So I'll play this now.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.470
This is ah, ah "István
Széchenyi"

00:16:20.510 --> 00:19:20.040
[Music]

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.300
So you notice at the end
there it's definitely not

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.600
in [music] in D major.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.640
It's actually quiet some,
somewhere quite distant.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.380
And what's also interesting
about and you can see this

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.800
in the Library's
manuscript is that Liszt puts

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.290
in an indication for trumpets.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.270
So he's already thinking about
orchestrating them at this time.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.940
He does, he doesn't end
up, he puts in instructions

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.220
for Széchenyi and
Deák but he doesn't end

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.590
up doing the orchestration
himself.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.810
A student of his, named Arthur
Friedhiem also ended up doing,

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.800
I think, four of the pieces.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.350
I believe that Liszt heard
those before he passed away the

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.400
following year.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.350
But I'm going to move on to the
next piece which is Franz Deák.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.360
And we do not have
any source material

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.590
for that particular piece at
the Library but you can hear,

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.980
and I'll just point
out a couple of things

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.280
and then I'll just play it.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.790
You can hear these fifths
and sixths very clearly.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:28.970
You'll also hear scale elements,
and also the barren octaves.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:34.140
THere's also a kind of a
secondary idea, that I think

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.640
of as a modified arpeggio that
ends up coming back in a big way

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.230
at the very end of the piece

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.250
but I'll mention it
again at that point.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.460
So I'll just go ahead
and play it just listen

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.780
for these very clear fifths
and sixths motive ideas

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.760
that are going to be there at
the beginning of the piece.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:23:27.260
[Music]

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:34.180
So why to I hear that as
being quite so unclouded

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.810
as the commentator I
first read from in terms

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.120
of where that piece goes.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.530
One might hear what might be
typically called Hungarianish

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.760
sounding things because of
the use of particular scales

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.720
that particularly emphasize
an augmented second.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.910
To completely oversimplify it.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:06.020
But then we move on to a new
area that involves Mosonyi,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:14.890
Széchenyi, the first piece
and Teleki, who is the,

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.950
the third portrait of
that particular person.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.090
As mentioned earlier
Széchenyi committed suicide

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:32.240
and stunned everybody
and Mosonyi, the story is

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.990
within a few days he
wrote this as a response.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.540
I'm not going to play the whole
piece because it's a big piece

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.200
but Im going to play a
relevant little chunk,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.500
and what I want you

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:50.470
to particularly listen
to the baseline.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:26:07.250
[Music]

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:12.130
So in that baseline we
have the seed for what

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.320
in 1885 Liszt would turn
into his [inaudible]

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.430
and [inaudible] march
and this march

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.340
in particular uses
this base and its

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.670
from this particular
[inaudible] funeral march

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.970
that he develops
the Teleki portrait

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.040
in the historical
Hungarian portraits.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.240
He makes certain modifications
to it that you can see at,

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.300
on our manuscripts so Liszt is
modifying copyist manuscripts

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.660
that we have.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:50.030
But I want to show you how the
[inaudible] leads into the march

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:59.260
and it helps to explain some
of the changes that he made.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:05.510
So here's the original funeral
prelude and march that were

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.850
for August Guric that ended

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.730
up taking the historical
Hungarian portraits

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.280
to the next level.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:29:19.090
[Music]

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.390
So that's how he gets in to it

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.330
and you might have noticed my
little mistake there that's

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.630
because I was playing
the version

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.760
that Liszt changed it to.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.140
What we have is a very
strange emphasis of C sharp

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.380
which is basically the front
end and back end of the scale.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.570
Is what the [inaudible]
prelude consists of.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:48.080
I think I'm going to skip
this other demonstration

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.670
from the [inaudible] march

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.240
because it's basically
the same piece as Teleki

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.350
but it's just a bit longer.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.840
And the way that Liszt
ended up tightening it up is

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.850
by extending the
period we have just

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.800
on the strong beat statement
of the base austonoto pattern.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.220
And then eventually it picks
up steam and moves forward.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.010
It's just a little bit
more tightly constructed

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.320
than the, than the other piece.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.300
There is something that's really
interesting in our manuscript

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.990
that I just want to mention
about here that is missing

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
from the published version.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:36.050
And that's this amazing
moment where he marks esposivo

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.300
in the midst of a
fortissimo passage.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.990
And its, what's amazing about
it to me and it may just be me,

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.950
is that, that's how
I would think of it

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:50.520
when I got there even though
it's very dark and heavy.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.620
The other thing that
stands as a difference

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.200
between these other pieces is

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.530
that the funeral march
version is all staccato.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.010
There's a lot of piano
in the Teleki movement.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.040
So I'm just going to
grab a sip of water

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.520
and play the Teleki movement.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:35:21.900
[Music]

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.030
So one thing to notice at
the very end of this is

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.270
that we have isolated
[music] the fifth, [music]

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.910
and the minor, the major sixth

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.230
which in the context
sounds minor

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.770
because of , it sounds
G minorish.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:42.840
But this piece proceeds
the other ones

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:49.360
and may well be the seed
for identifying [music],

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.370
identifying that
as motivic material

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:58.990
for the rest of the entire work.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.660
Moving past Teleki, we
get to József Eötvös.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.800
You might know there's
currently a living conductor

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.100
and composer with that name.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:16.190
I don't know if there's a
relationship but in any case,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.970
for our purposes what
we get here is more

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.370
of those open fifths, and we get
a very clear harmonic setting

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.850
of the fifths and sixths.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.230
And heres what that fifths
and sixths sound like here.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:37.340
[Music]

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:42.450
So in this case the outlines
[music] fifths, [music] sixths,

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.020
and they'll be outlined
more clearly

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.950
when I actually play the piece.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.810
Let's see if I have
anything else about this.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.530
One other thing just to look
for are, are also reoccurrences

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:09.400
of these open scales and
empty octaves, especially

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.360
and the end of the
first section.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.450
So this is in three sections,
a very beautiful piece.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:39:46.370
[Music]

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:50.550
So Liszt very carefully
coordinated these particular

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:54.510
light cues to happen during
the course of that work

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.130
and was just pulled
off brilliantly there.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:02.350
But unfortunately he didn't do
that for the rest of the pieces.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.870
Well, or fortunately for me.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.690
Hopefully for me.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:13.100
The next piece, I'm just
gonna keep moving right along.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:21.780
Honors Mihály Vörösmarty,
and he is a poet best know

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.010
for his setting of the
Hungarian appeal, sorry,

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.820
the penning of the
Hungarian appeal.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.300
Which was then set
by [inaudible] later

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.530
and became something
of a national anthem.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.670
And here's a case where I
think that we have evidence

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.300
in our collection of
a different opening

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.900
that should be there
based on the fact

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:50.010
that Liszt has crossed out, or
actually covered up and written

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.930
on top of the published version.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.390
So uh, there's something
very interesting here.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.580
Here's way it goes in
the published version

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.720
and when I actually play it
I'll play the new version that's

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.680
based on the Library's material.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:23.570
[Music]

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:27.710
So what we have are very
clear open fifths, fourths,

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.250
very much in line with
that motivic continuity.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.280
But Liszt ended up adding
a scaler component to it

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.040
which I'll play in
just a minute.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.250
Another important thing
to point out about

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.970
in this particular piece
is that it includes a quote

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.270
from that [inaudible] piece.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.130
Liszt even writes in
Vörösmarty wrote this,

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.160
meaning that he penned
the lyrics to it.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.790
It's a little bit, it's just
a tiny fragment of the theme.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.510
It actually comes from later

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.300
in the movements,
rather in the appeal.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.610
So it's not necessarily
an obvious thing except

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.420
that the rhymic material
feels very familiar.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:12.480
It also happens to have
in-versional relationships

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.920
to that original appeal.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.880
It turns out the the Library
also has Liszt piano version

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.050
of this, the [inaudible] which
is a combination of two pieces

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.540
that it was originally
for orchestra.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.440
The, I think there were
some singers involved too

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.340
and there's different
versions of all these.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.380
And he made this solo
piano version as well

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.740
which the Library has.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.590
There's that and then there's
one other thing I wanted

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.890
to mention and that's

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.450
in all these pieces there are
some real questionable tempos.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.110
And part of the issue is that,
you have copyist who will write

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.120
for instance in quarter
note equals 84

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.420
or something like that.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.820
And then you'll have presumably
Liszt going in with a blue crown

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.910
and putting it in to
cut time after the fact.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:00.270
So it becomes a question of
what exactly is the beat,

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.210
is it going to be the
larger beat or is it going

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.760
to be the smaller one.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.550
To me the music makes fairly
clear that it is the larger beat

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.370
so that music ends up going
faster because of this.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.490
Otherwise I think it
would just go to slow

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:18.240
for what the material merits.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:24.250
So here is Vörösmarty.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:46:20.480
[Music]

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.070
You can hear all those exposed
octaves still very much around.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.380
And another strange
ending to the work

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.250
in a very different
place from what seemed

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:36.270
like a B minorish [music]
or maybe a B majorish start

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:40.110
to something [music]
in the G ish region.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.770
But with, without enough
pitches to make it very clear.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:49.400
The penultament work
in this set,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:57.610
the Library has a version
called [inaudible] Petõfi's

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:04.520
of that earlier piece
from about 1877

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.600
that Liszt has corrected
and made changes to.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.610
So he puts into there places

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.640
where he wants a
measure repeated twice

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.940
or something like that.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.550
And then he gives a whole
bunch of different endings.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.970
And because of the way he
puts together these endings,

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.400
which I'll play for
you shortly just

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.820
so you can hear what
the differences are,

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.490
it makes me think
that the final version

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.570
that got published is
actually probably incorrect

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.810
because of the particular
profile and a character

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.000
of the progression that
he's using at the end .

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.360
So I'll play my corrected
version for you.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.020
The material itself though
is related to Petõfi but in

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.200
that it pulls from an
earlier tradition called

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:59.340
"the recitation" in which you
have a piano accompanying a

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.130
dramatic reading of a work.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:07.100
And so in 1874, Liszt did this
with a Hungarian poem of a story

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.470
by [inaudible], I think I'm
probably not pronouncing

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.130
that right, which was
ostensibly about Petõfi

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:18.430
who again had been this major
national hero who disappeared

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:22.340
on the battlefield,
presumably dead but nobody heard

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.710
from him again and
actually yoky later wrote

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:26.240
about if he had lived.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.030
That's sorta an alternate
reality sorta senerio.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:35.390
But what we have in this work
that basically translates

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:39.660
into the dead poet's love.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:44.880
You have this very
clear motto theme

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.480
that gets associated
with Petõfi.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.820
I'm going to play a
little bit from that

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.150
so you can hear that
motto theme.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.370
Here it is in the
original resertation.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:33.040
[Music]

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.650
So you hear an extended version
of that in [inaudible] Petõfi.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.750
In fact it starts with this,
up a half step [music].

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:46.310
It starts that way with
[inaudible] Petõfi's.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.910
Later Liszt would actually
expand the opening,

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:54.110
in the Library of Congress
expansion it's by 8 measures

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.020
and the version that
got published

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.770
that I think is probably
correct is ten measures.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.800
Correct because of that
double expository component

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.090
that present in most of Liszt's
work as I mentioned before.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.620
THere's also this other idea
that comes into play that's kind

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.050
of etherial type of music.

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:15.350
And here's what that
sounds like.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:29.950
[Music]

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.090
So that will appear in
the Petõfi as well.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.660
Then Liszt does what
you'd expect.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.060
He develops this idea,
always presenting it

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.730
in a moderate type form.

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.950
But I just want to give you a
couple of what, how he decided

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:46.100
to set it because he does
not do that in Petõfi

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.430
where he could have
chosen to do it.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:51:03.160
[Music]

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.840
And now listen to what we
have in those upper parts,

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.450
you're gonna have those
fifths and sixths.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:43.100
[Music]

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.330
So he's very much moving into
a Straussian kind of world.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.800
And here are just two
more quick examples.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:52:30.040
[Music]

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:37.510
And lastly a final development.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:53:43.240
[Music]

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.890
And I played it through
till there

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:51.280
because this idea [music]
is used very promenately

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.530
in Petõfi which I'll play now.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.860
But also in a very
different way.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.460
So he similtanisouly
expands the music and kind

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.430
of redirects the
dramatic content

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:07.770
of the original resertation
into this new setting.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.360
But before I start it I forgot
to mention the new endings,

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.660
I should just show you quickly.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.890
So originally and the end

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:35.510
of [inaudible] Petõfi's
it ends like this.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:46.150
[Music]

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:47.450
The next version that was wrote

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.540
but then was crossed
out goes like this.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.860
I'm playing it a
little bit faster

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.250
that you would play it normally.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:55:10.430
[Music]

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.570
He's not happy with that
so he goes on and some

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.770
of this is illegible so
I'm just kind of filling

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.070
in what I think is
suppose to be there.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:37.060
[Music]

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.860
Crosses that out.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.580
Then he moves on to
say I think I need

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.730
to incorporate the Petõfi
motif though he does this

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.250
and this is really hard to read
so I'm just kind of guessing.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:56:18.060
[Music]

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:20.480
It breaks off there so he's
trying to think of a way

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.210
to incorporate the melody
but it's not working.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:35.070
So in the published version
what we have is this kind

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:36.540
of a [music], that's the
progression that gets put

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.230
in there but the chords
are out of order according

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.490
to every single one of
these other examples.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:43.560
And in fact the one
that is not crossed

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.820
out by Liszt has
a different order.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.120
And that is [music].

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.560
And so that's the one
I'm going to play.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.300
It's just two chords
switched around

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.600
but it makes a big difference

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.190
and it make [inaudible]
perspective.

00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:00.730
So here's Petõfi's.

00:57:08.510 --> 01:02:22.870
[Music]

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:27.630
So Liszt's solution ends up
being the most kind of exposed

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.990
and like but also the
most poetic I think

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:34.300
as a solution just to set
that [inaudible] theme

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.370
by itself at the very end.

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:41.000
And I think it's a very
beautiful solution.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.900
Again we end up in C sharp
major, who knows where we came

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:51.750
from but it's a very
kind of bold thing to do.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.380
We then move on to
the last piece

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.780
which you might have heard
before in a version known

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.730
as Mosonyi's [inaudible].

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.030
It's a funeral procession.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.720
Mosonyi I said came into
prominence more or less

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:10.230
in the late 1850s
and into 1860s.

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:14.850
Originally his name was Michal
Braun but he decided to go

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:18.470
by Mosonyi to kind
of show solidarity

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.190
with the Hungarian cause.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:25.560
So this particular one
was written in 1870,

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.840
kind of the earliest of the set

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.790
and was Liszt's response
to Mosonyi death.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.530
He was one of Liszt great
compositional friends.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.090
So in edition to this
being a great elegy,

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.210
it serves as the capstone
for the entire set

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.710
of the historical
Hungarian poets.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.670
But what's interesting, in
particular what I'm going

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:55.400
to do today, is that I'm
going to play a version

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.510
that shows corrections and
additions in Liszt's hand.

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.590
It came to us in the
Ed Waters collection.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:08.680
This is a very strange ending.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.270
All those things I've been
talking about, those fifths

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:16.090
and sixths open octaves,
ah scaler components,

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:21.320
seconds moving this way and that
in a rhymically clear fashion.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.810
But it was also something that
Liszt clearly struggled with.

01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:30.320
In fact I'll just play through
a sped up version of a couple

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.780
of those endings right now
for you so you can hear

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.260
where he's starting with.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.210
It's suppose to end,
at least according

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.700
to the original in D major.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:05:08.070
[Music]

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.390
He does provide some
alternatives

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.880
where it involves this [music].

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:22.240
Ultimately he ends it
in a very different way.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:37.660
So I'm just going to play
through it so you can hear it

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:42.470
and it's a striking
difference and I'm curious

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:46.230
to see afterwards if anybody
wants to stick around and talk

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:47.530
to me and look at
the manuscripts.

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:50.560
See what you think about it.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.310
I'm not sure that it's
Liszt's last word on it.

01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:56.180
It certainly seems like it's
the last one that we have.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.180
But he was prone to
a lot of revision

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.900
and different version
of the pieces.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.310
So it would have
been interesting

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:06.100
to see what would have happened
had gone through the press.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.080
It might have made
other difference too

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.550
in the rest of the piece.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:14.160
So here is Mihály Mosonyi.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:14:14.060
[Music]

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.600
So that's the way Liszt
edited it in this case.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:22.540
So thank you all for being here
and going through these with me.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.650
I think there's a good reason
to have an edition made

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:30.130
that incorporates the
Library's manuscripts.

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:33.130
That would be fantastic
because I think some

01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:37.850
of the differences make it
tie better together as a set.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.950
Also just work differently
musically.

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.280
Liszt's versions of his
own pieces often have a

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.580
separate identity.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.400
It's not necessary a question of
if one is better than the other

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.840
but it's just a different way
of looking at the same material.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.660
It's always a kind of exciting
thing to be able to look

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.800
at this music and learn from it.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.510
So thanks again for coming.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:07.040
[Applause]

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.640
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
