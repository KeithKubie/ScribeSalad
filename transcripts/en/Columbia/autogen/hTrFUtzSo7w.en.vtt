patients in ICU so there's a lot that we
 

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.690
patients in ICU so there's a lot that we
learn at a bio defense that helps us

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:18.700
learn at a bio defense that helps us
 

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.010
learn at a bio defense that helps us
inform a public health and there's a lot

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.020

so to be able to identify an epidemic

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:35.539
so to be able to identify an epidemic
 

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:37.419

you have to have a background of Health

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:37.429
you have to have a background of Health

it's not enough to be an epidemiologist

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080
it's not enough to be an epidemiologist
 

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.710
it's not enough to be an epidemiologist
and say you have to have this particular

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720
and say you have to have this particular
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.090
and say you have to have this particular
epidemic curve you have to have a

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
epidemic curve you have to have a
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.799
epidemic curve you have to have a
certain number of cases and you report

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:44.809
certain number of cases and you report
 

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:46.779
certain number of cases and you report
an epidemic so the point I'd like to

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:46.789

often we really focus on ethanol

often we really focus on ethanol
anthropologist all of us tend to look at

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.210
anthropologist all of us tend to look at
 

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.419
anthropologist all of us tend to look at
the global and the national but we don't

00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:31.429
the global and the national but we don't
 

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:33.039
the global and the national but we don't
really tend to see the intersections

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:33.049
really tend to see the intersections
 

00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:35.320
really tend to see the intersections
within countries itself and the

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:35.330
within countries itself and the
 

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.880
within countries itself and the
political determinants that really

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:36.890
political determinants that really
 

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.100
political determinants that really
influences and when when my work

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.110
influences and when when my work
 

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.320
influences and when when my work
progressed I realized that the political

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:41.330
progressed I realized that the political
 

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.750
progressed I realized that the political
determinants of epidemics are crucial

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760
determinants of epidemics are crucial
 

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.850
determinants of epidemics are crucial
and they come up really in the issue of

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:45.860
and they come up really in the issue of
 

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.320
and they come up really in the issue of
what I think are the semantics of

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.330
what I think are the semantics of
 

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.810
what I think are the semantics of
epidemics during the nineteen

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:49.820
epidemics during the nineteen
 

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.940
epidemics during the nineteen
ninety-four epidemic the big question

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:51.950
ninety-four epidemic the big question
 

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.789
ninety-four epidemic the big question
really was is it the plague or not and

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799
really was is it the plague or not and
 

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:56.620
really was is it the plague or not and
it not only poised the international

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:56.630
it not only poised the international
 

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.870
it not only poised the international
community with you know the scientific

00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880
community with you know the scientific
 

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.659
community with you know the scientific
community within India itself but there

00:33:01.659 --> 00:33:01.669
community within India itself but there
 

00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:04.210

was constantly this this tension really

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.220
was constantly this this tension really
 

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.010
was constantly this this tension really
of proving and summoning enough

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.020
of proving and summoning enough
 

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.260
of proving and summoning enough
scientific evidence to be able to prove

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:08.270
scientific evidence to be able to prove
 

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.000
scientific evidence to be able to prove
that it was the plague or not and

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.010
that it was the plague or not and
 

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.370
that it was the plague or not and
somewhere there I think people really

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:12.380
somewhere there I think people really
 

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.769
somewhere there I think people really
lost lost touch with the real question

00:33:14.769 --> 00:33:14.779
lost lost touch with the real question
 

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:16.690
lost lost touch with the real question
because it was not only about proving

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:16.700
because it was not only about proving
 

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.090
because it was not only about proving
the science of whether it was the plague

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:19.100
the science of whether it was the plague
 

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.580
the science of whether it was the plague
or not but you really needed to ask why

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:21.590
or not but you really needed to ask why
 

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.130
or not but you really needed to ask why
a country like India does report an

a country like India does report an
 

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.919
a country like India does report an
epidemic or not why do countries report

00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:26.929

or don't report epidemics why do state

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.110
or don't report epidemics why do state
 

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.590
or don't report epidemics why do state
governments not report them and it's not

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600

the press reported at that point of time
that India was having a huge number of

was starting to liberalize so you

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:50.570
was starting to liberalize so you
 

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.690
was starting to liberalize so you
opening up your economies and you want

opening up your economies and you want
 

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.190
opening up your economies and you want
it to be global and the last thing you

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200
it to be global and the last thing you
 

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.870
it to be global and the last thing you
want it was the utter sort of

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880
want it was the utter sort of
 

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.340
want it was the utter sort of
international and social embarrassment

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:57.350
international and social embarrassment
 

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.010
international and social embarrassment
of having a medieval epidemic arrived

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:00.020
of having a medieval epidemic arrived
 

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.539
of having a medieval epidemic arrived
when you wanted to only be seen as being

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:01.549
when you wanted to only be seen as being
 

00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:04.060
when you wanted to only be seen as being
global so it's it's partly about the

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.070
global so it's it's partly about the
 

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.950
global so it's it's partly about the
trade and economic losses but it's also

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960
trade and economic losses but it's also
 

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.200
trade and economic losses but it's also
about it's also about the pressures

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:08.210
about it's also about the pressures
 

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.849
about it's also about the pressures
which I think were reflected in the

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:09.859
which I think were reflected in the
 

00:34:09.859 --> 00:34:12.190
which I think were reflected in the
Indian press at this point of time about

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200

ways in which epidemics are being
 

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.329
ways in which epidemics are being
reported and so many I mean these are

00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:19.339
reported and so many I mean these are
 

00:34:19.339 --> 00:34:20.829
reported and so many I mean these are
reports which were there I mean if you

00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839
reports which were there I mean if you
 

00:34:20.839 --> 00:34:21.980
reports which were there I mean if you
looked at Time magazine

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:21.990
looked at Time magazine
 

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.020
looked at Time magazine
at that point of time I mean where do I

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.030
at that point of time I mean where do I
 

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.480
at that point of time I mean where do I
epidemics occur and how our economics

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.490
epidemics occur and how our economics
 

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.609
epidemics occur and how our economics
reported across contexts so you would

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619
reported across contexts so you would
 

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:30.710
reported across contexts so you would
see the indian national press reporting

fringe that didn't really belong to the
 

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.669
fringe that didn't really belong to the
nation at all so there was a sort of

poised with the sort of reporting that

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.530
poised with the sort of reporting that
 

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.530
poised with the sort of reporting that
was happening across the world and the

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540
was happening across the world and the
 

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.000
was happening across the world and the
utter embarrassment of course was that

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.010
utter embarrassment of course was that
 

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.220
utter embarrassment of course was that
countries like Bangladesh and you know

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:55.230
countries like Bangladesh and you know
 

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.810
countries like Bangladesh and you know
and that's where the region becomes

and that's where the region becomes
 

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.700
and that's where the region becomes
really important the issue is of course

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:58.710
really important the issue is of course
 

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.530
really important the issue is of course

about the future or the present we

about the future or the present we

a long time ago but that's pretty much

it right mmm and I actually think that's
 

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.250
it right mmm and I actually think that's
not a bad question because it asks his

and what about 1918 is different than

question of what type of history is more
 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.910

useful are we making an argument that

taxonomy of usefulness and lack of
 

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.570
taxonomy of usefulness and lack of

usefulness it's something we need to
 

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.900

finally I think that this question look
 

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.080
finally I think that this question look
in history teach us about the next

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.090
in history teach us about the next
 

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.320

foreign was much more hitting at women
 

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:25.210
foreign was much more hitting at women
and so there was a question about where

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.220
and so there was a question about where
 

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.120
and so there was a question about where
that particular argument was coming from

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:28.130
that particular argument was coming from
 

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:30.430
that particular argument was coming from
and and why was being constructed and

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440
and and why was being constructed and
 

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.200
and and why was being constructed and
how was being used but as I said I

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:32.210
how was being used but as I said I

you can kind of see how cholera evolves

well the first question is I think we
 

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.460

fascinated particularly by one pill you

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:56.420
fascinated particularly by one pill you
 

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.480

really socialized to believe that and
 

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.800
really socialized to believe that and
want that and seek that out and then

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:08.810

magic bullets would want large purchases
of them and so if you look at the

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:17.390
of them and so if you look at the

Professor Packard was saying is that we

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:35.630
Professor Packard was saying is that we
 

01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:37.600
Professor Packard was saying is that we
still can't really predict things until

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:37.610
still can't really predict things until
 

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:39.100
still can't really predict things until
they they kind of have that we do much a

know being informed concerned is very

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:46.070
know being informed concerned is very
 

01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:49.600
know being informed concerned is very
different from informed panic and so we

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:49.610
different from informed panic and so we
 

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.450
different from informed panic and so we
have fire departments and ambulances and

01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:52.460

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.280
fire depart we want that because we know
that there's going to be some false

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.290
that there's going to be some false
 

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.590
that there's going to be some false
alarms for every real alarm and I think

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600
alarms for every real alarm and I think
 

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.970
alarms for every real alarm and I think
we have to do a much better job of

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:14.980
we have to do a much better job of
 

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.040
we have to do a much better job of
explaining the public health departments

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:17.050

level have to be they're going to over
 

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:24.990
level have to be they're going to over
call and I think I think we'd prefer to

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000
call and I think I think we'd prefer to
 

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.510
call and I think I think we'd prefer to
have them over call than under call and

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520
have them over call than under call and
 

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.979
have them over call than under call and
that doesn't mean it's a failure that

01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:28.989
that doesn't mean it's a failure that
 

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:32.689
that doesn't mean it's a failure that
means we're very vigilant anybody else

01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699
means we're very vigilant anybody else
 

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:39.200

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:53.830
robust argument you don't think we're
 

01:16:53.830 --> 01:17:00.180

very robust

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:00.190
 
 

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:05.350
 
I would really wonder whether a lot of

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360
I would really wonder whether a lot of
 

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.149
I would really wonder whether a lot of
public health science is really based on

01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159
public health science is really based on
 

01:17:07.159 --> 01:17:10.330
public health science is really based on
such good you know 19th century concepts

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:10.340
such good you know 19th century concepts

virtually any historical methodology in
fact probably more so i think when we

01:17:32.859 --> 01:17:32.869
fact probably more so i think when we
 

01:17:32.869 --> 01:17:36.040
fact probably more so i think when we
react when we think of epidemics as

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.050
react when we think of epidemics as
 

01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.680
react when we think of epidemics as
constantly getting back to Rodians point

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:38.690
constantly getting back to Rodians point

constantly getting back to Rodians point
yet epidemics has constantly kind of

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:42.260

written as surprises and needing
emergency responses I think we find our

01:17:47.169 --> 01:17:47.179
emergency responses I think we find our
 

01:17:47.179 --> 01:17:49.299
emergency responses I think we find our
science and our history sometimes

01:17:49.299 --> 01:17:49.309
science and our history sometimes
 

01:17:49.309 --> 01:17:51.430
science and our history sometimes
getting distorted I think the point I

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440
getting distorted I think the point I
 

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.410
getting distorted I think the point I
was trying to make before is that the

01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:53.420
was trying to make before is that the
 

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.660
was trying to make before is that the
existence of an ongoing infrastructure

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:55.670
existence of an ongoing infrastructure
 

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:58.629
existence of an ongoing infrastructure
for dealing with the here and now in the

01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:58.639
for dealing with the here and now in the
 

01:17:58.639 --> 01:18:01.330
for dealing with the here and now in the
everyday both within the United States

01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:01.340
everyday both within the United States
 

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.029
everyday both within the United States
and also for other societies it's

01:18:04.029 --> 01:18:04.039
and also for other societies it's
 

01:18:04.039 --> 01:18:05.649
and also for other societies it's
probably much more important in terms of

01:18:05.649 --> 01:18:05.659
probably much more important in terms of
 

01:18:05.659 --> 01:18:09.040
probably much more important in terms of
creating a responsible response to

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:09.050
creating a responsible response to
 

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:12.129
creating a responsible response to
epidemics and I think that there is kind

01:18:12.129 --> 01:18:12.139
epidemics and I think that there is kind
 

01:18:12.139 --> 01:18:13.839
epidemics and I think that there is kind
of a cultural prejudice against history

01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:13.849
of a cultural prejudice against history
 

01:18:13.849 --> 01:18:16.149
of a cultural prejudice against history
in the United States where we believe

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159
in the United States where we believe
 

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:18.339
in the United States where we believe
that history does not does not have

01:18:18.339 --> 01:18:18.349
that history does not does not have
 

01:18:18.349 --> 01:18:19.959
that history does not does not have
scientific rigor if I think if you go to

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:19.969
scientific rigor if I think if you go to
 

01:18:19.969 --> 01:18:22.509
scientific rigor if I think if you go to
Paris you'll find exactly the opposite

01:18:22.509 --> 01:18:22.519
Paris you'll find exactly the opposite
 

01:18:22.519 --> 01:18:24.489
Paris you'll find exactly the opposite
you know where everything is history and

01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:24.499
you know where everything is history and
 

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.919
you know where everything is history and
no no you know contemporary evidence

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:26.929
no no you know contemporary evidence
 

01:18:26.929 --> 01:18:29.979
no no you know contemporary evidence
really matters so it's a it's kind of

01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:29.989
really matters so it's a it's kind of
 

01:18:29.989 --> 01:18:32.379
really matters so it's a it's kind of
cultural issue about what is really good

01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:32.389
cultural issue about what is really good
 

01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:34.479
cultural issue about what is really good
evidence what is bad evidence and I

01:18:34.479 --> 01:18:34.489
evidence what is bad evidence and I
 

01:18:34.489 --> 01:18:37.180
evidence what is bad evidence and I
think it's some sense we've no we found

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:37.190
think it's some sense we've no we found
 

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.029
think it's some sense we've no we found

numbers even if we don't understand them
 

01:18:41.719 --> 01:18:44.830
numbers even if we don't understand them

in the results of experiments as as
probably interpretations of history that

01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:54.289
probably interpretations of history that
 

01:18:54.289 --> 01:19:01.950
probably interpretations of history that
would be my modest modest statement

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960
 
 

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.470
 
I'd also like to add that it depends

I'd also like to add that it depends
 

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.870
I'd also like to add that it depends
where the numbers are coming from so if

01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880
where the numbers are coming from so if
 

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.580
where the numbers are coming from so if
you look at the whole controversy about

you look at the whole controversy about

you look at the whole controversy about

Asia and the way in which the UN aids
responded to it so a lot of countries

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800
responded to it so a lot of countries
 

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.189
responded to it so a lot of countries
contest where the data comes from so

collects is you know there's there I

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960
collects is you know there's there I
 

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.350
collects is you know there's there I
mean you see the politics of of data

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360
mean you see the politics of of data
 

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.240
mean you see the politics of of data
collection and research as well and that

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:34.250
collection and research as well and that
 

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.430
collection and research as well and that
leads to also assumptions about what is

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440
leads to also assumptions about what is
 

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.580
leads to also assumptions about what is
legitimate what do people accept and so

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:39.590
legitimate what do people accept and so
 

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:41.410
legitimate what do people accept and so
I mean I think when we talk about

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.420
I mean I think when we talk about
 

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.750
I mean I think when we talk about
science we also talked about you know

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760
science we also talked about you know
 

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.380
science we also talked about you know
the demand and supply of science who

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:46.390
the demand and supply of science who
 

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:49.689
the demand and supply of science who
buys that evidence who accepts it and

01:19:49.689 --> 01:19:49.699
buys that evidence who accepts it and
 

01:19:49.699 --> 01:19:51.729
buys that evidence who accepts it and
you know which policymakers do or don't

01:19:51.729 --> 01:19:51.739
you know which policymakers do or don't
 

01:19:51.739 --> 01:19:53.530
you know which policymakers do or don't
and I think there's a certain amount of

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:53.540
and I think there's a certain amount of
 

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.689
and I think there's a certain amount of
of politics and looking at that science

01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:55.699
of politics and looking at that science
 

01:19:55.699 --> 01:19:57.220
of politics and looking at that science
as well so it's not only about the

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:57.230
as well so it's not only about the
 

01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:58.870
as well so it's not only about the
method and the tools and the research

01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880
method and the tools and the research
 

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.970
method and the tools and the research
that you use but also eventually if you

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:00.980
that you use but also eventually if you
 

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.620
that you use but also eventually if you
are talking about how it will affect the

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:02.630
are talking about how it will affect the
 

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.360
are talking about how it will affect the
ways in which pandemics are administered

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:04.370
ways in which pandemics are administered
 

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:06.310
ways in which pandemics are administered
or what policy is coming to place we

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320
or what policy is coming to place we
 

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.080
or what policy is coming to place we
have to look at the politics of where it

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.090
have to look at the politics of where it
 

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.030
have to look at the politics of where it
comes from and I just quickly wanted to

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040
comes from and I just quickly wanted to
 

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.550
comes from and I just quickly wanted to
add to David's point about culture and I

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560
add to David's point about culture and I
 

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.140
add to David's point about culture and I
think there's also you know there's a

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:14.150
think there's also you know there's a
 

01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:16.120
think there's also you know there's a
whole sense of sage about pandemics

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:16.130
whole sense of sage about pandemics
 

01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:17.500
whole sense of sage about pandemics
which is also related to where you are

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:17.510
which is also related to where you are
 

01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:19.959
which is also related to where you are
located and the sense of why you you

01:20:19.959 --> 01:20:19.969
located and the sense of why you you
 

01:20:19.969 --> 01:20:24.070
located and the sense of why you you
know it has to do with I mean pandemics

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080
know it has to do with I mean pandemics
 

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.870
know it has to do with I mean pandemics
all are also about you know the assume

01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880
all are also about you know the assume
 

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.640
all are also about you know the assume
that you have a certain cultural

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:27.650
that you have a certain cultural
 

01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:29.830
that you have a certain cultural
imagination where you think you should

environment so I'm not disputing the
 

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.010

fact that you do need you you know you

01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:39.020
fact that you do need you you know you
 

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.510

do need techniques to be able to you

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520
do need techniques to be able to you
 

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.010
do need techniques to be able to you
know you you'll need you need public

01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:42.020
know you you'll need you need public
 

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.320

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.540
normal models of research and there was
a result of that we have really fairly

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:51.550
a result of that we have really fairly
 

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.700
a result of that we have really fairly
large gaps in our knowledge of these

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:53.710
large gaps in our knowledge of these
 

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:56.220
large gaps in our knowledge of these
things and so you're absolutely right we

01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:56.230
things and so you're absolutely right we
 

01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:58.170
things and so you're absolutely right we
need no more robust but it we also need

01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:58.180
need no more robust but it we also need
 

01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.970
need no more robust but it we also need
more funding to do them to get the

01:22:59.970 --> 01:22:59.980
more funding to do them to get the
 

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:05.100
more funding to do them to get the
robust into the research might wanted to

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.110
robust into the research might wanted to
 

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.360

that we were talking about um from a
historical perspective to what extent

does international cooperation and
 

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.130
does international cooperation and
coordination kind of filter into

something like the social determinants
 

01:23:30.699 --> 01:23:32.100
something like the social determinants
of health which is an increasingly

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:38.440
cooperation with other nations sort of
 

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.810
cooperation with other nations sort of
come into play and I'm also thinking I

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:39.820
come into play and I'm also thinking I
 

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.010

harder battle than then suggested but I
 

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.709
harder battle than then suggested but I

the history of disease and it's it's

the history of disease and it's it's
 

01:29:44.449 --> 01:29:46.089
the history of disease and it's it's
it's important you know I think there's

it's important you know I think there's
 

01:29:46.099 --> 01:29:47.770
it's important you know I think there's
a lot more to be done in this field but

01:29:47.770 --> 01:29:47.780
a lot more to be done in this field but
 

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.150
a lot more to be done in this field but
it's not without content

the history of disease and I would kind

of it a lot of historians or work

constructs in fact if you think disease

constructs in fact if you think disease
 

01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:50.360
constructs in fact if you think disease
is only socially constructed I suggest

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:50.370
is only socially constructed I suggest
 

01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:52.729
is only socially constructed I suggest
you think about that the next time

01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739
you think about that the next time
 

01:32:52.739 --> 01:32:55.160
you think about that the next time
you're in bed with one you'll find it

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:55.170
you're in bed with one you'll find it
 

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:58.550
you're in bed with one you'll find it
there quite real but the reality that we

01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560
there quite real but the reality that we
 

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.090
there quite real but the reality that we
all as humans are going to get sick we

all as humans are going to get sick we
 

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:05.240
all as humans are going to get sick we
are all with the common bind of us is it

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:05.250
are all with the common bind of us is it
 

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.919
are all with the common bind of us is it
we're all going to share certain

01:33:06.919 --> 01:33:06.929
we're all going to share certain
 

01:33:06.929 --> 01:33:08.810
we're all going to share certain
diseases certain number of people here

01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820
diseases certain number of people here
 

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.060
diseases certain number of people here
are going to get cancer let's certain

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:11.070
are going to get cancer let's certain
 

01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:12.020
are going to get cancer let's certain
another number of people are going to

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:12.030
another number of people are going to
 

01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:13.820
another number of people are going to
get heart disease we know this and

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:13.830
get heart disease we know this and
 

01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:15.110
get heart disease we know this and
others are going to get infectious

01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120
others are going to get infectious
 

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:18.410
others are going to get infectious
diseases and so i use it really is a

01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420
diseases and so i use it really is a
 

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.680
diseases and so i use it really is a
prism to study humanity history of

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:21.690
prism to study humanity history of

disease in medicine and health and cures
 

01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:26.780
disease in medicine and health and cures
and disease entities is really just one

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:26.790
and disease entities is really just one
 

01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:28.669

way that I think that prism starts to

01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540
way that I think that prism starts to
 

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:36.530
way that I think that prism starts to
distort rather than clarifying so we

01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540
distort rather than clarifying so we
 

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:37.850
distort rather than clarifying so we
have to take care of that but in terms

a very useful tool but obviously has to
be used wisely and well and and
