00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution for pig<u>actions</u>d.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you were challenged with a double, then the legal actions are accept and decline.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If there's something pending, then you can either roll or hold.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If there's nothing pending, then you can only roll.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That's my initial description of actions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then I add in if doubling is 1, then we append to whatever we computed before--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that we're allowed to do the double action--and return that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I didn't describe my strategy function because there were so many good ones

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that people have come up with. There's lots of different choices.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So I think the best thing is just look in the discussion forums

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then you can see some options for ways to go for figuring out a good strategy.
