Inter-professional
cooperative practice

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.910
is very important in
delivering healthcare service.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
Introducing kolaboraSIM,
a 360-degree video

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.410
learning simulation for
health professionals that

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.620
use virtual reality
technology and place

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.800
participants in a real
complex teamwork situation

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.560
to learn inter-professional
collaborative practice.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.900
For our first-round
funding, we collaborated

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.010
with Indonesian Young Health
Professionals' Society,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.840
industry-leading a customer
development strategy

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.530
to health professionals who
work in inter-professional teams

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.950
in rural areas across Indonesia.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.510
The results from
this stage will be

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.015
used in designing the scenarios
and developing the simulation

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:49.515
video.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120
VR simulation for
better collaboration--
