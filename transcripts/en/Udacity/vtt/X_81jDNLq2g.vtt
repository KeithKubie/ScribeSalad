[D. Evans] There's no real correct answer to this quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you really don't like money, I guess you could prefer not to be paid at all.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The closest thing to a correct answer is that it depends.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And it depends on how you interpret the meaning of biweekly.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We could look that up in the dictionary to decide how we should interpret it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If we look up biweekly in the dictionary,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what we see is the definition of biweekly, which is right here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It says, "happening every 2 weeks" is the first definition.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The second definition is, "happening twice a week."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If you have the first definition, you'd rather be paid weekly,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
assuming you would like more money.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If you have the second definition, you'd rather be paid biweekly.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Maybe that's the problem with paper dictionaries--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that they're not very precise because they're old things.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's look up a more modern dictionary. Let's see what Wiktionary has to say about this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here is the Wiktionary entry for biweekly.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If we scroll down, we can see that it has 2 meanings:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
occurring once every 2 weeks;

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
occurring twice a week. This is chiefly in the UK.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The American dictionary didn't seem to think that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It seemed to think both definitions occurred in both countries.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So this is a pretty big problem.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If we wrote a computer program and the program was doing our payroll

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and had to decide what it meant to pay someone biweekly,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we'd want to make sure that it understood that the same way the programmer did.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So that's 1 important reason why we need to invent new languages like Python

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to program computers rather than using natural languages that we already understand,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and that's because we don't really understand languages like English or Mandarin--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that there's lots of things that different people will understand different ways.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And this happens at the granularity of words like biweekly.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It also happens in complete sentences

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where there are many different ways to interpret the same phrase.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Another reason we don't use natural languages for programming

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is that natural languages are very verbose.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
To write a program we need to describe exactly what the computer should do

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in a very precise sequence of steps.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If we had to describe all those details using a natural language,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that would require a huge amount of text.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So we'll see soon that with a programming language like Python

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we only need a few lines of code to describe a complicated thing

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and describe it in a very precise, step-by-step way.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I want you to think about as we write programs in this class

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
how much more detail you'd need to actually describe in English

00:02:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
precisely how to do what we're describing with a few lines of Python code.
