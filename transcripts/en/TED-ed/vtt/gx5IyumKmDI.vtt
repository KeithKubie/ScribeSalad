00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:10.037
A national hero? Or public enemy number one?

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:12.450
Historical figures are often controversial,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.836
but few were as deified or vilified

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:16.496
in their lifetime

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:19.129
as the seventh President of the United States.

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:22.888
This is History vs. Andrew Jackson.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:27.973
"Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson!

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:31.225
You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency,

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:33.612
causing financial collapse

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:36.644
and wanton cruelty against American Indians.

00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:39.147
How do you plead?"

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:41.558
"Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer,

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:43.865
but I do know a few things.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:45.532
And I know that President Jackson was

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:47.035
a self-made frontiersman,

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.157
a great general,

00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:50.788
a real man of the people."

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.583
"Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler,

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:54.480
a drunk, and a brawler.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.890
Why, I've heard it said that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.087
he would fight at the drop of the hat

00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:58.808
and then drop the hat himself.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:00:59.974
I ask you,

00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:02.875
was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation?

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.159
Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration?

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.557
Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob

00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:09.146
into the White House?

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:12.205
It took ages to get the upholstery clean."

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.563
"That drunken mob, sir, was the American people,

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:18.064
and they deserve to celebrate their victory."

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:21.975
"Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?"

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:24.363
"Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:25.812
that immediately upon assuming office

00:01:25.812 --> 00:01:27.584
you introduced the spoils system,

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:30.481
replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:33.497
with incompetent party loyalists?"

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:35.664
"Your Honor, the President did no such thing.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:38.003
He tried to institute rotation in office

00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.098
to avoid any profiteering or funny business.

00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:42.514
It was the rest of the party

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:45.726
who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys."

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:48.228
"But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?"

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:50.251
"Now, uh, see here."

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.435
"Moving on.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:53.524
Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.938
the financial Panic of 1837,

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:58.063
and the ensuing economic depression

00:01:58.063 --> 00:01:59.808
with your obsessive war

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:01.524
against the Bank of the United States?

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:03.391
Was not vetoing its reauthorization,

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.391
as you did in 1832,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.282
an act of irresponsible populace pandering

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:10.333
that made no economic sense?"

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.480
"Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.497
That bank was just a way for rich Yanks

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:15.742
to get richer.

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.573
And all that money panic was caused

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:19.458
when British banks raised interest rates

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:20.835
and cut lending.

00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:23.829
To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say."

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.307
"But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank,

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:28.678
it would have been able to lend to farmers

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:31.145
and businesses when other credit dried up,

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:32.569
would it not?"

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.473
"Hm, this is all highly speculative.

00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:35.648
Can we move on?"

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:36.791
"Certainly, Your Honor.

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:38.159
We now come to Mr. Jackson's

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.098
most terrible offense:

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:41.724
forcing entire tribes out of their native lands

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.312
via the Indian Removal Act."

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:46.064
"I resent that accusation, sir.

00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:47.913
The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:49.592
fair and square."

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:51.450
"Do you call coercion and threats

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.898
by a nation with a far more powerful army

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:55.505
fair and square?

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.144
Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.918
with a small group that didn't include

00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:01.294
their actual leaders?

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:02.588
They didn't have time to properly

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:05.422
supply themselves before the army came

00:03:05.422 --> 00:03:07.759
and forced them to march the Trail of Tears."

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.802
"Now, hold on a minute.

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:10.406
This was all Van Buren's doing

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:12.875
after President Jackson left office."

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.859
"But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.045
and made sure the treaty was ratified.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.063
All President Van Buren had to do afterwards

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:20.720
was enforce it."

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.366
"Look here, Your Honor.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.061
Our government's been purchasing

00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.644
Indian land since the beginning,

00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:27.444
and my client was negotiating these deals

00:03:27.444 --> 00:03:28.744
even before he was President.

00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:30.640
President Jackson truly believed

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.033
it was best for the Indians

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.796
to get compensated for their land

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.151
and move out West,

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:36.373
where there was plenty of space

00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:37.313
for them to keep living

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:38.366
the way they were accustomed,

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:39.724
rather than stick around

00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:41.585
and keep butting heads with the white settlers.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.380
Some of whom, I remind our court,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.338
wanted to exterminate them outright.

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:46.975
It was a different time."

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:48.926
"And yet, even in this different time,

00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:50.557
there were many in Congress

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:51.482
and even the Supreme Court

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:53.035
who saw how wrong the Removal Act was

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:54.478
and loudly opposed it,

00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:56.140
were there not?"

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.474
"My client was under a great deal of pressure.

00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:00.558
I say, do you think it's easy

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:02.440
governing such a huge country

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.766
and keeping the Union together,

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.443
when states are fixing to nullify

00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:06.902
federal laws?

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:08.783
President Jackson barely got South Carolina

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:10.724
to back down over those import tariffs,

00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:12.808
and then Georgia had to go discover gold

00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:14.701
and start grabbing up Cherokee land.

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.703
It was either get the Indians to move

00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.080
or get in another fight with a state government."

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.994
"So, you admit that Mr. Jackson

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.626
sacrified moral principles to achieve

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.141
some political goals?"

00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:27.058
"I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't."

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.308
As societies change and morals evolve,

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:30.819
yesterday's hero may become

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.470
tomorrow's villain, or vice versa.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.397
History may be past,

00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:39.397
but our understanding of it is always on trial.
