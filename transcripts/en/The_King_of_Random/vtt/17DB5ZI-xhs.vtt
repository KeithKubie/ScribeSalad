00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Hey, what's up guys? Now in yesterday's video I pulled a request out of the comments to make a silicone mold of a real heart.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.740
So I decided to give it a try,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.500
I made a wooden box, and mixed up a new batch of silicone and poured it over top of a pigs heart, and let it set over night.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.480
Now the rubber is firm, so lets cut it open, clean up the mold

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.340
and fill it up with candy melts to make our self a real chocolate heart for Valentines Day.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.740
Alright all the screws on the bottom have been removed so we should be able to pry this thing up now

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.180
but it seems like silicone grabs on a lot harder to wood than it does to acrylic.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.320
Ohh yes look at that!

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.800
there is the bottom of the heart you can actually see the hole where the screw went in

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.060
and held it in place

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.240
That is lovely.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.520
Alright, lets go ahead and get this thing the rest of the way out

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.680
There we go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.240
And that, hopefully, will be our little rubber heart mold

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.400
Now, before I cut into this, I need to think it through a little bit.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.080
How do we want to cut this, because it is gonna leave seams

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.520
And I don't want the seams to go down the front of the heart

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.040
I'd rather have them around the back

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.520
There's so many parts to this heart, though,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.880
And I'm under the impression that silicon has probably seeped inside it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.220
So, uh, we may have to do a little bit of surgery

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.680
once we start digging down inside

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.100
It always amazes me how tough and rubbery this stuff is

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.100
I always like cutting at a criss cross angle, a jagged angle

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.240
because that helps the final mold come out a little bit better

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Oops, I cut off part of my glove

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.440
We have a little bit of silicon in here that slipped into all those cracks and crevices

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.440
but we don't really want those in our finished product

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.440
so I just sliced them off

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.540
There we go!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.480
Our heart is recovered

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.620
and its looking in a really good shape

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.280
And I'm feeling pretty confident we got ourselves a pretty good looking mold here

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.940
So we're gonna take this thing and save it for later

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.740
And now what we need to do is clean and sterilize our mold

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.440
and prep it for use with chocolate

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.140
Look at all the different flaps and folds that are in there

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.200
Like just looking at it, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
But we do need to clean it, because there's like little gross bits of heart

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.740
So how does it smell?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.280
It does have a very faint odor of formaldehyde

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.060
So we're going to take some hot, soapy water and some bleach

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.920
So we can clean and sterilize this thing

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.700
and prep it for use with chocolate

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.140
It's already smelling fresher!

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.760
Now we're gonna put on a little bit of bleach to sterilize that a little bit more

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.160
Give one more wash then rinse it off, and it should be good to go

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.460
There we go!

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.720
Clean, sterilized, just needs a good rinse now

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.080
and we should be good to pour our chocolate.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.260
Alright, so, update guys

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.360
we have successfully removed our heart

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.760
and we cleaned and sanitized our rubber mold

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.740
We now have a heart mold, ready for casting chocolate.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.460
So now we can throw all this stuff in the microwave

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.800
fill this up with chocolate,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.680
and then let it set in the fridge for a few hours

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.460
So we can open it up and reveal the solid chocolate heart that lies inside

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.340
Now one thing that we have to keep in mind is

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.000
this heart is facing down

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.300
and I don't want one front layer to all be the same color

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.200
So when we pour in the different colors, I think I'm gonna drip it at different angles

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.940
and kind of smear it around a little bit

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.140
Hopefully that'll give it a bit more marbled effect

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.640
rather than a stacked layered effect

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.320
It already is starting to make a little bit of a marbled effect in there

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.860
If you were to look close, you would see

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.620
This is fun

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.720
Valentine's crafts King of Random style

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.100
And of course, if you're not making a mess, you're probably not having fun

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.100
and we are definitely having fun

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.580
Alright, let's get this thing to the fridge and give it a few hours to set

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.700
Now, our chocolate heart's been sitting in the fridge for a little over four hours

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.440
which isn't nearly as long as I would like to keep it in there

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.560
But we're running out of time

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.660
so let's go take it out

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.880
open the silicon mold,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.720
and see what kind of results we got

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.440
Okay, so moment of truth guys.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.200
Let's slowly and very carefully peel this thing open

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200
so we can check out the results of our labors

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.240
Look inside there, it kinda looks like one of those magic mushrooms from Mario

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.960
and the red and white splotches

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.400
Oh, it's like having your first baby

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.400
Ha Ha Ha Ha

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.820
Check that out

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.480
Oh my goodness

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.200
That looks

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.400
Disturbingly

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.440
amazing

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.400
Yeah, actually that really does look - I'm proud of this, I'm proud of this chocolate heart

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.760
That looks crazy!

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.540
So anatomically correct

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.620
Come check this out

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.740
We got the ventricles, we got the atriums, we have the aorta

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.580
Everything's there, even these little flappy muscle things

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.960
I don't really know what purpose those serve, but

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.660
they're very delicate

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.520
And I imagine they taste fairly good

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.080
Everything about this looks cool

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.200
from every different angle

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.940
I'm loving it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.400
I'm so glad we did this!

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.280
I heart you, internet

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.900
That looks amazing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.080
I'm really, really proud of this chocolate heart

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
And it actually looks relatively edible as well

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.920
I mean, I thought it was gonna come out looking kinda gross,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.120
because you could actually see the veins,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.120
the division lines,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.160
you could see the little contours of the muscle

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.320
and even these little ripples and folds

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.800
but, because of the pink

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.380
the white

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.080
and the Valentine's colors

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.800
I think it actually looks relatively edible

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.280
Okay, so now the biggest question on my mind is how much does this thing actually weigh?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.260
we got it set to grams

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.080
and it comes out

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.160
1.1 kilograms

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.780
that is a healthy sized heart

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.340
Of course ironically enough,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.980
this much sugar isn't good for your heart

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480
The thing is absolutely massive!

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.420
So the question now is

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.040
how do these things actually taste?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.520
And we got these weird little muscle looking things

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.380
On top of the atriums

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.980
I'm not really sure what they're for,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.060
or what they're called, but

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.040
I think I can just snap it right off

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.140
Here we go

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.980
Look at that!

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.280
Oh and look inside

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.180
you can see that there's different layers to the chocolate too, that's kinda cool

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.120
You're playing with my heart, man.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.700
Alright so how does this thing taste?

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.920
This is the moment of truth!

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.080
Just tastes like white chocolate

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.740
That's really fun!

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.920
Really fun, really cool

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.300
and it's got layers

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.920
How does it taste?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.420
Good! I like it

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.920
You getting any heart flavor seeping through there?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.600
Mm-mm It's choclate

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.200
So I'm not really sure who you'd give a heart like this to,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.920
maybe someone who's aspiring to be a doctor,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.860
or a mortician

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.360
I don't know

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.760
But, there you go

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.720
a 1 kilogram

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.860
anatomically correct

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.840
chocolate heart for Valentines Day.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.960
So thanks to you, Andrew Jenson, for your comments,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.680
you're the crazy kid that made this happen.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.260
And I'm sending 25 dollars your way.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.160
And to the rest of you,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.600
thanks for joining me for this experiment,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.980
have a happy Valentines Day,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.060
and I'll see you in the next video

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.920
Talk to you then

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.220
That looks so cool!

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.800
[heart beating noises]

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.680
It's alliiiiiiive!
