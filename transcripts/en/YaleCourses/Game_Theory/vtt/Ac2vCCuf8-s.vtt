1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.340
Okay.
So last time we came across a new idea,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.470
although it wasn't really new for a lot of you,

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.740
and that was the idea of Nash

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.853
equilibrium.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.450
What I wanted to do today is discuss Nash Equilibrium,

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.780
see how we find that equilibrium in some rather simple examples.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.790
And then in the second half of today,

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.270
I want to look at an application where we actually have some fun and play a
game.

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.520
What does,
I hope it's fun.
All right,

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.760
but it starts by putting down a formal definition.

11
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.020
We only used are all the informal one last week.
Uh,
so here's a fun one.

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.780
A strategy profile.

13
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.150
Remember profile is one strategy for each player.

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.420
So it's going to be s one star,

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.550
two star,

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.260
all the way out to s Amstar if there are end players playing the game.

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
So this profile is a nash equilibrium and I'm just gonna write m e in this

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.360
class,
the Nash equilibrium from now on.

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.773
<v 1>If</v>

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.730
<v 0>for each I used to be each player,</v>

21
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.760
I have a choice.

22
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.830
So choice.
Here is s I start,

23
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.860
I as part of that profile is a best response

24
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.590
is the best response

25
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.380
<v 1>to [inaudible]</v>

26
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.930
<v 0>the other players choices,
the other players</v>

27
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.023
<v 1>choices.</v>

28
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.280
<v 0>What's the other players choices here?
Oh s minus side style.</v>

29
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.060
So everyone is playing a best response to everyone else,

30
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.120
<v 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.220
<v 0>No,</v>

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.220
this is by far the most commonly used solution concepts in game theory.

33
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.070
So those of you who are interviewing from Mckinsey or something,

34
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.070
you're going to find that they're going to expect you to know what this is.

35
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.020
All right,
so one reason for knowing what it is is because it's in the textbooks.

36
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.550
It's going to be used in lots of applications is going to use in your Mckinsey

37
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:10.220
interview.
That's not a very good reason,
right?

38
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.730
And I certainly don't want you to jump to the conclusion that now we've got to

39
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:14.564
nash equilibrium.

40
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.450
Everything we've done up to now is somehow someone at some sense irrelevant.

41
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.620
That's not the case.

42
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.700
It's not always going to be the case that people always play a nash equilibrium.

43
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.430
For example,
when we played the numbers game,
the game,

44
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:29.060
when you chose a number we've already discussed last week or last time,

45
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.060
that the equilibrium in that game is for everyone to choose one.

46
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.510
But when we actually played the game,
uh,
the average was much higher than that.

47
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.960
The average is about 13.
It is true that when we paid it repeatedly,

48
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.670
it seemed to converge towards one,

49
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.360
but the play of the game when we played at just one shop first time wasn't a

50
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:45.640
Nash Equilibrium,
right?

51
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.250
So we shouldn't have formed the mistake of thinking people always play Nash

52
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:52.370
equilibrium or people if they're rational for Nash equilibrium.

53
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.370
But neither of those statements are true.
Nevertheless,

54
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.800
there are some good reasons,
but thinking about Nash equilibrium,

55
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.360
other than the fact it's used other people,
and let's talk about those a bet.

56
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.270
So what have I done to motivations here?

57
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.460
<v 0>All right.
The first motivation we already discussed last time.
In fact,</v>

59
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.410
somebody in the audience mentioned it and it's the idea of no regrets.

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.800
<v 0>So what does this idea it says,
suppose we're looking at a nash equilibrium.</v>

62
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.690
If we hold the strategies of everyone else fixed,

63
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.220
no individual,

64
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.330
I has an incentive to deviate to move away.

65
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.470
All right?
Say it again.
Holding everyone else's actions fixed.

66
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.730
No individual has an incentive to move away and letting me be a little bit more

67
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:49.440
careful here.
No individual has any strict incentive to move away.
All right,

68
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:50.960
we'll see that that actually matters,
right?

69
00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:53.790
So no individual can do strictly better by moving away.

70
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.520
<v 1>All right?
No individual</v>

71
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.980
can do strictly

72
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.490
strictly batter
by Dva.
Sing.

73
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.980
Hold on,
holding everyone else fixed.

74
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.090
All
right?

75
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.470
<v 0>So why would I call that?
And they regret it means having played the game.</v>

76
00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:31.030
Suppose you did in fact play a Nash equilibrium and then you look back at what

77
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:33.580
you've done and now you know what everyone else has done and you say,

78
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.160
do I regret my actions?
And the answer is no.

79
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.650
I don't regret my actions because I did the best I could give them what they
did.

80
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.680
All right?
So that seems like a fairly important,

81
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.650
so central idea for why we should care about Nash equilibrium.

82
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.060
Here's a second idea and we'll see others arise in the course of today.

83
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.870
The second idea is that a nash equilibrium can be thought of as so fulfilling

84
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.093
<v 1>beliefs.</v>

85
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.870
<v 0>So in the last week or so,
we've talked a fair amount about beliefs.</v>

86
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.150
If I believe the goalkeeper is going to die of this way,

87
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:11.580
I should shoot that way and so on.
All right?

88
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.810
But of course we didn't talk about any beliefs in particular these beliefs.

89
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:20.250
I believe that if everyone in the game believe that everyone else is going to

90
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:23.370
play their part of a particular Nash Equilibrium,

91
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.940
then everyone will in fact play their part

92
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.390
<v 1>about Nash equilibrium.
All right.
Now why?</v>

93
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.130
Why?

94
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.490
<v 0>Why is it the case that everyone believes that everyone else is playing their</v>

95
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:37.760
part of that,
of this particular Nash Equilibrium,

96
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.020
but that Sofa fatigue and people actually will play that.

97
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.180
<v 1>Why is that the case?
Anybody?
Yeah.
Can we,</v>

98
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.130
can we get this guy in red?
Yep.

99
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.810
<v 0>Does your own Nash Equilibrium Strategy is the best response against those?</v>

100
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.940
Cause I played exactly.
So it's,
it's really,

101
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:55.680
it's almost a repeat of the first thing.

102
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.900
If I think everyone else is going to play that,
particularly if I,

103
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:02.690
if I think players two through n are going to play [inaudible] star through as

104
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.860
Enstar,
then by definition my best response is to play us one star.

105
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.790
So I will in fact pay my part of the Nash Equilibrium.
Right?
Good,
good.
All right.

106
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.390
So as part of the definition,
you can see these are self fulfilling beliefs.

107
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.980
Let's just remind ourselves how that arose in the example we looked at at the

108
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:22.450
end last time.
I'm not going to go back and reanalyze it by a hundred.

109
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.140
Sort of make sure that we followed it.
So we had this Patria last time

110
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.900
in the,
in the partnership game in which people were choosing effort levels

111
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.200
and this,

112
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.920
this line was the best response for player one as a function of player two's

113
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.770
choice.

114
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.310
And this lion was the best response of player to uh,

115
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.800
as a function of player once choice.
All right.

116
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.730
There's the pitch we saw last time and let's just look at how there's no secret

117
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.580
here.
What the Nash Equilibrium is.
Nash equilibrium is where the lines cross.

118
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.930
But let's just see how it maps up to those,
those two motivations we've got said.

119
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.120
So how about self fulfilling beliefs?
Well,
if player,
sorry,

120
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.350
I put one management tool.

121
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.090
If play a one believes that player two is going to choose this strategy,

122
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.000
then play a one should choose this strategy.

123
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.700
Play one thing to play a tourist using this strategy.

124
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.110
Then player one should choose this strategy.

125
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.590
Play one thing to play a Tuesdays in this strategy than prayer.

126
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.560
One should do this draft and so on.
That's what it means to be a best response.

127
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.430
But if player one thing to play a two is playing exactly

128
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.210
her Nash Strategy,

129
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.260
then play a one's best response is to respond by playing his na strategy.

130
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.930
And conversely,

131
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.000
if player two things play a one is playing his nash strategy,

132
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.980
then play a tos.
Best response indeed is to play her math strategy.

133
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.620
All right?
So you can see that as self fulfilling belief.

134
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:56.480
If both people think that's what's going to happen,

135
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.810
that is indeed what's going to happen.
All right,

136
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.780
how about the idea of no regrets?
So here's player one.

137
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.850
She wakes up the next morning.
I was,
he was,
he was,
he wasn't.

138
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.500
He wakes up the next morning and he says,
I chose s one star.
Do I regret this?

139
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.750
Well now he knows what play a to chose by a tutors as two star and he says,
no,

140
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.000
that's the best I could have done given the player to didn't factories as to

141
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.250
star.
I have no regrets about shooting us one star.

142
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.510
That in fact was my best response and there's just,
that wouldn't be true.

143
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.660
It's another outcome.
So for example,
if player,

144
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:31.661
what if player one had chosen s one star but play a to a chosen some other

145
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:34.700
strategy,
let's say s two prime,

146
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.030
then play a one would have regrets,
might play.

147
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:39.640
One would wake up the next morning and say,

148
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.930
I thought player one was going to play us to star.
In fact,
she chose us to prime.

149
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.600
I regret having chosen s one star.

150
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.660
I would have rather chosen as one prime only at the Nash equilibrium are the no

151
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.100
regrets.
Right?
Everyone okay with that?

152
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.520
This is just revisiting really what we did last time and underlining these

153
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:01.350
points.
All right,

154
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.220
so I want to spend quite a lot of time today just getting used to the idea of

155
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.610
Nash Equilibrium and trying to find now she could ever,

156
00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:11.500
am I going to turn off that projector that's in the way that I can.
Okay.

157
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.230
Is that going to upset the lights a lot?
All right.
So,
okay,
so uh,

158
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.070
what I want to do is I want to look at some very simple games with a small

159
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.820
number of players to start with and a small number of strategies and I want us

160
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.380
to get used to how we would find Nash Equilibria in those simple gains.
Okay.

161
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.740
We'll start slowly and then we'll get a little faster.
Okay.

162
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.360
So let's start with this game.

163
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.320
Very simple game with two players.
Each player has three strategies.

164
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.770
I'm not going to motivate this game.
It's just some random game play.

165
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.120
A one can choose up,
middle or down and play.

166
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:53.121
A two can choose left center and right and the payoffs are as follows,

167
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.090
zero four (405) 340-0453 again,

168
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.560
three five

169
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.210
three five and six six

170
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.710
all right,
so we can discuss.
We,
if,

171
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.810
if we had more time we could actually play this game,

172
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:23.310
but it isn't politically exciting games.
Let's,

173
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.400
let's leave our playing for later and instead let's try and figure out what are

174
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.370
the Nash Equilibria in this game and how are we going to go about finding the

175
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.570
right and the way we're going to go out.

176
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:36.540
Finding them is going to mimic what we did last time.

177
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.930
Last time we had a more complicated game and which was two players with a

178
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.040
containment strategies.

179
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.510
And what we did was we figured out play a one's best responses and play a tos

180
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.140
best responses,

181
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.650
pay a one's best response to what player two's doing and play a tos best

182
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:51.390
response to what player one's doing.

183
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.720
And then we looked where they coincided and that was the Nash Equilibrium.

184
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.140
And we're going to do exactly the same in this simple game here.

185
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.910
So we're going to start off by figuring out what play one's best response looks

186
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:05.700
like.
All right,
so in particular,

187
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.600
what would be player ones best response

188
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.580
if player to chooses left or be play one's best response if player to chooses

189
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.990
left.
Let's get the mics up so I can sort of,

190
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.620
<v 1>uh,
um,
challenge people.</v>

191
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.550
Anybody not at not such a hard question.

192
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.410
<v 0>Do you want it to try that?
The woman in the middle?
Uh,
who's closer to the room?</v>

193
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.513
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.290
<v 0>Mm.
Okay.
So,
so,
uh,</v>

195
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.520
play a one's best response in this case is middle.
All right?

196
00:11:42.521 --> 00:11:46.630
Because four is bigger than zero and is bigger than three.
Alright,

197
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.980
so to more cat facts,

198
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.040
what will we can do is let's put a circle like in Green as put a circle

199
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.660
round that round that for,
okay.
Hi.
Not Hard,
right?
It's nice to do it again.

200
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.730
What does play a one's best response

201
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.110
player to choose this center?

202
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.340
What does play a one's best response?
If player to choose a sentence,

203
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.550
get somebody on the other side.
Uh,
uh,

204
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:18.620
so what do you should feel free to cold call somebody here?
So,
uh,
just,
uh,

205
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.160
how about Calico Cabot Cochran and the guy with the Yale football shirt on?

206
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.470
Here we go up.
All right.
So [inaudible] is the correct answer.

207
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.190
All right.
So say one triumph for Yale at war.
Okay.
So,
all right,
so,

208
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.690
so four is bigger than three.
Bigger than zero.
All right,
so good.
Thank you.

209
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.070
All right,
and uh,
Ali,
why don't you do the same,
why don't you call,

210
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:43.810
call somebody who's going to tell me what's the best response for player one?
Uh,

211
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.660
to uh,
to write

212
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.380
down.
Down.
Down.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
uh,

213
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.070
best response is down because six is bigger than five,
which is bigger than five.

214
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.340
Six is bigger than five.
Okay.
All right.
All right.

215
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.840
So what we've done here is we've found player one's best response to left center

216
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.980
and best response to right and in passing,

217
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.000
notice that each of player one strategies is the best response to something.

218
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.050
So nothing would be knocked out by our domination arguments here and nothing

219
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:17.771
would be knocked out.

220
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.580
Clay are never a best response arguments yet for player one.
Okay?

221
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.080
Okay,
let's do the same.
The play too.

222
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.530
So why don't I keep the Mike's doing some cold calling.

223
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:30.820
So when they don't you want to cold call somebody at the back to tell me what is

224
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.590
play a tos best response against up.

225
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.790
Let's play a tos.
Best response against up.

226
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.290
It's probably in there.
Yeah.
Um,
left.
All right.
So,

227
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:50.010
so the gentleman in blue says left because four is bigger than three is bigger

228
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:51.290
than zero.
Let's uh,

229
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.290
switch colors and switch 'em polygons and uh,
you know,

230
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.810
put squares around these.
Okay.
All right.

231
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.650
I don't insist on the circles and the squares and you have a thing back second

232
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.230
that you can do that too.
Whatever you want.
All right.
All right.
What's,
uh,

233
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.140
what's play a tune?
It's right in here.
The answer is,

234
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:11.340
the answer was that the best response was left.
All right.

235
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.400
And play a twos best response to middle.
Uh,

236
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.600
so much you don't end up doing to grab somebody over there,

237
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.960
center it out center.
All right.
Because,

238
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.560
because four is bigger than through to bigger than zero.

239
00:14:28.561 --> 00:14:32.220
So that sensor and then my color coding,
like which me,

240
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.450
it gives me a square here.
And finally,
uh,

241
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.480
play a tos best response to down and turn away.

242
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.123
Let's grab somebody.

243
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.813
<v 1>Ah,</v>

244
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 0>laugh.
I'm sorry.
Right now he writes.
Okay,
good.</v>

245
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.840
Good cause because six is bigger than five again.
Okay.
So,
so here we go.

246
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.001
All right.

247
00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:03.001
So what we've done now is found play a one's best response function.

248
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:07.580
That was just the analog of finding the best response line we did here.

249
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.590
Here we drew it as a straight line and whites,

250
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.700
but we could have drawn it as a sequence of little circles in green.

251
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.850
It would have looked like this,
right?
And same idea.

252
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.390
We're not going to do the whole thing,
right?

253
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.150
It'll be a whole bunch of circles looking like this.

254
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.930
And then we found play a tos best response for each choice of player one.

255
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:27.460
And we used pink rectangles and that's the same ideas we did over here.
Here.

256
00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:30.470
We did it in a continuous strategies in Calc,
but it's the same idea.

257
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.190
So imagine I'm drawing lots of pink rectangles and again,
I'm not going to do it,

258
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:37.940
but you can do it in your notes.
Okay.
All right.
Same basic idea.

259
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.230
And just as the Nash equilibrium must be where these best response lines

260
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.670
coincided here because that's the point at which each player is playing a best

261
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:48.380
response to each other.
All right,

262
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.300
so the Nash equilibrium over here is drum roll tide on a,
on a cold call.

263
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.040
Somebody you want a coke,

264
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.120
just grab somebody in the row behind you or something or whatever.
Yeah.

265
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.280
Anybody,
anybody?
All right?
Yeah,
yeah,

266
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.280
I think you were in Italia Italia soccer shirt you get,

267
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.100
you're going to get picked on.
So,
so,
okay,
so what's the Nash Equilibrium here?
Uh,

268
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.280
the bottom right's where?
All right,

269
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.290
so the downright scratch the Nash Equilibrium here is no prizes in a World Cup

270
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.550
for that one is,
is downright.
All right.
All right,

271
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.680
so why is that the Nash Equilibrium?

272
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.820
Because at that point play a one is playing a best response to play a two and

273
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:29.390
play a two is playing our best pumps to play a one right now I want to try and

274
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:29.931
convince you,

275
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:32.450
particularly those of you who are worried by the homework assignment,

276
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.080
that that was not rocket science.
Right?
Right.

277
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.920
It's not hard to find that equilibrium games.
All right,

278
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:43.490
what didn't take us very long and we went pretty slow actually.
Alright,

279
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.160
so let's look at another example.
Oh,

280
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.030
before I do,
there was just before I leave this game,

281
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.250
make one of the remark notice in this game that are each strategy of player one

282
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.160
is the best response to something and each strategy of player two is the best

283
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:01.994
responses on thing.

284
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.930
So how we use the methods of the earlier on the class as to say if do eating

285
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:09.350
Donnie his strategies or reading strategies that are never a best response.

286
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.220
We've gotten nowhere in this game.
All right,
all right,
so now she couldn't run.

287
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.100
It goes a little further in narrowing down our predictions,

288
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.290
but we also learn something from that we all,

289
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:23.291
you'd lost time and in the last few weeks that rationality or even mutual

290
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:27.530
knowledge of rationality or even common knowledge of rationality couldn't really

291
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:31.130
get as much further than deleting dominated strategies or if you like deleting

292
00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:33.620
strategists that are never the best responses.
All right,

293
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.800
so here we've concluded that the Nash Equilibrium of this game is downright a

294
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:39.980
very particular prediction.

295
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:45.190
But notice a perfectly rational player could here could choose middle.

296
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.870
The reason they could choose middle player,
one could choose middle.

297
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:51.630
It's is could be that if they say rationally they should choose middle because

298
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:54.720
they think by a two is choosing left and they'd say,
you say,

299
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:57.060
well why would you think play a two is gonna choose left?

300
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.081
And I'll play a one can say,

301
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:02.040
I think player two is going to choose left because player to thinks I'm going to

302
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:04.110
play up.
And then you say,

303
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.010
but how could play a to possibly think that you're going to play up and and pay

304
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:09.720
one would you say,
I think play a two things.

305
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:14.040
I'm going to play up because player two things that I think that he's going to

306
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:17.640
play center and then you could say how good play a two pump,
etc.
Etc.
Etc.

307
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.820
And you could see you could work us off round little cycle that nobody would be

308
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.750
irrational to anything.

309
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.570
Everything will be perfectly well justified in terms of beliefs.

310
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.700
It's just we wouldn't have a nice uh,

311
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.390
fixed point who'd have a nice point where it's a simple arguments,
uh,

312
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.680
in case of downright play a one thinks it's okay to play down because he thinks

313
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.960
Tuesday pay.
Right and pay a two things to payment,
right?

314
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.770
Cause he thinks payer once in the bay down.
Right.
So just to,

315
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.410
just to underline what I'm saying,
rather messily that rationality and that,

316
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:47.340
that those kinds of arguments should not lead us to the conclusion that people

317
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:51.020
necessarily play Nash Equilibrium.
All right.
All right.
We good?

318
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.690
We need a little bit more.
You do it more than that.
Nevertheless,

319
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.780
we are going to focus on Nash equilibrium in the cost.

320
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.980
All right,
let's have a look at another example

321
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.260
and again,
we'll keep it,
keep it simple for now and we'll keep to a two player.

322
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.760
Three strategy game.

323
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.130
Oh middle down left center,
right.

324
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.960
And this time the payoffs are as follows.

325
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.020
0223431113

326
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.020
two zero zero zero three one zero s and eight zero s this is a slightly messier

327
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.320
game.

328
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.840
The numbers were really just whatever came into my head when I was writing it

329
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:52.630
down.
And once again,

330
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.380
we want to find out what's the Nash equilibrium is in this game.

331
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.990
And our method is exactly the same.
We're going to from each player,

332
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.860
figure out their best responses for each possible choice of the other player.

333
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.360
So rather than write out a thought,

334
00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:11.740
let me just go straight to my green circles and red squares and,
uh,

335
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.190
let me get my makes up again.
All right,
so we can cold call people a bed.

336
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.320
All right.
Can I get the,
uh,
where's my,
where's the Michael.
Thank you.
Thank you.

337
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.620
All right.
So,
uh,

338
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.750
Ali do want just grab somebody and ask them what's the best response against the

339
00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:26.584
left?

340
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.803
<v 2>Okay.</v>

341
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.630
<v 0>Can Grab anybody.
What's the best ones?
Gonna say middle.
Middle.
Okay,
good,</v>

342
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.920
good.
So middle is the best response against left because 11 is bigger than zero.

343
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.200
All right.
Uh,
murder than you to get to grab somebody.

344
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:44.160
What's the restaurant against center?
Middle.
Middle again,

345
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:48.550
because three is bigger than two is bigger than one.
And uh,

346
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.650
grab something at the back.
And some of the best responses against.
Right?
Anybody?

347
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.510
Anybody?
Just a dive in?
Yup.
Down.
Uh,

348
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.590
okay.
Dot.
Down.
Good.
All right.

349
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.950
And let's do the same for,
uh,
the column player.

350
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.960
So what's the colon players?
Uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

351
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:11.530
la.

352
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.710
If I find somebody to take the guys two rows behind you is about to fall asleep

353
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.240
and ask him what's the best response to up,
um,

354
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.320
the best response would beach for which,

355
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:27.190
which player to play at sees what's what's player to best response for up?
Sorry,

356
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:29.420
I'm just going to pick on someone else's,
right.

357
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.840
What's the best response for a CNR or tired?
So C or are,

358
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.400
all right.
So this is a slightly more tricky one,
right?

359
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:43.600
The best response to up is either C or are,

360
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.640
this is why we've got you to sign this legal forms,
right?
Okay.

361
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.610
Best wants to op is either C or are the best response to middle.
Don't happen.

362
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.480
Yep.
Man.
Center is center.
Thank you.

363
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.750
And the best response to down.

364
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

365
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.550
<v 0>Left.
All right,
so the best ones to down is face left.</v>

366
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.250
And here again,
it didn't take us very long.
We're getting quicker at this.

367
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.410
The Nash Equilibrium in this case is now she can,

368
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.870
let's go back to the guy who was asleep and uh,

369
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.250
give me an easier question this time.

370
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.750
So Nash equilibrium in this case is nash equilibrium would be,
uh,

371
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.370
the three two combinations,
but exactly.
Okay.
So the,
the,
the middle,

372
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.300
the Middle Center.
All right.
I noticed this is the Nash Equilibrium.

373
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.300
Why is it matter collaborate?

374
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.970
Because each player is playing a best response to each other,
right?

375
00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:39.420
If I'm a player one,
and I think that player two is playing center,

376
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:40.970
I should play metal and one player too.

377
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.840
I think Pi wanted playing middle aged should play sensor.

378
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.770
If in fact we play this way,
neither person has any regrets.

379
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.680
Those they didn't do particularly well in this game in particular player one

380
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.040
would have liked to get this 11 on this eight.
All right.

381
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.090
But they don't regret that action because given that player to play center,

382
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.450
the best they could have got was three,
which they got by playing middle.

383
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.180
Right now,
just in passing in this game,

384
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.650
there's just in passing that best responses needn't be unique,

385
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.790
right?
Sometimes it can be a tie in your best response.
Okay.
That can happen.

386
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.250
All right,
so what don't we see?

387
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.260
We've seen out of financial equilibrium and clearly it's very closely related to

388
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:20.940
the idea of best response,

389
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.350
which is an idea we've been developing over the last week or so.
All right,

390
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.620
but let's go back.
Oh,

391
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.420
they're in the course and ask how does it relate to the idea of dominance,
right?

392
00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:33.120
We already [inaudible].
This is really our third concept in this course,
right?

393
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.010
We had a concept about dominance.

394
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.610
We had a concert about best response and now we're at Nash equilibrium.
It's,

395
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.910
I think,
obvious how it relates to best response,

396
00:23:40.911 --> 00:23:45.910
which when Bester Fontis coincide,
how about how it relates to dominoes?

397
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.660
Wow.
To do that,
let's go back.
We're going to do is

398
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.180
we're going to relate

399
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.890
nash equilibrium to idea

400
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.920
of dominance or don't of domination.
All right?

401
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.270
And to do that obvious place to start is to go back to a game that we've seen

402
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:09.104
before.

403
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.260
So here's a game where player one and player two are choosing Alpha and Beta,

404
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.200
and the payoffs are zero zero three minus one minus one three and one one.

405
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.540
All right?
So this is the game we saw the first time.

406
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.770
This is the prisoner's dilemma.
All right?
And we know in this game,

407
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.750
I'm not going to bother to cold call people for it.

408
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.770
We know in this game that Bita is dominated,

409
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.680
is strictly,
it's strictly dominated

410
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.120
by Alpha,
right?
It's like we learned the very first time,
right?

411
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.940
Just to check.
All right?
So against Alpha,
uh,
against Alpha Alpha,
uh,

412
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.400
choosing Alpha gets you zero B to get to minus one against Bita.

413
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.460
Choosing Alpha gets you three bet against you.
One.
In either case,

414
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.370
Alpha is strictly better.
So Alpha Strip it on its feet.

415
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:05.960
And of course it's the same,
but the column player,

416
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.830
since the Games completely similar.
All right?
So now that's fine.

417
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:12.290
The Nash Equilibrium in this game,
I think we know what it's going to be.

418
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:17.220
All right,
but let's just do it in a sort of a slow away.
All right?
So,
uh,

419
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.750
the best response to Alpha must be alpha.

420
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.270
The best response to Bita must be alpha.
And for the column player,

421
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.630
the best response to Alpha,
we'll do it in pink,

422
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:34.631
was the best responders to Alpha must be Alpha and the best restaurants to Biesa

423
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.530
must be alpha.
Everyone okay with that?

424
00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:40.610
And just kind of rushing it a bit because it's kind of obvious,
is that right?

425
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.420
Okay.
And so the Nash Equilibrium in this game,

426
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.350
I'm actually glad room is Alpha Alpha.
In other words,

427
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.950
it's what we would have arrived at how we just deleted strictly dominated

428
00:25:54.951 --> 00:25:55.784
strategies.

429
00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.500
And so here's a case where Alpha strictly dominates Bita and sure enough nash

430
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:02.810
equilibrium coincides.
It gives us the same answer.

431
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.710
Both people choose Alpha in this game.
All right?
So there's nothing,

432
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.700
there's no news here.

433
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.540
I'm just checking that we're not getting anything weird going on.
All right,

434
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.690
so let's ask me a bit more careful.
All right,

435
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.000
how do we know it's the case?

436
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:22.030
So I'm going to claim it to the case that no strictly dominated strategy.

437
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:23.210
In this case,
Bita,

438
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.300
no strictly dominated strategy could ever be played in an actual equilibrium.

439
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.240
So I,
I claim that that's a good thing,
right?
Because we want,

440
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.100
we want these ideas to coincide.

441
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.550
I claimed that no strictly dominated strategy could ever be played

442
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.210
internationally.
Equilibrium.
Why is that the case?
Yeah,
there's a,
there's a a guy,

443
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.053
okay.
Yeah.

444
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.830
Strictly dominated strategy isn't the best response to anything.

445
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:53.100
So it couldn't be the best response to,
to the net,
to their plan,

446
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:54.570
the Nash Equilibrium.
Good.
Very good.

447
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:59.100
So strictly dominated strategy is never a best prompts to anything in
particular.

448
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.790
The thing that dominates,
it always does better.
All right?
So in particular,

449
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.460
it can't be a best response to the thing being played in Nashik,
whatever.

450
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.340
All right?
So that's actually a good,
good proof that proves,

451
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.770
that knows strictly dominated strategy could ever be played in a national

452
00:27:12.771 --> 00:27:17.220
[inaudible].
But now we have unfortunately a little wrinkle.

453
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.480
The wrinkle,
the wrinkle,

454
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:25.110
unfortunately is weekly domination is weak domination.

455
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.840
So we've argued if it was fairly easy to argue that no strictly dominated

456
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:35.250
strategy is ever going to reappear annoyingly in a nash equilibrium.

457
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.190
But unfortunately the same is not true about weekly donated strategies.

458
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.060
And in some sense you had a foreshadowing of this problem a little bit on the

459
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:47.750
homework assignment where you saw on one of the problem,

460
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.560
I think it was the second problem on the homework assignment,

461
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.150
that deleting weekly dominated strategies can lead you to do things that might

462
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.670
make you feel a little bit uneasy.
All right?

463
00:27:56.671 --> 00:28:01.410
So we can donate week domination is really not such a secure notion as strict

464
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:05.730
domination.
And we'll see here as a trivial example of that in the game.

465
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.680
Here's a trivial example on an interesting example,
but it just makes the point.

466
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.560
So here's a two way to game play.

467
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:18.561
A one can choose up or down and play a two confused left or rights and the

468
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.910
payoffs are really trivial.
One one zero,
zero,
zero,

469
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:27.930
zero,
zero,
zero.
All right,

470
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.920
so let's figure out what the Nash Equilibrium is in this game.

471
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:36.200
And I'm not going to bother cold calling because it's,
it's too easy.
So,
uh,

472
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:41.290
the best response for player one player two players left is clear to shoes up.

473
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:48.290
And the best response of player one if player to choose his rights is,

474
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:52.650
well,
I,
the apple down,
we'll do right cause either way he gets or she gets zero.

475
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.390
So these are both best responses,
is that correct?

476
00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:01.460
They're both restaurants is they both do equally well.
All right.
And uh,

477
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.690
conversely play,
uh,
to uh,

478
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.740
play a tos best response if play a one shoes is up,

479
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.940
is sure enough to choose left.
And that's kind of the answer we'd like to have.

480
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.720
But unfortunately,
when player one plays down,

481
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.900
play or two's best response is either left or right,

482
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.910
it makes no difference.
They get zero either way.
All right.

483
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.630
Okay.
So what are the national clever in this game?

484
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.350
What are the Nash Equilibrium in this game?
So notice,

485
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.540
first observation is there's more than one now she could ever in this game,

486
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.600
right?
We haven't seen that before.
All right.

487
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.760
There's a nash equilibrium with everybody in the room,
I think.

488
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.230
I hope thinks he's kind of the sensible prediction in this game.
All right.

489
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.750
In this game.
I think all of you,
I hope all of you,

490
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:52.440
if your player one would choose up and all of you have played,

491
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.480
two would choose left.
Is that right?
Is that correct?
I just make it,

492
00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.490
it's hard to imagine coming up with an argument that wouldn't lead you to choose

493
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.720
up and left in this game.
All right?
However,
unfortunately,

494
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.330
unfortunately that isn't it.

495
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.470
This isn't the unfortunate upper left is a nash equilibrium,

496
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.980
but so is downright

497
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.220
<v 1>right.</v>

498
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.630
<v 0>If play a two is choosing,</v>

499
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:27.631
writes your best response weekly is to choose down if play a one is choosing

500
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:32.080
down play a tos best response weekly is to choose,
right?

501
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.913
<v 1>All right,</v>

502
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.440
<v 0>and here we are here.
What this is,
uh,</v>

503
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.310
arriving because of the definition of national it,
it,
it's,

504
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320
it's a very definitely definition.
When we,

505
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.150
when we looked at the police didn't have in mind what is the definition we said

506
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.510
something isn't actually collaborate with each person that's playing the best

507
00:30:47.511 --> 00:30:48.271
response to each other.

508
00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:53.271
And we have seen that is no player has a strict incentive to deviate.

509
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.110
No pay.
I can do strictly better by moving away.
So here it down.

510
00:30:58.111 --> 00:31:02.610
Rights play a one doesn't do strictly better,
it's just a tie.

511
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:07.710
If she moves away and play a two doesn't do strictly better.

512
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.740
If he moves away,
it's a tie.
He gets early either way.

513
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.310
So here we have something which is going to worry us going on in the course.

514
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.900
Sometimes we're getting not getting many,
many.
Now she put a right out.
So that's,

515
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.020
that's,
that's something which I shouldn't worry as well is it's a fact of life.

516
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.180
But in this case,
one of the Nash Equilibria seems silly,
right?

517
00:31:27.181 --> 00:31:27.880
I mean if you,
if you,

518
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.300
if you went and tried to explain to your roommates and said,

519
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.110
I predict both of these outcomes in this game,
they'd laugh at you.

520
00:31:34.111 --> 00:31:37.110
It's obvious in some sense that this has to be the sensible protection.

521
00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.493
<v 1>All right,</v>

522
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.260
<v 0>so just that sort of worrying notes before we move on.
Okay.</v>

523
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.910
So this was pretty formal and kind of,
uh,
not very exciting so far.

524
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.290
So let's try and move on to something a little bit more fun.
Okay.

525
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.920
So what I want to do now is I want to get a different game.
Again,

526
00:31:56.921 --> 00:31:58.840
we're going to try and find Nash equilibrium in this game,

527
00:31:58.841 --> 00:31:59.830
but we're going to do more than that.

528
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:03.280
We're going to talk about the game of bed and a feature of this game,

529
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.410
which is uh,
to,

530
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.050
to distinguish it from what we've done so far is the game of went to look at

531
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.720
involves many players.

532
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.160
Although each player only has few strategies.
All right?

533
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.490
So I want to do is I want to convince you how to find an artist to discuss how

534
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:23.020
to find Nash Equilibria in the game,
which unlike these games,

535
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.390
it doesn't just have to players,
it has many players,

536
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.210
but fortunately not many strategist per player.

537
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.900
<v 1>All right?
So let me use this board.</v>

538
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.160
All right,

539
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.100
<v 0>so this is going be called the investment</v>

540
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.933
<v 1>game</v>

541
00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.080
<v 0>and we're going to play this game,
although not for real.
All right?</v>

542
00:32:50.081 --> 00:32:53.100
So the players in this game,
I was,

543
00:32:53.101 --> 00:32:58.101
I just suggested the players are going to be you.

544
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.410
All right?
So everyone who was getting sleepy,

545
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.880
just looking at this kind of analysis should wake up.
Now.
You have to play.

546
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:09.670
All right?
And the strategies in this game,
a very simple strategy sense.

547
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.280
Well,
the strategy will turn.

548
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.150
It says each of you can choose between investing

549
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.740
nothing in a class,

550
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.680
project zero or

551
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.500
invest $10 alright,

552
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.630
I'm just gonna refer to investing.
Nothing as not investing.
Is that okay?

553
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.400
All right.
And it seems like a natural thing.

554
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:43.020
You're either going to invest $10 or nothing.
I you're not gonna Invest.

555
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.850
All right?
So that's the players.
And those are the strategies.
So as usual,

556
00:33:47.851 --> 00:33:52.370
we're missing something we're missing are the payoffs.
Alright?

557
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.460
So here are the payoffs.

558
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.760
So the offs was follows.
If you don't invest,

559
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.080
if you do not invest,
I invest nothing,

560
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:11.180
then you'll pay off.
Is there?
All right,

561
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.960
so nothing ventured,
nothing gained,
right?
Natural thing,
right?

562
00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.080
But if you do invest,

563
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:21.763
<v 1>yeah,</v>

564
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:23.800
<v 0>that's right.
If you invest $10,</v>

565
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.930
remember each of you is gonna be investing $10 then your individual payoffs are

566
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:31.540
as follows.
Here's the good news.

567
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.080
You're going to get a profit of $5 where this isn't a work is you're going to

568
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.420
invest in $10 you'll make a gross profit of 15 minus the 10 year originally

569
00:34:43.421 --> 00:34:46.210
invested for a net of five I don't understand,
right?

570
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:50.560
So a net profit to $5 net profit,

571
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.460
that's the good news.
But that requires

572
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.280
more than 90% of the class to invest

573
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.060
greater than equal to 90% of the class turn faster than if more than 90% of the

574
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:09.880
class invest,

575
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.840
you're going to make essentially 50% profit.

576
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:20.190
And unfortunately the bad news is you're going to lose your $10,

577
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.940
get nothing back,
right?
So this is a net loss

578
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.600
if fewer

579
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.010
than 90% of the class
in best.

580
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.600
All right?
I need a key here.
You're not allowed to talk to each other,

581
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.120
alright?
No communication in the class.
No hands evolves,
no secret winks,
right?

582
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:48.720
Nothing else.
All right.
Okay.
So everyone understand the game,

583
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.760
including up on the boat.
Everyone.
I'm sound the game.
All right?

584
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.640
So what I want you to do,
I should say,
first of all,

585
00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.300
we can't play this game for real cause I cause there's something like 250 and

586
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:02.380
you want to,
I don't have that kind of cache line,
right?
Right.

587
00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.320
So we're not pretend or playing this for real.
Okay.
Tell I'm playing with story.

588
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.800
All right?
So without communicating,

589
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.210
I want each of you to right on the corner of your notepad,

590
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.310
whether you're going to invest or not.
So you can write why.

591
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:20.370
If you're going to invest.
And M if you're not going to invest,

592
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.700
I discussed it with each other.
Just write down on the corner of your notepad.

593
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.240
Why?
If you're gonna invest an n,
if you're not going to,

594
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.070
don't,
don't discuss it guys.
I'm discuss it.
All right?
And now show,

595
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.400
show your neighbor what you did just so you can,

596
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.490
your neighbor can make he make you honest.

597
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.970
All right,
now.
Okay,
let's have a show of hands.
All right.

598
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.270
So what I want to do is I wonder,
I wonder how a show of hands,

599
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.290
everybody who invested,
everyone don't look around.
Just raise your hands.

600
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.400
Everyone who invested in everyone who didn't invest.
Oh,

601
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:05.280
that's more than 10% all right,
so let's do that again.

602
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.260
So everyone who invested raise their hands,

603
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:10.990
raise their hands and everyone who didn't invest raise their hands.

604
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.800
So I didn't know what that is.
Maybe it's about half and half.

605
00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.380
So now I'm thinking we should play this game for real.

606
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.480
I want to just get some discussion going about this,
right?
What I want,

607
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.490
I'm going wanting to discuss this for a while.

608
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:27.190
There's lots to be said about this game.
Uh,
that'd be borrow that.

609
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.590
Can I borrow this?
All right,
so,
uh,
this guy.
Okay.

610
00:37:32.591 --> 00:37:37.300
So what did you do?
I invest it.
And why did you invest?

611
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.760
Uh,
cause

612
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:47.300
I think I can lose $10.
All right.
All right.
All right,
so he's rich.

613
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.430
That's okay.
It's okay.
You can,
you can pay for lunch.
It's right.
That's all right.

614
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.190
All right.
Who didn't invest in it?
If it's a non investors?
Yeah.

615
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.450
So [inaudible] is one,
so,
okay,
so why didn't you invest?
Shout it out.

616
00:37:56.451 --> 00:38:00.870
So we're going to hear,
I didn't invest because I,
because to make a profit,

617
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.870
there needs to be at least a two to one chance that every else,

618
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.370
that 90% invest our rise to take an expected profit.
Yeah.

619
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:12.330
You only get half back,
but you'd lose the whole thing.
I see.
Okay.
Okay.

620
00:38:12.331 --> 00:38:15.230
So you've been talking,
I've expected estimation.
Uh,
other reasons,

621
00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:19.630
other reasons out there?
Uh,
what did,
what did you do?
I invested.

622
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.370
You're invested with it.
You know,
I'm,
I'm finding the sock is on the road.
Okay,

623
00:38:22.371 --> 00:38:26.810
so you invested why B you stand to gain something.

624
00:38:26.811 --> 00:38:29.630
I don't see why anybody would just not invest because they don't,

625
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.010
they would never get anything.
All right,
so,
so,
so yeah.
Your name is Clayton.

626
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.590
So Clayton saying only by investing can I gain something here?
Not Investing.

627
00:38:37.591 --> 00:38:41.710
It seems kind of,
you know,
it doesn't seem,
uh,
brave in some sense.
Anyone else?

628
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.300
Yeah.

629
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.020
<v 3>Um,</v>

630
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.020
it's basically the same game is the one one zero zero game in terms of both Nash

631
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.790
Equilibria.
Um,
but the payoffs aren't like the same scale.
Um,

632
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.140
and uh,
yeah,
you'd have to really risk averse not to invest.

633
00:38:58.141 --> 00:39:01.130
So I thought people would be,
so you're investing I invest in,

634
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.650
<v 0>yeah.
All right.
All right.
So let me,
let me give this to La for,</v>

635
00:39:03.651 --> 00:39:07.780
I struck the sound system here.
Okay.
So we've got different answers out.

636
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:11.450
If it did,
people can people hear each other's answers?
Abet?
Yup.
Yup.

637
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.340
So we have lots of different views out here.

638
00:39:13.341 --> 00:39:17.030
We have half the people investing and half the people are not investing roughly.

639
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.100
And I think you can make arguments either way.
All right,

640
00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.390
so we'll come back to whether it's exactly the same as the game we just saw.

641
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:23.750
So the argument that a,
I'm sorry,

642
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.690
your name is Patrick made is it looks a lot like the game.

643
00:39:26.691 --> 00:39:29.120
We still got four and we'll,
we'll,
we'll say it is related clearly.

644
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:33.700
It's right in one sentence,
which we'll discuss now.
So,
um,
tell me about,

645
00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.480
I need this thing again.
Sorry.

646
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.900
So what are the Nash Equilibria in this game?

647
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.970
What are the Nash Equilibria in this game?
All right.
We can.

648
00:39:43.971 --> 00:39:46.520
We have a course on his phone message,
but in the meantime,
what are the,

649
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.230
what are the Nash Equilibrium?
This game?
Yeah.
Yeah.

650
00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:49.250
Let me get the woman up here yet.

651
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.543
<v 1>Yep.</v>

652
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.930
<v 0>No one invests and everyone's happy that they didn't lose anything or everyone</v>

653
00:39:56.931 --> 00:40:00.960
invests in.
Everyone's happy.
Good,
good,
so I've forgotten your name.

654
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:06.110
It's a case saying that there are two now she Culebra and with apologies to

655
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.260
shoot.
I'm going to put this on the board.
All right.

656
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.840
There are two Nash Equilibria here.

657
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.180
All right.
One is all invest.

658
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.800
We'll invest and another one is,

659
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

660
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.250
<v 0>No one invest.
All right.
These are both mashed Collibra in this game.</v>

661
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.510
Let's just check that they are exactly the argument that that,

662
00:40:33.511 --> 00:40:38.290
that Kate said that if everyone invests,
then no one would have any regrets.

663
00:40:38.291 --> 00:40:42.010
Everyone's best response would be to invest and if nobody invests,

664
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.910
then everyone would be happy not to have invested.
That would be a best response.

665
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.730
It's just in terms of what Patrick said,
it is again,

666
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:52.360
with two equilibria like the previous game and that there are other similarities

667
00:40:52.361 --> 00:40:54.850
to the previous game,
but it's a little bit of the,

668
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.840
in this case on not quite the same as the other game and the other game,

669
00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.920
that other equilibrium,

670
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:02.620
there's zero zero equilibrium seemed like a silly equilibrium.

671
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.920
It doesn't like we'd ever predicted happening.
Whereas here,
the,

672
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.760
the equilibrium with nobody investing.
Right.

673
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.030
Actually it's quite a plausible equilibrium.
Right.
If,
if,
if,
if,
no,

674
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.690
if I think no one else is investing,
then I strictly preferred not to invest.

675
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.860
Is that right?
Is that right?
Okay.
So two remarks about this.

676
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:26.440
Uh,
I want to do more before I do it moves your remarks.
Um,
yeah.
Well,

677
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:27.910
what do you want?
Let's have one rock at least.

678
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.610
How do we find those Nash Equilibrium?

679
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:37.110
What was our sophisticated mathematical technique for finding the,

680
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:42.230
now she could have burned in this game.
So I should,
we should,
we should take it.

681
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.450
You can you get the mic on,
on,
uh,
is a,

682
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.580
she's k to that,
right?
Yeah.
So how did you find that actually collaborate?
Uh,

683
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.590
I looked for the only two places where,
um,
there's no regrets.

684
00:41:55.850 --> 00:42:00.300
All right?
So,
so in principle,
you could have anything,
I mean that,
that works,

685
00:42:00.301 --> 00:42:00.811
but in principle,

686
00:42:00.811 --> 00:42:04.020
you could have looked at every possible combination and there's lots of possible

687
00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:04.491
combinations.

688
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:09.491
It could have been a combination where 1% invested in 99% didn't and tubes and

689
00:42:09.571 --> 00:42:12.720
invested in [inaudible] 98 didn't.
And so on so forth.
All right.

690
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:13.840
We could've checked rigorous way.

691
00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:15.780
You want everyone's best response was in each case.

692
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.380
But what do we actually ended up doing in this game?
I the method.

693
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.480
Yeah.
Uh,
we got the guy in.
Yeah.

694
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.950
You only consider situations where your action can have a different outcome.

695
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.430
And those only occur when everyone's investing are known.
So that's true.

696
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.670
So that certainly makes it easier.
I claim,
however,
I mean,
you're being,

697
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.640
you're both of you being a more rigorous and more mathematical.

698
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:44.030
I'm tempted to be here.
I think the easy method here,
uh,

699
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.960
the easiest sophisticated math here is to,
is to guess.

700
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:53.390
All right?
My guess is the easy thing to do is just a guest.

701
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:57.230
What flight did have been equilibrium here and then what?
And then check.

702
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.070
All right,
so a good method here in these games

703
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:07.640
is the guests and check and getting check is really not a bad way to try and

704
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:08.474
find.
Actually Collibra.

705
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.540
The reason it's not a bad way is because checking is fairly easy,

706
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.880
right?
Guessing is hard.
You might miss something.
I might be an,

707
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.370
she could have been hidden under a stone somewhere.
All right?

708
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.610
And it's not state in America to rocket and hit on a rock somewhere.
Alright.

709
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.090
Alright.
But checking,
that's something that you slap some Houston economy.

710
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.060
I'm trying to equilibrium checking whether it isn't equilibrium is easy,

711
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.250
cause I only have to do is check that nobody wants to move away.

712
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.750
They want us to deviate,
right?

713
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.720
So I think in practice that's what we're gonna end up doing in this game and it

714
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.380
out to be very easy to get some check,
which is why you're able to find it.
Right?

715
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.940
So guessing check is a very useful method in these games,

716
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.230
whether a lots and lots of players,
but not many strategies per player.

717
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.280
It works pretty well.
All right.

718
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.010
Okay,
now we've got this game up on the board.

719
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:57.080
I want to spend a while discussing x.
It's kind of important,

720
00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:02.300
so I want to do now is order to remind ourselves what happened just now.

721
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.950
So what happened just now?
Can we,

722
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:09.010
can we raise the yeses again or they invest again and raised the non investors?

723
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:12.680
None of us.
And I want to remind you guys,
you all owe me 10 bucks.
All right?

724
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.260
All right.
I want,
I want to do is I want to play it again.

725
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:20.000
No communication right down again on the corner of your notepad.

726
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.923
What you're going to do,

727
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.280
brand communicates.
Don't communicate.
You guys.
All right?
Show your neighbor.

728
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:32.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

729
00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.710
<v 0>All right.
And now we're going to poll again.
So ready without,
without cheating,</v>

730
00:44:36.711 --> 00:44:40.960
without looking around you if you invested,
all right,
let,
let,
let,

731
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.420
let you get a good view of you.
If you invested,
raise your hand now

732
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.800
and if you didn't invest,
you didn't know.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.

733
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.040
Can I look at the investors again?
Raise your hands on this way.
All right.

734
00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:57.500
We've got a few investors still,
so these guys really owed me money now.

735
00:44:57.501 --> 00:45:00.680
That's good.
All right.
All right,
let's do it again.
All right,
third time.

736
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.420
Third time.
Hang on a second.
Ten second.
So third time,
right down.
Write down.

737
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.000
I'm pretend this isn't real cash.
All right.

738
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.890
Now if you invested the third time,
raise your hand.
All right,

739
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:20.160
we've got it.
All right.
This is a few.
Soccer is born every day basically.

740
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.540
All right,
so where are we heading here?
Where are we heading?
Pretty rapidly,

741
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.740
right?
We're heading towards an equilibrium,
right?

742
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:30.430
Just let's make sure we confirm that.

743
00:45:30.431 --> 00:45:33.780
So everyone who didn't invest that third time raise your hands.
All right,

744
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.890
that's pretty close.

745
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:39.600
That show of hands is pretty close to a nash equilibrium strategy,

746
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.790
isn't that right?
Isn't that right?

747
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.240
So here's an example of a third reason when we already mentioned last time,

748
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.070
but a third reason why we might be interested in Nash Equilibria.

749
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.280
There are certain circumstances in which play converges in a natural science.

750
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.040
On the formal sense with a natural sense to an equilibrium.
Right?

751
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:00.850
And we work with the exception of a few dog,

752
00:46:00.851 --> 00:46:02.430
good people who want to pay for my lunch.

753
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.450
Almost everyone else was converging to an equilibrium.
All right,

754
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.340
so play converged

755
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.560
fairly rapidly
to the nash equilibrium.

756
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.163
<v 1>All right,</v>

757
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.840
<v 0>well,
we discussed it with two Nash Equilibria in this game.</v>

758
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.290
Is one of these Nash Equilibria ignoring me for a second?

759
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.490
He's one of these natty collaborate better than the Aba.
Yeah.

760
00:46:29.491 --> 00:46:33.300
Clearly the everyone investing Nash equilibrium is the better ones.
That right?

761
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.021
Everyone agree?

762
00:46:34.021 --> 00:46:38.720
Everyone investing is a better nash equilibrium for everyone in the class than

763
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.950
everyone not investing.
Is that correct?
That's great.
Nevertheless,

764
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.640
where are we were converging in this case was what?
Where are we converging?

765
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:50.410
Was the bad equilibrium,
right?

766
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.760
We were converging rapidly to a very bad equilibrium.
I mean grandma,
which,

767
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:58.410
which no one gets him thing,
which all that money is left on the table.
All right,

768
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.460
so how can that be?
How do we converge to this bad?

769
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:05.070
He groomed to be a bit more formal.
The bad equilibrium,

770
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:09.960
the no invest equilibrium here is Perico dominated by the good equilibrium.

771
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.610
Everybody is strictly better off at the good equilibrium than at the body will

772
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:16.470
ever meet.
Perissa dominates.
Right?

773
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:20.070
To use an expression that you probably learned to one 15 or one 15.
Right?

774
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.700
Nevertheless,
we're going into the bad one.
We're heading to the bad equilibrium.

775
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.140
Why did we end up going to the bad equilibrium rather than the good equilibrium?

776
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.690
Yeah.
Uh,
can we get the guy in the gray?
Yeah.

777
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.690
<v 4>Well it was a,
it was a bit of a bear market for investors,
wasn't it?</v>

778
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.470
<v 0>Just now?
You mean?
All right.
It's okay.
Say what you mean a bit more so yeah,</v>

779
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.990
that's good.
Just say a bit more.

780
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:46.310
<v 4>Um,
so it seemed like it seemed like people,</v>

781
00:47:46.311 --> 00:47:50.180
people didn't have a lot of confidence that,
um,
that other people were,

782
00:47:50.181 --> 00:47:54.050
we're going to invest and so it became a successively,
um,

783
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.640
less desirable options.

784
00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.000
<v 0>Right.
All right.
So,
so one way of saying that was when we started out,</v>

785
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.400
we were offering even whenever you're half,
half,

786
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.310
but that was already bad for the people who invested.
All right.

787
00:48:05.311 --> 00:48:07.530
And then two until we started out at half,
half,

788
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:11.040
which was below that critical threshold of 90% is that right?

789
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:16.020
And from then on in we just tumbled down.
All right,
so one way to say this,

790
00:48:16.021 --> 00:48:20.580
and I want you to think about that is it may matter in this case where we

791
00:48:20.581 --> 00:48:22.530
started,
right?

792
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.860
Suppose the first time we played the game in this class this morning,

793
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:30.210
suppose that 93% of the class had invested,

794
00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.590
in which case there's 93% would all have made money.
Right?

795
00:48:34.591 --> 00:48:37.200
Now I'm I my guests is,
I can't prove this.

796
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.880
My guess is we might have converged the other way and converged up to the good

797
00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:45.540
equilibrium.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
So people,

798
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:47.310
people figured out that they,

799
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.430
people who didn't invest the first time actually they played the bass response

800
00:48:50.431 --> 00:48:52.860
to the class.
So they stayed put.
And those of you who didn't invest,

801
00:48:52.861 --> 00:48:56.610
a lot of you started not investing as you got caught up in this spiral downward.

802
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.630
And we ended up not investing.

803
00:48:57.631 --> 00:49:00.540
But how do we start it off above the critical threshold?

804
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:04.320
The threshold here is 90% and had you made money the first time around,

805
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.770
then it would have been the non investors that would have regretted that choice

806
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.140
and they might've switched into investing and we might,

807
00:49:10.141 --> 00:49:13.760
I'm not saying we necessarily,
but we might have gone the other way.
Yeah.
Let me,

808
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.613
I'm gonna make them

809
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:20.960
30 70 thing where 70% invested.
So that's a good question too.

810
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.610
Suppose we'd been close to the threshold but below.

811
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.830
So I don't know is the answer.
I was thinking over didn't,

812
00:49:25.831 --> 00:49:28.410
we didn't do the experiment,
but it seems likely that the higher,

813
00:49:28.411 --> 00:49:29.820
the closer we got to the threshold,

814
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.300
the better chance there would have been going up.
My guess is,
is this the guest?

815
00:49:33.301 --> 00:49:35.130
My guest is,
if we started below the threshold,

816
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.220
we'd probably have come down and we started above the threshold would probably

817
00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:40.020
have gone up.
But that's not a theorem.
I'm just,

818
00:49:40.021 --> 00:49:44.100
I'm just speculating on what might've happened.
Speculating on your speculations.

819
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.590
Alright,
so here we have a game with two equilibria.
One is good,
one is bad,

820
00:49:49.591 --> 00:49:52.620
one is really quite bad.
It's prey to dominated.
All right.

821
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.920
And notice that what happened here,
the way we,

822
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.280
the way we spiraled down coincides with something we've talked about now.

823
00:49:59.281 --> 00:50:00.300
She put them already.

824
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.480
It coincides with this idea of a self fulfilling prediction as self fulfilling

825
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:10.560
prediction provided you think other people are not going to invest,

826
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.940
you're not going to invest,

827
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:15.990
so it's a self fulfilling prediction to take you down to not investing.

828
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.980
Conversely,
provided everyone thinks everyone else is going to invest,

829
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.340
then you're going to go up to the good equilibrium and I think corresponds to

830
00:50:23.341 --> 00:50:27.410
what the gentleman said in the middle about a bear market versus a bull,
right?

831
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:28.430
It was a bear market.

832
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.830
It looked like everyone else didn't have confidence in everyone else's and

833
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:34.370
fasting and then that was a self fulfilling prophecy and we ended up with no

834
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:35.204
investment.

835
00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:36.960
<v 1>All right.
All right.</v>

836
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.160
<v 0>Okay.
Now we've seen the bad outcomes in the class before.</v>

837
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.160
For example,
the very first day we saw a prisoner's dilemma,
right?

838
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.170
But I claim that though were getting a bad outcome here in the class.

839
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.100
This is not a prisoner's dilemma,
right?
Why is this not a prisoner's dilemma?

840
00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.590
What's different between both games have an equilibrium,

841
00:50:59.591 --> 00:51:03.400
which is bad prisoner's dilemma and has the bad equilibrium where nobody tide is

842
00:51:03.401 --> 00:51:05.200
there room on both guys go to jail.

843
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.490
But I claim that is not a prisoner's dilemma that [inaudible] to behind you.

844
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.450
No one suffers,
but no one gets any fun in this.
Okay.

845
00:51:13.451 --> 00:51:15.850
So maybe they don't come isn't quite so bad.
That's fair enough.

846
00:51:15.851 --> 00:51:18.850
I could have made it worse.
Right?
You could've made it sort of,
uh,
you know,
um,

847
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.320
I could have made that.

848
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.700
I could have lowered the payoffs some type of a pretty bad what,

849
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.670
why else is this another person in that the woman who's behind him that matter

850
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.280
because there's no strictly dominant strategy.
Good,
good.

851
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.480
So prisoner's dilemma playing Alpha was always a best response.

852
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.380
What led us to the bad outcome and prisoner's dilemma was the Alpha,
the,
the uh,

853
00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:41.950
the defense strategy,
the,
the,
the non corporate strategy.

854
00:51:41.951 --> 00:51:46.720
Then not helping tidy your room strategy was always the best thing to do here.

855
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.850
And sometimes the good thing,
the moral thing in some sense is to invest.

856
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:55.300
But it's not the case that not investing dominates investing.

857
00:51:55.301 --> 00:51:58.420
In fact of all the people invest in the room,
you want to invest.
Is that right?

858
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.450
All right.
So this is,
this is,
this is a social problem,

859
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:06.190
but it's not a social problem of the form of a prisoner's dilemma.
All right,

860
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.620
so what kind of problem is this
kind of social problem?

861
00:52:10.621 --> 00:52:15.210
Is this say the guy in front of you?
Perhaps this one of a cooperation.

862
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:19.230
It's one of,
okay.
So it's,
it would help if people cooperate.
Did he here,

863
00:52:19.231 --> 00:52:21.990
but I'm looking for a different times.
I turned the,
came up the first bay

864
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.840
coordination.
This is a coordination game.

865
00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:30.893
<v 1>Yes.</v>

866
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.570
<v 0>Hello?
People who read the New Yorker.
I'm a lot over the second day.</v>

867
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.650
It's a coordination.
Yeah.

868
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.690
<v 1>Okay.
All right.
So</v>

869
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.520
<v 0>why is it a coordination game?</v>

870
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.640
Because you like everyone in the class to coordinate their responses on invest.

871
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:54.710
All right.
And in fact,
if they did that,
they'd ever be happy.
Right?

872
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.080
And no one would have an incentive to the fact that would not be in equilibrium.

873
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.550
But unfortunately,
quite often we fail to have coordination either.

874
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.620
Either ever one of them.
This is the iPhone coronation.

875
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.190
I either everyone pays not invest or has happened the first time in the class we

876
00:53:08.191 --> 00:53:11.550
get some split with people losing money.
All right,

877
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:16.260
so I claim that actually this is not a rare thing into science at all.

878
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:19.170
There are lots of coordination problems in society.

879
00:53:19.171 --> 00:53:23.430
There are lots of things that look like coordination games and often in

880
00:53:23.431 --> 00:53:27.300
coordination games,
bad results and I want to spend,

881
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:31.300
most of us are today talking about that cause I think it's important.
All right,

882
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.370
wherever you are,
whether you're an economist or whatever,
so let's talk about it,

883
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:40.200
about what else has the structure of a coordination game and therefore can have

884
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:43.770
the outcome that people can be uncoordinated or can coordinate it in the wrong

885
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:45.690
place and you end up in a bad equilibrium.

886
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.160
What else has what else looks like there's let's,
let's collect some ideas here,

887
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.120
but know how I got to handle way at the back motor.

888
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.610
You can get the guy who was just way,
way,
way at the back.
Right up against the,

889
00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:01.950
yeah,
there you go.
Great.
Thank you.
Wait for the Mike gets to then.
Yeah.
Yeah.

890
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.290
<v 5>Oh,
like a party on campus can be a coordination game.</v>

891
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.700
<v 0>Yeah.
Good,
good.
Okay.
So podium campus is a coordination game because what,</v>

892
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.860
because you have to coordinate a being at the same place.
Is that right?

893
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.560
That's the idea you had.
You had,
go ahead.
Go ahead.

894
00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:20.200
<v 5>The thing is like if,
uh,
if not very many people are coming,</v>

895
00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:22.120
the people that did come are not going to enjoy it.

896
00:54:22.121 --> 00:54:24.790
But if a lot of people do come,
then it will be good for everybody.

897
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.310
<v 0>Good,
good,
good.
Okay.
That's,
that's good.
That's good.</v>

898
00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:29.770
So that's another way in which there's two ways in which a party can be,

899
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:33.220
it can be a coordination problem.
One is the problem that people don't show up.

900
00:54:33.221 --> 00:54:36.580
It's a lousy parties who don't want to show up.
Conversive everyone's showing up.

901
00:54:36.581 --> 00:54:39.130
It's great.
It's a lot of fun.
It's the place to be and everyone wants to show up.

902
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.460
And second,
so there's two equilibria they're showing up on everyone,

903
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:46.190
not showing up.
What everyone showing up.
And a similar idea,
uh,

904
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.060
the location of parties where I was put your driving habits is this similar idea

905
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:54.070
can can occur.
So it used to be the case in new haven that there are different,

906
00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:57.510
there's not many anymore,
but they used to be different balls around campus,

907
00:54:57.511 --> 00:54:59.860
none of which you're allowed to go to.
So you don't know about.
But anyway,

908
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.490
lots of different balls on campus and there's a coordination game where people

909
00:55:03.491 --> 00:55:06.580
coordinate on Friday night or to be more honest for graduate students,

910
00:55:06.581 --> 00:55:08.920
typically Thursday night.
All right.
All right.

911
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:11.800
So it used to be the case that one of those bars downtown was where the drama

912
00:55:11.801 --> 00:55:12.970
school people coordinated.

913
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.400
And another one was where the economists coordinated and it was pretty good

914
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.890
equilibrium,
but they didn't coordinate at the same place.
All right.
All right.

915
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.130
So one of these you have to learn when you go to a new town is where is the

916
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.180
meeting point for,
for,
for the kind of party I want to go to.
And again,

917
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.250
you can have a failure of coordination.

918
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.830
Everyone's wondering around the town getting mugged.
All right.

919
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.550
One of the things like coordination problems like that.
So again,

920
00:55:39.551 --> 00:55:42.010
way back in the corner that matter,
there's somebody right behind you.

921
00:55:42.011 --> 00:55:44.700
There you go.
You have to really shout out,
um,

922
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.200
maybe warring parties in a civil war signing a treaty.
Okay.
That could be,

923
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.590
so I'm,
I'm,
I couldn't be a coordination problem.
It has,

924
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.210
it has a feeling of being a bit prisoner's dilemma aeration.

925
00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:59.760
Some sense as long as my disarming my putting down my arms before you put in

926
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.870
your arms,
that kind of thing.
So it could be a coordination problem,

927
00:56:01.871 --> 00:56:05.260
but he has a little bit of a flavor of both.
[inaudible] go ahead.
Go ahead.

928
00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:06.094
Go ahead,
go on.

929
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:07.770
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

930
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.010
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll the other examples.</v>

931
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:14.820
This is the guy that one or that when you get the guy who behind you that I'm

932
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:17.850
going to get by the door.
They get great at a sports arena.

933
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:21.390
People deciding whether or not they want to start a chant for whatever team.

934
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.240
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not quite sure which is the good outcome or the bad outcome.

935
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.910
So there's this thing called the wave.
There's a single,

936
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:30.640
the way that Americans insist on doing and I guess they think that's the good

937
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:34.920
outcome.
All right.
All right.
Other things?

938
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.670
<v 1>Where did they go?
See?
Yeah.
Good.</v>

939
00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.350
<v 0>Let's come back to that one.
Just hold that thought.</v>

940
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.720
We'll come back to it next time.
But you're right.
That's a good,
that's great.

941
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.010
Let's come back to it next time.

942
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.300
<v 1>All right,
and anything else?
Anything else?</v>

943
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.320
<v 0>Let me try and let me try and expand on some of these meeting place ideas.</v>

944
00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:58.990
We try Tyler pubs to meet saddle parties to meet at.

945
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.140
But think about online sites,
online sites,

946
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:05.420
which are chat sites or dating sites or whatever.
Right?
Those are,

947
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.830
there's online sites.
Uh,
clearly you have the same feature of party,
right?

948
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.490
You want people to coordinate on the,
on the same site.

949
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.050
<v 1>All right.
All right.</v>

950
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:18.920
<v 0>Well what about some other economic ideas?
The ideas from economics.</v>

951
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:24.680
<v 1>What else has that kind of externality?
They can like a meeting place.
A,
yeah.</v>

952
00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.640
Yeah.
Can Get,
can we get him that patch right there?

953
00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:28.930
<v 3>I mean it's excluding some people,</v>

954
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:32.770
but things like newspapers or something like we want my one,
only one,

955
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.930
like global news site.

956
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:38.240
<v 0>So that's an interesting thought because it can go both ways.</v>

957
00:57:38.241 --> 00:57:40.580
It could be a bad thing.
I did have one newspaper for obvious reasons,

958
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.130
but in terms of having a good conversation about what was in the newspaper

959
00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:47.940
yesterday around the,
around the uh,
uh,
over lunch,
it helps everyone.
Fred,

960
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.380
the same thing.
And certainly there's a bandwagon effect this with TV shows.

961
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:54.020
If everybody in America watches the same TV show,

962
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.180
which apparently is American idol these days,

963
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.770
then you can all talk about it over lunch notice.

964
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.530
That's a really horrible place to coordinate.

965
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.380
<v 1>Alright.
Alright.
Alright.</v>

966
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.710
<v 0>There are similar examples to the American idol example.</v>

967
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:09.670
When I was growing up in England,
I again,
I'm going to reveal my age.
Uh,

968
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.700
everybody decided that to be an in person in England,

969
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:16.510
you had to wear flared trousers,
right?
Right.
This was,

970
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.880
and so to be in you have to wear flat trousers.

971
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:21.340
This is the horrible coordination problem,
right?

972
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.630
So for people who don't believe that could ever happen to them and you could

973
00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:29.170
ever have these sort of fashion goods that you end up at a horrible equilibrium

974
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:31.570
at the wrong place.
You believe that could ever happen.

975
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.670
Think about the entirety of the Midwest,

976
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:35.223
<v 2>right?</v>

977
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.610
<v 0>I didn't say that.
We're going to cut that off the film later.</v>

978
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:41.950
<v 2>All right.</v>

979
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.060
<v 1>What else is like this?
What else is getting a few ideas on?
How do I get this?</v>

980
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:48.903
It's got this dumped on my head.

981
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.880
<v 3>The establishment of monopolies,</v>

982
00:58:50.881 --> 00:58:54.780
like say like because like a lot of people use Microsoft save and then

983
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:57.000
everything is compatible with Microsoft so more people want to use it.

984
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.360
<v 0>Good.
So that,
sorry,
I've forgotten your name sir.
Stephen.</v>

985
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.240
Stephen's pointing out that certain software can,

986
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:05.210
can act this way by being a network.
Good.

987
00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.690
The more people who use Microsoft and Microsoft programs,

988
00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:11.900
the bigger the advantage to me using Microsoft.
All right.

989
00:59:11.901 --> 00:59:13.880
And therefore cause I can exchange programs,

990
00:59:13.881 --> 00:59:17.330
I can exchange files if I'm working with my coworkers and so on.

991
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:22.040
And so you can have different equilibria coordinating on different,
and again,

992
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:24.290
you could end up at the wrong one.
I think a lot of people would argue,

993
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.760
but I'm gonna stay neutral on this.

994
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.940
A lot of people would argue that Microsoft wasn't necessarily the best place for

995
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:30.590
the world to end up.
All right?

996
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.260
There are other technological network goods like this.

997
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:34.760
These are called network externalities.

998
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.060
And example here would be high definition television,
right?

999
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:41.150
You want to have one technological standard that everyone agrees on.

1000
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.390
Five things like high definition televisions because then everyone can produce a

1001
00:59:44.391 --> 00:59:47.990
TV to that standard and,
and uh,
good that go along with that standard.

1002
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:49.670
And of course it matters each,

1003
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:52.670
each company who's producing a TV and has a standard mind,

1004
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.430
we'd like this to be chosen as the standard.
And again,

1005
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.370
you could end up at the wrong place.
You could end up in a bag bringing back,

1006
00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:03.090
all right,
political bandwagons right?
In politics,

1007
01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:05.970
particularly in primary is there may be an advantage.

1008
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.410
I am on the democratic side,

1009
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.650
on the Republican side in having you all vote for the same candidate in the

1010
01:00:10.651 --> 01:00:11.250
primary.

1011
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:14.220
So they get this big boost and it doesn't seem like your party split and so on.

1012
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.220
Right.
And that could end up,
and again,
I'm gonna just run neutral on this.

1013
01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.370
It just could end up with the wrong candidate winning.
Right?

1014
01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:23.490
There's a political bandwagon affects the person who wins New Hampshire and Iowa

1015
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.040
tends then to win everything.
All right.
All right.
So that's another example.

1016
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:33.710
Any other,
uh,
economic examples?
Yeah,
there's,
there's,
uh,

1017
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:37.920
can we get,
can we get this guy in here
listing on a Scot?

1018
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.540
A Stock Exchange?
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
so in particular in particular,

1019
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:44.070
which stock exchange to list on it?
Right.
So,
so there's,

1020
01:00:44.071 --> 01:00:47.200
there's a huge advantage in having lots of stocks on the Stock Exchange.

1021
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.480
There are shared fixed cost.
There's also liquidity issues,
all right.

1022
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.140
And lots of issues that,
uh,

1023
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.560
of that form of mostly mostly the form of fixed costs.

1024
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.580
So there's a tendency to end up with one stock exchange.
We're not there yet,

1025
01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:01.490
but we do some be going that way quite rapidly.
Right?
The problem,

1026
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.040
of course being that might not be the best doc exchange or it might get that

1027
01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:07.640
stock exchange.
Monopoly power.
All right,
let me get one more.

1028
01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.670
Let me throw out one more example.
What about bank runs?

1029
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.890
What's a bank run?

1030
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.730
What's a bankrupt somebody,
uh,
yeah.
Can we get this guy?

1031
01:01:20.731 --> 01:01:21.564
What's the bank bankrupt?

1032
01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.340
<v 4>Um,
it's when,
when,
uh,
when the,</v>

1033
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:29.610
when the public loses confidence in this,

1034
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.290
their security of their money in banks,
then they rushed to,

1035
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.990
to withdraw the deposits.

1036
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:40.460
<v 0>Okay.
So you imagine a bank as natural case where there's two equilibria,</v>

1037
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.610
there's a good equilibrium,
everyone has confidence in the bank,

1038
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:45.500
everyone leaves their deposit in the bank.

1039
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:49.370
The bank is then able to lend some of that money out and earn a higher rate of

1040
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:51.470
interest on it.
The bank doesn't want to keep all those,

1041
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:52.730
all that money locked up in the vault.

1042
01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:57.170
It wants about lended out to lenders who can pay and trust.
Right.
That's a good,

1043
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.140
that's a good equilibrium for everybody.
However,

1044
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.560
if people lose confidence in the bank and start drawing their deposits out,

1045
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.270
then the bank hasn't got enough cash and it's vault to cover those deposits and

1046
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:12.020
the bank goes under.
All right.
Now,
I used to say at this point in the class,

1047
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.310
none of you would've seen a bank cron because they stopped happening in America

1048
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.260
more or less around 19,
in the mid thirties.

1049
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.440
There were lots and lots of bank crumbs in America before the 1930s.
But since,

1050
01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.680
uh,
federal deposit insurance came in this far fewer.
However,

1051
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:28.950
I really can't say that today because there's a main crime going on right now.

1052
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.460
Right?
There's a bank going on actually in England with a company called northern

1053
01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:37.010
security at know northern rockets called northern rock as we speak,
right?

1054
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.750
And it's really is a bankroll.
I mean,
it,
it,
uh,
if you,

1055
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:42.090
if you looked at the newspaper yesterday on the New York Times,

1056
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.770
you'll see a line of depositers lined up outside the office is in London at this

1057
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:48.690
bank trying to get their deposits out.

1058
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.320
And you see the Bank of England trying to intervene to restore confidence.

1059
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.270
And just to be clear,
this isn't simple.

1060
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.000
This isn't a simple case of being about the mortgage crisis.

1061
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.380
This bank does do mortgages,

1062
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:00.840
but it doesn't seem to be particularly involved in the kind of mortgages that

1063
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:02.100
have been at attracting all the publicity.

1064
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.340
It really seems to be a shift in confidence.

1065
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.930
They move from the good equilibrium I've ever wanted.

1066
01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:11.040
Remaining invested to the bad equilibrium I've ever won.

1067
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:12.360
I'm taking their money out.

1068
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.980
<v 1>Hang on a second.
Okay.</v>

1069
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:17.590
<v 0>No,
there are famous bank runs in American culture.</v>

1070
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:22.810
What's just in the movies anyway?
What is the famous bank?
Chronic in the movies,

1071
01:03:22.811 --> 01:03:26.960
in American movies.
It's a wonderful life.
All right.
There's actually,

1072
01:03:26.961 --> 01:03:29.030
there's one in Mary Poppins as well,
but we'll do,
it's a wonderful life.

1073
01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:33.350
How many of you have seen it's a wonderful life?
I don't even not seen.

1074
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.890
It's wonderful.
Like earlier poll here.
How many will not send them?
Okay,

1075
01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.960
keep your hand on a second here.
Hands up.
You need to do,

1076
01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:41.000
you need to know that if you're a green card,

1077
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.800
you can lose your green card if you haven't tuned into one.
Okay.
Alright.

1078
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.640
So in,
it's a wonderful life.
There's a run on the bank.

1079
01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:52.230
Actually it's a saving and loan,
but that never mind.
We'll think of it as bank.

1080
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:55.710
All right?
And Luckily,
uh,

1081
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.790
it doesn't end up with this saving and loan or bank going under.

1082
01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:02.600
Why doesn't the bank go under in it's a wonderful life.

1083
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:08.120
<v 1>Why doesn't it go on there?
Yeah,
the guy in blue and green.
Green.</v>

1084
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.940
Yup.
Um,

1085
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:17.470
<v 0>everyone agrees to only take as much as they need and not to take out their</v>

1086
01:04:17.471 --> 01:04:18.670
whole entire deposit.
All right.

1087
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:22.900
[inaudible] everyone agrees only to take out a small amount of hops,

1088
01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:26.050
even nothing.
Uh,
and therefore the banker on ends,

1089
01:04:26.051 --> 01:04:28.600
everyone rose at the bank isn't going to collapse and they're happy to leave

1090
01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:31.990
their money in the bank.
Now it's true.
Everyone agrees.
But why do they agree?

1091
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.250
What makes them agree?

1092
01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.830
What makes them agree is Jimmy Stewart,
right?
Right.
Everyone remember the movie,

1093
01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:43.490
right?
So Jimmy Stewart gets up there and he says he gives a speech and he says,

1094
01:04:43.491 --> 01:04:45.830
look,
more or less,
I mean,
doesn't it in these words,

1095
01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:48.020
but he would've done even taken the class.
It says,
look,

1096
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.850
there are two equilibria in this game.

1097
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.010
I can't do the whatever it is,
west Pennsylvania accident ever does it that way.

1098
01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:58.550
It's fun anyway,
but I,
there are two grammar in this game.
There's a bad one,

1099
01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:01.070
will be all dry money out and we all lose our homes eventually.

1100
01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.590
And there's a good one when we all leave our money in and that's better for

1101
01:05:03.591 --> 01:05:06.550
everyone.
So let's all leave our money yet.
But he gives this,

1102
01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.770
he's a bit more motivationally stimulating than me,
right?

1103
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:13.310
But he leads to people not leaving their money here.

1104
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.180
So what I want to do is I want to pick on somebody in the class.

1105
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.730
Now everyone has to understand this game.

1106
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.090
Everyone just download this to equilibriate.

1107
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.160
Everyone understands that when equilibriums better,
let's play the game again.

1108
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:26.440
It's choose the game again.
But before I do,

1109
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:31.100
I'm going to give the mic to Patrick here and Patrick is going to have,
uh,

1110
01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:34.750
exactly five seconds to persuade you.

1111
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:39.000
Get sent up some steps up projects and have five seconds to persuade you.
Well,

1112
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:42.220
whatever you liked,
you could pick your AA starting now.
Okay.
So clearly.

1113
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:46.630
If we all invest,
we'll all be better off so everyone should invest.
All right?

1114
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:48.180
All right.
Now let's see.
This is going to work.

1115
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:53.843
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1116
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.880
<v 0>so let's see what happens on everybody.
Everybody,
oh,</v>

1117
01:05:56.930 --> 01:06:00.850
we ain't got time to write down.
Everyone is going to invest.
Raise their hands.

1118
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.970
Everyone's going to best raise their hands and everyone is not investing.

1119
01:06:03.971 --> 01:06:07.700
Raise their hand.
Oh wait,
we almost made it.
We must've almost made it.
All right,

1120
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:09.920
so notice what happened.

1121
01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.310
I get a little right across a pattern or you did a good job back.

1122
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:17.380
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1123
01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:19.140
<v 0>but,
but there's a lesson here.</v>

1124
01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.620
The lesson here is the game didn't change.

1125
01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:25.410
It's the same game that we've played three times already.

1126
01:06:25.411 --> 01:06:26.670
This was the fourth time we played it.

1127
01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.780
We had a totally different response in playing this time,
right?
Right.

1128
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:33.090
Almost all of you,
the vast majority of you have.

1129
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.500
Even 90% of you invested this time,
right?
And you did do in response to Patrick,

1130
01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:39.960
but Patrick wasn't putting any money down.
He wasn't bribing you.

1131
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:43.230
He wasn't writing a contract with you.
He wasn't threatening to break your legs.

1132
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.410
He just was pointing out.
It's a good idea.
Right?
Now,

1133
01:06:46.411 --> 01:06:49.890
remember the prisoner's dilemma in the prisoner's dilemma,
if Patrick,

1134
01:06:49.891 --> 01:06:53.430
Patrick would've got up in the prisoner's dilemma and given the same speech and

1135
01:06:53.431 --> 01:06:54.420
said,
look guys,

1136
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.590
we're all better off if we choose Beta in the prisoner's dilemma then if we

1137
01:06:58.591 --> 01:07:01.920
choose Alpha Brian,
roughly the same speech.

1138
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.750
And what would you have done in the prisoner's dilemma you'd have all chosen now

1139
01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:08.100
for anyway,
right?

1140
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.930
So Patrick trying to persuade you or Patrick communicating to you that you do

1141
01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:17.750
better by choosing beats and the prisoner's dilemma doesn't work,
but here don't,

1142
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:21.570
don't,
don't,
don't go yet.
Here does work.
Why does Patrick,

1143
01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:23.850
why is Patrick persuasive in this game?

1144
01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:27.360
But he isn't persuasive in the prisoner's dilemma.

1145
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:32.540
Yeah.
Can we get the mic on Katie again?
Yup.

1146
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:35.550
Why is Patrick was wasted in this game and not before.

1147
01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:38.970
He's not trying to persuade us to play a strictly dominated strategy.

1148
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.760
He's not trying to get you to play a strip.
A common strategy and more than that,

1149
01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:45.840
he's played a bit swayed you to play was to play in Nash Equilibrium.

1150
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:49.860
Alright?
So there's a lesson here in coordination problems.

1151
01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.580
Unlike prisoner's dilemma,
unlike prisoner's dilemma,

1152
01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:58.380
communication,
just communication,
no contracts,

1153
01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.010
communication kind of hell.

1154
01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:07.460
And in particular what we can persuade each other to do is to play the other

1155
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:08.670
Nash Equilibrium.

1156
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.380
And this gives us one more motivation for a nash equilibrium in a president's

1157
01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:18.740
dilemma.
To get out of it,
we needed a contract,
we needed side payments,

1158
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:20.660
we needed to change the payoffs of the game.

1159
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.500
But a nationally poor Librium can be a self enforcing agreement.

1160
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:32.410
The Nash equilibrium can be self enforcing.

1161
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1162
01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:38.400
<v 0>Agreements.
We can agree that we're going to play,</v>

1163
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:43.080
invest in this game,
and indeed we will play invest without any side payments,

1164
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:45.210
without anybody threatening to break correct with any contracts,

1165
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:48.650
without any regulation or the law.
I'm assuming Patrick,
isn't that Long Island?

1166
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:49.440
All right,

1167
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.250
we're going to end up doing the right thing here because it didn't our own

1168
01:08:53.251 --> 01:08:54.360
interest to do so.

1169
01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.573
<v 1>All right,</v>

1170
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.070
<v 0>so coordination problems,
which we've,</v>

1171
01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:03.420
I think we've agreed are all over society when it comes to bank runs or bubbles

1172
01:09:03.421 --> 01:09:06.210
and all that,
that bubble's in the market or fashion in the Midwest.

1173
01:09:06.211 --> 01:09:07.470
They're all over society.

1174
01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:12.720
Communication can make a difference and we'll pick that theme up on Monday.
