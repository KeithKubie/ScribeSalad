00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:08.332
(pleasant music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.381
- So I'm going to be
talking about the complexity

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:21.710
of the single cells
that make up the brain.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.849
We've heard a lot about normal populations

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.410
and how they're organized,
which is quite amazing

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.800
but if you zoom in and look
at any one of those cells

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.320
whether they're astrocytes
or neurons or microglia

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.392
within the brain, inside those cells

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:46.200
is a plethora of subcellular organelles

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.450
that are playing a huge role
in how the brain is operating.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.100
I just want to draw your attention

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.740
to some of these organelles who,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.460
if they don't function properly

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.900
can lead to many of the
neurodegenerative diseases

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.620
that we're aware of, so for instance

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.698
mitochondria that you can see here.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.730
Defects in mitochondria
lead to Parkinson's.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.800
Many of the Parkinson's disorders.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.211
Lysosomes, proteins that
comprise some of these lysosomes

00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.730
are responsible for
frontal temporal disorders,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.760
and the endoplasmic
reticulum which you will hear

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.260
a lot about today, is very much at play in

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.040
where mutations in proteins
that shape that organelle

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.310
underlies a variety of
spastic paraplegia disorders.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.740
So in order for us to really get,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.710
I think, at this neurodegenerative
aspect of the brain

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.230
and how it ages and deteriorates,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.402
we need to understand how these organelles

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:50.700
that comprise the cellular components

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.970
which is the unit of the
whole system of the brain

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.240
are organized.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.130
So this is a classic
transmission electron micrograph,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.100
a 90 nanometer slice through a cell

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.100
to really reinforce the
complexity of these organelles.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.540
What we want to know is more information

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.830
about the three dimensional organization

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.290
of these organelles, and how proteins

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.660
are dynamically distributed.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.990
That's one thing we want to know

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.990
and I'm going to be
talking about other layers

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.680
of information that we're
now beginning to get

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.280
in terms of the
organization of this system

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.470
thanks to high end microscopy technology.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.041
So let's start with the
3D organelle shapes.

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:43.280
This is, as I mentioned, is a transition

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.990
electron micrograph
slice of 90 nanometers.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.120
What that means is within
that 90 nanometers slab,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.220
you have no Z information.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.170
Everything's flattened,
but thanks to technologies

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.160
like the focused ion beam
scanning milling system

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.420
that in combination with
scanning electron microscopy,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.482
we can now slice through the cell

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:11.940
at very thin sections,
four nanometer in this case

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.080
and we've used that in collaboration

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.530
with Harold's beautiful
FIB-SEM system at Janelia

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.614
to begin slicing through parts of the cell

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:25.380
to reconstruct particular organelles

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.500
in order to understand how these
organelles are shaped in 3D

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.750
and how they communicate
with other organelles.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.898
What you're looking at
here is just the fine

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.240
complex architecture of
the endoplasmic reticulum

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.900
in a small, the edge of the cell.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.530
In this panel right here,
what you're looking at

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.706
is the confocal volume that we've sliced

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.930
in what you would see if you were

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.110
using a confocal
microscope, so you can see

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.050
there's a huge difference
between the reality

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.050
of this organelle as revealed
by imaging at this very fine

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.610
three dimensional architecture

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.780
versus the typical
image that you would get

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.680
if you were using conventional
confocal microscopes.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.940
Now we've been working with Harold

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.020
to look in more detail
at these organelles.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.820
In this case we're looking at
plasma membrane mitochondria

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.380
ER endosomes that we can segment out

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.550
as you mill through these slices.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.121
This is a two micron volume of the cell.

00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.640
Four nanometer voxels
and you can color code

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.380
each of these different organelles

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.860
to see how they're arranged
relative to each other.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.930
Now, the mitochondria that you can

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.060
see here in green are
intimately communicating

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.030
with the ER which is shown in red

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.490
and there's a lot of crosstalk
between these two organelles

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.811
that's absolutely critical for
calcium handling in the cell,

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:59.980
for reactive oxygen exchange,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.410
as well as lipid and other
types of communication.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.180
Well how do we localize
proteins on these organelles

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.180
and the approach that we've been taking

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.180
really builds from really
the 20 years or more of work

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.300
that people have done using

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.510
a fluorescent protein technology

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.120
which allows you to tag
proteins of interest

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.860
and then look at how they're distributed.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.940
Now in order for us to get
high resolution protein

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.150
as well as lipid
distribution to understand

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.130
the fine architecture in these,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.520
in a three dimensional section of a cell,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.100
we've applied lattice
light sheet microscopy

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.515
developed by Eric Betzig and colleagues

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:46.360
where essentially you take
ultra thin Bessel beams

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.890
to create a thin 2D optical lattice

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.760
which is then used as a sheet

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.900
to pass through your cell of interest.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.480
What this allows is ultra thing slicing

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.330
through a cell, which is
at a much smaller scale

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.330
than big neuronal slices, sections.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.375
And because we have
such a thin light sheet

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:14.800
that's basically almost the same dimension

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.920
as the XY lateral resolution

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.650
that you get with the microscope,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.470
you have isotropic resolution and again

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.360
it's relatively low photo toxicity

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.970
because it's a lattice sheet of light

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.230
rather than a full sheet.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.232
So we've combined the lattice
light sheet microscope

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:37.232
with a point localization
or palm-like imaging

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.430
where individual molecules,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.082
in this case we're
looking at lipid molecules

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:46.210
that bind and then
disassociate from membranes

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.240
and whenever they're
bound, they create a spot

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.010
on the surface of that membrane

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.170
that we can fit with very high accuracy

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.080
by point PSF centroid fitting,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.456
and when we do that we can reconstruct

00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:05.690
the entire sort of organelle distribution,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.110
map it out in 3D through
lattice light sheet imaging

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.180
with combination of plotting out

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.710
all the individual
distributions of these lipids

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.750
that have been using super
resolution imaging docked in

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.762
and put in place.

00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:28.140
Now that we have an image
of all these organelles

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.212
and this, you can see mitochondria here

00:07:30.212 --> 00:07:33.100
and this web-like structure represents

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.010
the endoplasmic reticulum,
we can now come in

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.460
and dock in particular
proteins of interest.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.310
I'm just going to zoom
in on this area here

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.040
because what we're
particularly interested in

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.120
or were interested in in the study,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.120
was how proteins that are part
of the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.960
which is this large structure that expands

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.230
throughout the cytoplasm as this

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.030
tubular meshwork, how it's organized.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.700
And so what we can do with this technology

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.600
is superimpose our distributions
of fluorescent proteins

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.760
that we've specifically,
genetically engineered and tagged

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.130
onto our, a fluorescently acquired image

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.568
using this lattice light sheet system

00:08:19.568 --> 00:08:23.380
to dock in where these
proteins are localized,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.001
and this is an example where we have

00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.350
again all of the membranes of the cell

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.392
that have been painted out if you will

00:08:31.392 --> 00:08:34.500
using our lipid probe

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.820
and single molecule
super resolution imaging,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.980
and we're now correlating it

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.800
with a diffraction limited
image of Sec61 beta

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.500
tagged with an emerald,
a fluorescent probe

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.510
and you can see how they align.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.830
This is exciting to us because
it really sets the stage

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.940
for beginning to investigate a whole slew

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.087
of different proteins
and how they localize

00:08:57.087 --> 00:08:59.790
within this cellular system.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.170
So we think that FIB-SEM and
lattice light sheet paint

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.610
or palm-like correlative approaches

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.050
will allow us to really
gain deeper information

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.380
about how all of these
organelles are shaped

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.980
in three dimensions, and
how different proteins

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.190
might distribute on them.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.180
But one of the challenges
that we still face

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.180
is how many organelles are
arranged relative to each other

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.480
in a living cell context.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.165
In particular, that's
important for understanding

00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:40.519
how different organelles
are contacting each other

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:43.010
and communicating with each other.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.920
We know for instance,
the endoplasmic reticulum

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.360
which is this sort of snake-like structure

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.320
that you can see in this EM image

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.960
is contacting virtually
every other organelle

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.510
within the cell and communicating
with those organelles

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.260
through lipid trafficking, ROS,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.570
essentially exchange of
reactive oxygen species,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.320
calcium signaling, many
other types of communication

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.210
is going on between these organelles

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.550
and our problem with
trying to understand that

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.140
is that we haven't been
able to look simultaneously

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.980
at all of these organelles
in a living cell context.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.550
We can see them clearly
with electron microscopy,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.320
but if we do fluorescent
time lapse imaging,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.320
we're limited to imaging two
or three of these organelles

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.590
at one time, because of
this problem of overlap

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.240
in a mission spectrum.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.370
In among the different
fluorescent proteins

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.690
that are available.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.728
So here we have classic
fluorescent proteins

00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:53.320
that have different emission spectrums.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.611
CFP, GFP, YFP.

00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:58.640
These are the emissions
spectrum for each of these

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.370
different fluorescent probes,

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.160
and the problem is their
emission spectrum is overlapping,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.640
and what that means is that if you tag

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.620
a particular organelle with different

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.330
fluorescent probes like the
ones that I just mentioned

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.430
which are the most widely
used fluorescent probes,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.950
and then you image essentially

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.530
you go across the emission spectrum

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.650
to look at any particular
wavelength of light,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.650
which population of
organelle you've looked at,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.270
you can see that you have overlap

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.790
at any particular wavelength.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.830
So that means if you were imaging

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.488
for instance at 438 you'd
see three different,

00:11:44.488 --> 00:11:47.660
you would not be able to
distinguish mitochondria ER

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.000
and lysosomes from each other.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.350
It would just be one big blur,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.020
and hence you could not distinguish

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.370
how these different
organelles are behaving

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.290
relative to each other.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.561
So to overcome that challenge
two post docs in the lab

00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:05.240
decided to employ a technology
called multispectral imaging

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.320
to try to unravel this
overlapping emission spectrum

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.000
and a strategy that they
used was essentially

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.440
take, if you know the emission spectra

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.610
of each of these different fluorophores,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.840
you can then query and
observe pixel spectrum

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.640
that's a combination of one
or more of these fluorophores

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.470
and then use linear unmixing to decipher

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.586
what combination of, and in what abundance

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:37.580
any one or two or more
of these fluorophores

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.620
would give rise to this
particular spectrum,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.700
and using that we can at
each pixel of our image

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.110
unmix to determine which
fluorophore is giving rise

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.190
to the signal that we're
observing at that pixel.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.480
And so we've combined that

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.740
with lattice light sheet microscopy

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.800
to be able to image simultaneously

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.010
six different organelles
within the cell over time.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.330
In order to do that, we've
essentially introduced

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.020
six different laser lines that
cover the visible spectrum.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.210
That allows us to excite the
fluorophore that we've tagged

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.500
on each one of these different organelles

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.420
and then we do our linear
unmixing algorithms

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.100
to determine each, the specific spectra

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.960
associated with each organelle.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.580
And this is what you can
see in the case of these

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.242
six different organelles that we've

00:13:31.242 --> 00:13:34.630
introduced fluorescent tags for.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.613
Now, this is in a single
cell, so we can superimpose

00:13:37.613 --> 00:13:40.758
all of these signals on top of each other

00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:44.730
to simultaneously see in
a three dimensional space

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.870
because we're using
that lattice light sheet

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.580
to move through the
whole volume of the cell,

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.690
how all of these
organelles are distributed.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.730
Now with this technique, we can begin to

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.510
zone in on really specific measurements

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.842
in terms of organelle
distribution, localization,

00:14:04.842 --> 00:14:08.060
essentially connectivity.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.210
This is just a set of values for

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.652
the number of organelles
that each of these

00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:17.810
different populations
of organelles represent,

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.460
so for instance on average in the cell

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.099
that we're looking at
there's about 89 lysosomes,

00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:29.099
186 peroxisomes, 157 lipid droplets.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.380
The ER occupies by far the largest volume

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.830
in this cell among all of
these different organelles.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.510
It's about 30 times the
size of the Golgi apparatus,

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.650
which is involved in
the secretory pathway.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.860
Eight to nine times the
size of the mitochondria

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.720
which is involved in energy
production within the cell.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.690
Now, we can also come in and segment

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.690
these individual organelles
to look at how they are

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.940
connected to each other, how
they're contacting each other

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.256
in order to begin to understand

00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:06.910
the communication, the cross-communication

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.800
or cross-talk in activity
that we know is so important

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.452
for how cells are
operating and communicating

00:15:14.452 --> 00:15:17.070
with other cells in their environment.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.300
For instance, the endoplasmic reticulum

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.048
controls the secretory pathway

00:15:21.048 --> 00:15:23.360
together with the Golgi apparatus.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.090
It's what's secreting
the perineural network

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.890
that we heard earlier about.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.950
So it's critical for
us to really understand

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.960
how these organelles behave
relative to each other,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.363
and from these types of segmented images

00:15:38.363 --> 00:15:41.780
we can create, we've been able to describe

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.030
what we call the organelle interactome

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.200
where we just measure
the pair-wise contacts

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.602
between these different organelles

00:15:49.602 --> 00:15:54.602
in our images of these cells,
and from that we can see

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.800
the frequency of communication

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.630
that different organelles
have with each other.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.130
You can see here that the ER is by far

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.750
the most communicative
of all the organelles.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.020
It's contacting everyone.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.629
Importantly, if you look
at a single cell over time,

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:15.040
you can see that this
organelle interactome

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.510
is conserved over fairly
significant periods of time

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.870
and that is despite the fact

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.150
that any particular contact

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.420
that we see is relatively transient.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.500
I should emphasize that

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.310
this interactome changes dramatically

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.790
if we perturb the cell in different ways.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.770
We can depolymerize microtubules

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.680
or starve cells in different ways

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.850
and we dramatically change
the way these organelles

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.400
are interacting with each other.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.760
Now this is a movie
where we've segmented out

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.760
the mitochondria as an
example of an organelle

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.641
that is intimately communicating

00:16:53.641 --> 00:16:56.210
with the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.810
On the right hand side
represents the surface,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.620
all of the surface sites of mitochondria

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.830
where we see ER's signal.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.550
So the ER is wrapping around the surface

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.480
of the mitochondria and
intimately communicating

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.970
with virtually all of those

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.320
mitochondrial elements
that we see in the cell.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.270
This contact we think is what's,

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.670
we think there's calcium flux

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.950
between the ER and mitochondria.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.870
That calcium is playing an important role

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.540
for mitochondrial output,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.130
how much energy is being
produced by the mitochondria.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.090
We also know there's lipid and cholesterol

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.890
being transferred across
these contact sites,

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.740
and importantly reactive oxygen, ROS,

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.600
reactive oxygen species
is being trafficked

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.213
across those contacts,
which could play a big role

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:54.213
in the disulfide bond formation
and protein remodeling

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.630
occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.330
Now let's focus in on the ER for a second.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.120
It occupies 25% of the cell cytoplasm.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.480
We can measure that using
our lattice light sheet

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.700
three dimensional reconstruction.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.500
What is interesting is that if we plot out

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.210
the position of the ER over
a 15 minute time period

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.950
which you can see in this movie,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.330
what we find is that the
ER has pretty much explored

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:28.330
the entire cytoplasm over just 15 minutes.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.040
So it is a very dynamic organelle

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.390
that has lots of capability
of communicating.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.927
Now in my final two
minutes, or one minute,

00:18:39.927 --> 00:18:43.130
I want to take you through how fast

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.180
these organelles can move.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:50.950
We know that they can,
the ER has the capability

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.690
of exploring that cytoplasm.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.070
Let's look at its dynamics
at higher resolution.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.880
We can do this using a TIRF-SIM system.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.880
We can see these tubule
matrices move incredibly fast.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.340
Interestingly, the tubes themselves

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.140
undergo an oscillatory activity.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.760
That's ATP and GTP dependent,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.819
so it's not just thermally driven

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:17.637
and finally we can actually come in

00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:22.500
and start mapping out individual proteins

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.480
that move or diffuse along the surface

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.490
of the endoplasmic reticulum

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.750
and that's what you're seeing here.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.220
Each of these yellow spots
represent a halo tagged protein

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.840
that is associated with
the membrane of the ER

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.900
and we can begin to map
out the trajectories

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.850
of these proteins, and that's shown here

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.690
for another ER resident
protein Sec61 beta.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.080
If you sum up all of these trajectories,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.370
you see that these proteins,

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.800
and this is a trans-membrane
protein you're looking at,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.240
will explore the whole
surface of that ER freely.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.570
Now in my final movie
here, I just want to show

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:03.570
here's an example where
we're mapping out a protein

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.550
that actually interacts.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.560
It's on the surface of
the ER, but it is part

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.550
of a tethering complex that brings the ER

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.300
close to the mitochondria,
and what we can see

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.560
is when we track these
individual molecules

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.280
as they diffuse across
the surface of the ER,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.990
we can see that as they move across

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.450
the area of the ER that's in
close proximity of mitochondria

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.190
they slow down significantly.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.414
Consistent with a transient interaction

00:20:31.414 --> 00:20:34.640
of this tethering protein,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.380
with a target protein on mitochondria.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.970
So with that I want to end and say that

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.970
this field is really being
significantly impacted

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.567
by the high resolution
technology that's now available

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:52.850
that scans from electron microscopy

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.380
up to the fast imaging technology.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.530
People in my lab have
been greatly impacted by

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.140
the physicists at Jenalia.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.390
Eric Betzig and Harald in particular

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.830
who've really provided the technology

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.824
that allows us to do this
type of work, thank you.

00:21:11.824 --> 00:21:13.988
(applause)

00:21:13.988 --> 00:21:16.738
(pleasant music)
