00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.000
'Wú Wéi' (无为) means, in Chinese,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
'non-doing', or 'doing nothing'.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.480
It sounds like a pleasant invitation

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.800
to relax, or worse, fall into laziness

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.660
or apathy.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.360
Yet this concept is key to

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.880
the noblest kind of action,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.060
according to the philosophy of Daoism,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.840
and is at the heart of what it means

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.400
to follow 'Dào' (道) - 'the way'.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.280
According to the central text of Daoism,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.400
the 'Dào Dé Jīng' (道德经),the way never acts,yet nothing is left undone.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.780
This is the paradox of Wú Wéi :

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.700
it doesn't mean 'not acting,'

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.100
it means 'effortless action,' or

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.780
'actionless action'.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.360
It means being at peace,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880
while engaged in the most frenetic tasks,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.620
so that one can carry these out

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.480
with maximum skill and efficiency.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.640
Something of the meaning of Wú Wéi

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640
is captured when we talk of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340
being 'in the zone',

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.100
at one with what we're doing,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.940
in a state of profound concentration and flow.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180
Wú Wéi is closely connected to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.600
the Daoist reverence for the natural world,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.960
for it means striving to make our behaviour

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.860
as spontaneous and inevitable as

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.700
certain natural processes,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.600
and to ensure that we are swimming with,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.040
rather than against, currents.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.480
We are to be like the bamboo

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.300
that bends in the wind, or the plant

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.160
that adjusts itself to the shape of a tree.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.920
Wú Wéi involves letting go

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.420
of ideals that we may otherwise

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.300
try to force too violently onto things.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.060
It invites us instead to respond to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.340
the true demands of situations,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.980
which tend only to be noticed

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940
when we put our own ego-driven plans

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.760
to one side.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.840
What can follow is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.680
a loss of self-consciousness,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.120
a new unity between the self

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.040
and its environment.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.180
But none of this means we won't

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.300
be able to change or affect things

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.360
if we strive for Wú Wéi.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.620
The Dào Dé Jīng points out that

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.720
we should be like water, which is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.760
submissive and weak, and yet which

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.540
can't be surpassed for attacking

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.520
what is hard and strong.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.560
Through gentle persistence and a compliance

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.780
with the specific shape of a problem,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.700
an obstacle can be worked around

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.060
and gradually eroded.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.140
The idea of achieving the greatest effects

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.720
by wise, strategic passivity

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
has been central to Chinese notions of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.320
politics, diplomacy and business.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.880
In the manuals on wisdom produced

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.040
by Daoists, we are repeatedly told

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.920
that rather than impose a plan or

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.700
model on a situation, we should

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.900
let others act frantically, and then

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660
likely adjust ourselves as we

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.280
see the direction that matters

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.540
have evolved in.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.080
In China's Táng (唐) dynasty,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.180
many poets likened Wú Wéi to the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.040
best aspects of being drunk.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.400
It wasn't alcoholism they were promoting,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.020
but the decline in rigidity and anxiety

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.280
that sometimes comes with being a little drunk,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.480
and which can help us to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240
accomplish certain tasks.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.000
One poet compared someone

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.400
inspired by Wú Wéi to a drunk man

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.040
who falls uninjured from a moving cart.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.140
Such is their spiritual momentum,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.480
that they are unaffected

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.040
by accidents and misfortunes

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.520
that might break those of a more

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.460
controlled and controlling mindset.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.080
Theories of painting from

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.520
the Táng period onwards

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.020
made Wú Wéi central

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.580
to artistic practice.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.720
Rather than labouriously attempting to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.460
reproduce nature as faithful copyists,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.360
the artist should find nature

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.580
within themselves, and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.480
surrender to its calls.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.380
The painter's task is not to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.600
imitate the external surface of things,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.780
but to present the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.600
'Guǐ (鬼)' or 'spirit' of things

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.460
like mountains, trees, birds and rivers,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.920
by feeling some of this spirit

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.820
in themselves, and then letting it

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.140
'flow out' through the brush,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.680
onto silk or paper.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.560
It followed that Daoist thinkers revered

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.220
not just the finished work of art,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.260
but the act of painting itself.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.400
It considered artist studios as

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.480
places for applied philosophy.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.100
The Táng dynasty poet, Fú Zài (符载),

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.320
described a big party that had

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.260
been thrown to witness the painter,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.060
Zhāng Zǎo (張璪), in action.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.940
'Right in the middle of the room,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.780
he sat down with his legs spread out,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.820
took a deep breath and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.140
his inspiration began to issue forth.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.320
'Those present were as startled as if

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.380
lightning was shooting across the heavens,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.740
or a whirlwind was sweeping up into the sky.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.940
'The ink seemed to be spitting from his flying brush.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.320
'He clapped his hands with a cracking sound.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.960
'Suddenly, strange shapes were born.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.740
'When he'd finished, there stood

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.740
pine trees, scaly and riven,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.720
crags steep and precipitous,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.380
clear water and turbulent clouds.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.480
'He threw down his brush, got up and

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.880
looked around in every direction.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.040
'It seemed as if the sky had cleared after a storm,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.300
to reveal the true essence of ten thousand things.'

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.020
Fú Zài added of Zhāng,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.840
whose works are sadly now lost,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.140
that he had 'left mere skill behind',

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.340
and that his art was

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.180
'not painting', but 'the very Dao itself'.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.360
A good life could not be attained

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.660
by Wú Wéi alone,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.920
but this Daoist concept captures

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.400
a wisdom we may at times

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.840
be in desperate need of :

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.300
when we're in danger of damaging ourselves,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.900
through an overly stern and unyielding

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.640
adherence to ideas which simply don't fit

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.400
the demands of the world.
