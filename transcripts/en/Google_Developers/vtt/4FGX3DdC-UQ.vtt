NASIR KHAN: Hi, and welcome
to Google Developers Live.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.700
My name is Nasir Khan, and
I work for Google Wallet.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.270
We are going to talk
about Orbitz today.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.980
Orbitz is one of our
premiere partners.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400
We have done integration
with Google Wallet APIs,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.470
and we're going to go into
more detail about what

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.890
they have done.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.580
This is actually a
two-part segment,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.831
so today, we're going to
focus on the Instant Buy APIs,

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.205
whereas in the
following segment,

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:34.329
we're going to talk about
Wallet Objects API, which

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.540
relates to Office.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.282
So first of all,
let me welcome Brian

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:39.490
who's joining us from Orbitz.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.164
Brian, are you there?

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:41.830
BRIAN LEE: Yeah.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.100
Hi.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.295
NASIR KHAN: Hi.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.380
How are you doing today?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.463
BRIAN LEE: I'm doing good.

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:45.950
Very excited about
this opportunity

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.960
to share my experience
on the Instant Buy API.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.890
How are you doing?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.840
NASIR KHAN: I'm very well, thank
you, and thanks for joining us.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.590
So the Android
app that you built

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.306
and that you included
Instant Buy API with it,

00:00:58.306 --> 00:00:59.930
can you tell us a
little bit about what

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.420
it does, what the
users can do with it,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.945
and what essentially
does it offer overall?

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.050
BRIAN LEE: Sure.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.630
Our Orbitz app is the most
full-featured travel booking

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.670
app available on Android today.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060
Not only can you search
and book hotels, flights,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.320
and rental cars, you can also
access your booked itineraries,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.700
including the ones you
booked on the website.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.770
You can also join our new
Orbits Rewards Loyalty Program

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.780
directly from our app,
and start earning rewards

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.720
for your booking
flights, hotels,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.490
and use it instantly on hotels.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.580
And now with Google
Wallet Instant Buy,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.370
it's even easier to
use our app to take

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.150
advantage of these great offers.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.550
NASIR KHAN: Great, great.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.770
So for users who are not
familiar with Instant Buyer,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.400
I would recommend them to
look at a previous recording,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.060
previous videos,
but in a nutshell,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.990
it's basically a payment
API, which integrators

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.619
can use in their Android app.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.160
And the way it works
is that it makes

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.900
it really simple for the
users to access their Google

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.310
Wallet from within the native
app and use it for payments.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.800
So we're going to see some
examples of this going forward,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.470
but essentially, it streamlines
the process of payments

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.560
to just about two
or three clicks

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.397
versus a more cumbersome
entry process where users have

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:11.980
to enter their credit
card information

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.900
and things of that kind.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.520
So I believe you can show
us the app live, Brian.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.700
Can you?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.639
BRIAN LEE: Yes, I can.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.555
NASIR KHAN: All right.

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.138
So let's switch to
the app right away.

00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:25.410
Let's see what happens here.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.420
So we can see a screen now.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.950
Are you ready to demo?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.710
BRIAN LEE: Sure.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.310
Let's do a simple search
for a hotel in Chicago.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.790
So we'll click Hotel to search
it, and for the destination,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.655
we'll type Chicago.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.710
Select Chicago, and select
the dates, and click Search.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.710
So we'll just select the first
hotel, make sure we like it,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.200
and select a room.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.790
So when you're in the booking
screen as you can see,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.600
there's a lot of
information to populate

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.690
if it's your first time booking,
information like your name,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.760
email, credit card info,
and billing address.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.060
So instead of filling
everything in,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.560
let's see what
happens when we click

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.684
the Buy with Google button.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.500
So just like that, you
have a list of credit cards

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.410
you have linked in
your Google Wallet,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.550
and you can set it as a
default payment method as well.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.040
What's interesting
to note here is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.730
that this dialogue
and everything in it

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.791
is actually all
part of Wallet API.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.165
I didn't have to make any of
this dialogue or the content

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:48.180
inside.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.920
And in fact, the
Orbitz app doesn't even

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.000
have access to this
list of credit cards.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.660
All I had to do was create
a masked wallet request

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.330
with the purchase amount and
send it using the Google Wallet

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.350
API, which makes it really
simple for me as a developer.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.450
So now that we have
this, we'll select a card

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.385
and click Continue
and see what happens.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.150
So now you can see that
the billing information

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.250
is updated with your
Google Wallet email

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.445
address and your funding
card information.

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:17.570
Our Orbitz have never
received the full credit card

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.660
information you have
stored in Google Wallet.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.390
We just get and show the credit
card type and the last four

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.140
digits of the funding
card for user reference.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.950
And this is basically what the
masked wallet object is, see it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.540
at the travel
information, it's all

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.320
pre-populated with
the information

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.850
from the masked wallet.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.050
And just like that, with
just a single click,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.010
you're ready to check out.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.050
And since we have a promotion
for using Google on Instant

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.710
Buy right now, let's just
make sure to get that discount

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.210
as well.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.670
So now when you're ready
and when you click the Agree

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.380
and Book button, this is when
we actually make the full wallet

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.600
request, we add a
Google Wallet API.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.470
And what this essentially
does is get a single use

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.880
virtual proxy card
information, which basically

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.640
gets passed on to
our Orbitz back end

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.626
to be processed for payment.

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.200
NASIR KHAN: Perfect.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.820
Thank you so much
for the demo, Brian.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.950
So as Brian was telling
that there are essentially

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.740
two steps and just
kind of recap that.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.449
There is this masked wallet,
which essentially happens

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.240
when the users click
on the Buy with Google

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.690
button for the first time.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.397
This is the first interaction
of the users with Google Wallet,

00:05:20.397 --> 00:05:22.480
and what they get back is
this masked information,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.130
which Brian was showing on the
screen, which has the user's

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.580
address also the last four
digits of their banking card.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.460
And then when the
user confirm it,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.130
that's when a full
wallet request

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.690
was made from within
the app, which

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.405
gets the proxy card, which
is a one-time used card, not

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.280
the card that the users
have in their wallet,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.170
but a proxy to
that, which can then

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.900
be used from within the app
to actually make the purchase

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.430
or make the charge on it.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.775
And so there is a two-step
very simple API, first

00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:50.400
with the masked wallet
request and then

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.865
you do a full wallet request.

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:53.240
And in the response,
you get what

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.330
you need, which is
basically a proxy card,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.630
which you can then charge.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.320
So the benefit of
this approach is

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.010
that once you have filled
out say a credit card

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.152
processing from within the
app, you're accepting users,

00:06:04.152 --> 00:06:06.360
entering their credit card,
you're pretty much set up

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.000
to use Google Wallet Instant
Buy because you can use

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.360
the same rails, you'll
use the proxy card almost

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.720
as if the user had typed
in their credit card,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.995
and then you use it to
process the charge if you're

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.245
doing the credit card process.

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:21.150
So the idea behind this
approach was to the limit

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.764
the integration effort the
developers are allowed to do,

00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:27.180
not only in the front end, but
also in the back end, which

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.180
is probably more significant
because then they don't have

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.305
to really integrate
anything in the back end.

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.934
So let me ask you, Brian,
what I just mentioned.

00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:35.350
Did you experience
the same thing?

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.470
Did you feel that it
was an easy integration,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.690
or what are your general
thoughts about integration

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.710
experience?

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.320
BRIAN LEE: As far as integration
was, the happy paths where

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.070
you just had to implement a very
simple use case on the Android

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.581
apps, that was really
straightforward.

00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.710
NASIR KHAN: Right.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.920
At least, the hope
that we had when

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.130
we developed this API
was to limit the back end

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.050
changes altogether.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.960
So is that something
that you also

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.405
saw or did you have to make
any changes on your back end?

00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:02.340
BRIAN LEE: Right.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.910
Payment processing change
usually is not really

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.650
a simple change,
but in this case,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.020
the proxy card could be almost
treated as like a credit card.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.225
So we had to do some
additional changes

00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:15.808
to support a Google Wallet that
it's actually a Google Wallet,

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:17.391
but as far as the
actual process goes,

00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:21.832
it's very just quite similar to
a regular credit card payment.

00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:23.540
NASIR KHAN: And if--
let me ask you this,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.720
Brian-- how long did it
actually take from start

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.370
to finish in terms
of integrating

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.050
Instant Buy in your app?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.400
BRIAN LEE: Well the very simple
happy paths just doing the Buy

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400
with Google and getting
the aperture proxy card,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.330
and it was actually without
any error case handling

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.960
took maybe a day or two.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.420
That was really straightforward.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.670
In addition to that, we had
to do some back end changes,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.160
and we also had to do so
edge-case handling and a lot

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.910
of testing, so the
whole process took

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.880
about a few weeks, two
to three weeks about,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.557
three to four weeks,
depending on how

00:07:57.557 --> 00:07:58.890
you look at [INAUDIBLE] process.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.780
But actually it wasn't
that bad at all.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:00.960
NASIR KHAN: Yeah.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.940
That's pretty good, actually.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.523
I mean, if you think
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:05.100
it's a pretty big
app, and in terms

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.380
of getting it live in two to
three weeks with a new API,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.610
that's pretty good.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.790
So in terms of getting
the app on the Play Store

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.020
and getting people to use
it, are you seeing people

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.884
now using Instant Buy more,
and do you have any feedback?

00:08:24.884 --> 00:08:26.550
I think it's very
early days, but do you

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.690
have any feedback from users?

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.106
If they're finding
it easy to deal

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:32.451
with Instant Buy versus
filling out the forms manually?

00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:33.330
BRIAN LEE: I'm sorry.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.130
I missed the last
part of the question.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.650
NASIR KHAN: So I was saying,
it's pretty early days,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.390
but do you have
any user feedback

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.929
in terms of how the
experience has been using

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.065
Instant Buy versus filling
out the forms manually?

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:48.330
BRIAN LEE: Oh, actually
when we started

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.180
the Instant Buy integration,
we were actually having reviews

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.120
that people wished that
we had the Google Instant

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.670
Buy integration,
so it was great.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.495
After we integrated it, we could
reply to the user that hey,

00:08:58.495 --> 00:09:01.640
we actually have this Instant
Buy all and pre-populate

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.440
the forms as a really
positive experience.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.352
NASIR KHAN: Fantastic.

00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:06.060
Thank you, Brian.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.010
Thanks for your time today, and
don't forget to tune in again

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.850
for the second
segment of our video

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.060
in which we are going to talk
about the Wallet Objects API.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.670
Thank you.
