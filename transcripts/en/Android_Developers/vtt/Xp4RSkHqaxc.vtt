00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.810
CHET HAASE: So
Android Fireside Chat.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.480
The first thing we should do is
actually tell you who we are,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
so you have a little context
on the kinds of things

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.930
that maybe we can
fake an answer to.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.850
I'm Chet Haase.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.350
I'm on the Developer
Relations team.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.458
I will not be answering
any questions today.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:22.500
DAVE BURKE: Dave Burke,
Lead Android Engineering,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.190
and I was told I'm going to
answer all the hard questions.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.655
CHET HAASE: True.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:28.780
ROMAIN GUY: I'm Romain Guy.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.360
I manage the Android
Toolkit team.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.538
TOR NORBYE: I'm Tor Norbye,
and work on Android Studio.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:35.580
YIGIT BOYAR: Yigit Boyar.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.030
I work on Android X,
Architecture components, Harry

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.458

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.710
AURASH MAHBOD: Aurash Mahbod.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.330
I run engineering
for Play Store.

AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:53.870
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
I'm Steph.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.918
I work on our
developer experience.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:56.960
DAN SANDLER: Dan Sandler.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.995
I work on Android system UI.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:00.370
DIANNE HACKBORN:
Dianne Hackborn.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.540
I manage the Android
framework team that does not

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.492
include any Jetpack stuff.

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:06.700
ANWAR GHULOUM: Anwar Ghuloum.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.833
I work on Android Core OS.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:09.750
CHET HAASE: Excellent.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.720
So that's all the
people up here.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.000
We also have other
people in the audience

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.370
because this group of people
doesn't know everything.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.330
That group of people does.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.810
So we have many experts here
from the engineering team

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.440
on Android.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.600
We can hopefully answer
most of the topics that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.340
are going to come up.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.780
One important ground rule.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.620
We sort of have a general policy
on the Android of not answering

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.830
questions about the future.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.280
So if your question
begins with when

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.160
will or are you
planning to, you're

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.260
guaranteed to not get a
very interesting answer.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.320
I will give you a sample.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.000
What is your favorite feature
in the next release, Roma?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.042
ROMAIN GUY: Dark mode.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:45.709
CHET HAASE: Ugh.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.874
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.870
CHET HAASE: Why do I even?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.500
All right.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.840
So I had some content
to cover first,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.847
and then we'll get into
a little bit of Q&amp;A,

00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:58.305
so let me work
through some slides.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.470
All right.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.640
Let's get onto the Q&amp;A.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.810
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.560
CHET HAASE: Here's how
it's going to work.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.043
There are two mics
in the stands,

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:09.460
and there are a
bunch of questions

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.393
I reached out to Twitter for.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.560
And we're going to do a
combination of those things.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
So I'm going to start
with some of the questions

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.150
that we got from the
online community.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910
If you have a
question in your mind,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.680
please come stand by
the mic, and we'll

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.720
take most of the questions
from the audience.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.170
And on we go with
the Fireside Chat.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.020
So let me start with this one.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.900
What are Android's team's
feelings on Kotlin/Native?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.450
Any plans to actively
support it where

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.060
it is possible or sensible?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.998
Steph?

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:39.540
You want to--

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.075
Oh, deer in the headlights.

00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:43.450
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: I was
just looking at Tor to see--

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.340
I think we're very excited
about Kotlin/Native.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.810
Tor and I and the
team in general.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.348
It's a technology
we've been exploring.

00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:50.890
We're interested in
where it's going,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.100
and have been collaborating
with Jet Brain's team.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.280
We'll see kind of how it
evolves in the future.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.510
CHET HAASE: There we go.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.770
All right.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.755
I see a lot of people
lined up at the mics-- not.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:07.130
OK, let me tell you how short
this session is going to be

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.990
if we don't get live questions.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.160
Yes.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.430
So unfortunately
for the Pixel team,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.790
the top two OEM manufacturers
for Android are Samsung

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.040
and I think, like, LG
or Huawei or something.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.810
The unfortunate thing about
that is that both of these OEMs

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.465
have known quirks around things
like Bluetooth and camera.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.340
The unfortunate part
about that, besides that

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.230
being a pain for
all of us here, is

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.102
that these are the
ambassadors for Android.

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:40.560
These are the touch points for
the Android operating system

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.510
most people are familiar with.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.177
A lot of people, if you ask them
what kind of phone do you have,

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:45.380
they say, I have a Samsung.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.330
They don't say, I
have an Android phone.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.480
So given that this is the
touchpoint for Android,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.510
this is how most people
interact with Android, not

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.770
through Google specifically
but through these OEMs,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.550
and given that there's all of
these painpoints around camera

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.400
that have been addressed now
with camera X and Bluetooth

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.330
and all of these
hardware sensors, what's

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.430
the long-term vision for
ensuring that OEMs are adhering

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.480
to some sort of standard
around how they're integrating

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.800
hardware with the
operating system?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.000
And what's the plan to make
sure that developers don't have

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.730
to bash their heads in with
things like Bluetooth in years

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.480
to come?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.100
CHET HAASE: Just to be clear,
we don't encourage bashing heads

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.500
in as a developer community.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.910
It's not a policy.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.723
AUDIENCE: Sometimes
it's necessary, though.

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:35.390
[LAUGHING]

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.130
DAVE BURKE: So, our role
is to make sure that when

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.350
you write an application
that it runs everywhere

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.180
on all devices with as much
consistency as possible.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.187
Obviously the goal would
be perfect consistency,

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.270
and the way we ensure
consistency, as you probably

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.220
know, is we have
these CTS tests,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.020
compatibility test suites that
all device makers have to run.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.140
We also have something
called VTS now,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.030
which is a set of
tasks at the treble,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.920
at the hardware level,
which also have to pass.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.100
And even more so,
those tests have

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.110
to pass with what we
call a generic system

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.978
image from Android on top
of their implementation.

00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:10.270
And so what we've been doing
is investing more and more

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.790
into the infrastructure, the
number of tests, how they run,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.260
test tools.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.410
And as we invest more, we start
improving the consistency.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.660
And I think what you're
saying, which I think is fair,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.110
is that we still got work to
do to make it more consistent.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.190
And so we're definitely
investing there.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.150
The other thing that's new in Q,
which you may have heard about,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.500
is Android Mainline.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.190
And so now we have the ability
to push select OS modules.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.232
And the way that works is
it's still open source,

00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:41.732
but we work with
all of our partners

00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:43.010
to upstream their changes.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.500
So we have a common mainline.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.960
And then we push these
modules out in the terrain.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.600
And so in Q, for example, we
have media codecs and media

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.580
extractors that are standard.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.710
And they're often painpoints
for media developers,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.650
app developers using media.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.860
And so that brings consistency
as well as security benefits.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.720
So anyway, it's an ongoing
thing that we're constantly

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.920
working towards.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.628
I don't know if anyone
else wants to add.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:08.220
CHET HAASE: Good.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.090
Thanks.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.320
Hi.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.570
As a user, I actually have
a multi-voice assistant

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.090
household.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.450
I have Alexa and Google Home,
and I don't have a third.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.210
But I could theoretically,
potentially, have one.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.220
And one of the things
I love about my phone

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.340
is that I can access both
Google and Alexa on it.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.958
But with the changes, it seems
like a lot of permissions

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.250
and abilities are being
restricted to the default voice

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.060
assistant.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.450
And I wondered if there
was any ability or ways

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.370
that you could see
having multiple voices

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.850
assistants on your phone and
being able to just invoke Alexa

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.810
or Google or Bixby just by
using that particular wake

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.217
word on your phone.

00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:49.050
CHET HAASE: I have a
question for you first.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.827
Do you find that they talk about
you when you're not around?

00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:52.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.840
A lot.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.430
CHET HAASE: So
onto your question.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.110
Assistant?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.110
DIANNE HACKBORN: Do
you know what things

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.402
you think are being restricted?

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:01.320
Because I don't know that we--

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.730
AUDIENCE: Well, I do know that
there's a permission bundled

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.750
with default voices, the ability
to access your call logs.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.990
And I'm guessing just
based on that type of thing

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.900
that more types of
behavior like that

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.450
will fall under the default
voice assistant category,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.310
and thus will be
unable to be accessed

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.927
by the regular assistant.

00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:24.510
DIANNE HACKBORN: I
don't think we just

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.870
removed call log access.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.200
As far as I know, we haven't
pushed any functionality

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.670
to only the Assistant, or
whoever the default voice

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.700
interaction service is.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.200
Paul?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.480
AUDIENCE: Well, in
addition to permissions,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.760
there's also the
voice interaction

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.310
service, which gets callbacks.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.810
And you only get that if you're
the default voice assistant.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.340
DIANNE HACKBORN: Yeah,
so that's been design

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.170
since the beginning
of that, is that you

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.257
pick one assistant on your
device, and there's only one.

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:54.840
And there's a lot
of reasons for that,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.750
like the always on
hotword detection

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.958
like is, barely works for one--

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.250
I mean, barely as far as like--

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.640
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.380
DIANNE HACKBORN: --being able
to customize it and stuff.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.280
I don't mean it doesn't work.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.270
CHET HAASE: What
Dianne really means--

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.228
DIANNE HACKBORN: Sorry.

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:08.460
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.190
DIANNE HACKBORN:
And there is, like,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.660
the gesture to bring up the
Assistant is tied to that.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.400
And so if you have
multiple ones it's

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.150
not clear what should
happen in that case.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.630
And there's a lot of
resources associated with it,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.450
because those things need
to always be running.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.130
Like part of the expectation
is you're always running this,

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.480
you're always listening
to the microphone.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.430
And so it was a very
conscious decision

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.530
that you can have one
assistant on your device.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.080
And we-- I mean, that
hasn't changed in Q.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.340
That's been always the case.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.110
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.824
DIANNE HACKBORN: And, we don't
have any plans to change that.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:37.130
DAVE BURKE: Let's be clear.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.213
You can have one assistant,
and you can change it,

00:08:39.213 --> 00:08:40.610
for people who don't know.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.480
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.000
All right.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.870
Thanks.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.047
Hi.

00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:46.380
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
about expanded screenshots

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.790
or scrolling screenshots.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.760
So recently I read about, there
was a request about getting

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.190
this into Android.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.670
There's several OEMs who've
done, this but Google

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.765
recently said that they're
not going to do it?

00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:01.140
I think initially they said
that they might look into it,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.150
but that ticket was changed to
say it's not going to happen.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.580
Could you talk some about that?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.320
DAVE BURKE: So I don't know who
said it's not going to happen.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.760
But Dan Sandler, what
are you doing tomorrow?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.810
I think it's a good idea.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.100
I haven't talked to the team.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.980
I think it's a good idea.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.397
But maybe Dan's going to tell
me why it's not a good idea.

00:09:17.397 --> 00:09:19.360
DAN SANDLER: No, I
wouldn't dream of it.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.068
DAVE BURKE: Done.

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:23.620
Yeah, I mean, there's
no reason not to do it.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.792
It seems like a good idea.

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:25.500
We just have to--

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.705
DAN SANDLER: We just have
to prioritize it and fit it

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:27.250
in with everything else.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.413
DAVE BURKE: Exactly.

00:09:28.413 --> 00:09:29.330
CHET HAASE: Thank you.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.862
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.070
DAN SANDLER: Patches welcome.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.325
DAVE BURKE: Yeah.

00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:34.950
CHET HAASE: Any other
feature requests?

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.730
Anybody?

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.350
Yes.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.153
Hi.

00:09:37.153 --> 00:09:38.820
AUDIENCE: So one thing
that I'm noticing

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.288
is I have a lot of
friends who have iPhones.

00:09:41.288 --> 00:09:43.830
And I keep telling them, like,
you should come to the Android

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.540
device, and the number
one thing that I

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.000
keep getting as the
I don't want to do it

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.270
yet is because it
doesn't have iMessage.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.660
And we have our messaging
platforms that we've

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.240
tried in the past,
and historically they

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.480
have not been great or
they have been killed.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.360
And I want to be
able to see, like,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.430
a version of iMessage that could
come to Android that is either

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.090
supported and continued
to be built upon

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.000
or is agreed upon by all the
OEMs that necessarily do it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.110
And I probably assume you're
going to say the new rich text

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.142
format, but I'm curious
about all of that

00:10:22.142 --> 00:10:23.850
to fix that, so we
can kind of say, like,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.360
no, no, we have something
even better than iMessage.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.860
DAVE BURKE: Yeah,
so super conscious

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.727
of the iMessage situation.

00:10:31.727 --> 00:10:33.060
It depends on different regions.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.770
Like, you know,
I'm from Ireland,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.030
and WhatsApp is the thing.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.030
And so it doesn't
come up very often.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.920
That's what people use there.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.840
It's interesting if you
look at what happened.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.670
We had text messaging, right?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.740
And then you had over
the top messaging

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.590
services like iMessage,
WhatsApp, Signal, et cetera.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.297
And they pushed far
ahead of text messaging.

00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:54.630
They didn't have restrictions,
they had more multimedia,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.297
you could see when
the person is typing,

00:10:56.297 --> 00:10:58.270
you get read receipts,
all that kind of stuff.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.812
And so what's happened
is regular SMS

00:10:59.812 --> 00:11:00.870
has got left behind.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.120
And the work that we've been
doing-- and you're right,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.230
I was going to say RCS--

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.230
this is the new IMS standard.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.020
We've been working on that
and working with carriers

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.810
and working with device
makers to basically bring SMS

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.960
up to that level so
that that capability is

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.230
available in your
phone and it becomes

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.040
more standard, effectively.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.920
And so that's the approach
that we've been taking.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.870
But it takes time to work
through all the carrier

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.750
standards and to get adoption.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.510
But we're making progress on it.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.790
AUDIENCE: But you're not
going to kill it, right?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.215
We're going to keep--

00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:36.340
[LAUGHING]

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:36.665
DAVE BURKE: Kill--

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:36.990
AUDIENCE: Supporting it?

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.350
DAVE BURKE: --kill which?

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.450
All right.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.368
Thank you.

00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:41.160
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.600
I'm going to reach out to
online again to ask Yigit.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.440
The AndroidX
artifacts often seem

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.980
like everything's an
alpha beta RC, which

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.140
is a hard sell in some
companies where they demand

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.910
that you use stable releases.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.242
Are there good ways to
help smooth this out?

00:11:57.242 --> 00:11:58.950
YIGIT BOYAR: So I
actually tried to touch

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.750
this in our What is New talk.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.130
So there's two problems here.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.300
One is libraries, which
already reached stable,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.860
and they go back
to alpha quickly.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.990
Because while trying to
stabilize the library,

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.160
there's a lot of things we
want to implement we cannot.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.010
So as soon as it's stable,
we want to put them in.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.000
You are free to use
the stable version.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.210
Another part is this, like
something we announced--

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.280
WorkManager
navigation-- last I/O,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.950
it took them like six to
eight months to become stable.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.610
We want to shorten that
time, but we also--

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.680
once we go stable, somebody
is going to use it.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.920
You need to support
that API forever.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.970
So we want to make sure
there's a very good API.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.700
So we all try to do
better on that end,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.640
and when we call something
beta, that's pretty

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.920
good to use in production.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.405
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:12:51.582 --> 00:12:52.790
CHET HAASE: Beta stands for--

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.150
ROMAINE GUY: Don't be--

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.860
CHET HAASE: --pretty good.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.277
ROMAINE GUY: There's
also the fact

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:58.630
that we have something like
70 libraries in Jetpack now.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.227
So of course, there's
always one that

00:13:00.227 --> 00:13:02.810
will be in alpha or beta, which
feels like a lot of libraries.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.352
So what I'm hearing
is that we should

00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:07.000
do less and stop working?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.780
You're on vacation now.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.045
Right.

00:13:12.045 --> 00:13:12.670
CHET HAASE: Hi.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.760
Was there anything that
you'd be willing to share

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.050
about Fuchsia OS.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.540
I mean, I know there's a lot
of curiosity surrounding it,

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.582
and to the best of my
knowledge, it hasn't really

00:13:22.582 --> 00:13:25.970
been discussed at I/O so far.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.470
DAVE BURKE: Do you
have a slide that

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.380
says Fuchsia Fireside Chat
that you could put up there?

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.200
Just joking.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.850
I mean, it's really a
question for the Fuchsia team.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.540
So I don't really
have much to add.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.943
There's some good collaboration
happening between the teams,

00:13:40.943 --> 00:13:42.610
like this year to
give you two examples,

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.680
is one is we have this
angle driver on Q.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.950
And the idea is that
we have a module--

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.950
it's a mainline module--

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.975
and it implements OpenGL ES 2.0.

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:53.172
We're just finishing
that off, and soon 3.0.

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:54.380
And it runs on top of Vulcan.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.820
And we actually developed
that with Fuchsia

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.740
because Fuchsia uses
Vulcan at the base

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.470
level for graphics like
Android has now migrated to--

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.340
is migrating to.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.390
And so we work closely there.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.270
Also on Jetpack Compose,
which is our new UI toolkit.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.120
We work very closely
with the Flutter team.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.120
One of the things that
we care about is having--

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.980
I care about is in particular--
is having transferable skills.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.030
Like, so if you know Flutter,
the toolkit at Android

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.720
should look familiar to you too,
so you can move between them.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.762
And that's something we've
done in collaboration.

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.152
But, so our viewpoint of
Fuchsia is more about the things

00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:27.860
we're doing with them,
but I can't really

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.730
speak to exactly their project,
because I'll get it all wrong,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.518
so.

00:14:31.518 --> 00:14:32.060
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:32.990
Thank you.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.021
DAVE BURKE: Thanks.

00:14:34.021 --> 00:14:34.646
CHET HAASE: Hi.

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:35.560
AUDIENCE: Um--

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.930
CHET HAASE: No?

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, basically I
just want to ask the same.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.200
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.700
All right.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:40.860
Good.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.690
CHET HAASE: Dave, do you
want to say that again?

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.640
DAVE BURKE: Yeah,
I'll say it again.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.140
So--

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.660
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.398
CHET HAASE: Hi.

00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:46.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.700
So in past two years, we
had PWA and we had AMP,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.980
and we had instant app.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.440
But I feel like they are
competing each other.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.190
So I had the opportunity
to do AMP and instant app

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.850
at the same time.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.300
And when we released
to production,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.610
the analytics got skewed because
when we have instant app,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.640
the traffic's going to
read out to the apps.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.400
And our sales are going to
shift from the web sales

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.660
to the app sales.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.120
So my question is,
so when you guys

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.540
release the product, what's
the thinking behind it,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.360
like releasing two products
that compete directly

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.260
with each other.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.350
And the second question
is, what do you

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.012
expect from us as the
implementer of your products.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.470
AURASH MAHBOD: I
can take this one.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.040
So a couple of questions there.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.190
First is analytics.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.942
Obviously you know,
the web analytics space

00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:42.650
is pretty complex,
especially when you're

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.995
doing SEO and things like that.

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:46.370
So we've been working with a
lot of early access partners

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.470
to try to close those gaps
because the way people think

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.090
about mobile app
analytics is actually

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.423
quite different than the way
they think about mobile web

00:15:52.423 --> 00:15:53.423
analytics.

00:15:53.423 --> 00:15:54.965
So we're continuing
to improve there.

00:15:54.965 --> 00:15:57.382
You should see some continued
improvements in the Pub site

00:15:57.382 --> 00:15:58.760
particularly.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.718
The other is around how
you think about-- maybe

00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:02.260
I missed the third
question-- but how

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.890
you think about
selecting between

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.190
these various technologies.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.190
At the end of the day,
the way we think about it

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.790
is that we want developers to
have the flexibility to choose

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.740
the right technology for them.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.810
And for developers-- a
perfect example of this

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.050
is for games, where there is
no real mobile web equivalent.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.050
So we want to make sure
you have the flexibility

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.940
to do what's right for
you and for companies who

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.690
are mobile first, then
are really thinking

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.888
about building native apps.

00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:29.180
We want to make sure that
they have the same capability

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.090
to bring that instant-like
experience to mobile web

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.670
traffic or to even the Play
Store, like we talked about

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.440
at the keynotes.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.150
And then if you're
on the web and you

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.830
want to focus on PWA
or AMP, you know,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.740
there are pros and cons of all
of these various approaches.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.070
So it's kind of about what's
right for you as a developer.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.685
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but my concern is

00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:50.060
most of the time when we are
working like Android team is

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.602
working and web team
is working, they

00:16:51.602 --> 00:16:53.120
might be working
on a new feature,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.912
and they might be
working on a new feature.

00:16:54.912 --> 00:16:56.978
It wasn't until the
release we knew, like,

00:16:56.978 --> 00:16:58.520
are sales going to
hinder each other?

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.970
So we are in competition with
each other because of the two

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:02.990
new products released.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.630
PAUL BANKHEAD: It's
a fair question.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.297
I think one of the
things to think about

00:17:08.297 --> 00:17:10.968
is there's a technology
choice in terms of what things

00:17:10.968 --> 00:17:13.010
you want, but there's also
a distribution choice.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.890
And the different
technologies lend themselves

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.300
to the distribution method
that your business is using.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.020
So that's why for
game developers who

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.760
are used to a distribution model
that comes from an app store,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.250
instant games is going to be
a much more natural choice

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.710
from the distribution angle
as well as a technology angle.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.668
If you're a legacy is,
say, a shopping business

00:17:29.668 --> 00:17:31.610
and your legacy is
SEO and web, then

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.380
you come from a
legacy of technologies

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.840
where PWA AMP might be
more natural for you.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.875
And if you're businesses, you
know, 80% new visitors who

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:40.490
are coming from
SEO, you're probably

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.455
not going to get
those guys to download

00:17:42.455 --> 00:17:43.580
an app for a certain query.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.247
So I would think about it from a
technology perspective and then

00:17:46.247 --> 00:17:48.973
a distribution perspective and
try to make the right choice.

00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:50.390
We understand that
it's difficult.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.470
And from a Google
perspective, we

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.180
want to give you a
full suite of tools.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.330
And sometimes that
means we can't give you

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.530
a canonical answer that's
the same for everybody,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.747
because everybody's
situation is different.

00:18:02.747 --> 00:18:03.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.620
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.120
Hi.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.280
I'm quite invested in
the Flutter framework.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.340
So I had two questions.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.340
The first one is, is
it planned, or is it

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.590
possible to have one
module using Flutter

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.710
so we can migrate
some views in it

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.430
and maybe share it with
our iOS colleagues?

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.550
And the second question is
that I like Flutter, but is it

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.298
possible to make
Flutter with Kotlin?

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:32.292
[LAUGHING]

00:18:32.292 --> 00:18:34.777
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:44.250
DAVE BURKE: So I think, I didn't
fully hear the first question.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.910
The first question was
can you use Flutter

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.370
in just part of your
app, basically--

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:47.620
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.703
DAVE BURKE: --in a module
and make it work in iOS.

00:18:49.703 --> 00:18:52.470
And then the second question
is, you like Flutter

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.240
but can you use it with Kotlin?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.080
Somebody said that
should be called Clutter.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.210
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:18:59.298 --> 00:19:00.340
DAVE BURKE: So let's see.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.432
So Flutter is its own thing, and
I was actually really impressed

00:19:04.432 --> 00:19:06.390
with the keynote, like
how many people cheered,

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.710
and so it's gotten popular,
which I think is great.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.180
And from my
perspective on Android,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.535
it's awesome, because
the more options there

00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:15.370
are for developers to
write apps is really good.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.620
And where we as a team are
investing in terms of toolkits

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.600
is Jetpack Compose, which
I mentioned earlier.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.950
And that's very much
Kotlin-based, obviously,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.020
and also it's
designed to allow you

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.185
to use it in parts of your
apps or all of your app.

00:19:32.185 --> 00:19:33.310
And so you can phase it in.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.477
And so we really thought
about that sort of backward

00:19:35.477 --> 00:19:40.750
compatibility, and
also being language

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.460
consistent with Kotlin.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.988
But that said, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:19:44.988 --> 00:19:46.780
Flutter has some really
nice aspects to it.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.405
Like its Widget API is really
nice, how it's done material.

00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:50.780
And so we've worked
very closely.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.730
And so Jetpack Composed should
look somewhat familiar to you.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.230
And so we're kind
of trying to share

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.790
some of the best practices
and idioms in some ways.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.807
Yeah, so that's-- kind of
my indirect way of answering

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:04.390
your question.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.035
I don't know if anyone
else wants to add.

00:20:08.035 --> 00:20:09.450
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:09.950
It's OK.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.823
Thank you.

00:20:10.823 --> 00:20:11.740
CHET HAASE: All right.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:11.837
DAVE BURKE: Thanks.

00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:12.570
I've been watching politicians.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.540
This is how they do it.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.900
You sort of--

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.970
CHET HAASE: Hi.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.470
So seasoned and active
Android devs typically

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.750
have a good idea
of the road Android

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.120
is heading towards and excited
about all the new tools.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.940
But for new Android
engineers, it

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.320
can be nauseating trying to
wrap their head around all

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.660
the new approaches and filtering
out the old methodologies.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.100
What can the team
and community do

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.770
to make coming into Android
development easier--

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.560
examples, Kotlin
first, Jetpack Compose,

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.870
Navigation,
[INAUDIBLE] components,

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.230
Flutter which is also
developed by Google,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.570
and just quickly
outdated tutorials.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.540
CHET HAASE: I'm not sure what
the actual question there was.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.070
AUDIENCE: What can you or
the community do to help--

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.900
CHET HAASE: To simplify?

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.180
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: It's
a great question, actually.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.430
I don't know how many of you--

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.577
there was in Android Studio
AMA a month or two ago,

00:21:04.577 --> 00:21:05.660
and this question came up.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.370
I thought it was a great one.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.350
Essentially people
saying, look, it's

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.820
great that you're making
development better.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.767
But you've made it better, and
now there's all this new stuff,

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:15.350
and I have to learn
all the new stuff.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.950
And so holy cow, I got to
onboard everybody to this.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.000
And so yes, we've been talking
about this a lot in our team

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.200
is how do we not just add
documentation and samples,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.860
but holistically revamp
everything we have.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.710
So let me try this out on you.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.693
Wouldn't it be cool if you
could come into Android,

00:21:33.693 --> 00:21:35.860
and instead of having to
go through what I sometimes

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.980
call the layer cake of like
API 9 and 10 and 11 and 12,

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.413
by the time you have read all
the documents about how it

00:21:42.413 --> 00:21:44.080
works on different
versions, you kind of

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.580
forgot where you started.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.080
You could say like
look, I just want

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.163
to manage a background task.

00:21:49.163 --> 00:21:51.580
Send me to the documentation
that tells me how to do that.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.610
Look, I just want
to build some UI.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.860
Just want to build navigation.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.610
And I think we're
thinking a lot about how

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.980
to improve all of our
documentation and samples

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.190
and other supporting
information around that,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.565
as well as I think
the work Yigit

00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:05.290
and the team have done
around simplifying

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.700
the libraries has just been--

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.440
I mean, I'm probably biased,
but I think it's amazing.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.325
So I think we're
thinking a lot about how

00:22:11.325 --> 00:22:12.700
to lower that
barrier to entry so

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.783
that when people are newer
to Android development,

00:22:14.783 --> 00:22:15.800
it's straightforward.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.560
I would love feedback
about what's working

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.942
and also what we can do better.

00:22:18.942 --> 00:22:19.692
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:22:19.692 --> 00:22:20.738
Thank you.

00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:21.530
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.405
Actually, I would add
too, part of this stuff

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:25.850
that Yigit and team
were working on

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.330
was the opinionated
guide, right?

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.770
And it's trying to address that.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.920
It's not just the
libraries, but it's also

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.003
how do you put these things
together and architect

00:22:33.003 --> 00:22:34.320
or application appropriately.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.070
So hopefully we're
getting better at that.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.390
I would argue that
we're not done.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.820
YIGIT BOYAR: It's also
like we're trying our best.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.300
It's also a little
bit challenging,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.580
because like you know
your use case the best.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.170
So it's very hard to give
super generic advice.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.420
So we're trying to learn this
over the last two, three years.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.560
I think we got better.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.920
to work with the community.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.260
Now we moved Composed
to the open source,

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.620
we got a lot more code reviews
and help from the community.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.760
And I think if we can work
together with you all engineers

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.520
and people in our team,
that will get a lot better

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.480
over time.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.980
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Yeah, Jetpack

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.300
is intended to be our
opinionated answer.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.285
It's kind of the one, two--

00:23:14.285 --> 00:23:16.160
remember Dianne wrote
that really famous post

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.080
that we're not opinionated,
to which you all

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.320
replied please be opinionated?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.660
And that's basically
what Jetpack is, and we

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.702
want to keep building
on that so that you

00:23:26.702 --> 00:23:28.160
do have a sense of
like, look, this

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.535
is the way we
recommend doing it.

00:23:29.535 --> 00:23:31.198
You can always drop
down to the raw--

00:23:31.198 --> 00:23:33.740
we sometimes call the laws of
gravity-- to the raw framework.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.365
We always want to
leave you that power.

00:23:35.365 --> 00:23:37.730
But also provide a
more elegant, fast way

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.048
of getting things done.

00:23:40.048 --> 00:23:42.590
CHET HAASE: All right, I'm going
to dip into online questions

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.890
here.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.990
I thought this one was kind
of an interesting discussion

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.490
point.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.060
With regards to a device
like the Samsung Galaxy Fold,

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.790
who starts that conversation?

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.560
Is it Samsung or Google?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.720
Like hey, we'd like to
build a folded device.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.597
Any chance you can support
bendy phones in the OS?

00:23:56.597 --> 00:23:57.718
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:23:57.718 --> 00:23:58.760
DAVE BURKE: Bendy phones?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.802
CHET HAASE: Bendy phones.

00:23:59.802 --> 00:24:01.460
DAVE BURKE: Bendy phones.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.010
You know, what I've
noticed in the last decade,

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.190
the way this goes is really it's
actually the supply chain that

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.250
comes up with some technology,
whether it's like a fingerprint

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:16.750
sensor or folded, bendable
displays, flexible displays.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.200
And the supply chain
puts it out there.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.050
And then the device
makers look at it

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.342
like what can we do there?

00:24:22.342 --> 00:24:24.050
And then we get
involved, and we're like,

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.088
oh, let's think how
the software works.

00:24:26.088 --> 00:24:28.130
And so that's kind of a
pretty consistent pattern

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.922
of what we've seen.

00:24:28.922 --> 00:24:32.150
So we would have seen flexible
displays a couple of years

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.390
ago from the display
manufacturers.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.090
And then a year or two later,
we would see device makers

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.030
trying things out.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.573
And then we would get involved.

00:24:40.573 --> 00:24:41.990
But you know, I
actually am pretty

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.090
excited about the foldables.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.050
I think we've been talking
a lot about phones folding

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.730
into tablets, and I think
there's roughly form factors.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.580
But actually I think
there's a lot more ideas

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.460
still to come that will be
quite surprising that I'm

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.540
pretty excited about.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.620
And so yeah, I'm just thinking
like this time next year there

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.870
will be actually quite a few
cool things to talk about

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.640
in that space.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.390
Yeah.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.397
Anyone else want to add?

00:25:10.397 --> 00:25:12.980
CHET HAASE: And then eventually
marketing people get involved,

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.530
and they say, you know what,
how about not bendy phones?

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.650
How about foldables?

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.650
Better.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.370
All right.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.870
Yes.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:20.360
Hi.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.068
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:25:21.068 --> 00:25:22.490
Yeah.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.500
I'm currently working
on a Native calling app,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.380
and I was wondering if there's
an API available to access

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.850
to the voicemail system, kind of
like for the visual voicemail,

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.610
so that I can pull
voicemail audio data?

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.277
DAVE BURKE: No.

00:25:38.277 --> 00:25:39.610
So what I'm trying to remember--

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.110
DAVE BURKE: --how this works.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.693
They use IMAP.

00:25:41.693 --> 00:25:44.300
Most of the visual
voicemail services use IMAP.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.025
So if you get a regular
IMAP client, in theory,

00:25:47.025 --> 00:25:47.900
you can talk to them.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.980
But I'm not fully sure
what the credentials are.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.260
I'm sure carriers have--

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:52.760
yeah.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.250
But it's an IMAP client--

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.220
AUDIENCE: So it's-- OK.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.710
So there's no
telephone API for that?

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.673
DAVE BURKE: No.

00:25:59.673 --> 00:26:00.590
Not that I'm aware of.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.290
Because it's also like because
it's a pretty rich client,

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.790
you wouldn't want to bake
it into the framework

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.720
because it changes a lot.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.053
And I know that different
visual voicemail services have

00:26:08.053 --> 00:26:10.210
different quirks and stuff, so.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.210
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.390
DAVE BURKE: Sure.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.210
Thanks.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.280
CHET HAASE: Hi.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.480
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.120
There was a distinct
lack of mention

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.810
about Wear OS in either keynote
or anywhere in the conference.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.810
Is this a dead platform?

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.106
Should we be worried?

00:26:23.106 --> 00:26:25.090
[LAUGHING AND APPLAUSE]

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.270
DAVE BURKE: No, but
where's the Wear team?

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.520
Do we have anyone here?

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.400
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.538
DAVE BURKE: Did I
just make your point?

00:26:40.538 --> 00:26:41.080
I don't know.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.160
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
There is a sandbox.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.030
DAVE BURKE: Oh,
we have a sandbox?

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:44.530
Yes.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.950
So, no, they're
alive and kicking

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.030
in a sandbox at I/O.
No, it's something

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.500
we're continuing to invest in.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.360
We're really excited
by wearables, actually,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.780
and, what can I say?

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.960
We've actually hired more
people, and we're investing.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.335
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:04.335 --> 00:27:05.127
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:27:05.127 --> 00:27:05.930
Hi.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.360
AUDIENCE: So, hello.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.630
I've noticed that
I/O an increased

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.870
effort on diversity
and inclusion,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.010
and many talked about it.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.040
And I want to know if there's
anything you're doing just,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.650
to increase diversity inclusion
in the Android platform

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.710
or even just amongst
your own teams.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.210
DAVE BURKE: That's
a great question.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.630
So I've been spending a lot of
time in the medical industry

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:40.420
lately in hospitals, and the
striking thing that I notice

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.930
is that when doctors
do rounds and whatnot,

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.860
the striking thing I notice
is how balanced and, in fact,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.030
female-heavy, just to give
one angle of diversity, it is.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.120
And then I come back--

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.300
these really strong,
smart doctors.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.667
And then I come back
to work and it really,

00:27:58.667 --> 00:28:00.250
the diversity in the
software industry

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.870
is really quite skewed.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.240
And it's something
we have to fix.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.940
And it's not because
you live in a bubble

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.440
and you can be like,
well, the world

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.023
needs to be more
diverse or something.

00:28:10.023 --> 00:28:11.980
But this industry
specifically, like,

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.350
we really do need to improve it.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.090
And so we have a
bunch of initiatives

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.007
that we're working on.

00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:22.750
But fundamentally, we need
to get more diverse people

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:27.550
into the hiring chain so
we can hire more people.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.180
One of the arguments-- we
spent a lot of time in Google

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.137
in trying to increase
diversity both in the company

00:28:33.137 --> 00:28:33.970
and within our team.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.790
But it feels like a
bit of a zero sum game.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.885
So we're going to
try to do better.

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:39.760
But then other companies
are going to suffer.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.023
Like we need to work at this
at a sort of an industry level.

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:46.690
So that's just one
or two of the things.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.220
I think other
people on this panel

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.637
should talk to this point,
too, because it's so important.

00:28:50.637 --> 00:28:52.330
I know a lot of
people have opinions.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:52.570
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
I can just

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.570
say briefly, one of things
I was really proud of

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.980
is Google was actually the
first company, first tech

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.320
company, to publish our
numbers on diversity.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.150
And I think that
was really amazing.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.150
Because then that kicked
off all other companies

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.410
to do the same thing.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.350
And I think having
that transparency--

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.690
There's a saying, sunshine
is the best disinfectant.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.610
Just looking at the
numbers, I think,

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.950
causes people to be aware
and start to change.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.430
I think there's a lot of
opportunity for change, still,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.610
but it's been really amazing to
see especially on the Android

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.030
team, is a lot of very
strong leaders, like Dianne,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.290
many people on the team.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.950
And yet I think it's a place
we can continue to invest.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.506
DAVE BURKE: The other thing
I would add is, you know,

00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:34.090
it actually makes
business sense.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.507
Like if you're
building a product,

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.477
you want a diverse
set of opinions.

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.060
You're going to build
better products.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.300
And just so from a
very fundamental level,

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.300
it makes a lot of sense.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.320
You also have better teams.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.610
If you have a more
diverse set of teams

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.110
and different
opinions, you're going

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.720
have a better, healthier team.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.370
And so it's actually good for
business to do this as well.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.370
But you know, like I said,
I think this industry

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.495
needs to work harder on it.

00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:58.650
And there's a couple of beacons
which I get excited about.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.060
I went to Grace
Hopper last year,

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:07.360
and it's just
amazing to see there

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.790
are diverse aspects,
people in this industry.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.500
But we need more.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.410
But events like that are really
good to encouraging people

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.160
to join.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.560
But great question.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.360
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.910
Speaking of Dianne, I'm
going to toss one your way.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.940
Locking down inefficient
Android APIs, such as background

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.460
services, implicit
broadcast receivers,

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.140
and firewalls that reduce the
amount of developer innovation.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.340
Is the Android team worried
about that tradeoff?

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.170
Have smartphones
matured to the point

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.570
that not much
innovation remains?

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.070
DIANNE HACKBORN:
Very good question.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.450
So first of all, I understand
it is really painful

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.110
when we change things
like this and remove

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.850
some of the freedom
you have to do things

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.408
and put more
[INAUDIBLE] things on.

00:30:51.408 --> 00:30:53.200
It's also very important,
and it's actually

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.650
been kind of a fundamental part
of Android from the beginning.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.753
When we first did Android,
we had application sandboxing

00:31:00.753 --> 00:31:02.170
from the very
beginning, which was

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.510
a huge change from how
operating systems traditionally

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.010
have worked.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.500
It greatly restricts
applications.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.620
And it's very
important for us so

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.200
that we have this balance
between freedom of developers,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.420
how open of an
ecosystem we can have,

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.430
and what the user experience is.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.500
And so things like
application sandboxing

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.620
allowed us to do things
like by having restrictions

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.160
in the platform, we can have
a more open ecosystem instead

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160
of having something like
where someone is sitting there

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.860
approving every
single application,

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.950
like with arbitrary rules about
whether it could be installed.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.360
We can have a more
open store, we

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.130
can have side loading
of applications

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.990
and that kind of stuff.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.898
And we are always
having to kind of find

00:31:42.898 --> 00:31:44.190
a balance between these things.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.020
So as our ecosystem
grows and changes,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.690
problems come up where we
have issues, especially

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.230
around user experience.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.770
So for a good example of this
is background restrictions.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.050
We're finding that increasingly,
battery life on the devices

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.000
was getting bad because
applications had total freedom

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.250
to do stuff in the background.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.960
And you give them
freedom to do stuff,

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.290
and they're going to do it.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:07.420
And every app
developer is thinking

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.462
like, well, this is
important for my application,

00:32:09.462 --> 00:32:11.050
so I should do it.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.750
And you put everything
together, and things get bad

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.350
for the user.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.320
So as we see these
problems-- and this becomes

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.300
a problem for everyone,
because if users

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.240
aren't happy with Android, then
they're going to leave Android.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.380
They're going to not use
their devices as much.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.670
So we kind of need to
address this in the platform.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.430
So that's why we do these
kind of things where we say,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.030
OK, we can't let applications
run this freely anymore.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.778
We need to have some controls in
the platform to lock that down.

00:32:35.778 --> 00:32:37.320
Ultimately, it's
better for everyone.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.653
But it does cause a lot of pain.

00:32:38.653 --> 00:32:41.360
And it does cause
some restrictions

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.220
on what developers
can do, but we

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:48.290
try hard to still have as
much freedom as we can.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.790
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: We care
deeply about compatibility.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.660
And I think the soul of the
platform is we love developers.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.090
If you forget everything
else from this I/O,

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.470
just remember that.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.540
We love developers,
and we really

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.213
want to make it as friendly
a platform as possible.

00:33:06.213 --> 00:33:07.880
Dave actually talked
about compatibility

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.180
in the Dev Summit
keynote back in 2015.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.440
I remember that far back.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.510
It's a fundamental
philosophy for us

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.990
that we really want to, as much
as possible, minimize change.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.778
And yes, this year
there is some change.

00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:22.070
We actually had a great
conversation with our developer

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.620
advisory board and they said,
look, you guys are so careful.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.510
If occasionally you
need to make changes,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.220
just do a couple things.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.680
One, tell me about it
as early as possible.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.550
Give me notice.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.960
two, tell me all the
technical information

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.780
upfront so I can prepare.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.150
And three, tell me
why you're doing it,

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.380
and be really careful.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.980
Do it as little as possible.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.410
And that's what
we've tried to do.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.910
But I think the
big fear I've heard

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.600
from people with this I/O is
a few people come up and said

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.570
are you guys changing?

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.570
Are you going to start
breaking us all the time?

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.960
And the answer is no.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.950
We have not changed.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.470
Our philosophy is the same.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.970
We are going to always
seek to minimize changes

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.050
as much as possible.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.610
Because we want you to be able
to focus on your own business.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.220
Is that how you feel?

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.110
OK.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.296
Other thoughts?

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:05.158
CHET HAASE: Cool.

00:34:05.158 --> 00:34:05.658
Hi.

00:34:05.658 --> 00:34:06.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.699
I'm really excited
about MotionLayout

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:12.360
and some of the stuff that
that can do, so thank you.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.909
My question's about
Jetpack Compose,

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.520
and how are they going
to work together?

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.793
Is one going to be
deprecate at some point?

00:34:20.793 --> 00:34:22.710
ROMAIN GUY: So we really
want ConstraintLayout

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.960
in something like MotionLayout
and Jetpack Compose.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.600
But the ConstraintLayout
and MotionLayout team

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.699
was apparently busy
building ConstraintLayout

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.199
and MotionLayout.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.790
So it's one of
those many meetings

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.429
that we decided to have
after I/O to talk about it

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.380
and start thinking
about it seriously.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.409
But yeah, we want it to
happen somehow at some point,

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.397
hopefully.

00:34:42.397 --> 00:34:43.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.022
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:34:44.022 --> 00:34:45.179
Hi.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:47.820
AUDIENCE: So I've noticed
it seems like Google

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.850
as a whole has become split
brained on what they feel

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:55.469
is right for Android
development with this hard push

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:59.610
towards Kotlin as like a godsend
language as well as Flutter.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.075
And both are really
hard to ignore

00:35:01.075 --> 00:35:02.700
with all the advancements
that you guys

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.220
are making on both sides.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.130
Kotlin with all of its
functional features and things

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.530
like that, while
Flutter is really

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.120
good with its cross platform.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.610
I was wondering if you
could provide some guidance

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.880
on how to decide, as
a developer, which

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.780
framework to go with.

00:35:23.172 --> 00:35:24.130
ROMAIN GUY: It depends.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.010
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.822
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah.

00:35:25.822 --> 00:35:27.280
It's what we said
earlier, it truly

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.800
depends on what you're
focusing on as a developer.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.740
Like, Flutter's a fantastic
cross platform solution

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.370
if that's what
you're looking for.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.450
If you're building a
Native Android experience,

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.730
we provide Kotlin,
and we're building

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.110
new libraries for that.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.335
We're improving our APIs.

00:35:42.335 --> 00:35:43.960
So again, it's about
the choice, right?

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.590
We feel like one single
solution will not

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.090
make all developers happy.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.685
So we have multiple solutions.

00:35:51.685 --> 00:35:55.050
AUDIENCE: So I was talking
to the Flutter developers

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.710
earlier at the
sandbox, and it was

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.520
difficult to get anything out of
them as far as why not Flutter.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.380
Like, why use
native over Flutter

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.950
if you would have
to write it twice?

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.290
So is there anything
that, like, you get out

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.860
of writing natively
that is significantly

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.100
beneficial over using Flutter?

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.797
ROMAIN GUY: So I mean,
it's designed by--

00:36:19.797 --> 00:36:21.630
our API is all designed
by the Android team,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.510
so you're going to have all
the newest features first.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.030
You can talk to all of
the Android APIs directly.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.490
You don't change runtime,
you don't change language.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:29.800
TOR NORBYE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.590
ROMAIN GUY: So you
have benefits there.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.800
And you get Kotlin, Tor says.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.620
ROMAIN GUY: And you
know, that's where

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.620
we focus all of our
efforts, so all of our teams

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.428
are focused on this
being what we think is

00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:42.720
the best experience on Android.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.600
But again, you know--

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.040
Flutter.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.498
If you're looking for something
else that's cross platform,

00:36:46.498 --> 00:36:47.527
that's a great solution.

00:36:47.527 --> 00:36:48.360
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.098
Thank you.

00:36:49.098 --> 00:36:49.890
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.900
We've got time for
one or two more.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.920
We'll go as fast we can.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.240
Hi.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.620
So what are your
thoughts regarding

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.000
the amount of fragmentation
found across all 20,000

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.990
or so Android phones, across
all markets, OEMs and stuff,

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:12.160
and the choice the developers
may find when they--

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.690
like sometimes I
run into the choice

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:21.120
where I need to choose between
supporting an older API version

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:28.800
and trying to make what I do
compatible with those older

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.890
versions versus just stopping
and just drawing the line

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.690
and supporting only
the newer versions.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.910
But due to that amount
of fragmentation,

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.430
I only get a chunk
of the users where I

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.445
would get to the other choice.

00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:47.820
DAVE BURKE: Yeah,
I think there's

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.042
a couple of things we're doing.

00:37:50.042 --> 00:37:52.500
First of all, I would say this
is a pretty unsolved problem

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.230
at this scale to have an
operating system that's

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.020
open source and customizable
running on so much

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.780
different hardware and silicon.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.310
But we're doing a lot of work
to improve the situation.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.880
So one is something we
call Project Travel.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.470
By having a very distinct
hardware abstraction layer.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.140
And so that when a
device maker wants

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.960
to move to a new
version of Android,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.140
the new version of Android just
runs on top with minimal work.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.960
And you can see some
progress on that.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.645
So with the beta
this year, we have--

00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:20.520
what was the numbers?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.120
Like 23 devices, I think,
including all the Pixels,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.680
that are running on the beta Q.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.530
And that's like
four times more--

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:31.125
sorry.

00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:33.000
So that's double what
it was last year, which

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.337
had doubled the year before.

00:38:35.337 --> 00:38:37.170
And then on top of that,
if you look at Pie,

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.210
there's four times as
many devices on Pie

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:42.492
now than there was Oreo at
the same time last year.

00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:43.950
And then the other
interesting stat

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.760
is there's 40% more
devices on Pie than there

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.282
where devices on O
at the same time.

00:38:51.282 --> 00:38:53.490
And that's a direct example
of why Travel is helping.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.600
It's much easier to do this.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.223
And so we're just putting a
lot of effort into that area.

00:38:59.223 --> 00:39:00.390
And we do a lot of programs.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.190
We work with the
silicon vendors,

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.390
and so that we give them a
standard build of Android.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.430
And so that helps reduce
version fragmentation.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.513
But it's an ongoing thing.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.763
It'll keep getting better,
but it takes a lot of work.

00:39:11.763 --> 00:39:13.470
I mentioned earlier
about main lines

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.115
for consistency so we can
have more consistent modules.

00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:17.490
And then on top
of that, Jetpack,

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.530
if you think of that
as a veneer on top,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.228
we do a lot of the work like
CameraX to try to abstract you.

00:39:22.228 --> 00:39:24.270
I think that CameraX works
from Lollipop forward.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.000
So we tried to abstract you
from a lot of the complexity

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.450
and the quirks that went across
those different API versions.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.992
So we're doing
multiple things, and I

00:39:32.992 --> 00:39:34.992
think, as I said probably
in the first question,

00:39:34.992 --> 00:39:36.690
is it is clearly more
work for us to do.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.960
But it's something we care
about and are investing in.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.450
YIGIT BOYAR: This is a
major focus area for us.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.390
So if you tried to use
more Jetpack libraries,

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.360
like all these
background restrictions,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.050
WorkManager tries to hide
the problems from you

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.270
that so you don't need
to deal with the APIs.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.570
And when you create a
compatibility library,

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.020
we try to implement it
even in the older versions,

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.480
even if we don't have the APIs

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.990
So the more you could use
Jetpack in your libraries,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.833
the less you will care
about fragmentation.

00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:07.500
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.333
Thank you.

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:09.250
CHET HAASE: Thank you.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.667
Unfortunately, we
ran out of time.

00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:13.320
I had one really quick question
that I wanted to ask Aurash,

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.940
and then we're
going to wrap it up.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.820
When will Google Play
in app update APIs

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.650
be available for
developers to use?

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.345
AURASH MAHBOD: Now.

00:40:22.345 --> 00:40:24.720
CHET HAASE: So thanks, Twitter,
and thanks to all of you.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:25.605 --> 00:40:26.580
See you next year.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.630
