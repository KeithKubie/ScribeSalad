so thanks a lot Peter for joining me

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
so thanks a lot Peter for joining me
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.000
so thanks a lot Peter for joining me
today um I think a lot of people know

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
today um I think a lot of people know
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.280
today um I think a lot of people know
you as a well known machine learning and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
you as a well known machine learning and
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.310
you as a well known machine learning and
deep learning and robotics researcher

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320
deep learning and robotics researcher
 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.110
deep learning and robotics researcher
like to have people here but about your

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
like to have people here but about your
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.970
like to have people here but about your
story how did you end up doing the work

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
story how did you end up doing the work
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.009
story how did you end up doing the work
that you do yeah it's a it's a good

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019
that you do yeah it's a it's a good
 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.330
that you do yeah it's a it's a good
question and actually if you would have

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
question and actually if you would have
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.759
question and actually if you would have
asked me as a as a 14 year old what I

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
asked me as a as a 14 year old what I
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.580
asked me as a as a 14 year old what I
was aspiring to do it probably would not

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
was aspiring to do it probably would not
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460
was aspiring to do it probably would not
have been this in fact at the time I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
have been this in fact at the time I
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.509
have been this in fact at the time I
thought being a professional basketball

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
thought being a professional basketball
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.120
thought being a professional basketball
player would be the right way to go I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
player would be the right way to go I
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850
player would be the right way to go I
don't think I was able to achieve it I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
don't think I was able to achieve it I
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500
don't think I was able to achieve it I
feel that machine let me left out that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
feel that machine let me left out that
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780
feel that machine let me left out that
DeVos ball didn't work out yeah that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
DeVos ball didn't work out yeah that
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.160
DeVos ball didn't work out yeah that
didn't work out it was a lot of fun

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
didn't work out it was a lot of fun
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720
didn't work out it was a lot of fun
playing basketball but it didn't work

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
playing basketball but it didn't work
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.420
playing basketball but it didn't work
out to try to make it into a career

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
out to try to make it into a career
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150
out to try to make it into a career
so what I really liked in school was

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
so what I really liked in school was
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970
so what I really liked in school was
physics and math and so from there it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
physics and math and so from there it
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439
physics and math and so from there it
seemed pretty natural to study

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
seemed pretty natural to study
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.510
seemed pretty natural to study
engineering which is applying physics

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
engineering which is applying physics
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939
engineering which is applying physics
and math in the real world and I should

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
and math in the real world and I should
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799
and math in the real world and I should
them after my undergrad in electrical

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
them after my undergrad in electrical
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689
them after my undergrad in electrical
engineering a she wasn't so sure what

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
engineering a she wasn't so sure what
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.509
engineering a she wasn't so sure what
the Duke is which we anything

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
the Duke is which we anything
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.889
the Duke is which we anything
engineering seemed interesting to me

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
engineering seemed interesting to me
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.810
engineering seemed interesting to me
like understanding how anything works

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
like understanding how anything works
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240
like understanding how anything works
seems interesting trying to build

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
seems interesting trying to build
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090
seems interesting trying to build
anything is interesting and in some

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
anything is interesting and in some
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620
anything is interesting and in some
sense artificial intelligence went out

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
sense artificial intelligence went out
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.010
sense artificial intelligence went out
because it seemed like it could somehow

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
because it seemed like it could somehow
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.400
because it seemed like it could somehow
help all disciplines in some way and

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410
help all disciplines in some way and
 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.180
help all disciplines in some way and
also it seems somehow

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190
also it seems somehow
 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.220
also it seems somehow
a little more at the core of everything

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230
a little more at the core of everything
 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.290
a little more at the core of everything
like you think about how a machine can

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300
like you think about how a machine can
 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.840
like you think about how a machine can
think then maybe that's more the core of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
think then maybe that's more the core of
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460
think then maybe that's more the core of
everything else than picking any

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
everything else than picking any
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.000
everything else than picking any
specific discipline and saying you know

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010
specific discipline and saying you know
 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.710
specific discipline and saying you know
a is the new electricity sounds like the

fourteen-year-old here's know if you had

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160
fourteen-year-old here's know if you had
 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.840
fourteen-year-old here's know if you had
an earlier version of that event you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
an earlier version of that event you
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910
an earlier version of that event you
know in the past few years you've done a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
know in the past few years you've done a
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980
know in the past few years you've done a
lot of work in deep reinforcement

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
lot of work in deep reinforcement
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.400
lot of work in deep reinforcement
learning what's happening why is deeper

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410
learning what's happening why is deeper

before I worked in deep reinforcement

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
before I worked in deep reinforcement
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.560
before I worked in deep reinforcement
learning and I work a lot in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
learning and I work a lot in
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780

reinforcement learning actually with you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
reinforcement learning actually with you
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.200
reinforcement learning actually with you
and ER at Stanford of course and so we

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
and ER at Stanford of course and so we
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.230
and ER at Stanford of course and so we
worked on autonomous helicopter flight

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240
worked on autonomous helicopter flight
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.700
worked on autonomous helicopter flight
then later at Berkeley with some of my

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

what characterized the work was a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030
what characterized the work was a
 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.390
what characterized the work was a
combination of learning that enabled

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
combination of learning that enabled
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.260

things that would not be possible

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
things that would not be possible
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270
things that would not be possible
without learning but also a lot of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
without learning but also a lot of
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.040
without learning but also a lot of
domain expertise in

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
domain expertise in
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.150
domain expertise in

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160
with the learning to get this to work
 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.410
with the learning to get this to work
and it it was very interesting because

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
and it it was very interesting because
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.700
and it it was very interesting because
you needed the main expertise which is

you needed the main expertise which is
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.410
you needed the main expertise which is
fun to acquire but at the same time was

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420

need domain expertise plus machine

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

prediction so that makes several ways to
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.320
prediction so that makes several ways to
come in deeper also learning so I think

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
come in deeper also learning so I think
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.190
come in deeper also learning so I think

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
supervised learning is about learning an
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830
supervised learning is about learning an
input-output mapping with reinforcement

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840
input-output mapping with reinforcement
 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.050
input-output mapping with reinforcement
learning there is the notion of where

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
learning there is the notion of where
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.729
learning there is the notion of where
does the data even come from so that's

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
does the data even come from so that's
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.949
does the data even come from so that's
the exploration problem when you have

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
the exploration problem when you have
 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.540
the exploration problem when you have
data how do you do credit assignment how

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550
data how do you do credit assignment how
 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.220
data how do you do credit assignment how
do you understand what actions you took

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
do you understand what actions you took
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.370
do you understand what actions you took
early on got you the reward later and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380
early on got you the reward later and
 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.080
early on got you the reward later and
then there's issues of safety when you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
then there's issues of safety when you
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.699
then there's issues of safety when you
have a system of times like collecting

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
have a system of times like collecting
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.340
have a system of times like collecting
data essentially rather dangerous in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
data essentially rather dangerous in
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.870
data essentially rather dangerous in
most situations imagine the self-driving

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880
most situations imagine the self-driving
 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.220
most situations imagine the self-driving
car company that says we're just gonna

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
car company that says we're just gonna
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.990
car company that says we're just gonna
run deep reinforcement learning it's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
run deep reinforcement learning it's
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400
run deep reinforcement learning it's
pretty likely that car will get into a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
pretty likely that car will get into a
 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.750
pretty likely that car will get into a
lot of accidents before it does anything

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760
lot of accidents before it does anything
 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.500
lot of accidents before it does anything
useful

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
useful
 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.060
useful
you need two negative examples of those

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070
you need two negative examples of those
 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.979
you need two negative examples of those
oh right you do need some negative

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989
oh right you do need some negative
 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.830
oh right you do need some negative
examples somehow yeah send positive ones

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
examples somehow yeah send positive ones
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.500
examples somehow yeah send positive ones
hopefully so I think there's still a lot

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
hopefully so I think there's still a lot
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.330
hopefully so I think there's still a lot
of challenges in deep reinforcement

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
of challenges in deep reinforcement
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.790
of challenges in deep reinforcement
learning in terms of working out some of

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800
learning in terms of working out some of
 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.170
learning in terms of working out some of
the specifics of how to get these things

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180
the specifics of how to get these things
 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.490
the specifics of how to get these things
to work so the deep part is the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
to work so the deep part is the
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.560
to work so the deep part is the
representation within the reinforcement

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570
representation within the reinforcement
 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.659
representation within the reinforcement
learning itself still has a lot of

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669
learning itself still has a lot of
 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.750
learning itself still has a lot of
questions and what I feel is that with

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
questions and what I feel is that with
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520
questions and what I feel is that with
the advanced advances in deep learning

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530
the advanced advances in deep learning
 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.740
the advanced advances in deep learning
somehow one part of the puzzle in

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750
somehow one part of the puzzle in
 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.990
somehow one part of the puzzle in
reinforcement learning has been largely

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
reinforcement learning has been largely
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.340
reinforcement learning has been largely
addressed which is the representation

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350
addressed which is the representation
 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.960
addressed which is the representation
part so if

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
part so if
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.760
part so if
if there is a pattern we can probably

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770
if there is a pattern we can probably
 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.680
if there is a pattern we can probably
represent it with a deep network and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
represent it with a deep network and
 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.390
represent it with a deep network and
capture that pattern and then how that

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400
capture that pattern and then how that
 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.190
capture that pattern and then how that
tease apart the pattern is still a big

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200
tease apart the pattern is still a big
 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.950
tease apart the pattern is still a big
challenge in reinforcement learning so I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
challenge in reinforcement learning so I
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470
challenge in reinforcement learning so I
think big challenges are how to get

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
think big challenges are how to get
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.510
think big challenges are how to get
systems to reason over long time

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520
systems to reason over long time
 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.210
systems to reason over long time
horizons so right now a lot of the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220
horizons so right now a lot of the
 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.890
horizons so right now a lot of the
successes in deep reinforcement learning

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
successes in deep reinforcement learning
 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
successes in deep reinforcement learning
are very short horizon there are

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910
are very short horizon there are
 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.180
are very short horizon there are
problems where if you act well over a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190
problems where if you act well over a
 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.850
problems where if you act well over a
five second horizon you act well over

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860
five second horizon you act well over
 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.420
five second horizon you act well over
the entire problem and so a five second

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430
the entire problem and so a five second
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.680
the entire problem and so a five second
skill was something very different from

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
skill was something very different from
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.590
skill was something very different from
a day-long skill or the ability to live

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600
a day-long skill or the ability to live
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.620
a day-long skill or the ability to live
a life as a robot or some software agent

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630
a life as a robot or some software agent
 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.060
a life as a robot or some software agent
so I think there's a lot of challenges

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070
so I think there's a lot of challenges
 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.310
so I think there's a lot of challenges
there I think safety has a lot of

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320
there I think safety has a lot of
 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.280
there I think safety has a lot of
challenges in terms of how do you learn

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
challenges in terms of how do you learn
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.590
challenges in terms of how do you learn
learn safely and also how do you keep

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600
learn safely and also how do you keep
 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.360
learn safely and also how do you keep
learning once you're already pretty good

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
learning once you're already pretty good
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.570
learning once you're already pretty good
so give an example again that a lot of

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580
so give an example again that a lot of
 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.470
so give an example again that a lot of
people would be familiar with

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480
people would be familiar with
 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.110
people would be familiar with
self-driving cars for a self-driving car

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120
self-driving cars for a self-driving car
 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.210
self-driving cars for a self-driving car
to be better than a human driver I

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220
to be better than a human driver I
 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.190
to be better than a human driver I
should that human drivers may begin to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200
should that human drivers may begin to
 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.140
should that human drivers may begin to
accidents bad accidents every three

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150
accidents bad accidents every three
 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.960
accidents bad accidents every three
million miles or something and so that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970
million miles or something and so that
 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.210
million miles or something and so that
takes a long time to see the negative

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220
takes a long time to see the negative
 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.130
takes a long time to see the negative
data once you're as good as a human

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140
data once you're as good as a human
 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.600
data once you're as good as a human
driver but you want your cell down in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610
driver but you want your cell down in
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.940
driver but you want your cell down in
car to be better than a human driver and

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950
car to be better than a human driver and
 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.320
car to be better than a human driver and
so at that point the data collection

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330
so at that point the data collection
 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.880
so at that point the data collection
becomes really really difficult to get

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890
becomes really really difficult to get
 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.850
becomes really really difficult to get
that interesting data that makes your

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
that interesting data that makes your
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.740
that interesting data that makes your
system improve there's a lot of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750
system improve there's a lot of
 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.140
system improve there's a lot of
challenges related to exploration that

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
challenges related to exploration that
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.450
challenges related to exploration that
tie into that but one of the things I'm

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460
tie into that but one of the things I'm
 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.140
tie into that but one of the things I'm
actually most excited about right now is

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150
actually most excited about right now is
 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.270
actually most excited about right now is
seeing if we can actually take a step

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280
seeing if we can actually take a step
 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.430
seeing if we can actually take a step
back and also learn the reinforcement

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440
back and also learn the reinforcement
 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.950
back and also learn the reinforcement
learning algorithm so reinforcement is

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960
learning algorithm so reinforcement is
 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.840
learning algorithm so reinforcement is
very complex credits and very complex

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850
very complex credits and very complex
 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.850
very complex credits and very complex
explorations very complex and so maybe

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860
explorations very complex and so maybe
 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.820
explorations very complex and so maybe
just like how deep learning for

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
just like how deep learning for
 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.200
just like how deep learning for
supervised learning was able to replace

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
supervised learning was able to replace
 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.450
supervised learning was able to replace
a lot of domain expertise maybe we can

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460
a lot of domain expertise maybe we can
 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.810
a lot of domain expertise maybe we can
have programs that are learned that are

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820
have programs that are learned that are
 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.370
have programs that are learned that are
reinforcement learning programs and the

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380
reinforcement learning programs and the
 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.040
reinforcement learning programs and the
do all this instead of us designing the

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050
do all this instead of us designing the
 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.020
do all this instead of us designing the
details the river-water functional

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030
details the river-water functional
 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.060
details the river-water functional
during the whole program so this would

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070
during the whole program so this would
 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.590
during the whole program so this would
be learning the entire reinforcement

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600
be learning the entire reinforcement
 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.110
be learning the entire reinforcement
learning program so it would be imagine

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
learning program so it would be imagine
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.570
learning program so it would be imagine
you have a reinforcement learning

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580
you have a reinforcement learning
 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.630
you have a reinforcement learning
program whatever it is and you you throw

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640
program whatever it is and you you throw
 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.490
program whatever it is and you you throw
it out some problem and then you see how

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500
it out some problem and then you see how
 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.810
it out some problem and then you see how
long it takes to learn and then you say

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820
long it takes to learn and then you say
 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.900
long it takes to learn and then you say
well that took a while now let another

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910
well that took a while now let another
 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.760
well that took a while now let another
program modify this ring for

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770
program modify this ring for
 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.279
program modify this ring for
learning program after the modification

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289
learning program after the modification
 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.249
learning program after the modification
see how fast it learns if it learns more

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259
see how fast it learns if it learns more
 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.050
see how fast it learns if it learns more
quickly that was a good modification and

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060
quickly that was a good modification and
 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.839
quickly that was a good modification and
maybe you keep it and improve from there

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849
maybe you keep it and improve from there
 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.330
maybe you keep it and improve from there
Wow I see right yeah this is direction

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340
Wow I see right yeah this is direction
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.760
Wow I see right yeah this is direction
yeah it's I think it's a lot to do with

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770
yeah it's I think it's a lot to do with
 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.260
yeah it's I think it's a lot to do with
maybe the amount of compute that's

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270
maybe the amount of compute that's
 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.839
maybe the amount of compute that's
becoming available so the more this

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849
becoming available so the more this
 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.850
becoming available so the more this
would be running reinforcement learning

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
would be running reinforcement learning
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.830
would be running reinforcement learning
in the inner loop whereas right now we

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840
in the inner loop whereas right now we
 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.480
in the inner loop whereas right now we
were unreinforced millenials the final

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490
were unreinforced millenials the final
 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.990
were unreinforced millenials the final
thing and so the more compute we get the

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000
thing and so the more compute we get the
 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.520
thing and so the more compute we get the
more it becomes possible to maybe run

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530
more it becomes possible to maybe run
 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.980
more it becomes possible to maybe run
something like reinforcement learning in

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990
something like reinforcement learning in
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.760
something like reinforcement learning in
the inner loop of a bigger algorithm so

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770
the inner loop of a bigger algorithm so
 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.249
the inner loop of a bigger algorithm so
you know starting from the 14 euro you

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259
you know starting from the 14 euro you
 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:23.779
you know starting from the 14 euro you
you've worked in the iPhone maybe what

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789
you've worked in the iPhone maybe what
 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.659
you've worked in the iPhone maybe what
some 20-plus years now so so tell me a

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669
some 20-plus years now so so tell me a
 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.059
some 20-plus years now so so tell me a
bit about how your understanding of AI

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:29.069
bit about how your understanding of AI
 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.080
bit about how your understanding of AI
has evolved over this at this time yeah

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090
has evolved over this at this time yeah
 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.990
has evolved over this at this time yeah
so when I started looking at AI sorry

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
so when I started looking at AI sorry
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.779
so when I started looking at AI sorry
interesting cuz it really coincided with

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:38.789
interesting cuz it really coincided with
 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.520
interesting cuz it really coincided with
coming to Stanford to do my master's

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530
coming to Stanford to do my master's
 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.029
coming to Stanford to do my master's
degree there and there were some icons

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039
degree there and there were some icons
 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.070
degree there and there were some icons
there like John McCarthy who I got to

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080
there like John McCarthy who I got to
 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.080
there like John McCarthy who I got to
talk with but who had a very different

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.090
talk with but who had a very different
 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.689
talk with but who had a very different
approach to and in the year 2004 what

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699
approach to and in the year 2004 what
 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:52.339
approach to and in the year 2004 what
most people are doing at the time but

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:52.349
most people are doing at the time but
 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:55.430
most people are doing at the time but
also talking with Daphne Koller and I

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440
also talking with Daphne Koller and I
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.020
also talking with Daphne Koller and I
think a lot of my initial thinking of AI

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.030
think a lot of my initial thinking of AI
 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.350
think a lot of my initial thinking of AI
was shaped by Daphne's thinking her AI

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360
was shaped by Daphne's thinking her AI
 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.830
was shaped by Daphne's thinking her AI
class her brow was the graphical models

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840
class her brow was the graphical models
 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.469
class her brow was the graphical models
class and kind of really being intrigued

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479
class and kind of really being intrigued
 

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.529
class and kind of really being intrigued
by how simply a distribution over many

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539
by how simply a distribution over many
 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:10.999
by how simply a distribution over many
random variables and then being able to

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:11.009
random variables and then being able to
 

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:12.860
random variables and then being able to
condition on some subsets of variables

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:12.870
condition on some subsets of variables
 

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.209
condition on some subsets of variables
and throwing conclusions about others

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:14.219
and throwing conclusions about others
 

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:16.519
and throwing conclusions about others
could actually give you so much if you

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:16.529
could actually give you so much if you
 

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.870
could actually give you so much if you
can somehow make it computationally

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880
can somehow make it computationally
 

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.839
can somehow make it computationally
intractable which was definitely the

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:20.849
intractable which was definitely the
 

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:23.570
intractable which was definitely the
challenge to make it computable and then

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580
challenge to make it computable and then
 

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.990
challenge to make it computable and then
from there when I start my PhD and her

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000
from there when I start my PhD and her
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.939
from there when I start my PhD and her
you you arrived at Stanford and I think

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:28.949
you you arrived at Stanford and I think
 

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:30.890
you you arrived at Stanford and I think
you gave me a really good reality check

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
you gave me a really good reality check
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.440
you gave me a really good reality check
that's that's not the right metric to

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:33.450
that's that's not the right metric to
 

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.170
that's that's not the right metric to
evaluate your your work by and to really

you're working on to what impact it can

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560
you're working on to what impact it can
 

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.740
you're working on to what impact it can
can really have what change it can make

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:42.750
can really have what change it can make
 

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.540
can really have what change it can make
rather than what's the math that

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.550
rather than what's the math that
 

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.910
rather than what's the math that
happened to to be in your work right

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920
happened to to be in your work right

this doesn't mean I I

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:48.329
this doesn't mean I I
 

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.150
this doesn't mean I I
that I did not realize that we got

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160
that I did not realize that we got

that I did not realize that we got
through that yeah it's actually one of

00:08:51.439 --> 00:08:51.449
through that yeah it's actually one of
 

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:52.970
through that yeah it's actually one of
the things that most often to people

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980
the things that most often to people
 

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.799
the things that most often to people
people asking them once if you're gonna

advice do you have for them I think it's

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:21.749
advice do you have for them I think it's
 

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:22.970
advice do you have for them I think it's
a really good time to get into

a really good time to get into
 

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.999
a really good time to get into
artificial intelligence it's if you look

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:26.009
artificial intelligence it's if you look
 

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:28.729
artificial intelligence it's if you look
at the demand for for people it's so

00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:28.739
at the demand for for people it's so
 

00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:30.109
at the demand for for people it's so
high there is so many so many job

00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:30.119
high there is so many so many job
 

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:31.609
high there is so many so many job
opportunities so many things you can do

00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:31.619
opportunities so many things you can do
 

00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:33.769

research wise build new companies and so
 

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:35.960
research wise build new companies and so
forth so I would say yes it's definitely

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:35.970
forth so I would say yes it's definitely
 

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.479
