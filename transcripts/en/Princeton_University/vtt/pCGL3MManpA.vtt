00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.065
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.065 --> 00:00:02.940
ALEXIS MUTSCHLER: We're
here because the roof

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.210
and the cupola on Nassau
Hall need to be restored.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.840
It's been 60 years since
the roof or the cupola

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.100
have been touched.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.720
The roof was last replaced
in the late 1950s.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.890
As a result, in the
past decade or so,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.280
we've done a lot
of roof repairs,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.290
including chasing leaks.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.980
Age and weather has taken a
very large toll on the cupola.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.990
The copper seams have started
separating through the years.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.740
And as a result, water
has been getting in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.360
through the copper seams.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.330
And it has not only
rusted the iron structure,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.940
but it's also gotten
behind the stucco

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.670
and allowed it to
crack and separate

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.430
from the main brick structure.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.890
It is very important
to the university

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.320
as well as to the
municipality to make sure

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
that the cupola is restored
in its proper fashion

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.960
and is historically accurate.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.340
The project team
spent a great deal

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
of time working with the
Princeton University Library

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.940
as well as other
sources to find out

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.160
what the original
cupola looked like when

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.230
it was last reconstructed
in the 1920s.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.000
We found some really neat things
while we started construction.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.210
The people who cast
all the copper --

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.070
we could still
see their markings

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.260
for how they were putting
the pieces together,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.535
and even some math
notes that they did.

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:28.910
It's amazing
because none of this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.190
can be seen from the ground.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.280
But up close, it
really is pretty cool

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.340
seeing that little
bit of history.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.440
If we do our job
right, the cupola

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.540
will look almost exactly
the same, only better.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.900
The biggest difference
will be that it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.630
will take about 20 years
for the bright copper

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.580
to turn the beautiful
patina green that we've

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.050
grown so accustomed to.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.390
Working on this building
is truly an honor.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.020
The fact that this building
has played such a vital role

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.660
in our history as a nation --

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.880
just thinking of all
the men and women

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.100
who've gone through this
building, and the role they

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.030
played --

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.009
is truly humbling.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.280
And it's an honor to be able to
be a part of its past, present,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.875
and future.
