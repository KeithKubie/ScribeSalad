00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here's my solution. I modified the code in trivial ways.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I go through all the i's as opposed to leaving out the first and last node,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and because we are cyclic, I now have to add the model of division by the length of the path

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in this smoothing parameter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's it. So it's a very small modification.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I don't have a graphical interface, but what the points look like is very much like an oval,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
like this, after the smoothing. It actually put all endmarks a little bit,

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is a bit of a concern, which we address in a minute.
