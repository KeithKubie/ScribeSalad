00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.070
Two basic principles
provide the fundamental

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.040
theory behind the cloud
computing approach.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.620
The first is the so-called
Law of Large Numbers.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.180
This says that once you start
considering many customers

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.130
who's resources may vary over time,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.900
the average across all of them
will tend to be fairly constant.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.990
That's why a cloud
computing provider can pick

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
any amount of resources in capacity for
the cloud.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
And with that capacity,
can service lots of customers,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.670
whose peaks in the expected
demand are shifted in time.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.850
Second, there is the Principle
of Economies of Scale.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.950
Essentially, things
are cheaper by the dozen.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.700
When you start considering how many
different customers a cloud provider is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.210
able to leverage on a single
physical piece of hardware resource.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.460
The cost of that hardware
resource ends up being amortized.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.610
And ends up being an offset
by all of the fees

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.590
that the cloud provider is able
to gather from its customers.
