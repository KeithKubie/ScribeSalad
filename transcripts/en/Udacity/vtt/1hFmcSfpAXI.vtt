00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:04.656
Here we have an example of players
paying real money for in game currency.

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:10.637
$0.99 cents will get you 3000 of gold,
$4.99 gets you 18, 000, and

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:15.841
so on, and you can see this bonus listed
underneath the higher priced items.

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.149
And this is a great example
of being clear about value.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.056
The bonus markers make it obvious
that there's a specific benefit for

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.113
buying different,
higher priced items in the store.

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:28.363
And the user doesn't
have to do any math.

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:33.020
For example, I already know that
the $4.99 option compared to the $0.99

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.008
one will give me 20% more gold than
I would have gotten, had I gone for

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:38.229
the cheaper option.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.538
The store layout is also very clear.

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:44.590
They're only selling one item,
gold, the in game currency.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.276
So, the store isn't crowded
with too many options.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.968
Let's look at another example of
a store that could be improved.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.354
It has a good layout, but

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.984
I'm not immediately sure why I
should buy a higher priced item and

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:59.094
the store is mixing in game currency and
items for sale?

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:00.615
There's too much variety.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.717
This example is not as clear as our last
one, and I would be less likely to buy

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:07.991
higher priced items, or
really, anything in this store.

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:12.223
So make sure to show what kind of value
a player will be getting by buying your

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:13.171
in-app items.

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.456
It's important to have a nice layout,
and

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.620
most importantly be clear about value.
