ALEX MAIER: Hello and welcome
to the special episode of Women

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.650
Techmakers.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.010
My name is Alex Meier, and
I'm the community manager

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.640
at Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.970
Today with me are Karen
Sandler, the executive director

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.090
of the GNOME Foundation.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.284
Hello Karen.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:24.950
KAREN SANDLER: Hi,
Alex, how's it going?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.982
ALEX MAIER: Pretty good.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:27.690
KAREN SANDLER: I'm so
excited to be here,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.356
and I'm so excited to talk about
the outreach program for women.

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:30.970
Thank you.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.928
ALEX MAIER: Absolutely.

00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:33.270
Happy to have you on the show.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.850
My second guest today is
Marina Zhurakhinskaya,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990
who is the community
lead at Red Hat.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.499
How are you doing, Marina?

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:41.790
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA: Yes, hi.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.750
I'm doing well.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.010
Very excited to be on
the program as well.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.850
ALEX MAIER: Wonderful.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.800
As you mentioned
earlier, we are here

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.420
to talk about the women
outreach program at GNOME.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.150
Marina, can you tell us
a little bit about it?

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.450
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA: The
very first precursory program

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.070
was the Women's Summer
Outreach program

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.360
that was done by the
GNOME Foundation in 2006.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.280
And the reason we
did that was we

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.430
participated in Google Summer
of Code, the great opportunity

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.690
that Google has for
students to have

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.670
paid remote internships working
with a mentor on an open source

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.692
project.

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:24.150
And we participated
in that program

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.810
since 2005, when it started.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.250
And in 2006 we had 180
applicants, and none of them

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.750
appeared to be women.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.360
So, that was the first time
when Hanna Wallach and Chis

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.500
Ball put together a two-month
program very similar

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.880
to Google Summer of Code.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200
And when they put this
call out, they in fact

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.990
had 100 applicants
for the program.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.970
And over the next
few years we noticed

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.350
that that did not actually
leave a lasting impact

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.020
on our communities.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.690
In 2009, when I was one of the
eight women at the conference,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.250
and one of the
four women who were

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.270
software developers
for the project,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.810
from among about
1,000 contributors,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.500
and we still had maybe one or no
women in Google Summer of Code

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.330
this year, we decided to
kind of reinvent the program

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.674
and start over in
the internships.

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.090
KAREN SANDLER: How long has
the program been in existence?

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.840
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA:
Since 2010, and we

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.570
have had 130 participants.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.120
We do two rounds
per year, because we

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.560
have to catch up so much.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.910
And we are noticing that
there are advantages

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.110
to both doing a May through
August round and a December

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.364
to March round.

00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:40.280
In particular, December
to March round appeals

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.160
to students in the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.110
But two main differences
from Google Summer of Code

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.830
is that we are actually open
to non-students as well,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.580
and a big part of our
participants are not students,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.400
and also we have non-coding
tasks in addition

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.712
to coding tasks.

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:58.920
ALEX MAIER: Oh, that's great.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.140
Karen, what is GNOME
Foundation's role

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.352
in all of this?

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:03.810
KAREN SANDLER: The
GNOME Foundation

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.726
organized the program.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.660
When we originally
founded the program,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.910
it was for the GNOME project.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.750
And we found that the
program had such a big impact

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.500
on our project, it was bringing
so many extraordinary women,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.470
we went from having,
as Marina said,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.700
4% women at our annual
conference, which

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.970
is called GUADEC, to this
year we recently had 18%,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.830
which is often a statistic
given as the number of women

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.280
in proprietary software.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.070
And the gap between
free software

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.290
and proprietary
software was very

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.630
wide in terms of how many
women were participating,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.650
which was really surprising.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.549
We've had this major
change in GNOME,

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.090
and because it was
so good for GNOME,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.440
we decided we couldn't
keep it to ourselves.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.820
What we did was we opened
it up to other free software

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.700
projects, who also were
interested in trying

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.240
to help solve this problem.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.360
We now have over 20
projects participating

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.380
in the outreach program for
women, including the Linux

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.660
kernel, and Mozilla,
and Wikimedia-- a lot

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.630
of great organizations.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.760
We have both Debian and Fedora.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.350
It's pretty fun.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.240
And different
projects participate

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.660
during different rounds,
and GNOME Foundation

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.620
serves as the overall
organizer for the project.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.390
As Googlers know,
the Summer of Code

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.760
is a massive and
inspirational program.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.030
It's amazing.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.170
I honestly have no idea
how Google handles it.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.660
It's such a big and
amazing project.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.030
But for us, having
this smaller program

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.100
where-- in this
particular round--

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.950
we have around 30
participants, it's

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.240
a lot for a small nonprofit
organization to handle.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.400
But we do so for all
of the free software

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.797
projects participating, and
I think it works out well.

00:04:42.797 --> 00:04:43.880
ALEX MAIER: This is great.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.810
So have you experienced
any growth since 2010

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.060
in the number of participants?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.434
Are you trying to
keep it steady?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.660
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA:
Absolutely.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.570
We started with about 10
participants each round,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.840
was a GNOME project.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.895
And then when Karen stepped
in as executive director,

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.420
she suggested that we
expand the program.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.530
At first we did a pilot
round, expanding the program

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.610
to just one project, which
was the twisted project,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.540
was a Software
Freedom Conservancy.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.610
And as any programmer
knows, expanding one to two

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.430
is almost as hard as
expanding as two to many.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.970
So, that was the
first step, and then

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.100
after that when we
expanded to having

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.340
about 10 participating
organizations in each round,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.125
we have had about
30 participants

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.687
in each round for the
last three rounds.

00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:40.770
ALEX MAIER: This is great.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.170
What kind of tasks
can women expect

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.290
when they participate
in your program?

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.577
What can they choose from?

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.410
KAREN SANDLER: There's
really a wide variety

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.600
of tasks or projects
that women can

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.590
work on when they join the
Outreach Program for Women.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.250
As Marina was saying, one
of the key differences

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.960
between Outreach Program for
Women and Google Summer of Code

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.770
is that our program welcomes
women to do other things that

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.000
are non-coding tasks, which is
really valuable for attracting

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.430
women to free software.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.930
So, for example, we have
marketing internships

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.490
and design internships
and things like that.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.350
I think it's several things.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.850
One, is that it's
an acknowledgement

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.950
that free software, and
software in general,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.600
needs so much more than
just coding and valuing

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.330
contributions in those
fields it's really important.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.700
Another thing is
that sometimes women

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.075
who are interested
in coding find

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:34.780
it a little more
accessible to come

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.760
in in some of those
other projects.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.630
I, for example, had an intern
who I was the mentor for,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.290
who did marketing, and she
had such a good experience

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.060
with her Outreach
Program for Women

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.080
that she took coding
classes and she

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.720
participated in Summer of Code.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.080
So we have some of
that happening as well.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.680
I think it's twofold.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.710
It's valuing the non-coding
side of free software

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.004
and also recognizing
that helping women build

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.420
relationships
within our community

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.375
is also really valuable.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:05.750
ALEX MAIER: How
would a woman who

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.330
wanted to participate in
this program be able to join?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
What does she need to
do and what can she

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.620
expect when she first
establishes contact?

00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:18.260
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA:
What we require

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.910
of all participating
organizations

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.920
is to have a list
of mentors who are

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.720
available at any time
throughout the year,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.510
for the prospective participants
to approach and to work

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.670
with informally on
contributing to the project.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.870
A very strong
requirement that we

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.800
have for the program
for the applicants

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.100
is that they need to make
a relevant contribution

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.460
during their application
process and offer

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.780
the informal mentorship
and help during that time.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.460
Just going over the
available organizations

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.230
and available projects
and contacting a mentor

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.100
and just following
the guidelines

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.050
from the organization
about how to get started,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.650
and actually getting
started, diving in

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.060
is the best recipe
for planning to apply.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.900
KAREN SANDLER: I love
this part of the program

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.210
because it basically
assists all applicants

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.100
in getting involved in
free software projects.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.800
We have to be very selective.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.100
We don't have funding
for a lot of spots.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.540
And so it's very hard to
always choose the women

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.810
that we wind up selecting.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.500
But all of the women who
apply have the opportunity

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.630
to work with a mentor
and have the opportunity

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.730
to become a contributor to a
free and open source project.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.520
Just the application process
alone is really valuable

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.000
to go through.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.150
We do find that women who
go through the process

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.796
sometimes, even
if they didn't get

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:46.170
the internship during the time
that they applied, if they

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.580
stuck around and
continued to contribute,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.480
they become a much stronger
candidate for the next round.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.814
Even though we get many more
applicants than we can accept,

00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:57.480
every woman who
completes an application

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.960
has become a contributor to a
free and open source software

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.460
project.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.964
I think that's pretty cool.

00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:04.380
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA: I've
seen a lot of our participants

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.100
describe this first
contribution as something

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.280
that got them hooked,
that showed to them how

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.150
addictive contributing
to free software

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.740
is, because it's a thrill to
be able to see changes go out

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.190
and be publicly available
and be making a difference

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.100
in a project that's available to
anybody and can help somebody,

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.630
and a lot of people are
using it around the world.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.100
A lot of people have
described it as addictive.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.770
I'd also like to mention
another requirement

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.420
that we have for our interns
is to blog every two weeks.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.270
The blogs have been aggregated
on the Women in Free Software

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.570
planet, and that's an amazing
boost to read that planet

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.440
and to see what they are doing
during their internships.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.930
It also gives them visibility.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.124
ALEX MAIER: Is there
a website that women

00:09:54.124 --> 00:09:55.540
who are interested
in your program

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.777
can visit and learn more
and maybe participate?

00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:00.860
KAREN SANDLER: Absolutely.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.410
You should go to gnome.org/opw.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.830
You'll find information about
our program, how to apply,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.621
what participating
organizations there are,

00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:11.662
and who is participating now.

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.620
ALEX MAIER: And when is
the next round opening?

00:10:16.162 --> 00:10:18.120
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA:
The application deadline

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.540
is very similar in time
to Google Summer of Code.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.470
For Outreach for
Women, it's March 19.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.600
For Google Summer of
Code it's March 21.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.187
What we do for our May
through August round

00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:33.520
is that we parallel the dates
for Google Summer of Code,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.170
because part of
what we like to do

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.900
is kind of going back to
the original motivation.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.072
For the program, we want
to encourage more women who

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.600
are students, who
are coders to apply

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.640
for Google Summer of Code.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.680
That's part of what we
do with the program.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.190
So for example, last summer
10% of the participants

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.060
in the Summer of
Code were women,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.030
and the organizations
that also participated

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.610
in Outreach Program
for Women had 14% women

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.954
amongst their participants
in Google Summer of Code.

00:11:01.954 --> 00:11:03.620
KAREN SANDLER: One
great example of that

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.840
is that Wikimedia
media, for example.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.680
In all of the years
of participating

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.620
in Summer of Code, they had
only ever had one applicant.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.040
After participating in one
round of Summer of Code

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.620
they had seven female
participants in Summer of Code.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.380
So the program has
been really working.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.620
It's amazing.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.830
ALEX MAIER: This is great.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.320
The numbers, the percentages
that you're naming

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.240
are absolutely not
typical in the industry,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.120
and particularly in the
open source project.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.130
So great kudos for
you for running this.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.390
KAREN SANDLER: Google has
been a really strong sponsor

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.848
since the beginning
of the program.

00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:38.887
Aside from just providing
the model of Summer

00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:40.970
of Code, and the fact that
the two programs really

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.840
work together,
Google sponsorship

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.264
has been really important.

00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:45.180
ALEX MAIER: Thank you.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.380
MARINA ZHURAKHINSKAYA:
Absolutely.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.380
ALEX MAIER: Well, thank
you very much for coming

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.130
on the program,
Karen and Marina.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.450
I'm looking forward to
welcoming you back on the show

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.090
again sometime.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.720
Thank you very
much for watching.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.070
My name is Alex Meier, and
this is Women Techmakers.
