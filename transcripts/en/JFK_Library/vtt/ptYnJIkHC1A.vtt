00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:03.086
- Never in the past, in the history,

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:07.258
except during second World War,

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:11.425
have we had so many, have
we not had so many refugees,

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.458
65 million refugees now.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.653
The United Nations has to feed every day,

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.192
at least 135 million people.

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:24.754
Every day, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.637
- [Man] How many does
the United Nations feed?

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:27.603
How many?

00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:28.770
- 135 million.

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.072
- [Man] That's what the UN feeds everyday?

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:35.155
- Yes, including 65 million refugees.

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:39.115
We need to mobilize huge resources.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.048
The more refugees the more problems.

00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:46.959
I think the less humanitarian support

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.878
come from international community.

00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:51.415
That's very troubling.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:53.948
That is why people are complaining

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:56.478
against the United Nation.

00:00:56.478 --> 00:01:00.061
At this time, I count
on the United States.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:05.740
United State is by any
standard, by any standard,

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:09.421
the most important, most resourceful,

00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.233
most powerful country in the world.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.995
And continues engagement
and global leadership

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:19.283
of the United States is crucial

00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:23.116
to make United Nations
united and deliverable.
