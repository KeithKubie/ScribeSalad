00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.700
 in this capsule we will see an example 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.589
 which will allow us to see maybe 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.610
 a little more precisely what we want 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.580
 say that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.490
 the analysis ps the different types 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 of environment and maybe give 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.640
 the more concrete example of the context in 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.600
 which an agent will have to make 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.600
 calculations and make decisions 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 in fact we will see an example that when 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 even very very simple it's taken from the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.059
 section 7.12 you books norvig russell and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 is sailing so that's what they call 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.140
 the world says yes and more we can see 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.989
 it's a bit like a game 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 of adventurous where one does the environment where 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.780
 it exists and where in addition that are 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 creatures that could devour our 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.480
 agent another agent him what he has to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 to make our player is to go 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.469
 pick up when they are in a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.199
 kind of dungeons in which comes 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.409
 among others holes in which 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.970
 money could fall 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.250
 so if we do a worse analysis of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.280
 this application the man the measure of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 badens performance that if we are going to land 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.970
 as the provides among others we will 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 measure very high performance if they 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 have managed to pick up the cinor a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.189
 very low measure at least 1000 if I am 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.159
 for example raffle the same box as the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.990
 one piece or falling into a hole 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.759
 we will also have a penalty of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 less hours per hp not for 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.060
 basically have a motivation l 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 encouragement to fetch gold the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 faster then get out of the dungeon 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 with the man and our agent or even a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 arrow 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.700
 and then we go social nation a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.920
 penalty if we decide to kill the web 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.890
 you know that or finally to try to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.899
 kill the one piece fully note the ofs 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.750
 environment note what will contain 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.119
 among other things it's the stench that can 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 come from adjacent charms where in 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.829
 more breezes that they will come from 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 adjacent charm where can be perceived 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.410
 in adjacent morning fields where 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.690
 found pits where the holes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510
 when we will be in the box 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.810
 associates then we will rather perceive a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.730
 flicker obviously needs a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.170
 piece that is in the grid and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.300
 this one dies if you shoot him an arrow 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.130
 we have a single arrow we can pick up 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.360
 lens on is in the same room 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 and we can get out of the cave if we 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.340
 found in box 1 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.840
 ok the starting box in itself is a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.850
 description of the different 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.590
 features of our of our 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.520
 environment 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.020
 so that's good because they 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.610
 sensors in finish have described rather 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.800
 what types of observations do we 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.200
 can have a given box one could 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.350
 perceive a stench or English 600 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.650
 ch 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.420
 a breeze or English breaks a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.830
 flicker in English twitter jack 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.130
 so in English apple that would be in the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.070
 where we would try to move to 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.270
 the outside of the grid at long tony 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.280
 vairelles is a cry that one would perceive 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.610
 have launched an arrow and that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.990
 managed to reach now because 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.880
 that the shareholders the shares 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.560
 finally we will be able to take these 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.580
 turn left to the right 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 advance grab their climb and 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.830
 thierry note arrow so that's written 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.450
 there all aspects of measuring 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.790
 environment performance title 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.140
 of observation as ready to see and the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.840
 shareholders the actions that can 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.220
 take in this context for this 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.220
 agency is to see in the environment 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.180
 now we could do an analysis 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.400
 properties with characteristics of 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.890
 of the environment is it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 completely observable not dense that 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.190
 if we are going to see a perception of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.080
 local so it's only when we 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.340
 found in a crusade jacentes 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.190
 hole to one more than we will perceive that 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.380
 there is possibly a more rom to the box 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.480
 adjacent see a hole as appropriate 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.940
 is it deterministic of huy 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.590
 the effect of each action in this case 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.470
 will be predictable he postpones 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.630
 of randomness is it episodic 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.150
 no clearly we will move from 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.180
 sequentially in the environment 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.100
 so our action has a given time for 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.730
 influence the state of the environment 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.040
 plan too soon we will find ourselves in the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.860
 rate as following is what these 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.480
 statistics static sorry yes we're going 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.980
 arise in that if our 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.770
 environment is such that the one piece 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.990
 and the fake ones do not move the fake ones 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 also obviously the us group or if the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.970
 game set so that they could 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.890
 to assume that they are not moving 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.720
 it's discreet yes we could list 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.130
 all the grids possible every 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.130
 possible configurations of environment 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.220
 and the number of actions is over is this 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.570
 that it's a single agent yes so the 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.460
 selection actually the world can be done 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.710
 it is who can devour us on the head 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.180
 his room so in fact we can 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.110
 consider as part of 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.230
 the environment 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.030
 a bit like we can fall into the hole 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.040
 if we move in a box that he 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.260
 contains too much ok so that's 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.760
 the application where it sinks a 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.700
 analysis of all characteristics 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.870
 the properties of the environment in 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.669
 this context and finally but actually 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.250
 what are we going to do a species of have done 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.990
 a kind of simulation of the agent that 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.490
 would move in our environment 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.200
 to maybe see a little more 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.210
 precisely in what context is this 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.600
 that our agents us different types 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.970
 agents will have reasoned then act 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.740
 in a typical environment so in 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.560
 this case we start our agent 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.570
 starts at box 1 1 and here we have the 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.760
 forgiveness perception here we would have a 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.560
 perception in this case we perceive 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.320
 absolutely nothing no observation 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.950
 so our agent in his internal memory 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.689
 could conclude that this case is ok 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.939
 in his studio not since 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:14.439
 of one piece same thing here and here 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.879
 since we have no perception associated with 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:20.229
 which will bring us though a well or a 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.229
 rom more in adjacent squares 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:25.789
 so following his ready so take 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.979
 an action choose to go in honor 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:31.759
 choose to go to the top right 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:35.749
 our chosen to go upstairs and there we have 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:37.939
 like watching a breeze and at 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:41.419
 from this observation one can 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:45.199
 so have to maintain the uncertainty on 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.669
 the presence of the well either at the top or at 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.949
 right because if we're not in 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.719
 able to determine but our agent 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.789
 could remember that he 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.249
 there is possibly and then at the top or at 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.329
 right 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:57.739
 then the jump our agent could 

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:59.869
 decide to move to the other cause 

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:03.589
 who was associated in our memories 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:06.619
 alcohol hockey and when we watch at 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:11.329
 this box is a stent so the 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:12.889
 stench of one piece while should 

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:15.050
 to make joy in this case bath a 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.479
 agent who would be able to do the 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.659
 logical reasoning could actually 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:24.589
 come to the conclusion that there is 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:27.529
 necessarily one then to 7 4 6 and 1 8 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:30.769
 thumb this time and this is because 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:32.509
 that if there had been and then here we have 

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:37.219
 felt a breeze that was not the case 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:39.919
 and if we had a web more here in 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:41.629
 did we feel the stench we would have 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.999
 eu is here what was not the case 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:45.789
 so we can update our 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:49.129
 estimate of the environment then 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:51.379
 conclude that there is a well here full 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:54.169
 boom more here is among others we can 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:57.019
 so conclude that this lens and 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:08:00.050
 this hold this is ok do not have any 

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:02.149
 cooking and their notation could 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.569
 determine to decide to move 

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:07.150
 here in which he observes absolutely 

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.430
 nothing so 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:13.480
 we can conclude that up and to the right 

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:15.610
 the cases are ok and then the aja could 

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.610
 decide when to move to 

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.710
 right which in fact tend our 

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:24.340
 knowledge equivalent to parents 

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:28.450
 preferably from that and when 

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.650
 observe is among others the booth of 

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.530
 we can obviously because we 

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.110
 just find in top of seven cases if we 

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.250
 is observed a breeze also what 

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:43.210
 leads us to believe that there is 

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:45.360
 possibly a well here or here is by 

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:49.360
 against crucially we also observe 

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.730
 of flicker of the and so at this 

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.920
 target time the agent will pick up 

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.100
 their and go back to the starting square 

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.210
 to get out of the cave 

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.100
 so obviously I have not described 

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.700
 of algorithms I presented a 

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.830
 reasoning described in natural language 

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.990
 ultimately is what we will see in the 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.680
 short finally yielded algorithm allows 

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.970
 to do this type of reasoning there and 

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.010
 several other facts we will see 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.530
 really a lot of other apps 

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.790
 than just logical reasoning 

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.490
 but I hope this example has allowed 

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:24.400
 to perhaps clarify a little more what 

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.050
 kind of environment in which we 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.780
 might have to develop agents 

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.400
 and then what kind of network our calculation 

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.000
 it's in there people should be in 

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.000
 able to do
