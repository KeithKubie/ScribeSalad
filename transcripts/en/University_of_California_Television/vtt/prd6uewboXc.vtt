00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.995
- Our next speaker, I'm really
interested to hear about

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:16.874
the STAR Program.

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:21.780
Dr. Whitney Ence is the
Director of Clinical Services

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.671
for the Service, Training,
Advocacy, and Research,

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:28.973
STAR, Center for ASD
and Neurodevelopmental

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:30.473
Disorders at UCSF.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:39.974
(audience applauds)

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:44.552
- Great, I was just happy to
have Dr. Hendren keep talking

00:00:44.552 --> 00:00:47.118
through my time, and then I
wouldn't have to go at all.

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:50.451
So, unfortunately, I do have to present.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.814
So, I'm happy to follow
Bob because what I'm here

00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:58.135
to talk about is the new program

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:01.119
at the Department of
Psychiatry, the STAR Center,

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.745
and a lot of what we do is sort
of the Level Four, I guess,

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.477
is what he was talking
about, so I'll be focusing

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:10.712
a little bit on our treatment services

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:14.379
as well as the other
aspects of our program.

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.678
Okay, I don't have any disclosures.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:23.674
So the STAR Program, the four
tenets are service delivery,

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:27.468
our training, advocacy, and research.

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:30.596
This a new program in the
Department of Psychiatry,

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:32.189
and we really wanted to have a program

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.685
that clearly integrated
the clinical services

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:37.185
alongside with the research services,

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.509
and so all the families and patients

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.296
that come into our center,
we ask if they're interested

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:46.746
in participating in some
of our research projects

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.882
and data collection as well.

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:51.920
As you can see, we are a happy bunch,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.018
a friendly, welcoming bunch
even on a cold, windy day

00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:57.518
over in Parnassus.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.507
So our mission is to lead the way

00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:04.717
to better understand, treat,
promote the well-being

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:06.974
for people with autism spectrum disorder

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:10.000
and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.248
I just want to spend a moment on the

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:14.021
neurodevelopmental piece,
so if we can think back

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.423
to what Dr. Leventhal showed, that slide

00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:18.859
with all the other different
types of disorders,

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.610
we also want to see those
individuals as well.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.378
We want to capture autism and other

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:25.788
neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:29.497
We don't want to just be known for autism.

00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:32.582
So in order to meet the
mission that we have at STAR,

00:02:32.582 --> 00:02:37.246
we have committed ourselves
to working and providing

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:40.867
services to individuals
across the lifespan.

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:45.040
So we see individuals as
young, recently seven months,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.207
to 55 years of age, has been
our oldest patient so far.

00:02:50.874 --> 00:02:53.437
There's many programs that
are just focused on pediatrics

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:55.963
and we know that the
needs of these individuals

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:58.584
and families, they change and it's diverse

00:02:58.584 --> 00:03:01.233
as families and children and adults

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:05.400
progress across their
development and as they mature.

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:09.268
There's just a lot of different needs.

00:03:09.268 --> 00:03:11.788
We also want to be a clinical home.

00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:14.323
So what we've found is
that many of the families,

00:03:14.323 --> 00:03:15.663
it's getting very disparate.

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:20.234
They have school programs,
they have ABA services,

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.327
they have their
pediatrician, and there's no

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.420
one person to really quarterback

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.323
all of those different types of services,

00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:29.302
and so we try to be that
home where they can come,

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:31.620
consult with us, we can provide services

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.852
and we can also offer
guidance and family support

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:37.039
to navigate all the different needs.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.533
That gets really complex and complicated.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.985
We also are interdisciplinary
in our approach.

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.895
So one major difference with our program

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:49.504
than the prior iteration
of the autism center

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:52.286
that was there before us, is that we are

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:54.607
really interdisciplinary,
and we work together

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:57.091
across a multitude of disciplines.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.623
We've recruited people from psychology,

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:04.456
behavior analysis, social
work, speech pathology.

00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:05.925
We have psychiatrists, and then we also

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:08.834
have our clinical research team.

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:10.833
So across our domains, we incorporate

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.498
these different types of disciplines,

00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:17.665
not only in our research, but
also in our clinical work.

00:04:20.953 --> 00:04:24.131
I'm gonna focus a little
bit for the next few minutes

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.121
on the different types of
services that we provide.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:31.288
In particular, one of the very
large aspect of what we do

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.557
are provide comprehensive
diagnostic assessments,

00:04:35.557 --> 00:04:38.584
and they're multi-day assessments

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.590
for our families, and they start and end

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.053
with meeting with our social worker.

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:45.436
So we really want ... So our social worker

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:47.583
is the first point of
contact for our families,

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:51.383
and then also our last point for contact.

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:54.920
We know that the assessment
is really just the first step

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.724
in the journey, for the
family coming to see us.

00:04:57.724 --> 00:05:00.919
It's more that a lot has to happen

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.901
after the assessment is
done, it's not the end,

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.234
so that we provide feedback.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.509
When I was listening to Dr. Leventhal,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.339
I was really reflecting
on how he was saying,

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.963
how you look at the symptoms
and what you need to assess

00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:17.535
and address.

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.752
And all of those components
have been clearly

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.403
incorporated into our assessment process

00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:25.765
through our psychology
visits and when necessary,

00:05:25.765 --> 00:05:30.453
we add speech consultation,
and also behavioral assessment

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:33.237
in the diagnostic
assessment, and we also have

00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:36.731
our psychiatry appointment,
in order to really complete

00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:40.898
that medical exam, and all of
our psychiatrists are focused

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:45.486
for working with
individuals on the spectrum.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:52.255
These are the main domains
that we assess and look at.

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:56.422
We really want to individualize
our assessment process

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.475
based on the needs of the individual,

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:02.655
and what we hope to look
at are the different levels

00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:05.778
of cognitive abilities,
adaptive living skills,

00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:10.059
social communication, and
social-emotional development.

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.830
Our goal with the assessment process

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.376
is to help develop a
comprehensive treatment plan.

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.501
So telling the family
what they need to get,

00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:19.835
how they can address the specific needs

00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:22.168
of their own child or adult.

00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:25.795
We really want it to be individualized,

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:29.128
and be a plan to help them move forward.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.841
So just in terms of what we've
seen so far in our center,

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:37.743
we've had a range of
individuals that we've seen.

00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:40.367
As I mentioned before, the
youngest that we've seen so far

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.297
for a consultation has been seven months,

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:45.252
but for assessment it's
been about 14 months,

00:06:45.252 --> 00:06:50.045
and we've seen individuals up
until about 55 years of age,

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:51.827
and we have a few more older adults

00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:54.327
on our waiting list right now.

00:06:57.493 --> 00:07:01.990
We've also seen a range of
individuals with autism.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.876
This is just the final primary diagnosis,

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:07.657
and this also incorporates some families

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:10.393
who had already had a
previous diagnosis of autism,

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:14.951
and they were coming in
just for a re-evaluation,

00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:19.504
so we expect this number to
fluctuate and change over time.

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:22.531
And this doesn't take into
account the individuals

00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:24.698
that may have comorbid diagnoses

00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:27.043
that Dr. Leventhal was also indicating,

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:28.808
so individuals who may have autism,

00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:30.486
but also anxiety or depression

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.897
or autism and intellectual disabilities,

00:07:32.897 --> 00:07:36.730
so this is just capturing
the final diagnosis.

00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:40.311
We are committed to serving our families

00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.316
within the San Francisco county

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:46.419
and also the northern California counties,

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:49.502
so about 86% of who we have seen

00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:53.201
has come from that demographic,

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:57.604
but we've also been a
place for an assessment

00:07:57.604 --> 00:08:00.271
for individuals internationally.

00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:04.256
So we've had families
come from China and Turkey

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:06.589
and also out of state,
so we've had families

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:09.840
as far as New Jersey and
North Carolina coming to get

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.757
intensive treatment and,
or assessment with us.

00:08:15.816 --> 00:08:17.161
In terms of the treatment services,

00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:20.120
so the level four that Dr.
Hendren was talking about,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.444
we are really working to ...
All of the services really,

00:08:24.444 --> 00:08:26.446
we think about how can we reduce

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:30.441
the challenging behavior or the rigidity,

00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:33.405
or disruptive behavior
or aggressive behavior.

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:36.414
We also focus on building
social communication

00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:41.264
and play skills in some of
our little kids that come in.

00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:45.225
We target increasing peer interactions

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:49.288
across the lifespan and
improving adaptive skills.

00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.430
I just want to spend a moment
on the adaptive skills.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.545
This is something that we clearly focus

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:58.252
and target on quite a bit
in our assessment reports

00:08:58.252 --> 00:08:59.845
and also our treatment planning.

00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:02.523
There's been some really
nice longitudinal research

00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:05.050
come out from University of North Carolina

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.524
from Dr. Klinger, showing
how important it is

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:11.456
to work on adaptive skills,
and how much that helps

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:14.576
with longterm outcomes,
and so we talk about

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:17.703
working on little adaptive skills, chores,

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:20.935
when someone's younger to being able to

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:24.522
pay for services, pay
for food, or do laundry,

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.711
or cook for themselves as they get older.

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:28.980
Those are the skills
that sometimes I found,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.088
some programs have often left out

00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:34.509
and they focus more on
social and play skills,

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:38.176
but the adaptive skills
really leads to high

00:09:39.572 --> 00:09:43.811
longterm outcomes, so that's
something we talk about a lot.

00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:46.878
Then we also, our
treatment services focus on

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.461
emotional and attentional
concerns as well.

00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:54.821
So as I said, we're interdisciplinary,

00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:58.167
so all of our services are
offered in different formats

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.399
with different service providers,

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.017
and some of them overlap
more so than others

00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:04.745
across different time points.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:07.605
So we have psychological
services, behavioral services,

00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.438
speech, and medication management.

00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:14.207
And across our treatment services,

00:10:14.207 --> 00:10:17.768
the big overarching process
throughout all of them

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:21.498
is focus on evidence based interventions.

00:10:21.498 --> 00:10:24.201
Then within that, we
really focus on the child

00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:27.556
and the family first, and
as I said in the beginning,

00:10:27.556 --> 00:10:30.533
we know that it's not just our child,

00:10:30.533 --> 00:10:32.014
or the family in isolation.

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:34.428
There are different rings of providers

00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:36.379
and different people in their life

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.052
that is impacting their ability
to function in the world,

00:10:40.052 --> 00:10:41.729
or the skills that they're learning,

00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:43.823
so we want to help coordinate those

00:10:43.823 --> 00:10:46.468
different types of services as well.

00:10:46.468 --> 00:10:49.429
So we really focus on
working with the family,

00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.939
engaging in parent training,
and also consulting

00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:56.069
and talking with other
providers, ABA providers,

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:58.682
school services, the place of work

00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:01.182
that the individual may be at.

00:11:03.884 --> 00:11:08.051
The way we provide the services
is a different modality.

00:11:09.505 --> 00:11:11.205
We have some individual services.

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.839
We have a huge arm of family support,

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.101
so for families who just
have had a recent diagnosis,

00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:20.383
or they are struggling to
figure out the different types

00:11:20.383 --> 00:11:22.075
of connections that they can make,

00:11:22.075 --> 00:11:24.631
or service systems, how to navigate that,

00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:26.479
we have our social worker leading the way

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:28.791
with our family support services.

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:32.916
We provide consultation,
and a big component

00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:36.204
of our service delivery
model is parent training.

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:38.915
So we focus on working with the parents

00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:41.888
in order to teach them how
to implement the skills.

00:11:41.888 --> 00:11:46.187
And this goes way back to the
early studies of Ivar Lovaas

00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:50.224
at UCLA who found, if you
just work in the clinic

00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:51.521
and don't train the parents,

00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:53.429
the skills that the children learn

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:55.127
will decrease over time.

00:11:55.127 --> 00:11:59.187
So we know that we have to
work with training the parents

00:11:59.187 --> 00:12:01.241
or any caregiver, or any other individual

00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.736
in that child's life, or adult's life

00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:07.235
to really produce meaningful
and longterm outcomes.

00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:10.476
So that is a big area of focus of ours.

00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:12.433
We also want to try serve a wide number

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:15.071
of individuals and families,
so we've also offered

00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.381
a number of different group services.

00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:21.214
Our services focus on a wide range

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:26.167
of different types of treatment models.

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.889
Our behavioral and speech services

00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:31.890
really take into account that naturalistic

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.973
developmental behavioral intervention

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:38.844
is a new turn that's used
for more naturalistic type

00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:42.011
of applied behavior analysis programs.

00:12:43.327 --> 00:12:46.675
Two that we use prominently in our clinic

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:50.280
are Pivotal Response
Treatment or training, PRT,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.226
and also the Early Start Denver Model

00:12:53.226 --> 00:12:57.393
that Dr. Hedren was speaking
about with Sally Rogers.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.851
We also across our behavioral programs,

00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:03.378
use positive behavior
support and a component

00:13:03.378 --> 00:13:05.445
of optimistic parenting.

00:13:05.445 --> 00:13:07.979
We incorporate, when
needed, Structured Teaching

00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:10.249
or visual supports from TEACCH

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:13.082
and behavioral activation, and for

00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:17.176
our individuals with
other comorbid conditions,

00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:21.180
anxiety, depression, we provide
Cognitive Behavior Therapy

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.157
on an individual basis.

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:25.908
And we're also offering
a social skills group,

00:13:25.908 --> 00:13:30.075
the PEERS model, developed
by Liz Laugeson at UCLA.

00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:35.245
This is what we've conceptualized

00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:41.170
as our Together!Series, and
it's not that you go in order.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.697
You can enter in at any time
point for this Together!Series.

00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:49.507
The first program is our First Steps,

00:13:49.507 --> 00:13:51.580
First Steps Together, so this is a group

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.775
that we offer to parents who have

00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:56.608
a recent diagnosis in their child.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.757
Right now, we have it focused
on children two to six,

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:04.274
but we're hoping to
expand it because we know

00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:06.278
that's not the only time parents

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.778
receive a diagnosis of autism.

00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:13.342
The focus of the group is really to

00:14:13.342 --> 00:14:15.496
increase the knowledge of the parents

00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:18.356
in terms of autism services
and how to navigate

00:14:18.356 --> 00:14:21.856
the community supports that are out there.

00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:26.476
Two groups that we have
based on the principles

00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:28.648
of Pivotal Response Treatment,

00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:30.581
we have Motivate to Communicate Together

00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:32.748
and then Motivational
Early Learning Together,

00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:34.171
and these are parent groups.

00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:38.338
There about 13 sessions
in total with nine groups,

00:14:39.496 --> 00:14:43.848
and then each family gets
four individual sessions.

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:48.141
We include a didactic portion
of Pivotal Response Treatment

00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:51.644
with video clips of
parents implementing PRT

00:14:51.644 --> 00:14:54.365
and then the subsequent
weeks, families are sent home.

00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:56.602
They have homework, essentially,

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:59.234
to practice with their
kid the skills every day,

00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:01.291
and they have to video tape themselves.

00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:03.072
And what they do the following week,

00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:05.703
I guess it's not video taping anymore,

00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:07.620
it's digital recording.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.974
It's back in my graduate school days,

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:14.528
when we had the tapes and the ...

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:17.356
Everybody's recording
on their iPhone now, but

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:20.335
we ask them to bring back
their video recordings,

00:15:20.335 --> 00:15:22.755
and we provide video feedback based

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.449
on the implementation of the skill,

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:26.885
so that's one component for them

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:31.244
to get direct feedback on
the positive and constructive

00:15:31.244 --> 00:15:34.577
parts that they can do better next time.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:38.657
We really find that the parents
are feeling more empowered

00:15:38.657 --> 00:15:42.503
by engaging in the group,
and learning the skills,

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:43.735
and feeling like they can

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.340
produce change in their children.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.315
The first group is really
focused on first words,

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:52.110
and the first group was
based on the research

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.117
that was done at Stanford, by Dr. Jun Gu

00:15:56.117 --> 00:15:59.417
who was a colleague of
ours in Santa Barbara,

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.659
and what we have done is
expand that group into

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:04.781
our Motivational Early Learning.

00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:07.175
So we know that the first
words isn't the first step,

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.230
but we want to teach social initiations.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.545
We want to teach engagement.
We want to teach play.

00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:13.519
We want to teach emotional regulation,

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:18.255
and so the second group
builds upon the first group.

00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.877
The third group in our Together Series

00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:24.188
is really focused on challenging behavior,

00:16:24.188 --> 00:16:26.703
so again, it's a similar format.

00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:29.282
This one is a bit longer.

00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:32.052
It's half individual
and half group sessions.

00:16:32.052 --> 00:16:35.252
So parents are learning
how to conduct their own

00:16:35.252 --> 00:16:38.072
kind of, ABC or behavioral analysis,

00:16:38.072 --> 00:16:40.752
understanding the function or reason why

00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:44.117
their children are engaging
in challenging behavior

00:16:44.117 --> 00:16:48.284
from rigidity to just not
liking when something changes,

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:52.750
or just getting really
frustrated and hitting.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.209
So there's a wide range of
different types of behaviors

00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:59.042
that are focused on in this group.

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:04.386
For our Social Skills Groups,
we try to serve the gamut

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:08.777
of age range, so we
have a preschool program

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:11.478
for children four to six years old,

00:17:11.478 --> 00:17:13.948
and then we go all the way to young adults

00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:15.828
from 18 to 35 years old.

00:17:15.828 --> 00:17:17.899
We just started our young
adult group last night

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:20.778
and it was quite a joy
to see them all come,

00:17:20.778 --> 00:17:23.501
and get really excited about participating

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.335
and learning new skills.

00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:28.206
For all of these groups,
it's the social group

00:17:28.206 --> 00:17:31.631
where the child or adult is
participating in the group,

00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:34.805
but also again, that parent component,

00:17:34.805 --> 00:17:37.877
where the parent or
caregiver is in a group

00:17:37.877 --> 00:17:41.959
at the same time just working
and learning about the skills,

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:43.562
and then helping support those skills

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.479
throughout the 14 to 16 week group.

00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:49.554
So it's a bit different
than some of the other

00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:52.637
social skill groups in the community.

00:17:53.651 --> 00:17:56.785
Our program, we are
trying to meet the needs

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.850
of the community, and so we also know

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.662
that the transition age, more
so than just social skills,

00:18:02.662 --> 00:18:05.483
but other needs, so how do you get a job,

00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:07.425
how do you transition from
high school to college.

00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:10.925
What are the legal needs, conservatorship,

00:18:12.741 --> 00:18:15.189
because to meet that need we are offering

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:17.256
a Transitioning Together group.

00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:20.059
This group also has
the teen or young adult

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:23.318
and the parent group component.

00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:25.804
We also found that we were seeing

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:28.059
a number of school age children,

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:32.018
about eight to twelve years
old and there was no service.

00:18:32.018 --> 00:18:35.157
The families were asking
for a social group,

00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:37.301
so we are meeting the need and providing

00:18:37.301 --> 00:18:39.801
that group for them right now.

00:18:41.528 --> 00:18:44.803
This is just a progression of the specific

00:18:44.803 --> 00:18:48.453
group services that we have
offered since the beginning.

00:18:48.453 --> 00:18:52.222
So you can see the
rollout from July of 2015

00:18:52.222 --> 00:18:55.131
to where we are now, and
how they keep stacking up,

00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:57.168
and we continue to want to grow

00:18:57.168 --> 00:19:00.085
and meet the needs of our families.

00:19:02.403 --> 00:19:05.642
So the T in STAR stands for training,

00:19:05.642 --> 00:19:09.355
and this is a really big
component of our mission.

00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:11.443
We offer interdisciplinary training

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.650
for psychiatry residents and fellows,

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.526
so they rotate through
our assessment clinic,

00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:18.457
they also participate in our groups.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.138
We are working to incorporate psychology

00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:22.464
interns and fellows.

00:19:22.464 --> 00:19:25.011
We've had neurology residents
rotate through our clinic

00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:26.985
on multiple days to get exposed

00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:29.742
to autism and other
neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:19:29.742 --> 00:19:32.847
and pediatric residents and students.

00:19:32.847 --> 00:19:35.914
We're hoping in the future,
to have practicum students

00:19:35.914 --> 00:19:39.128
from other different programs as well.

00:19:39.128 --> 00:19:43.458
We are lucky enough to
have some of our faculty

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:47.643
with very advanced training
in autism assessment,

00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:50.357
and because of that we are
able to offer the ADOS.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.340
So that's the big, that's the tool,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.673
one of the tools that we use for autism,

00:19:56.827 --> 00:20:00.142
and as Dr. Leventhal said,
you don't just use the ADOS,

00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:01.933
you use it in conjunction
with everything else

00:20:01.933 --> 00:20:03.536
and clinical experience,

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.689
but this is one of the tools that is used.

00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:09.080
So we offer training in the ADOS

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.174
and we also provide training in the ADI-R,

00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:15.091
which is the autism diagnostic interview,

00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:17.939
so that's the parent
interview to gather symptoms

00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:20.855
of early development and current levels,

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.683
and in the future, we
want to provide training

00:20:23.683 --> 00:20:26.183
in Pivotal Response Treatment.

00:20:28.097 --> 00:20:30.963
This is just to show what training

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.493
we've done since we've been open.

00:20:32.493 --> 00:20:35.160
We have trained about 202 people

00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:40.265
in the ADOS, and you can see
we've had researchers trained.

00:20:42.706 --> 00:20:44.772
We've had a number of school
psychologists come in,

00:20:44.772 --> 00:20:47.992
clinical psychologists, medical
doctors, speech pathologists

00:20:47.992 --> 00:20:51.155
and social workers come to our trainings,

00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:54.255
and we plan to increase, we're having

00:20:54.255 --> 00:20:57.672
an ADI-R training in the next few months.

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:01.880
The A stands for advocacy,
and this is a part

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.485
of our program that we are
continually developing.

00:21:04.485 --> 00:21:07.711
How it's conceptualized right now,

00:21:07.711 --> 00:21:11.245
is we are providing
support for our families

00:21:11.245 --> 00:21:14.174
and advocating for our
families within school IEPs

00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:17.219
and coaching families how to read the IEPs

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:20.825
and to gather more understanding
within that domain,

00:21:20.825 --> 00:21:23.601
and also how to advocate
for health insurance,

00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:26.566
the mandates are confusing for families.

00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:28.411
Some people have self-funded plans,

00:21:28.411 --> 00:21:30.739
and they're not able
to access the services.

00:21:30.739 --> 00:21:34.427
Other families are able to, so we try to

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:37.427
support our families in that domain.

00:21:41.728 --> 00:21:44.963
This is our research, so
the R part of our program,

00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:48.365
so this also conceptualizes everything

00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:52.490
that we work intervention
wise with the research arm.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.998
So there's different types of research.

00:21:53.998 --> 00:21:57.859
You got to hear a little bit
about Dr. Hendren's research.

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.995
He's part of our group as well.

00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:02.000
We have biological genetic research,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.398
we look at symptom profiles.

00:22:04.398 --> 00:22:06.686
There's epidemiological research.

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:09.952
We have lifespan outcomes
and also intervention,

00:22:09.952 --> 00:22:12.759
so many of the programs that
we are offering right now,

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:15.762
we are researching and looking
at the social validities,

00:22:15.762 --> 00:22:18.376
seeing how meaningful
the families find it,

00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:20.099
how useful they find it as well,

00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:22.729
so we want to continue to

00:22:22.729 --> 00:22:24.608
look into our program,
see what's effective,

00:22:24.608 --> 00:22:27.858
and how we can move forward and change.

00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.950
This is just an illustration
of the different types

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.867
of labs that we have,
and everyone is doing ...

00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:39.460
There's lots of different
projects and on our website too,

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.627
you can get directly in
contact with the individuals.

00:22:45.012 --> 00:22:47.980
This is just, Dr. Bal will be presenting,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.813
but I wanted to ...

00:22:48.813 --> 00:22:51.693
She won't put it up there,
so I figured I would.

00:22:51.693 --> 00:22:54.852
She's looking at exploring
the strengths and challenges

00:22:54.852 --> 00:22:57.091
for adults with limited spoken language,

00:22:57.091 --> 00:23:00.406
so there were flyers up on
the second floor I believe,

00:23:00.406 --> 00:23:04.137
or first floor, however
the building is done.

00:23:04.137 --> 00:23:07.731
So if you know of anyone
who may fit this profile,

00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:11.898
we are happy to accept them
into the research program.

00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:15.169
Okay. I saved time.

00:23:16.761 --> 00:23:17.730
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.730
(audience clapping)
