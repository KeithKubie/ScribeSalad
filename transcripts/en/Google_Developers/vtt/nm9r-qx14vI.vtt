MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.620
Welcome to Root Access, the
show on Google Developers

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.070
Live about startups.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.320
My name is Martin Omander.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.190
And I have here Don
Dodge, longtime investor

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.250
and startup advocate.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.790
Welcome.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.498
DON DODGE: Great.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:20.012
Thanks.

00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:20.720
Great to be here.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.550
MARTIN OMANDER: I see you
got the memo about blue shirt

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.110
today.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.820
That looks good.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.620
DON DODGE: I did, yeah.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.703
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:26.540
Good, good.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.170
So Don, we've got a question
from a viewer, Jim, who said,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.340
is it worth it as a startup
to go into an accelerator?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.950
So let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.460
What are typically the
terms in terms of money

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.355
for going into an accelerator
when you are a startup?

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.140
DON DODGE: So Y Combinator
and Techstars and several

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.340
of the other incubators, their
models are pretty similar.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.740
They give you $20,000
to $30,000 of cash

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.670
to basically live off from.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.250
They require at
least two founders.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.320
And then they take
about 5% to 6% equity

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.960
in return for that
$20,000 to $30,000.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.080
So if you do the math,
they're valuing your company

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.750
at about $400,000 to $500,000.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.710
So it's a pretty low valuation.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.589
So it's something to consider.

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:28.130
The valuation part
of it is something

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.592
to consider if
you want to do it.

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:30.800
MARTIN OMANDER: Right, right.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.210
And also, $20,000
to $30,000, you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200
could possibly get
that in other ways.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.100
We've spoken to
founders here who

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.220
have got it through maxing
out credit cards and whatnot.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.950
DON DODGE: Right.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.110
So cash shouldn't be the reason
for doing an accelerator.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.640
You can do that on
your credit card.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.940
You can get friends and
family to loan you money.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.190
So it's not about
raising the cash.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.204
It's about the other
services that they provide.

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:00.120
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.560
So let's talk about those.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.090
What are those services?

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480
DON DODGE: I think the
biggest thing that you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.610
get from being in an
accelerator is mentorship.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.340
So they're able to attract
mentors and experts

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.790
in the field of all
kinds of things.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.300
So once a week, you might
have a group meeting

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.040
where an expert comes in to
talk about SEO or marketing

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.820
and how to do target
marketing, or a lawyer

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.080
to explain how term sheets work,
or a successful entrepreneur

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.710
to talk about scalability
and technical issues.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.530
So you get a lot of
expert mentorship

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.320
that you probably wouldn't
have access to otherwise.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.670
So that's number one.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.620
Number two, you get
to focus on what

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.650
is your minimum viable product.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.840
What are those key
features that have

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.662
got to be there in order to
launch and be successful?

00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:01.870
And that's a tough question,
because, typically, it's

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.380
not obvious what those
things should be.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.730
So you'll get a lot
of advice about how

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.430
to do your minimum
viable product.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.470
The third thing you get
is a lot of training

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.390
on how to pitch, how to put
together your pitch deck,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.270
what issues you
should cover, and then

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.500
how to pitch in
front of an audience,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.820
or how to pitch
in front of a VC.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.470
And if you haven't
done that before,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.690
that's a pretty big deal.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.790
The last thing you get
is, typically, they'll

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.580
have an investor day or demo
day at the end of the session.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.030
And that's where you
get exposure and access

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.980
to lots and lots of investors
and maybe some press.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.850
So that's four things you get
that are a pretty big deal.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.280
There are other ways to do it.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.354
But they're very, very good
at delivering those services.

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:56.270
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.480
So if you're a
startup and you're

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.800
thinking about whether to go
into an accelerator or not,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.650
whether you can provide
these things yourself,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.430
what's the thought process one
should go through as a founder?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.270
DON DODGE: Well, there are
counter cases and examples

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.090
for each one of those four
benefits that I mentioned.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.610
There are other ways
to get those benefits.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.490
That said, getting
into Y Combinator

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.710
or Techstars is
very, very difficult.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.010
They accept 1% to 2% of
the companies that apply.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.190
So it's sort of like
getting into college.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.290
Should you go to college?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.800
Well, yeah.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.840
If you can, you probably should.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.840
Should you go to
Harvard or Stanford?

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.300
Absolutely, if you can.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.640
But that's not a prerequisite.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.977
It's not, if I can't get
into Harvard or Stanford,

00:04:46.977 --> 00:04:48.060
I'm going to be a failure.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.940
Obviously not.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.780
You don't need to go
to college at all.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.000
There are always different
ways to do things.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.740
So if you can get into an
accelerator like that, sure.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.070
If you can't, there are
other ways to raise money.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.230
You can raise them from
friends and family.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.590
There are other ways
to get mentorship.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.620
You can bring on an adviser.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.950
And rather than give up
5% or 6% of your company,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.700
maybe give up a half a
percent to an adviser.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.850
There are other
ways to raise money.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.640
Your advisers or other
founders can introduce you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.180
to VCs or Angels.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.290
And you can raise
money that way.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.950
So there's an alternative to
every one of these things.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.260
I think being in
an accelerator just

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.210
makes it all happen faster.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.920
And the single biggest
thing you really

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.560
get out of an accelerator is
it's like being in boot camp.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.130
You have other founders who are
going through the same things

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.670
that you are, trying to
solve the same problems.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.430
And you learn a lot
from them and together.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.077
And you probably
make progress faster.

00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:57.160
MARTIN OMANDER: Go faster.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.892
And speed is important, right?

00:05:58.892 --> 00:05:59.600
DON DODGE: It is.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.262
That's why they call
them accelerators.

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:02.470
MARTIN OMANDER: Accelerators.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.700
Ah, good.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.170
So at what point is your
company, your startup,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.000
ready to go into an accelerator?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.090
Should you have a product?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.420
Should you have a team?

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.592
Should you have customers?

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:15.551
What's the right place?

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:16.717
DON DODGE: Yeah, good point.

00:06:16.717 --> 00:06:17.740
So there are incubators.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.300
And there are accelerators.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.120
So incubators, like
Techstars and Y Combinator,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.080
assume that you
don't have a product.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.890
So you probably have an idea.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.220
You have two founders.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.940
You might have a prototype or
maybe even a working model.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.949
But you don't yet
have a product.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.240
So that's why they call them
incubators, because you're

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.640
going from nothing to
something in an incubator.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.810
If you have a product, you have
a team, and it's out there,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.950
and you're looking
to accelerate,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.480
then you go to an accelerator.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.660
Sometimes we use those
words interchangeably.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.130
But they're different.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.950
Incubators are for
starting from nothing

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.630
and incubating it to an idea
that's ready to accept money.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.080
Accelerators are you
already have a product.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.609
You have a team.

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:06.150
You might have a
little bit of money.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.480
And you're looking
to accelerate.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.520
So they'll give you some office
space and a place to expand.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.710
They'll give you
different services

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.290
that allow you to
accelerate your plans faster

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.450
than you normally would.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.390
So I would say you can do an
incubator or an accelerator

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.550
at any time.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.860
It just depends on
what services you need

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.260
and what stage you're at.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.260
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.760
Thank you.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.770
Excellent advice, Don.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.520
DON DODGE: Great.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.560
Great to be here.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.710
MARTIN OMANDER: So if
you are a cloud developer

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.160
and you want to run your
application on Google

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.940
infrastructure, you should try
out the Google Cloud Platform.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.560
And right now, if you're
a Root Access viewer,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.700
you can get a $2,000 credit to
get started on the platform.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.660
The details are on your screen.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.912
Please keep the comments
coming in on the YouTube video.

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:57.370
And we'll address
them, like we did

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.040
this one in future episodes.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.750
Thank you.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.720
See you next time.
