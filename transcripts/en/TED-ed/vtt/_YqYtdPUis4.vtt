00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:08.793
What makes a book a book?

00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:12.828
Is it just anything that stores
and communicates information?

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:14.509
Or does it have to do with paper,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.236
binding,

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:15.984
font,

00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:16.736
ink,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:17.973
its weight in your hands,

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:19.803
the smell of the pages?

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:21.112
Is this a book?

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:22.486
Probably not.

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:23.483
But is this?

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:24.763
To answer these questions,

00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:27.525
we need to go back to the start
of the book as we know it

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.698
and understand how these elements
came together to make something

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.240
more than the sum of their parts.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.859
The earliest object that we think of
as a book is the codex,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.949
a stack of pages bound along one edge.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.395
But the real turning point in book history

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.575
was Johannes Gutenberg's
printing press in the mid-15th century.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:51.642
The concept of moveable type had been
invented much earlier in Eastern culture,

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:55.833
but the introduction of Gutenberg's
press had a profound effect.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:59.949
Suddenly, an elite class of monks
and the ruling class

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.531
no longer controlled 
the production of texts.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:04.328
Messages could spread more easily,

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:07.333
and copies could constantly be produced,

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.432
so printing houses popped up
all over Europe.

00:01:10.432 --> 00:01:15.268
The product of this bibliographic boom
is familiar to us in some respects,

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.949
but markedly different in others.

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:22.796
The skeleton of the book is paper,
type, and cover.

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:27.044
More than 2000 years ago,
China invented paper as a writing surface,

00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:30.516
which was itself predated 
by Egyptian papyrus.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:32.707
However, until the 16th century,

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:35.236
Europeans mainly wrote 
on thin sheets of wood

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:39.176
and durable parchment
made of stretched animal skins.

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:43.022
Eventually, the popularity of paper
spread throughout Europe,

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:47.673
replacing parchment for most printings
because it was less expensive in bulk.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:51.576
Inks had been made by combining
organic plant and animal dyes

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:53.046
with water or wine,

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.519
but since water doesn't stick
to metal type,

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:00.144
use of the printing press required
a change to oil-based ink.

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:03.513
Printers used black ink made of
a mixture of lamp soot,

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:04.395
turpentine,

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:06.138
and walnut oil.

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:08.236
And what about font size and type?

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:12.577
The earliest movable type pieces
consisted of reversed letters

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:16.673
cast in relief on the ends of
lead alloy stocks.

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:19.147
They were handmade and expensive,

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:22.865
and the designs were as different
as the people who carved their molds.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:27.151
Standardization was not really possible
until mass manufacturing

00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:30.830
and the creation of an accessible
word processing system.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.230
As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson
for developing two types of Roman font

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.610
that led to thousands of others,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.248
including the familiar Times Roman.

00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:44.013
Something had to hold all this together,

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.399
and until the late 15th century,

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.732
covers consisted of either wood,

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:51.045
or sheets of paper pasted together.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:54.698
These would eventually be replaced
by rope fiber millboard,

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:59.482
originally intended for high quality
bindings in the late 17th century,

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:02.947
but later as a less expensive option.

00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:06.550
And while today's mass produced
cover illustrations are marketing tools,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.304
the cover designs of early books 
were made to order.

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:12.839
Even spines have a history.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.406
Initially, they were not considered
aesthetically important,

00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:19.743
and the earliest ones were flat,
rather than rounded.

00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:22.516
The flat form made the books
easier to read

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:25.522
by allowing the book to rest easily
on a table.

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:30.453
But those spines were damaged
easily from the stresses of normal use.

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.580
A rounded form solved that issue,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.555
although new problems arose,

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:37.389
like having the book close in
on itself.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.263
But flexibility was more important,

00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:41.609
especially for the on-the-go reader.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.266
As the book evolves
and we replace bound texts

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.855
with flat screens and electronic ink,

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:50.953
are these objects and files really books?

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:52.436
Does the feel of the cover

00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:55.738
or the smell of the paper add something
crucial to the experience?

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:58.837
Or does the magic live only within
the words,

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:01.018
no matter what their presentation?
