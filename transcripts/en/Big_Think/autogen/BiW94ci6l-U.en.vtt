in schools that are in the urban core

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
four-year period to be placed in an
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.840
four-year period to be placed in an
inner-city school and I really think

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850

this is a very novel idea for a couple

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479
this is a very novel idea for a couple

the environment and urban school is

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190
the environment and urban school is
 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.480
the environment and urban school is
unique and it also is unique in the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490
unique and it also is unique in the
 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.940
unique and it also is unique in the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
sense that these students are spending
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.990
sense that these students are spending
much much more time in inner-city

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000
much much more time in inner-city
 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.450
much much more time in inner-city
schools so that over the four-year

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460
schools so that over the four-year
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.490
schools so that over the four-year
period they will spend it at least

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500
period they will spend it at least
 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.790
period they will spend it at least
double the amount of time in actual

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
double the amount of time in actual
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.550
double the amount of time in actual
