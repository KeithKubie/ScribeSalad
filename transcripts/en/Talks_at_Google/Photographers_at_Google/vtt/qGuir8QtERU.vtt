00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.450
Appreciate you being here.
It's my great pleasure to introduce George

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.400
Steinmetz, I've been a big
fan of his work for some time.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.530
Amazing photographer and author of two books
now.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.630
And welcome, George.
Thanks for coming.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.630
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.380
George Steinmetz: Thank you.
Umm, I wanted to show you all some pictures

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.789
today from a long-term
project that I've been working on about the

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.300
world's deserts and I got
into this because when I was a young man and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.730
I hitchhiked across the
Sahara Desert and I imagined what it would

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.890
be like to fly over the
desert.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.290
And about 12 years ago I talked National Geographic
into doing a big

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.761
project in the Sahara and I wanted to aerial
photos and I got

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.649
into motorized paragliding to do that.
And when I was flying over the Sahara on that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.990
first trip it opened up
my mind to a new way of seeing the world from

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.489
the air.
And I started to wonder what it would be like

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.700
if I took my crazy
little aircraft to different parts of the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.899
world, umm, to other
deserts, to the Atacama, to the Gobi, to Antarctica,

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.270
which most people
don't think of as a desert but it is.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.170
It's the world's largest desert.
And what I'm gonna show you are pictures from

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.380
that project and then in
the past six years I've actually been using

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.170
Google Earth a lot for my
research and trying figure out where to go

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.159
'cause I go to very remote
areas where there's -- most of these areas

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.120
have never really been
photographed before.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.549
And so it's, uh, you have to find your subject
matter and it's very

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.939
difficult and expensive to get around so you
need to know where you're

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.560
going.
They call this project hyper-arid because

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.920
the areas we've been going
to are the driest areas on our planet.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.520
They all get less than 10 centimeters of annual
percipitation.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.909
This is in the dry valleys of Antarctica.
These are Victoria Dunes.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.840
I was down there on a grant from the National
Science Foundation to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.790
document their scientific research work there.
This is in the, umm, Atacama Desert on the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.189
coast of Peru.
That's the Pacific in the background.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.689
And, uh, this is up in the, umm, Qaidam Basin
in China on kind of the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.050
backside of the Himalaya, the north side of
the Himalaya.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.440
Uh, it's in the Gobi Desert in China.
These are the Badain Jaran Desert in -- these

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.000
are the tallest dunes in
the world.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.450
They're over 1200 feet.
These are the sub dunes that are part of the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.069
1200-foot dunes.
And this is in the Namib Desert in Namibia

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.540
southwest Africa.
And this is in Antarctica, also.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.540
This is in the Dry Valleys.
This frozen lake is the purest water in the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.300
world.
Umm, and this is out in the Empty Quarters

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.129
of Arabia.
Umm, the tracks on the right are the -- are

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.160
my car tracks and the
car -- car -- tracks on the left are 50 years

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.099
old.
The area is so sterile it's paralyzed landscape.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.180
There's really no -- there's no life out there
at all.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.430
And this is where the Empty Quarter bumps
into the United Arab

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.920
Emirates and this is a -- they tried to stabilize
the sand with

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.340
pumping ground water into a little drip irrigation
system.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.050
This is the last steam train in the Gobi Desert
with a similar sand

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:32.239
stabilization program.
And this is in the -- this is the village

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.680
of Rendille people in
northern Kenya.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.610
The area's now going through a severe draught
and the people have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.150
moved to a mission post to get education,
access to water, and medical

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.620
care, but when they're in a sedentary village
environment they can't

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.400
feed their camels and their goats so this
is kind of their village and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.160
town but most of their adult males and the
livestock was 10 to 15-miles

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.770
away trying to find grass for their animals.
And this caravan's carrying salt across the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.560
Sahara.
Still do that.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.030
This picture's about ten years old but they
still do.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.159
This is in Iran.
These -- the holes are from underground aquaducts

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.410
that are thousands
of years old.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.570
They have vertical shafts to clean them out
and they have to go down

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.330
every ten years or so to take out the mineralization
out of the canals

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.980
that take water from the highlands down to
the lowland farms.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.160
This is a similar system in China.
The -- this Qanat system, the system of underground

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.990
irrigation spread
along the silk road from Iran all the way

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.660
to western
China and then you can find it on the other

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.600
side of the world in
Moracco.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.011
World travel -- knowledge traveled by camel.
Umm, this is the road to the oil fields in

00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.250
China, the Taklamakan
Desert.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.729
You get a similar system of taking salty ground
water and putting it

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.930
through dip irrigation to make plants to stabilize
the dunes so that

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.930
the road doesn't get overtaken by dunes.
And the little blue house is for the person

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.220
who makes sure the drip
irrigation pipes don't leak.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.690
This is the lowest point in China.
It's about 50 meters below sea level in the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.820
Taklamakan in the tar pit --
And these pits are used to harvest salt.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:34.490
These -- there's some prison labor out there.
Umm, that's harvesting peppers on the floor

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:45.449
of the Taklamakan Desert.
Put 'em out to dry.

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.389
And this is, umm, an area where they cultivate
salt in the Sahara.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.389
It's for animals -- animal use.
And the different colors are because of the

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.250
mineral content of the --
of the mud.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.449
They mix kind of salty mud with well water
and then they -- the -- the

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.990
white areas you see like, umm, that's from
salt forming on the surface

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.949
kind of like, umm, like ice forming on the
surface of a pond and they

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.509
splash the water up and then the ice -- sorry,
the salt will go down

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.340
to the bottom and after a month or so of this
process the whole basin will be filled enough

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.750
with salt they can scrape it out in their
little

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.280
mud-lined basins.
Umm, this is in, uh, central Sahara.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.270
This is in northern Mali.
And there's a different salt trade from, uh,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.860
some oases between Mali
and Algeria and they carry it down by camel

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.160
caravan to Timbuktu and
this is the only, umm, uh, the only, uh, consistent

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.620
water point so
there's a little village here where they trade

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.789
water for salt and the
village is half buried in the sand.

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.422
And there's no vegetation at all because the
camels have eaten

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:52.422
everything.
You go 10 miles away from the village and

00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:58.199
you would find scrub
vegetation but within 10 miles it's all been

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.361
eaten by camel.
Inside of the Empty Quarter of Arabia.

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:12.910
Very unusual to have two colors of sand.
You have to have very strong winds.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.669
Umm, and, uh, these are, umm, James's flamingos
in Bolivia.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:24.180
And these are greater flamingos.
This is in Iran.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.280
Flamingos are very skiddish birds but with
my aircraft I can get

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.540
fairly close to them.
Camels going out to get fodder on the Empty

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.009
Quarter of Arabia.
It's funny.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:43.620
I started -- this picture went viral on the
internet about two years

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.830
ago and I started getting these strange e-mails
from people in the

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.910
Middle East. They thought it was taken with
a predator aircraft and

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.919
then they wanted to make sure it was -- they
thought it was, you know,

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.889
was I part of the CIA and how did I get this
picture?

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:57.110
And then I started getting e-mails from camera
clubs in the U.S.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.820
because they wanted to know what camera lens
I took and it was just

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.820
funny.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.820
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.820
George Steinmetz: Different sides of the same
coin.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.460
They all thought it was done in Photoshop,
too.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:14.520
The central Sahara.
It's in northern Chad.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.630
And this is in, uh, Namib Desert in the southwest
coast of Africa.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:29.699
And zebras on a nature reserve in Namibia.
The circles there, they're very strange.

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.779
They called them fairy circles and they're
not really understood.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:36.330
There's, umm, these kind of bald areas and
they suspect that it could

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.880
be some kind of toxic in the ground, maybe
an insect colony, like an

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.210
ant hill, the ants left some sort of toxicity,
or some kind of tree that

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.350
no longer exists that left some toxicity in
a decayed root system but

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:57.040
nobody really understands.
This is the, umm, end of the Colorado River

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.740
where it hits the Gulf of
California and Mexico.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.170
Down river from calexico and you have 30-foot
tides here.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.580
So this was taken in the morning of a full
moon when the tide was at

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.660
its lowest.
Used to be one of the most productive wetlands

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:19.940
in North America and
now it's just a sand desert raked by tide.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.160
This is the Altiplano in Bolivia.
This lake is the biggest salt flat in the

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.600
world.
It's, umm, 12,000 feet.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.380
And in the springtime it gets flooded.
Those are two cars -- my two cars -- the two

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.920
cars I hired take aroung and we use one for
the aircraft and one for camp supplies but

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.590
I wanted them for
scale to get an idea how big the Sahara was.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.190
This is taken just after sunrise.
And this is also in the Altiplano.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:54.080
This lake's about 14,000 feet.
Laguna Co -- Laguna Colorada with a indemnic

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.310
species of flamingo that
nest there, James's Flamingo.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:06.790
This is Cape Vercillos on the southeast African
coast -- southwest African coast

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.860
in Namibia.
Most of the areas I go to there are virtually

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.600
no people there.
It's so severe.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.660
Sometimes you find some unusual way that animal
life can exist there

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:25.350
but virtually no people at all.
This is the Antarctic coast near the Dry Valleys.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.570
It's perma frost.
On the right there is the Ross Sea.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:40.290
And this is the Niger River in northern Mali.
In the middle foreground is a mosque.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.110
It's taken during the flood season when everybody's
growing rice.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:50.110
And this is, uh, the north side of the Himalaya
in the Qaidam

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:56.470
Basin in China.
This is all deserts of Iran.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.620
It's very difficult getting permission to
fly over there.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.410
And that little white parachute that's what
I fly.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.360
It's my friend Alaranu's.
He's gone with my on just about all my trips.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.080
He's the world champion of this crazy kind
of aviation.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.610
And a similar pattern in -- this is where
glaciers come together in

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.610
Antarctica is they head out into the Ross
Sea.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:20.360
The black is all glacial till.
The rocks that got ground up as the glaciers

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.190
move them and as they merge it gets kind of
tossed up on the surface.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:30.530
And this is in the Lut Desert in Iran.
It's kind of a rock formation called yardangs.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.320
They're wind weathered rocks.
This is biggest field of yardangs in the world.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.990
It's an old, umm, lake deposit.
When you have really severe rains from one

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.000
direction it's kinda like
sandblasting soft wood.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.310
You get these kind of fluted ridges that pop
up and this is an area

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.240
that's, umm, frequented by heroin smugglers
'cause they can travel through

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.650
the desert without being seen and it was very
hard to get the Iranian

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.410
military police to take me out there because
they were worried about

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.410
getting shot.
Let alone having the crazy American taking

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.410
pictures of their terrain.
Got arrested three times over there.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:06.010
Umm, this is out in the Altiplano in Bolivia.
This is edible salt being harvested for human

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:14.639
consumption.
And this is also in Iran in the salt deserts.

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:20.589
Lake Tashk.
Home to a lot of flamingos.

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:25.269
This is the Ross Sea in Antarctica.
It's a -- looking at the tongue of the Erebus

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:30.460
Glacier it comes out and
in the summer the wave action -- the winds

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:36.921
and the wave action will turn
the -- they carve the tongue of the glacier

00:12:36.921 --> 00:12:41.620
into kind of a scallop pattern
from the -- kind of like the waves kind of

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:48.079
gnawing at the ice.
Looks like a big bill of, like, a sawtooth

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:53.000
shark.
It's another view of Mount Erebus looking

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.690
the other way.
Mount Erebus the big, uh, volcano in the background.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.269
There's a molten lava lake in the center of
that volcano.

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:07.529
One of only two in the world.
This is down to P-3 Orion from the U.S. Navy

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:09.450
crashed on take-off in
Antarctica.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.040
It was overloaded.
You see Mount Erebus in the very background

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.040
on the left.
It's Arakao in Niger.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.230
It's a crater that, uh, didn't quite erupt
and then it sank back down

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:29.900
and it was invaded by sand and wind off the
central Sahara.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.010
Some of the fee -- this is one of the higher
altitude pictures I take.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.630
Most of my flying is very low, like, umm,
a hundred to 500 feet but

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.660
for really large features like this volcano
you have to get up quite

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.100
high.
This is taken about 6,000 feet above ground.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.510
The volcano is probably 5 miles across and
you can see a little pink

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.709
parachute in kind of the upper left and that's
one of my French

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:54.779
buddies that was flying with me in the same
aircraft that I had.

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:59.730
This picture's taken from the ground but at
21,000 feet, the top of

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.600
the highest point of Bolivia and at sunrise
Mount Sajama projects,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.570
umm, projects a shadow out of the atmosphere
it's so tall.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.610
Those two volcanos in the background, that's
the border between

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:18.460
Bolivia and, uh, and Chile.
This is also the Altiplano volcanic island

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:28.040
in the salt lake.
Salt flats.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:37.870
This is in, uh, the Sonora Desert just south
of the U.S. border.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.870
The red parachute's my crazy friend Alain
Anu and the winds are so

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.779
strong here and this is a ridge of salt and
Alain Anu was flying -- the

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:43.959
winds were so strong that he could actually
walk the ring as he was

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.959
flying and he said it was brick hard.
It looks like a sand dune but it was brick-hard

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:54.870
mud.
This is my legs above a volcanic crater in

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.700
Niger.
I think if you look at the altimeter my altitude

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.300
 -- yeah.
I'm at 7,470 some feet and I was 5,500 feet

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.120
above take-off.
this really scared the hell outta me.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.250
This was my first trip with the par -- with
the paragliding.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.010
I've never been that tall.
It's really uncomfortable being that high.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.160
It's actually -- it's quite safe but it's
very nerve wracking 'cause

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.680
if you drop anything it's gone.
I got a motor behind me.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.399
If I drop it, it's gonna get sucked into the
propeller and the motor's

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:25.029
gonna go kaput and I'm -- you can see I'm
really far away from the

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:26.560
sand so I might not be able to get it back
to there and I don't wanna

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.160
land in this rough terrain.
And it's just -- it's -- it's -- yeah,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.079
Unnerving for me being up that high.
This is in the same flight getting down low

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:37.579
it's a lot more fun.
Chasing Francois.

00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:41.480
I'm taking off from the salt flats in Bolivia,
12,000 feet.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:50.600
It's very cold.
You have to run a long way to take off at

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.410
12,000 feet.
And this, uh, flying over Shaybah.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.210
They call it the Manhattan of the desert in
Yemen.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.670
It's also known as the medieval Manhattan.
These buildings are, umm, eight stories tall

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.740
made of mud and palm
fronds.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:08.850
It's the mosque in the middle that I'm about
to buzz.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.850
And, umm, this is after I had a bad take-off
in China.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:40.309
I got 19 stitches in my face.
But no mark.

00:16:40.309 --> 00:17:03.949
&gt;&gt; [Upbeat percussion music playing]

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:15.770
&gt;&gt; [Wind chimes]

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:41.090
George Steinmetz: And so when I get to a place
there's some assembly

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.380
required and then -- and then this is how
our a take-off works.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:50.030
This is in Yemen.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:18:00.030
&gt;&gt; [Propeller/engine buzzing, wind blowing]

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:10.030
&gt;&gt; [Engine running, wind blowing]

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:26.370
George Steinmetz: The take-offs can be a little
tricky but flying's

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.370
actually pretty easy.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:19:45.230
&gt;&gt; [Propeller buzzing in the background]

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.230
George Steinmetz: This is from the Empty Quarter
in Saudi Arabia.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.230
Actually, this is Yemen.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.230
&gt;&gt; [propeller running]

00:19:48.230 --> 00:20:07.640
George Steinmetz: So, the trick is flying
and taking pictures at the

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:29.030
same time and it's, umm -- it takes a little
practice.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.030
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.030
&gt;&gt; [Propeller buzzing, wind blowing]

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.030
George Steinmetz: And from -- the sequence
from that little flight

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:39.630
resulted in this picture of Reem gazelles.
And before I go away on my trips I do a lot

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.200
 -- I spend a lot of time
doing research, a lot of it on the computer

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.160
now, and I used to have to
hit up friends of mine at JPL for satellite

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.280
images but now actually I
use Google Earth 'cause now I don't have to

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.470
trade any favors and
it's -- it's really an amazing tool.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.760
This is, umm, the border between -- on the
right side -- the right

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.539
side of the road is Oman and the left side
where the green is the

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:04.120
U.A.E.
This is what it looks like from the ground.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.090
This is the border fence.
U.A.E.'s got a lot more oil money per capita

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.630
so they are much more
wasteful in their use of water.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:25.385
And these are crop circles in Saudi Arabia.
And if you look at, uh, this little area right

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:26.385
here, this is a big
salt lake.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:31.830
It would be a dune.
The dune used to be here and then it moved

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:44.110
as the lake dropped.
And so you have all the trees on the right

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.330
die because the water table
dropped about 5 meters and the trees that

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.620
are on the left are doing
just great.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:22:00.280
These are, umm, star dunes in Yemen.
Very hard driving up there.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:08.770
And this is in the Emirates.
There is a little -- this little city right

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.380
there, it's a medieval
fort.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.621
It's been re-built.
Looks like that.

00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:23.990
And this is a river coming out of the Atlas
Mountains out in the

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.080
Sahara and if you get there on the right day
 -- it happens once about every

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.870
25 years or so -- you get snow.
It's very lucky to catch snow on the Atlas

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.950
 -- on this part of the
Atlas.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:43.330
Never seen snow on palm trees before.
This is in the coast of Mauritania where all

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:51.880
the camels got wiped out
in the draught of the 80s and now everybody

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.740
fishes.
And this is one of the few roads going across

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.871
the Empty Quarter in
Saudi Arabia.

00:22:56.871 --> 00:23:08.050
And this is out in the salt deserts of Iran.
I don't know if many have studied the geology

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.620
but there are huge salt
domes, huge plumes of subterranean salt deposits

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.350
that have pushed
their way up like a molar coming up through

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:20.740
gums and the area got
inundated and the top was shirred off and

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740
you have this pattern looks
like burl wood.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.490
&gt;&gt; Is that a composite --

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.690
George Steinmetz: The Google Earth image?

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.100
&gt;&gt; (Asking question in the background.)

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.280
George Steinmetz: You can see there's a composite
line on the left.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.600
Yeah.
And it's actually a lot more colorful in real

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.690
life.
This -- is actually happens to be out in a

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.690
military rocket range.
Very dangerous place to be flying an aircraft

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.690
like mine.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.690
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.980
George Steinmetz: Fortunately nobody found
out.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:57.020
This is in the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia.
Composite image of, like, three or four different

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.200
digital globe images.
Also a very dangerous enviroment to fly.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.840
It's kinda like -- they're kinda like sand
traps and if you -- if I

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.610
landed on one of those they could probably
get in there with a

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.950
vehicle.
We'd never be able to get out.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.120
So there's one road going across it.
So it's -- it's a nasty place to be flying.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.260
I can't -- I'm so light with my aircraft I
don't take anything.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.390
Actually one camera, one extra lens, and no
water.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.620
And so you really got -- you have a radio
and a GPS and you try to be

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:30.690
careful.
And these are very curious a kind of barchan

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.870
dunes with their propagating jelly
fish.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:41.770
It's in Yemen.
And then so I'll spend hours late at night,

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.970
uh, trolling through
Google Earth and NASA images kinda like -- kinda

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.350
like going through along with
a magnifying glass looking for interesting

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.799
features.
And on the upper left is kind of a big zigzag

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:56.871
of sand and I thought,
ooh, that'd be cool.

00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:01.179
And this is in LANSAT7 imagery.
You see the same zigzag.

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:06.100
It's not quite up in the same corner.
It's kinda halfway between the center point

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.940
and the upper left corner?
See the zigzag?

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.290
And then in the kinda lower right there's
a big lake and that lake is

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.130
caused by an oil well that was abandoned when
it hit a subterranean

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.830
fresh water aquifer.
So it's just kind of a big salty lake out

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.840
there and this big zigzag and I thought it'd
be kind of a cool thing to check out.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.120
And the zigzag was quite cool but it's just
massive in scale.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.270
You can see two of our cars out there.
It's one thing to see something like that

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.691
and say, cool.
It's another thing to be able to get out there

00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:36.159
on the ground 'cause
the purple stuff is all sudka.

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:40.230
The salt flats that have mud deposit underneath
them you can be going

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.549
along and it's all dry and all of a sudden
your car starts sinking down in the mud and

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:49.390
if you get stuck out there, there's nobody
coming to get

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.390
you.
You're really stuck.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.390
You couldn't even -- you couldn't get a helicopter
out there 'cause

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.909
they couldn't take off and land.
Too difficult environment.

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:59.581
This is in Yemen.
This is the same town you saw me flying over,

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:17.529
uh, a few images before.
This is Shaybah.

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:18.529
Medieval Manhattan.

00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:19.529
&gt;&gt; [Silence]

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:20.870
George Steinmetz: This is not part of my desert
project but I went to

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.870
China for the geographic 'cause I wanted to
go to China's deserts and

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.740
I had to do the whole country.
And these are these weird, umm, very unusual

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.779
homes of the Hakka people.
They migrated from the north where they were

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:33.220
continually attacked by
nomads and so they started building circular

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.510
villages that were
fortified.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:40.260
And as their population grew they kept -- the
villages grew like rings

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.850
in a tree.
But I couldn't -- I found these -- this site

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.480
through Google Earth.
Actually, the sites were listed in tourist

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.010
brochures but it was too
mountainous an area for me to fly.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.570
This is great situation I just drove to with
Google imagery.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:58.490
It was very helpful.
Uh, this is in the Great Rift Valley in Africa,

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.429
Lake Natron.
It's -- sometimes I work from a small plane

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:03.850
if it's too dangerous an
area to fly, like this area.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:09.870
It's very caustic salts that are red from
algae growth and if you land

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:17.580
in there you get very bad burns on your legs.
And this is the Altiplano in Bolivia.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.840
Similar pattern in salt.
Edible salt.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:28.659
And my friend Alain Anu, the pilot, checking
out some cracked mud

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:32.570
between -- there used to be two dunes filled
by a lake and then the

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.570
dunes moved away and left kinda this -- kinda
looks like elephant

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:41.330
skin, uh, crack, uh, cracked clay on the surface.
This is mount Erebus in Antarctica.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:47.000
The molten lava lake at the center of that
big cloud of steam.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.670
That's the Ross Sea in the background that
the shadow of the volcano's

00:27:54.670 --> 00:28:02.720
casting on.
The peak of edge of the Empty Quarter in Yemen.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:11.030
This is in the central Sahara, in Chad.
Same place.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.789
This is in the Namibian coast.
It's a freighter that went ground about 30

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:20.279
years ago and the ocean --
the beach has been accreting so now it's about

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:27.380
a half a kilometer
from the water.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:33.049
The salt flats of Bolivia.
The coast of Peru.

00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:40.399
The shore of a lake in Namibia.
It's clay.

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:44.919
It's a little stick.
This is not a -- this is a low altitude aerial,

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:46.249
about one meter.

00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:47.249
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:28:47.249 --> 00:28:53.360
George Steinmetz: A cheater.
And this is, uh, over the, umm, the shanty

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.960
town of Nouakchott, the
capital of Mauritania.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:02.559
No plumbing, no electricity.
It's all little donkey cart paths for water

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:09.419
and trade.
And this is out in the Sonora desert of Creosote

00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:12.110
and in Creosote they space
each other out because of how much water their

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.390
roots need to -- to
survive.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:27.929
Caravan crossing the Sahara.
This is the vegetable garden of Timbuktu in

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:33.190
Mali.
Center pivot irrigation system growing tomatoes

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.500
in Saudi Arabia.
They drill down into the fossil water that

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.080
underlies the desert.
This water filtering the last ice age and

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.880
the wells will last about 20
years until they've sucked all the water out

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.030
of the rock underneath
and then their abandoned.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.490
But with water and fertilizer they can grow
tomatoes.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:56.799
This is, uh, a very rare fog in the Empty
Quarter near the border of

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:57.799
Saudi Arabia with the Emirates.
Star dune.

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:06.640
It's the little dot in kinda the lower center
is our car.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:15.230
And the ground's white because there was a
salty spring nearby that

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.110
stained the ground white.
This is in the Gobi Desert in China.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.850
Tallest dunes in the world.
These dunes are about 1200 feet tall.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.440
In between the dunes there are salt lakes
with fresh water margins.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.790
That little green strip you see in the lower
left -- so sorry, lower

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:33.669
right -- you walked along that green strip
you could drink fresh water

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:38.970
out of your footprints, but to the right into
the lake it's saltier than sea water.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:45.660
So the dunes act as kind of a reservoir for
fresh water that falls in

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:54.370
the winter.
This is in Iran.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:31:00.090
This is out in the Gobi in China where they're
trying to

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.740
stabilize dunes that are taking over agricultural
fields.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.059
This is Macor next -- this is a picture from
the Dead Sea.

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:09.659
This slide's from Israel in Jordan and this
is a site called Macor in

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:10.659
Jordan where John the Baptist had his head
cut off and delivered to

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:11.659
Herod's wife for her birthday.
Or so they say.

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:26.000
This is Masada, in Israel.
And that big, uh, kinda -- in the middle center

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.220
is a big ramp that the
Romans used to overtake Masada.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:39.760
This is a military area in Jordan.
Controlled access 'cause they don't want Palestinians

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.380
to be crossing
in -- crossing the Dead Sea.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.919
And the Dead Sea is sunk so low that part
of it's actually totally dry

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:52.059
so they pump water up and there's a big salt
works.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:32:02.720
They're mining potash from the Dead Sea waters.
This is part of the potash works.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:10.720
And the evaporation ponds for the potash works.
Same area potash.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:21.340
And, uh, this is Marsab.
It's one of the holiest churches for eastern

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.360
orthodox Christians in
the hills above the Dead Sea, between Bethlehem

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:30.750
and the Dead Sea.
And this is a nude beach in Israel.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:36.000
A lot of, umm, uh, Israelis will go to the
beach to the Dead Sea

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.559
because they believe that, umm, the mineral
water's good for psoriasis

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:41.340
because it's so low they say there's less
chance of getting skin

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340
cancer because there's more atmosphere between
themselves and the sun.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.529
I got arrested for taking this picture.

00:32:43.529 --> 00:32:44.529
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:50.830
George Steinmetz: They said, oh you're from
 -- I got arrested for

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.750
taking pictures of naked women.
I said, no, no.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.269
There weren't any women.
And I was showing them pictures of the men.

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:57.880
They said, oh, we don't care about the men.
We care about the women.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.960
So they let me go.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.419
&gt;&gt; [Silence]

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:08.179
George Steinmetz: These are sink holes on
the Israeli side of the

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:10.919
Dead Sea.
Because the water level drops the ground water

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:15.309
coming in from the
hills, umm, dissolves the salts that are -- one

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:18.080
of the layers in the
stratigraphy and then you get a cave-in as

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.659
the salts dissolved.
And this is in, umm, Waonamos.

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:31.980
It's an unusual volcanic formation in the
Libyan Sahara.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.590
Salt lake in the Libyan Sahara.
Same kinda -- same situation you'd find in

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.080
China.
You can drink water out of your footprints

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.909
as you walk around the
lake.

00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:40.909
But the lake here is totally sterile it's
so salty.

00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:41.909
&gt;&gt; [Silence]

00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:42.909
George Steinmetz: Sand dune field in Libya.
And you're getting over towards the Algerian

00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:43.909
plateau.
You see one of our expedition cars in the

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:44.909
lower right.
I think that's that.

00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:45.909
Are there any questions?
Yeah?

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:46.909
Pardon?

00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:48.380
&gt;&gt; [Talking in the background]

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:55.380
George Steinmetz: I think you're supposed
to walk over to the

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.380
microphone.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.380
&gt;&gt; [Talking in the background]

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:09.720
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Uh, the question was, how do you land?

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:27.250
You show the take-off but not so much the
landing.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:32.399
George Steinmetz: Well, you, umm, landing
is -- takeoffs -- takeoffs

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:35.159
are optional.
Landings are mandatory.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.159
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.829
George Steinmetz: Umm, landings are a bit
of a -- the first couple

00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:41.550
steps are kind of a skid mark.
As you first come in it's kinda like when

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.829
airplanes land you hear
the -- you know, the -- the -- the tire isn't

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:49.310
quite up to speed yet
and my first step is about the skid mark at

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.530
a foot -- about two or
three feet long.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.710
It's a lot easier to land on sand.
If I land on asphalt it's very easy to stumble.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.740
Or landing on a hard salt lake I don't really
like to do.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.840
I'd much rather land on sand or kinda scuffy
terrain.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.410
And I can -- I'm not the best lander but generally
I can land on

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.609
something about the size of a basketball court
and it's about three

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:08.070
steps to come to a complete stop if I'm lucky.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:14.849
&gt;&gt; Sir, could you talk a little bit about
the power paraglider that

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:15.849
you use?

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:17.279
George Steinmetz: About the paraglider?

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:18.279
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:21.470
George Steinmetz: Well, it's kinda like a
motorcycle engine with a

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.119
big fan on the back.
It's kinda like the biggest leaf blower in

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:28.589
New Jersey and, umm, I
don't know.

00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:34.020
It's, uh, uses -- my rig uses about 10 liters
of fuel and I can stay

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.829
in flight for two to three hours, depending
on the conditions, and it

00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:43.109
weighs about 60 pounds.
With fuel probably, you know, 70, 80 pounds.

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:48.710
And it's a bit of a trick to take off and
once you're flying -- you're

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.230
self-stabilizing.
You're hanging underneath.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.430
You kinda swing like you're in a playground
swing.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.300
You get turbulence.
It's self-stabilizing so I can take pictures

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.010
with my hands off the
controls.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.089
&gt;&gt; Sorry.
I'm relaying some questions from the San Francisco

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:05.089
office.

00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:06.099
George Steinmetz: Okay.

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:09.820
&gt;&gt; And, uh, let's see.
So the question number one is, have you done

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.940
many shots from this
elevated angle before the series?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.200
What made you want to take them all from this
perspective?

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.060
And then the third one is, how did the new
perspective change the way

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.589
you would frame photos?
Did it influence your style on the ground?

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:26.910
George Steinmetz: Umm, I've always liked taking
pictures from above

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.310
even, like, when I was a young guy traveling
in Africa.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:33.100
Always wanted to climb a tree to take a picture.
Always liked kind of the elevated perspective.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.150
But this aircraft it gives me kind of what
I think is kind of a

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.089
missing altitude, if there is such a thing,
in aerial photos.

00:36:40.089 --> 00:36:44.060
Most people's aerial photos are very high
and, umm, usually like when

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.380
you're taking off in a plane like the really
cool view is when you're

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.000
just about to land.
And that's the kind of altitude I like to

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.030
fly in where it's, umm, you
get kind of a three dimensional quality to

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.410
the landscape, especially if you use a wide-angle
lens you can get a human sense of scale, you

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.160
can see,
you know, the vertical surfaces but you can

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.790
also see the horizontal
surfaces.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:06.720
And I find it's just a much more interesting
space to be in.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.770
I can get an aerial view where you can get
a sense of scale and human

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:16.130
perspective, umm, so, uh, and I -- it's a
problem for me when I go in

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.980
the field with my aircraft 'cause I tend to
wanna go flying every day.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.530
It's fun to fly but it's also it's very expensive
to bring my rig over

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.980
there, and have the cars and all the support,
and I usually have these

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.460
French guys who wake up every morning and
they wanna go flying.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.720
So it does influence my -- my work in that
I tend to take a lot more

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.640
aerial photos when I go out in the field with
my aircraft.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.930
But when I'm working on the ground it's same
old same old.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:45.390
&gt;&gt; I had a quick question about the logistics.
So you're talking about how you look for a

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.090
while on Google Earth and
you find a spot --

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.090
George Steinmetz: Yeah.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.880
&gt;&gt; -- And just it seems -- it seems like in
all the photos that we saw

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.770
that would take a lifetime and a half to get
out there, seeing how the cars are so small.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.099
What sort of considerations?
I mean, you find a spot you wanna take a photo

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:01.339
of and then do you
personally go from there to seeing if it's

00:38:01.339 --> 00:38:06.400
accessible and seeing if it's
flyable like you're not in the lead of a big

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400
mountain?

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.810
George Steinmetz: Generally like in a place
like the Empty Quarter a

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:13.930
big issue is could you get there?
And you go -- you can go at it a couple ways

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.360
you can go and say, you
know, what's easy to get to?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.880
And you get to it and you look there.
But generally it's like going through the

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.400
lawn with a magnifying glass
and I'll try to find cool stuff and then say,

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.900
jeez, how can I get
there?

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.190
And sometimes you don't really know.
It's hard to know with what you're seeing

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.711
Google Earth what the
terrain is like.

00:38:26.711 --> 00:38:30.829
Like the area in Saudi Arabia where you see
these enormous dunes that

00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:33.260
are shaped like an egg crate and then the
salt flats you just don't

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.341
know if that's drivable.
And there's nobody to call to find out if

00:38:36.341 --> 00:38:38.310
it's drivable.
And you go to Saudi Arabia and the locals

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.760
have never been out there
'cause you're the crazy son of a gun who wants

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.380
to go out there.
And they don't wanna go out there.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:46.510
So there's a lot of issues.
In Libya we wanted to go out into the big

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.940
dune fields and we had a
driver that would come up with every excuse

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.650
not to go out there.
And finally I said, look, we're going out

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.020
there, dude.
And he got down and prayed.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.859
This guy was not a very religious guy and
he was praying.

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:55.859
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:38:55.859 --> 00:38:57.070
George Steinmetz: And he was sure that he
was gonna die out there.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.190
We got out there and look, there are tracks,
there are wrecked cars,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.980
it's okay.
And he was still you know you know, he was

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.440
really nervous.
And so there are a lot of issues, political

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.040
issues, like permits and
when I wanted to go out into the salt deserts

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.079
in Iran, I had to get a
13-car escort from the Iranian military police

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:17.070
that are supposed to be
chasing after heroin smugglers and to have

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.700
13 cars and get a colonel
up there to protect the crazy American guy.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.780
I mean, it's amazing that they let me out
there at all let alone to

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.054
give me a 13-car military escort, but I had
to organize all that to get

00:39:28.054 --> 00:39:30.940
out to a place that I thought would be really
cool from Google Earth.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.640
So you have all these different problems you
gotta worry -- and then,

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.420
like, wind conditions, and getting stuck in
the mud, and carburetors breaking and all

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.069
that other stuff.
Umm, and for some of the countries it's just

00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:43.950
 -- I mean, getting into
Libya or Iran, or -- it's really tough.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.180
I'm going to Algeria next week.
Getting permission to fly aircraft like mine

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.300
in Algeria is not a
straightforward process.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.030
It's a very non-linear process.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.030
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.020
George Steinmetz: Yes?

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.330
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering so where would you like
to go?

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.841
Like what's your plans?
I didn't see Australia there.

00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:06.440
Or what countries can't you go 'cause it's
too dangerous or it's too

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.440
hard to get into?

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.190
George Steinmetz: Well, I -- when I started
this project I looked at

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.830
some kind of old textbooks about deserts and
I got some maps and I

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.940
figured out all the different places that
I had to go to finish my project.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.609
And right now my list I've got Algeria, which
I'm going next week, and

00:40:21.609 --> 00:40:25.150
Egypt which is also very difficult for permission
to fly like flying

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.670
over the pyramids.
Not so easy to get permission.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.650
And I need to go to Eritrea in Ethiopia and
then I'm pretty much

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.000
done.
I didn't go to Australia 'cause it's not dry

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.230
enough.
It gets more than ten centimeters and if you're

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.589
gonna be strict to the
rule hyper-arid it's too wet down there.

00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:41.579
They get monsoonal rains and it's very dry
for most of the year but

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:43.569
when it rains they get hosed and it doesn't
really fit.

00:40:43.569 --> 00:40:49.260
It's beautiful but it doesn't really fit.
Antarctica fits but Australia it's not on

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.710
the menu.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.180
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if there was any sort of
magic that allows -- that

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.130
you use to be able to get to fly in these
places.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.319
I mean, I'm a pilot.
I would love to fly some of these places.

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:05.819
Do you have to be with National Geographic
is that the magic ticket

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:07.970
or just lots of hard work?

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.510
George Steinmetz: There's nobody from National
Geographic here so I

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.800
can say honestly they don't really help at
all.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.260
They -- they fund -- they fund -- they pay
for it which is wonderful

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.640
but in terms of access generally that's got
to be worked out.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.190
I gotta work -- that's my problem.
Like going to Libya, I smuggle my aircraft

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.380
in and I had to work all
that stuff out.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.880
And so, umm, and most of these places I mean,
they've never -- they

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.820
never heard of National Geographic.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.540
&gt;&gt; So it's all -- this is your personal expertise?
You've slowly figured it out place by place?

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.510
George Steinmetz: Yeah.
It's like that's my cross to bear.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.900
George Steinmetz: Yeah. I mean, I love the
Geographic and

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.050
that -- you know, they publish the work and
they support it but they

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:48.579
don't know how to get an aircraft into Yemen.
They don't have to do it.

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:49.579
It's not their thing.

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:50.579
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:51.579
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:41:51.579 --> 00:41:52.660
George Steinmetz: They'll send me a letter
and I can use their

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.701
stationary but that's about it.

00:41:53.701 --> 00:41:57.930
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious.
Which do you usually find is easier to get,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:58.930
permission or forgiveness?

00:41:58.930 --> 00:41:59.930
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.100
George Steinmetz: It's a lot easier to get
forgiveness.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.890
There's a serious question because you have
to figure out, you know,

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:09.380
how to play the game and, like, in some African
buearacracy you try

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.450
and get permission and you're looking for
a world of pain.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.079
And you just go out there and some guy might
get upset and, you know,

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:18.750
you give him like a case of beer out of the
back of the car and

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:19.750
everything's okay.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.750
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.260
George Steinmetz: It's hard to know how to
play that and in North

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.410
Africa it's really different because you're
between the European

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:32.510
buearacracy and kinda the free-living way
of Africa and so you kinda get the worst of

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:41.380
both worlds.
And I'm gonna find out more next week.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.880
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks for showing us very greatful
photos.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.380
Can you tell us what kind of camera you use?

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.040
George Steinmetz: Yeah.
I try to keep it pretty simple while I'm flying

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.880
because it's awkward
changing lenses.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.410
You get dust in 'em and stuff because I'm
in a very dusty environment

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.280
but you don't wanna be taking your hands off
the controls and have,

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.079
like -- there's no place to put anything.
It's basically like a flying lawn chair.

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:09.000
So, umm, I keep it real simple.
I usually have one body, sometimes two extra

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.630
lenses -- usually it's
one extra lens -- and I switched about five

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.339
years ago from film to
digital and that made my life a lot easier,

00:43:16.339 --> 00:43:20.670
umm, because I can have
big CF cards so I don't have to change cassettes

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:24.540
in flight.
And, umm, the -- with digital imaging I can

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:30.640
use high ASA without any
loss of quality so I can take pictures in

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.290
really low light and I used
to have problems to use really fast lenses

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:37.300
and focusing it accurately
and now I can be kinda the pig and use autofocus

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.710
and I don't really
shoot like that but it's gotten a lot easier.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.369
And the resolution is so much better.
I can get -- I can take pictures up and blow

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:49.021
them up the size of the
screen and they're just tack sharp and in

00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:51.589
film they start to fall
apart once you get them much bigger than that.

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:56.670
So it's made life a lot easier.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.940
&gt;&gt; So, one more question for the few pilot
and paraglider pilot geeks

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.359
in the audience.
Umm, you show up at this place and, I mean,

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.900
how much do you know about
the meteorology?

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:09.170
How much do you know about the conditions,
and are there local pilots

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:13.530
to show you if it's safe to fly and -- and
how do you --

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:14.920
George Steinmetz: No.No.
You're kind of going into virgin turf every

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.740
time and there aren't
no -- there aren't any local guides.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:22.920
I mean, sometimes I'll go and maybe in a couple
South American

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.630
countries you can find somebody but generally
you're -- you're kinda

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.950
figuring it out on your own. And you can talk
to -- try and find guides

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:33.660
and say, you know, what are the winds like?
I've been going to the Sahara -- the Sahara's

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.290
divided into about ten
different countries and the only real season

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.750
for flying there is in
the fall because in the winter they get -- after

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.260
February/March they
get ripping winds, Harmattan winds that carve

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.650
the landsape if you look
at satellite imagery.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.369
So there's really no -- only one season.
I got two or three months.

00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:51.431
So I've missed my kids' birthdays every year
for ten years 'cause they're -- all

00:44:51.431 --> 00:44:59.630
the birthdays are in the fall and I'm just,
sorry, Daddy's gone to the

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:00.630
Sahara.
That's the way it is.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:01.630
It's the season.
It's like the surf's up and I gotta go.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.770
But it's a real problem.
You try and ask -- you go to a place like

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.240
the Empty Quarter you try and
ask 'cause you look at this landscape and

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.839
you can see they've got huge
winds.

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:10.910
I can tell by looking at the dunes.
I know what direction they're coming from.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.161
I just don't know what time of year they might
be down and to get

00:45:13.161 --> 00:45:16.130
around up there safely you have to be there
when the temperatures are

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.570
relatively cool so that the cars don't overheat
so you don't have to

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.660
carry literally a ton of water.
And so if you go down you can walk outta there.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.930
So you wanna be down in the winter in, uh,
a stable atmosphere.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.730
But it's very hard to -- there aren't any
meteorological stations out

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.830
there so that's tough.
It's been a big problem.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.069
And sometimes I went to, like, Morocco and
it was winter and we got

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:40.130
hosed.
It was bad weather for three weeks and somebody

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.619
said, you know, it's
snowing in, I don't know, in Whatchamacallit.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:45.650
I said, well, where in the hell is Whatchamacallit?
Gad zukes.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.980
There was snow there on the palm trees.
It was fantastic.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:59.130
We had, you know, one good day in three weeks.
It's like that sometimes.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.130
It's tough.
Any other questions in.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.200
&gt;&gt; Umm, is there any chance or possiblity
to make some of those great

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.400
pictures available for Google Earth?

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.950
George Steinmetz: Yeah.
Actually, I'm working on making a layer and,

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.311
uh, things that
will -- gonna be plugged into Google Earth.

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:19.099
So -- Google Earth it's been an amazing, uh,
resource for me and

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:21.710
'cause it's just the whole world, and it's
searchable.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.200
And you can look at it in time.
I had a problem when I first started using

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.880
Google Earth when it was in
its infancy and I'd look at an area and it

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.180
didn't tell me what date
the picture was taken in.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.670
So I'd try and go there and the picture was
taken in the winter and I

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.079
was going there in the summer and the pictures
didn't match up.

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:37.720
And now it's just there's so much more information
there.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.230
It's a really amazing resource so I'm happy
to give something back.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:44.650
Well, thank you all for coming.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:45.980
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
