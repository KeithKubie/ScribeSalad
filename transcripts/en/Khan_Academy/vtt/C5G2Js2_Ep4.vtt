00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.500
So we have the
function f of x is

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.290
equal to e to the
x over x squared.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.630
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.960
is find the equation,
not of the tangent line,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.220
but the equation of the normal
line, when x is equal to 1.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.970
So we care about the
equation of the normal line.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.250
So I encourage you to pause this
video and try this on your own.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.690
And if you need a little bit
of a hint, the hint I will give

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.800
you is, is that the
slope of a normal line

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.920
is going to be the
negative reciprocal

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.020
of the slope of
the tangent line.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.640
If you imagine a
curve like this,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.686
and we want to find a
tangent line at a point,

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.310
it's going to look
something like this.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.600
So the tangent line is
going to look like this.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.220
A normal line is perpendicular
to the tangent line.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470
This is the tangent line.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.710
The normal line is going to
be perpendicular to that.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.310
It's going to go just like that.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450
And if this has a
slope of m, then this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.100
has a slope of the
negative reciprocal of m.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.350
So negative 1/m.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.200
So with that as a
little bit of a hint,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.880
I encourage you to find the
equation of the normal line

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.410
to this curve, when x equals 1.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.082
So let's find the slope
of the tangent line.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:30.790
And then we take the
negative reciprocal,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.070
we can find the slope
of the normal line.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.190
So to find the slope
of the tangent line,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.660
we just take the derivative here
and evaluate it at x equals 1.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.180
So f prime of x,
and actually, let me

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.400
rewrite this a little bit.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.222
So f of x is equal to e to the
x times x to the negative 2.

00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:49.180
I like to rewrite it this
way, because I always

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.721
forget the whole
quotient rule thing.

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.770
I like the power
rule a lot more.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.610
And this allows me to
use the power rule.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.792
I'm sorry, not the power
rule, the product rule.

00:01:57.792 --> 00:01:59.250
So this allows me
to do the product

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.150
rule instead of
the quotient rule.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.650
So the derivative
of this, f prime

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.930
of x, is going to be the
derivative of e to the x.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.500
Which is just e to the x times
x to the negative 2, plus

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.780
e to the x times the derivative
of x to the negative 2.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
Which is negative 2x to
the negative 3 power.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.200
I just used the power
rule right over here.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.710
So if I want to evaluate
when x is equal to 1,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.450
this is going to
be equal to-- let

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.570
me do that in that
yellow color like.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.000
I like switching colors.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.950
This is going to be
equal to, let's see,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.580
this is going to be
e to the first power.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.100
Which is just e times
1 to the negative 2,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.290
which is just 1 plus e to the
first power, which is just e,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.410
times negative 2.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.210
1 to the negative 3 is just 1.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.644
So e times negative 2.

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:52.810
So let me write it this way.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.390
So minus 2e.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.220
And e minus 2e is just going
to be equal to negative e.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.190
So this right over here, this is
the slope of the tangent line.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.390
And so if we want the
slope of the normal,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.100
we just take the
negative reciprocal.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.702
So the negative reciprocal
of this is going to be,

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:21.410
well the reciprocal
is 1 over negative e,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.785
but we want the
negative of that.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.240
So it's going to be 1/e.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.260
This is going to be the
slope of the normal line.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.066
And then if we, and
our goal isn't just

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.524
to the slope of
the normal line, we

00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:40.340
want the equation
of the normal line.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.560
And we know the
equation of a line

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.860
can be represented
as y is equal to mx

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.970
plus b, where m is the slope.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.050
So we can say it's going to be
y is equal to 1/e-- remember,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.660
we're doing the normal
line here-- times x plus b.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.250
And to solve for b, we
just have to recognize

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.210
that we know a point
that this goes through.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.180
This goes through
the point x equals 1.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.970
And when x equals 1, what is y?

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.430
Well, y is e to the 1st
over 1, which is just e.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.820
So this goes to the
point 1 comma e.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.800
So we know that when x is
equal to 1, y is equal to e.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.020
And now we can just solve for b.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:34.960
So we get e is
equal to 1/e plus b.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.630
Or we could just subtract
1 over e from both sides,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.160
and we would get b is
equal to e minus 1/e.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.355
And we could obviously right
this as e squared minus 1/e

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:54.730
if we want to
write it like that.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.355
But could just leave
it just like this.

00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:58.170
So the equation of
the normal line--

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.630
so we deserve our drum
roll right over here--

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:10.020
is going to be y is equal
to 1/e times x, plus b.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.400
And b, plus b, is all of this.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.830
So plus e minus 1/e.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.530
So that right there is our
equation of the normal line.
