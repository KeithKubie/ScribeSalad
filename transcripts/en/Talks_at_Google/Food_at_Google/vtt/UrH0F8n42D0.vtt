SHEILA BOWMAN: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.350
My name is Sheila Bowman.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.200
I'm with the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Seafood Watch program.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.920
We're extremely pleased to
be here and have a chance

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.740
to thank you, but also
to meet each one of you

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.990
Googlers, and, of course,
hopefully encourage you

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.490
and invite you to join us down
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.660
when you have free time.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.420
All the programs that we do
really depend on great folks

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.330
like you coming in
and supporting us.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.413
And one of our programs
that we're especially here

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.140
to talk about today is, of
course, our sustainable seafood

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.120
program.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.240
And I'm going to
take this opportunity

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.960
to welcome and introduce to
those who don't know Chef Rick

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.210
Moonen, who's come to us this
morning from Las Vegas, where

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270
he has two successful
restaurants.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.820
And really, beyond
that, I think everyone

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420
who knows Rick knows he
has a world of experience

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.910
beyond that, from TV--
"Top Chef Masters" program.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.340
He travels the
world-- in my opinion

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.480
is the foremost chef who is
speaking out on sustainable

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.060
seafood issues, educating
himself, engaging, really,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.670
at the level of fish farmers
who don't know how to improve

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.490
and want to improve, all the
way through to these premium

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.380
products.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350
The folks who have made
this conversion, who

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.530
have done great work, who
are providing sustainable

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.300
seafood-- helping promote
them, so that all of us

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.960
can enjoy this great
fish that's come so far.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.350
And in so many cases, we have
environmental heroes out there,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.570
where we can support them and
still enjoy delicious food.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.140
So I think I'm going to just
go ahead and turn things over

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.970
to Rick, 'cause I know he's
got to get the lentils started.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.427
So please, everybody--
Seafood Watch spokesperson,

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:43.760
and my good friend, Rick Moonen.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.510
RICK MOONEN: Thanks,
Sheila, that's great.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.990
What a tremendous
privilege, to be

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.330
able to be standing in
front of all of you.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.970
Just because-- not only just
of the mentality of the Google

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.870
campus-- and Google world,
I might as well say,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.160
but it's your generation.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.050
It's you.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.680
You are the thinkers.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.170
You are the future.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.100
I've been focused
on sustainability

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.740
for my entire career.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.090
I graduated culinary
school in the '70s.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.800
1978.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.680
First in my class.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.180
Yay!

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.710
But I worked with some great
chefs that instilled in me

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.525
an integrity, a
respect, a connection,

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.930
and an understanding
about our environment.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.940
Healthy environment
equals healthy food.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.810
Better, healthy environment
makes tasty, delicious,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.607
nutritious, real food.

00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.940
And the biggest problem,
today, that we're faced-- well,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.940
not the biggest-- but one
of them-- one of many,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.720
unfortunately-- is that
the food that we consume

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.862
is ofttimes so processed
that our bodies don't even

00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:40.820
see it as food anymore.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.450
It doesn't recognize it.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020
And that's when immunity
systems start to break down,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.710
and all kinds of stuff happens.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.000
That's a whole nother
topic of discussion.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.750
But it's just something
I want to open up,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.645
because real food
equals healthy-- health.

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:54.770
You're going to be healthy.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.330
Every atom of your
body is a result

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.038
of something you've
consumed or something

00:02:58.038 --> 00:02:59.440
you've come in contact with.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.430
So let's be a little bit
more connected to that food--

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.500
to that source.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.480
And that's really about
the responsibility

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.230
of how I define sustainability.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.720
Sustaining, keeping--
making sure there's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.310
enough for tomorrow,
for tomorrow's dinner,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.200
for the next generation--
your children,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.330
yourselves, and everything
else, going on down the line.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.025
Without putting our toys
away at the end of the night,

00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:22.650
we're not going to
be able to have them

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.567
tomorrow to play with.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:24.066
Right?

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.060
It's pretty simple.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.680
So I'm going to do that through
a cooking demonstration.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.263
But really, the
opportunity is to have

00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:30.507
this ongoing discussion.

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:32.090
And if I can change
the way you think,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.160
a little bit, today,
then I've succeeded.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.490
If I can connect you to a
great source of information

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.040
to help you along, as you're,
like, I got a little bit of it,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.300
but I need more,
then we're going

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.424
to talk about Seafood Watch,
and what they've done,

00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:44.870
and what they do
every single day.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.560
They've got a team
of people in Monterey

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.570
that are connecting to a
crazy network of scientists,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.590
environmental groups, people
that are-- government-- that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.970
are measuring and taking census
of different species of fish

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.640
and stuff.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.370
Measuring their potential
to be able to reproduce

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.140
enough to produce what we
want for the following year.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.750
A lot goes into this.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.262
And I'm not here to
scare you about it.

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.720
But I hope that
you'll be motivated

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.700
to know more about your
food at the end of this.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.050
Jeez!

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.841
I didn't know that!

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:15.800
All right!

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.660
Now I know more.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.160
So let's get the
lentils started.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.920
Anyway, what I'm going
to show you today

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.004
is I'm choosing a-- OK, so how
do I define sustainability?

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:24.920
We're going to do that
when the lentils start.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.605
Because these lentils-- brown
or green lentils are the lentils

00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:29.730
that you want to work with.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.729
All those other colored
lentils are real pretty,

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.780
but they turn to mush.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.730
They just do.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.040
So I'm just going to put some
cold water on some dry lentils.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.930
You don't have to presoak them.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.950
It's not necessarily
a requirement.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.760
As a matter of fact, I never do.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.470
I just put cold water on the
fire, bring it up slowly,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.480
simmer it very, very gently.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.790
And then, towards the end,
I'll season it with salt.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.730
If you salt it in
the very beginning,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.180
it has a tendency to
take longer to cook,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.370
be more uneven, et cetera.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.800
So that's Lentils 101.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.300
Yay.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.810
We got that out of the way.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.430
Another thing, because I am
in love with Moroccan places,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.930
right now.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.880
Indian spices.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.550
I think-- what's the movie? "100
Foot Journey," or something?

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.310
What is it called?

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.670
How many people have seen that?

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.550
It's a cool movie.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.966
I mean, the coolest
part of it was

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:19.260
when the guy pulled out this box
of jars, of mixtures and spices

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.926
from his mother.

00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:21.340
He's like-- [SNIFF].

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.020
And the guy ended up, you know,
with a three-star Michelin

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.540
restaurant.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.920
That blew my mind.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.310
It's that depth of flavor
that we're kind of going for.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.860
It's the new
palette of intrigue.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.412
It's the depth-- the smell--
turmeric-- ooh, really good!

00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:35.370
Turmeric is good because
it's anti-inflammatory

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.600
and it helps get rid
of all the pains.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.990
Food does that.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.790
Food can and always
will do that.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.240
It'll help solve 90% of the
concerns and health issues.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.290
My opinion, OK.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.940
So how do we go about that?

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.047
Take everything that
starts with a C,

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:54.380
in your whole spice counter,
and that's pretty much what

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.546
you're going to end up with.

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:56.950
Coriander.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.970
Coriander seeds.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.160
Also, if you planted that
in the ground, what would

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.480
it grow up into?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.160
Cilantro.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.840
That's correct.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.980
I'll help you out.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.480
OK.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.980
This is cumin.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.030
Very deep, very
rich, very earthy,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.320
very delic-- um-- widely used.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.570
Many, many different cuisines.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.920
You're going to see it from
Greek, Mediterranean, Indian,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.396
Moroccan.

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.544
Cumin.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.960
This begins with an F, so we're
not going to go there yet.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.600
These are cloves-- whole cloves.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.090
Very oily, very deep, lot
of, um-- well, cloves.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.590
You know?

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.090
It's what you-- they stick them
in ham when they roast them.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.680
It's got a real
distinctive flavor.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.830
So you only want
a couple of those,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.090
because that's very strong.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.890
This-- cardamom.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.816
Cardamom.

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:37.940
Really, really interesting.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.920
You've got green,
you've got black,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.250
you've got different ones.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.710
There's little seeds inside.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.740
We use the whole
green cardamom when

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.270
we're making this
particular spice blend.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.590
And then-- so that's
everything with a C. Coriander,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.995
cumin-- not-- yeah-- coriander,
cumin, cardamom, and cloves.

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:57.256
And then we get some
fennel, because we need

00:06:57.256 --> 00:06:58.710
a little F in there, I guess.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.510
Fennel.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.770
You can add cinnamon in there.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.610
I'll often use turmeric--
you can add to it.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.920
And then you're starting to
go into like a curry style.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.503
This isn't so much
like a curry style.

00:07:07.503 --> 00:07:09.520
This is going to be
based on some heat.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.270
I want some spice.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.919
So, in order to get those
flavors out of there,

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:13.710
I want to toast it.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.510
So that's why I'm
putting it in a dry pan.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.980
I have it on a medium heat.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.730
And I want to toast them.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.530
Difference between a
piece of white bread,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.370
stick it in this little
machine, push down the thing,

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.310
pops out toast.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.240
Big difference; same product.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.560
Kind of the same idea, here.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.820
Right?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.694
You want to get the--

00:07:28.694 --> 00:07:31.557
And you're going to start
to smell the aroma--

00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:32.556
the aromatics out of it.

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:33.930
So I'm keeping it
simple to five,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.620
but you can put up to 10
different spices in there.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.890
Good base, what I
just showed you.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.180
Lentils are cooking.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.029
And I'm going to get
back to sustainability

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.820
while this happens.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.600
This had to start
real soon, because it

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.690
takes a little bit of time.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.090
Do not participate in
the activity that brings

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.900
a species to an extinction.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.360
So important.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.720
Ecosystem.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.180
Everything works in
conjunction with each other.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.950
Every living thing on
our planet plays a role.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.620
It was put here.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.620
We didn't invent the plants or
any animals that are on here.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.790
They all have a function
that helps the earth

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.540
stay healthy and go around.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.550
You would never think
of taking something out

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.925
of your car engine-- driving
down the highway and saying,

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:18.970
"Hmm, you know?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.577
I'm just going to
pull something out."

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:22.160
And expect the engine
to run the same.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.190
It would not.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.600
That's ridiculous.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.640
Yet, if we allow something
to fall out of the ecosystem,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.930
then we create an imbalance.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.003
An imbalance, then we
have to try to repair.

00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:34.669
You try to repair it,
you overrepair it.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.460
It's oversteering.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.418
It's all over the road.

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:37.590
You can't do it.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.360
Study nature.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.200
Emulate it.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.664
Respect it.

00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:42.580
Earth will be healthy.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.700
Environment will be healthy.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.230
We'll be healthy.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.730
OK?

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.750
I know I've repeated it.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.640
I'm not going to
bring it up again,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.848
except maybe four more times.

00:08:47.848 --> 00:08:49.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.220
OK.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.870
So intriguing spice mix.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.280
Lentils.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.502
I'll explain alternatives
to lentils, too.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.960
You know, a lot of
times, I'll just

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.480
do what I call
"cauliflower rice."

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.290
You know what that is?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.590
You take a box grater,
you take a whole head

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.312
of raw cauliflower, and you
just-- [SCRAPING SOUNDS]

00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:04.830
--and just saute
it really quick.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.520
Boom.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.810
Instantaneous,
gluten-free, grain-free,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.210
whatever free you want to
go down-- whatever road

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.760
is floating your
boat at that moment.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.340
There's really great vegetables
that help you to do that.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.840
OK.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.640
I want to make, here, a harissa
sauce, or a fiery-hot tomato

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.690
sauce.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.830
Because somehow
vinegar-- acidity--

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.740
works really, really,
really well with seafood.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.250
Take a piece of fish,
put it in a pan, cook it.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.846
What's the first
thing you need to do?

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:35.597
AUDIENCE: A lemon.

00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:37.054
RICK MOONEN: Squeeze
a lemon on it.

00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:37.560
It works.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.070
Acidity and fish protein
are just meant to be.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.070
So we've kind of got the
idea of sustainability.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.730
Right?

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.400
You know?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.870
Not allowing
something to go bad.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.020
But there's a lot to that.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.990
What does that mean?

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.750
It means I encourage you to
learn more about your food.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.550
Ask questions.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.660
Be curious.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.500
The dumbest question
that you could have

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.039
is the question
that's not asked.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.330
Because once you ask that
question, for a brief moment,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.621
you may feel awkward, but
then now you know the answer.

00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:06.480
So now you're smarter.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.850
You've expanded your base of
knowledge and connectiveness

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.180
to the environment, which
is what I highly recommend.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.760
You know?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.593
If you can't grow produce
in your backyard--

00:10:16.593 --> 00:10:20.570
which I also recommend-- get
connected through your food.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.180
Right?

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.900
OK.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.070
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about aquaculture.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.890
Aquaculture.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.190
What's aquaculture?

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.340
That's when we're farming fish.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.840
Hmm.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.410
Isn't there enough fish in
the ocean to feed us, anyway?

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.780
Why do we need farms?

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.680
Well, over half the food from
the ocean that's consumed,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.270
every single day, globally,
comes from a farm now.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.830
[WHISTLE] That's pretty big.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.657
So is aquaculture good or bad?

00:10:47.657 --> 00:10:48.240
Show of hands.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.070
Is it good?

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.340
How many people think
aquaculture's good?

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.597
One.

00:10:52.597 --> 00:10:53.680
Don't you raise your hand.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.054
You're going to
influence people!

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:55.760
Right.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.480
Aquaculture has
a bad reputation.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.370
It does.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.880
It has been proven to be
detrimental to our environment

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.040
because of the learning curve.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.645
Farming fish is
not something that

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:10.800
has happened hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.540
This is decades old.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.570
It's new technology.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.660
A lot of mistakes have
been made in order

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.460
to try to keep up with the
booming aquaculture interest.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.990
So the guys that go into fish
farming, 20, 25 years ago,

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.390
they didn't know how to deal
with sea lice, or escapes,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.407
or fish-in, fish-out ratio.

00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:34.740
They didn't even think about it.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.270
You're raising carnivores.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.362
Carnivores!

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:40.445
Imagine if you bring that
onto land, for a minute.

00:11:40.445 --> 00:11:40.700
All right?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.991
We're going to raise carnivores
on land for consumption

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:45.075
in our-- if you go
to a grocery store,

00:11:45.075 --> 00:11:47.450
there's only one category of
carnivores that you can buy,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.770
and it's fish.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.120
Because fish eat fish.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.460
And that's no big deal.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.211
But if you're going to be
farm-raising lions for dinner--

00:11:54.211 --> 00:11:54.710
right?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.340
We're going to have lions.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.130
I love lion.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:56.990
Don't you love lion?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.697
Delicious.

00:11:57.697 --> 00:11:59.530
You think about how
it's going to be farmed.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.310
Kind of gross.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.530
Kind of weird.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.330
We're going to have to go get
some protein-- animal protein.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.980
Could be your dog, your cat--
anything-- and it's going--

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.897
could be rodents.

00:12:07.897 --> 00:12:08.730
And that's not cool.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.230
You see?

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.700
That gets weird.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.540
So let's pull it into
the category of-- OK,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.520
now, this is-- this is now
getting a little bit toasty.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.357
You can smell it.

00:12:18.357 --> 00:12:20.940
You can see the little bit of a
poofiness coming out of there,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.070
from just the haze of heat.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.800
So farming of fish
has had major issues.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.810
But the good news is, big
companies are starting

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.910
to do a little bit better.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.910
They're starting to learn how
the fish-in, fish-out ratio--

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.430
in other words, because it's
a carnivore, if it takes

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.120
five pounds of some
other live fish

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.910
to grind up to make Purina
Fish Chow to feed this fish,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.460
in order to have
a farmed product

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.360
come out onto our dinner
plate, well, what's the ratio?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.206
If it takes five pounds to
make one pound, not so good.

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.330
Even if it's sardines or
something you hate anyway.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:52.680
Gross.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.090
You can have all the
sardines you want.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.800
Eat 'em all.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.590
Ecchh!

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.230
Right?

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.730
No.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.271
Because there's a
lot of other things

00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:00.330
that you do like that like
sardines, that eat it.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.000
It's necessary.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.860
You want to keep
the sardines happy.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.970
You want them to have
a healthy population.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.640
And I encourage you
to try sardines,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.090
but that's not
today's discussion.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.930
You know, It's about
fish in, fish out.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.250
So they're becoming a lot
more efficient about that.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.430
The feed.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.590
It's a big topic.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.090
There's a lot of
other topics, and I

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.420
could talk to you for
two hours about that,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.740
and I only have 35 minutes.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.480
How many minutes
have I got left?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.710
I gotta know how
quickly I have to go.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.410
So aquaculture was,
and for many years

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.510
has been, kind of a problem.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:37.650
Because you put a ton of fish in
a small area of the open ocean.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.040
You put a pen there--
a net, basically--

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.960
throw in a bunch of
baby fish, and then you

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.560
start to grow them.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.169
But you put a ton
of them in there.

00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:45.960
So now you've got this
stressful situation,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.544
because they're kind of like--
it's not a natural environment.

00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:50.251
One of them gets sick,
they all get sick.

00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:51.522
You have to use antibiotics.

00:13:51.522 --> 00:13:53.730
One of them gets a little
thing of some lice on them,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.355
they all get lice.

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.063
It's an epidemic.

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:57.307
You've got to use some
chemicals to get rid of them.

00:13:57.307 --> 00:13:58.890
The chemicals that
are used to get rid

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.290
of lice-- which is
basically a crustacean--

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.290
might have a little bit
of an effect, especially

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.960
in Maine, where the lobsters
are, because the lobster's just

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.951
a big-- you know-- bug, anyway.

00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:10.200
So that's really what happens.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.658
We all love it,
but it's the truth.

00:14:11.658 --> 00:14:12.490
It's a bug.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.960
SHEILA BOWMAN: But you're
talking about open net pen--

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.390
RICK MOONEN: Yep.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.090
Open-net pen--

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.860
SHEILA BOWMAN: --aquaculture--

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.330
RICK MOONEN: Correct.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.750
SHEILA BOWMAN: --where there
is this farm, with nets.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.860
And so the fish stay in, and
they put the fish in there.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.880
But if they put
the chemicals in,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.810
they float out to the
rest of the environment.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.290
And then what we also
find is, quite often,

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.840
a big storm may come through,
and those fish escape.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.400
Right, Rick?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.940
So all of a sudden, you had
three million fish in the farm.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.617
Now you have two and a half
million fish out of the farm,

00:14:37.617 --> 00:14:38.200
swimming free.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.230
RICK MOONEN: And they're
competing for the food

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.604
that the fish that live in
that neighborhood need to eat.

00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:42.614
SHEILA BOWMAN: Right.

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:43.530
RICK MOONEN: Not cool.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.010
It's like busloads
of people moving

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.620
into your neighborhood one
day, and all of a sudden,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.328
you're like, what the
hell just happened?

00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:51.590
Well, that's what the fish of
a particular area surrounding

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.069
a farm-- fish
farm-- are thinking.

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:54.610
I think that's what
they're thinking.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.380
Maybe they're not
thinking at all.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.260
I don't know.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:56.760
OK.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.764
So this is our
toasted spice mix.

00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:02.430
I want to cool it off
just a little bit,

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.130
and the we're going just going
to put into a spice blender.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.970
Like one of these
things-- coffee grinder.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.770
But once you put spices into
it, it's then a spice blender.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.190
Because it'll smell and
have the oils, et cetera,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.210
of the spices in there.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.030
So that just goes inside there.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.700
I recommend that
you cool this off.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.450
Because what'll happen is,
you do it hot, like I'm

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.780
about to do it, you really
have a cleaning project

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.880
ahead of you.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.520
Because the oils from
the clove kind of

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.649
have a tendency to
stick to the walls--

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:32.940
the inner-lining walls of this.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.940
But what I want to do is
I want to pass this around

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.310
so you can smell it.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.820
You can get an idea.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.012
Connect with it.

00:15:41.012 --> 00:15:42.220
And it smells so much better.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:42.650
You see that?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.850
It's going to-- watch this.

00:15:46.682 --> 00:15:47.182
Oh!

00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:49.680
SHEILA BOWMAN: Oh!

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.680
RICK MOONEN: Incredible.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.180
OK?

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.250
So I'm going to just give
you a little sniffer.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.880
Start here; sniff around.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.945
All right?

00:15:57.945 --> 00:15:59.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:00.170
Then you keep that.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.740
This is going to go
inside our sauce.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.005
This is going to go on
the outside of our fish.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.130
We're just going to use
this with reckless abandon,

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.250
because that's the whole idea.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.750
OK.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.476
To make the sauce,
let's get this going.

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:13.850
Sheila, feel free
to just jump in

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.790
on any conversation you
might want to have here.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.120
SHEILA BOWMAN: Sure.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.815
So I think what
you're saying, Rick,

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:21.490
is that not all aquaculture
is bad these days.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.640
Is there certain
aquaculture that you

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.914
think that is pretty great--
that you're supporting?

00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:27.580
RICK MOONEN: Oh.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.030
Yeah.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.446
Right now, I'm
looking-- well, OK.

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:31.180
For many, many, many,
many, many years,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.920
I personally am supporting
noncarnivorous fish.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.420
Right?

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.470
So you got your tilapia.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.750
You've got your catfish.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.347
[SNORE] Really?

00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:41.430
SHEILA BOWMAN: Barramundi.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.350
RICK MOONEN: That's
what I got to work with,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.310
in order to be sustainable?

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.820
I gotta work with
these boring fish?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.110
Because they are.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.090
But more and more, there's
more intrigue and interest

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:54.330
in flavor being introduced into
some of the farm-raised fish.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.279
And the ratios to the feed are
becoming a little bit better.

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:59.820
They're more cognizant of the
byproduct that comes out of it,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.630
called "effluent," which is a
beautiful little recipe of fish

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.032
poop, dead fish,
and uneaten food.

00:17:05.032 --> 00:17:06.990
It's nasty when it hits
the bottom of the ocean

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.780
and turns into this suffocating
blanket of death goo.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.619
Bleagh!

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.480
Doesn't sound good.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.369
Needs to be treated.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.720
Something-- there's
a lot of protein

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.845
and a lot of food in there.

00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:18.236
So you get some fish farms
that are going, food; problem.

00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:20.819
Let's grow something next to it
that's going to eat that food.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.069
Like nature does.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.329
So they plant kelp next to the
fish farm-- the salmon farm.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.690
And next to the kelp
they put mussels.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.770
All different layers
of the food chain,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.280
working in conjunction to
keep the ocean healthy.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.239
This is something new,
which is kind of scary.

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:40.030
This should have been
the way of the world.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.557
Just watch the way
it happens naturally

00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:43.473
and try to emulate it.

00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:44.690
But no, we're men.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.820
We're mankind.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.750
And we're going to
force our way into it.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.900
And that's not good.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.380
That's when we run
into a problem.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.450
So that's called Integrated
Multi-Trophic Aquaculture,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.550
IMTA.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.050
All right?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.450
So, like, YMCA?

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.830
(SINGING) I-M-T-A!

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.440
You got it?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.000
All right.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.930
I gotta look silly, but
now you'll remember.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.140
So what I'm doing here is I'm
just cutting up some shallots.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.639
Big deal.

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:06.040
So this is how you cut shallots.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.030
So integrated multi-trophic
aquaculture-- back

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.020
to the subject-- is,
to me, probably one

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:17.220
of the most exciting
prospects of feeding

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.251
the planet, as we grow from
seven billion to nine billion.

00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:20.750
Right?

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.205
We're already having
problems feeding the planet

00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:22.996
with seven billion.

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:26.380
How the heck are we going to do
it when we have nine billion?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.590
Not going to be such an
easy thing, if we don't

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.066
change the way we're thinking.

00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:33.440
And that's why we're having
this discussion, right today.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.810
Because that will
change the world.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.760
That will educate the
planet, and that will help.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.230
And how do we do it
in a big-type way?

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.700
Well, let's think,
for instance--

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.780
where and what company
might be crucial in getting

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:54.570
that message out-- adopting
and putting it into play?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.600
Compass.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.750
Bon Appetit.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.470
The companies that are
helping to drive what's

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.030
going on in large
campuses such as Google,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.790
and other large campuses that
are like-minded, in the world.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.040
Awesome.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.790
But it's not just enough for you
to walk up, get lunch, and walk

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.470
away.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.321
You need to connect with
it a little bit more.

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:14.820
You know?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.278
It's not just about
deliciousness--

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:18.700
and I hope it is a lot to
do with just deliciousness--

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.830
but it's not just that.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.330
Right.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.740
So we got shallots.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.380
We got garlic.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.960
Basic tomato sauce.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.460
You know?

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.560
This is not--

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.310
The thing I like about
this tomato sauce--

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.270
it's not one of
those sauces that

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.250
has to cook for hours
and hours and hours,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.520
in order for it to be good.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.978
So we put a little
bit of olive oil

00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:37.265
in the bottom of a saucepan.

00:19:37.265 --> 00:19:37.890
"A little bit."

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.660
A lot of bit.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.960
And then we add some shallots.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.170
I'm still trying to learn
induction a la Google.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.691
Induction is just a type of
cooking that's not flame.

00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:54.190
Right?

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.375
It's magnetic, actually,
which is very, very cool.

00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:58.000
You have to have the
right metal on it,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.802
in order for it to connect.

00:19:59.802 --> 00:20:01.760
So I'm just going to make
a little bit of that.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.781
Shallots and garlic.

00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:04.530
I'm going to put them
in at the same time.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.180
Let them sweat.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.340
Just cook slowly,
without browning.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.736
So that's what's
happening there right now.

00:20:13.736 --> 00:20:16.360
And we're going to introduce our
spice blend that we just made,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.160
with four Cs and one F.
And this is a-- well,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.720
the sauce calls for harissa.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.410
Harissa is a chili
paste blend that's

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.140
usually used in Moroccan food.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.030
It's used in couscous,
very, very often.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.330
Couscous is, you know-- the
couscous and steamed lamb

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.127
and vegetables, and
all sorts of stuff.

00:20:37.127 --> 00:20:38.210
Can be a little bit bland.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.620
But then, once you add a
little bit of this, bam!

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.440
It's like sriracha.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.890
It is, basically-- that's
what this is, actually.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.950
This is sriracha, because
we don't have harissa.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.760
So sriracha is the
harissa of yesterday.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.780
It's the cool harissa today.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.601
So that's what
we're working with.

00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:55.100
All right.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.605
So how are we doing on time?

00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:58.105
Ooh!

00:20:58.105 --> 00:20:58.750
Boy!

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.710
That was quick!

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.210
All right.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.550
I'm going to start preheating a
pan over on this side, as well.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.500
Because this is what we're
going to saute our trout in.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.512
And I need to get to
the trout in second.

00:21:11.512 --> 00:21:13.220
So I might do a couple
of things at once.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.334
I'm going to try
to kick up the heat

00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:16.500
on the lentils a little bit.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.030
And just like I
thought, we're probably

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.280
not going to have enough time.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.140
But that comes to a simmer, then
lower down to just a lazy boil.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.260
Blub, blub blub.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:25.770
All right?

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.110
Test it in about 15 minutes.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.720
You take a little bit out, put
it on your table and squish it,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.540
bite it.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.250
If it still seems really,
really firm in the middle,

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.375
give it another five minutes,
and then you salt it.

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:35.930
Done.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.350
Drain it, lay it out on a
pan to cool off-- just steam.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.729
And then you end up with--
you end up with this.

00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:44.270
This is lentils that
have been cooked

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.792
in water for about 20 minutes.

00:21:45.792 --> 00:21:48.250
And they're just-- you don't
want them to be falling apart,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.430
because you're going
to reheat them.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.804
And I'll show you
how we do that.

00:21:50.804 --> 00:21:51.410
OK.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.020
Shallots and garlic have been
sweating for a few minutes.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.890
I'm going to add
some of the harissa.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.010
This is where you figure out--
or sriracha-- how much-- how

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.660
spicy do you want it to be?

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.880
Eh-- I want it to
have a good kick,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.820
because that's what
I'm feeling today.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.930
You don't want it so hot?

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.221
You put a little less in there.

00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.480
It's not the end of the world.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.825
That's got a little
bit of, um-- I mean,

00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:14.700
you can feel the heat
coming up in your face.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.890
That's basically a
chili paste, all right?

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.727
Then I want it to have
that Moroccan flavor.

00:22:19.727 --> 00:22:22.060
Well, I just happen to have
this little spice mix I just

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.790
put together a few minutes ago.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.840
So a good, good,
good pinch of that.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.090
Let that go in and mix in
with your sauteing hot sauce,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.420
shallots, and garlic.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.950
Then we're going to
add some tomatoes.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.132
And a little bit of vinegar.

00:22:36.132 --> 00:22:38.090
Vinegar being the acidity
that I want in there,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.910
I want to-- there's
some acidity in tomato.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.868
There's also sweetness
and a little bitterness.

00:22:41.868 --> 00:22:44.030
Which is great, because
that's perfect for creating

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.430
a balance on your palate.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.450
But you want to add a little
bit extra of the acidity.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.870
So I add some red wine vinegar.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.390
Right?

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.510
There we go.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.174
We're going to bring that
up to a little higher heat.

00:22:59.174 --> 00:23:00.840
Reduce it just a sec
and give everything

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.450
a chance to kind of come
together in the pan.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.280
And then I'm going
to add some tomatoes.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.321
SHEILA BOWMAN: And we're
going to take questions.

00:23:07.321 --> 00:23:09.310
So if anyone has a
question, let us know.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.530
But we're also going to
do questions at the end.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.440
But I think a lot's
going on right now.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.235
So does anyone have a question?

00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:19.130
A burning, sriracha-style
question, right now?

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.362
Or are we all good?

00:23:20.362 --> 00:23:22.320
AUDIENCE: Tomatoes that
are crushed from a can?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.986
RICK MOONEN: These
are crushed tomatoes.

00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:27.240
I-- personally, I try to stay
away from canned anything,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.850
nowadays.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.130
Canned is not good.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:29.930
Alzheimer's.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.780
All kinds of stuff.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.290
You know?

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.940
And I believe that the stuff
in boxes that you get, now--

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.507
Pomi-- P-O-M-I-- it's a brand.

00:23:36.507 --> 00:23:37.840
I'm not-- I don't work for Pomi.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.700
It's not-- I'm not
a sponsor of it.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.150
It's not a sponsor of me.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.900
But I just find that
to maybe be the best.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.190
You get Pomi in
those little boxes.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.670
You know, the strained
tomatoes, the crushed tomatoes.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.300
This, I would usually
use just crushed tomatoes

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.120
of the Pomi brand.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:52.620
OK.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.640
So now we've got a little
simmer going on the lentils,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.074
so I'm going to turn
it down a little,

00:23:58.074 --> 00:23:59.490
because I just
want it to be lazy.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.360
Just hang out.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.860
Just, like, floating
down the river,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.490
drinking a beer,
on an inner tube.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.430
All right?

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.920
Over here, I'm
preheating a pan to saute

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.382
the-- I should preheat
this pan, as well,

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.090
because I'm going to
end up with no time.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.630
I think I'm really getting
this down to a science, now,

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.900
this-- uh-- not really.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.400
SHEILA BOWMAN:
Turning the stove on?

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.110
RICK MOONEN: Just as
soon as I said that--

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.070
AUDIENCE: With the
spices, do you just

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.520
wait until they start to
smell a little fragrant--

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:27.880
RICK MOONEN: Yeah.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.460
AUDIENCE: --and
then they're ready?

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.180
RICK MOONEN: Just,
like, lightly toasted.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.350
You don't want to brown
them or blacken them.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.490
That's why I do it
on a low temperature.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.470
I like doing it in cast iron,
because it has a tendency

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.520
to be more even heated.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.020
OK.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, I had a
question on the spices.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:43.969
RICK MOONEN: Yes.

00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:45.551
AUDIENCE: So are you
going to add some

00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:46.670
more later, to freshen up?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.050
Because sometimes you--
in some cooking, you--

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.350
RICK MOONEN: I'm sorry.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.960
What was that?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.970
AUDIENCE: I said
sometimes in cooking,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.600
you freshen up, near the end.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.570
Will you be doing that?

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.310
RICK MOONEN: Absolutely.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.070
You're going to taste this.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.486
You're going to
go, you know what?

00:24:56.486 --> 00:25:00.756
I don't taste the spices as much
as I would like to. [WHISTLE]

00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:02.050
[WHISTLE]

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.284
See, recipes are guidelines.

00:25:05.284 --> 00:25:06.950
Your palate is different
than my palate.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:07.660
So is yours.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.660
So is yours.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.550
You know, I like spicier
food, perhaps, than you do.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.360
Add some more.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.580
Add some more heat.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.560
You know, you just need
the building blocks

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.120
to make the flavors happen.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.690
And it's really just suggestions
according to what I think.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.060
But at the end of the day,
it's really up to you.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.870
So, yeah, you do refresh.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.580
This is a piece of
aquaculture-farm-raised brook

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.840
trout from Idaho.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840
Very nice.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.790
Right?

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.810
You get rainbow trout.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.610
It's got a pinker hue to it.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.860
They all have a decent
amount of omega-3s.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.660
They're all considered
very sustainable--

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.860
some more so than others.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.450
There's some trout available
that is completely vegetarian.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.100
Oh, that's good, right?

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.680
I don't think that trout can
really be bad, because what

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.140
does trout eat, naturally?

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:56.670
Bugs.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.280
Worms.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.040
You know, I don't
think that that's

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.470
becoming an endangered
species, at the moment.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.300
So trout is great.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.080
And it's affordable.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.000
You know, I think it's
undervalued, really,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.290
for what it is.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.730
But it's what's
for dinner today.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.800
So I'm going to dry the skin
side a little bit by placing it

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.650
down on a paper towel.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.620
And I'm going to dry it
up on top a little bit.

00:26:25.302 --> 00:26:27.490
It should have really
no smell to it at all,

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.080
because it's a freshwater fish.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.620
All right?

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.820
Then I'm going to
season it with salt.

00:26:35.122 --> 00:26:37.080
I mean, you can season
it a little bit earlier.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.520
If you season something
that's this kind

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.952
of a high-moisture-content
protein-- such as almost

00:26:43.952 --> 00:26:45.410
any kind of fish--
with salt, ahead

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.826
of time, what's
going to happen is

00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:49.670
the salt is going to start
to draw out the moisture.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.510
Not making it dry, but
concentrating its flavor,

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.270
firming up the flesh.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.360
The fat doesn't come out,
just the water content does.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.350
So I like to season
things maybe a little

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.462
bit ahead, which is almost
like a precure to the fish.

00:27:06.462 --> 00:27:08.920
So now I'm going to put some
of the Moroccan spices on this

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.690
as well.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.040
That's going to carry the
Moroccan flavor, mostly.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.990
But just a little bit
on the outside of here.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.660
Why not?

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.770
All right.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.670
I'm going to trim the
tail just a touch.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.280
And that gets used, in
a kitchen situation,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.207
in all kinds of stuff.

00:27:27.207 --> 00:27:28.290
That goes in your chowder.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.415
That goes in your cioppino.

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:31.710
That goes in a
multitude of pastas,

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.850
or whatever else that
you might want to have.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.350
OK.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.550
The lentils are still
doing their lazy thing.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:42.430
I've got my pan
pretty decent heat.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.930
I want to get it
really hot, though.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.640
So while that's
happening, I'm going

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.050
to start heating up my lentils.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.633
So, all right.

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:52.140
Let's pretend these lentils
are now 20 minutes in.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.477
Take them, put them
in a colander, right?

00:27:55.477 --> 00:27:57.810
I would have lightly salted
them just before doing that.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.460
I would have a pinch of salt
in that pan, then strain them.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.380
Put them out onto a pan
like this to cool off.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.995
I'm just showing this so that
you kind of have a visual.

00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:08.510
You know, shake them around.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.290
And just leave them to cool off.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:11.790
All right?

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.920
And then that turns into this.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.220
Now, how am I going to,
um-- this tomato sauce

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.200
is pretty close.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.740
This tomato-- the Pomi tomato
has a lot more juice in it.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.260
And that's kind of dry to me.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:23.840
Right?

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.090
So I'm just going to
add a little water.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.350
And I'm going to
pulse it, in a second,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.070
with my little handheld blender.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.360
That's heating up.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.140
That's really hot.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:36.960
That's good.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.460
All right.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:44.330
So a slick of oil into the
pan, to keep it from sticking.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.520
Skin side down, because I'm
going to serve the skin.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.270
I want the skin.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.925
The skin gets crispy.

00:28:47.925 --> 00:28:48.424
[SIZZLE]

00:28:48.424 --> 00:28:51.010
Hear that noise?

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.011
That's-- that's like.

00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:52.510
I like.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.112
I likee.

00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:54.070
That's making me happy.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.040
And you see,
immediately, I do that?

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.160
That's to make sure
it's not sticking.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.660
OK?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.451
We're not sticking.

00:28:59.451 --> 00:28:59.951
Yay!

00:28:59.951 --> 00:29:01.992
Because that's a pain in
the neck when it sticks.

00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:04.660
If it sticks, you kind
of leave it for a minute.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.230
Let it form a crust.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.820
Right?

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.736
You can even-- if the
fish is so fresh that it

00:29:08.736 --> 00:29:11.520
starts to curl up, stop it.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.540
Just come down on it, a
little bit, with a spatula,

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.570
to kind of fuse the skin
with the hot surface.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.070
All right?

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.950
That fish is going
to cook, well, I'd

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.047
say 90% of the way
on the skin side.

00:29:24.047 --> 00:29:26.380
I'll flip it over, for a
second, and just call it a day.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.260
While that's cooking, I'm
going to puree my tomato

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.135
sauce by just--

00:29:35.135 --> 00:29:37.260
SHEILA BOWMAN: So, Rick,
shall we talk a little bit

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.310
about fish diversity?

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.310
How many people have
had trout before?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.169
Excellent!

00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:43.960
Really outstanding.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.210
Have you had it here at work,
or have you mostly-- has

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.960
anyone cooked it at home?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.520
Really good.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.686
I think one of things that's
kind of fun about trout

00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:52.350
is you can also
do it whole fish.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.020
Kind of stuff it, and that
whole fish preparation.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.170
Super easy, super flavorful.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.620
It's kind of another new
trend in the way people

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.500
are looking at fish.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.110
But lots of people are
not familiar with trout.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.430
So what other fish
are you guys eating?

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.670
What kind of diversity
is in your diet?

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.380
And Rick, I think
one of the things

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.220
we know is that salmon, shrimp,
and tuna are our top three

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.530
seafoods in this country.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.820
And it's like 80% of the fish
we eat are those three fish.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.840
So one of the things
that we have to know,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.491
when it comes to
sustainability, is

00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:27.490
we've got to diversify
our diet, because there's

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.910
no way seven billion people can
live on three species of fish

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:31.865
around the world.

00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:34.430
So trout's a great add.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.320
Crab's a great add.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.600
We have a new
group of fisheries,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.060
here on the Pacific
coast, which is

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.720
all of our rockfish,
petrale sole, sand dabs.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.940
Those are all moved onto
our yellow and green list

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.760
at Seafood Watch.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.370
They're great choices.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.200
So I think it's kind of
the era of weird fish.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.420
Sometimes people are calling
it "trash fish"-- fish

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.790
that didn't have a
lot of financial value

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.290
to fishermen, even two,
three, four years ago.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.780
But nowadays, chefs like
Rick are picking them up,

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.410
making them into, like,
real shining-star dishes.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.640
And you start to
see different fish

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.889
on menus than just kind
of the old standards.

00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:14.680
RICK MOONEN: Step
outside your comfort zone

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.240
is what Sheila's saying.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.800
You know, generally
speaking, I think

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.250
people eat mostly about three or
four different species of fish,

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:20.833
and that's it.

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:23.130
Eat something that you
haven't eaten before.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.820
Give a break to that species.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.600
We love single species to death.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.320
We just consume them
until they're problematic.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.210
When there's so many other
things that are available.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:40.880
Chefs are dying to work with a
more diverse pantry or kitchen

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.320
or refrigerator--
ocean products.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:44.820
All right.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.620
Here, this is just water.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.000
Put a pinch of salt in there.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.170
I'm going to shake some butter
into there until it emulsifies.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.572
And then I'm going to
reheat my lentils in there.

00:31:54.572 --> 00:31:56.280
And then we're pretty
much ready to rock.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.670
What I'm going to
need is some cilantro,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.050
if you guys got some cilantro
for garnish, in a second.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.350
So you'll notice, as
you're cooking, the sides.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.960
Look at the sides while
something's cooking.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.385
You see the bubbles
happening, there?

00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.620
That means that
everything's touching

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.784
the surface of the pan.

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:13.200
If there's no
bubbles on one side,

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.900
it's probably because of it
kind of humped up or something.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.580
So I see that it's
starting to brown.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.460
I see that the sides of it
are starting to turn whiter.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.506
Right?

00:32:23.506 --> 00:32:24.880
How do I know if
fish is cooking?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.550
How do I know?

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.370
Oh, I'm so scared!

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.660
It's so expensive
to cook so quick.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.310
It's going to get dry.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.810
Aaiigh!

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.370
No.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.310
Just look at it.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.900
You've cooked an egg.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.470
You've popped an egg into a pan.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.880
You've seen the egg white
go from clear to white.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.260
That's what happens
with protein.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.820
So that's turning
from clear-- which

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.910
is kind of the middle,
still-- to white.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.930
So that fish is just about
ready to rock and roll.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.230
I'm just going to flip it over.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.730
Right?

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.970
I've got a nice
little light brown.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.920
I'm going to turn it off and
just let the heat of the pan

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.810
carry it the rest
of the way through.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.965
I am not worried at all that
that fish is going to overcook.

00:32:58.965 --> 00:32:59.877
Well, a little bit.

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:00.460
But not a lot.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.640
OK.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.760
So I'm going to bring
this up front here.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.090
I'm going to crank this
up and turn that off.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:07.600
All right.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.058
Now I'm going to
just start shaking

00:33:09.058 --> 00:33:10.142
some butter into this pan.

00:33:10.142 --> 00:33:10.641
Right?

00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:12.930
This is called a "beurre
monte," or "mounted butter."

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:18.770
You just kind of-- you can
use a whisk, if you want.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.260
Shake the pan.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.230
Just making a real
simple emulsified butter.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.690
I want more.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.930
One more butter.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.880
Butter's good.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.540
Butter's not bad for you.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.120
It's not.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.280
Just ask Julia Child.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.760
Oh, she's dead.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.990
Sorry.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.120
Sorry, Julia!

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.620
OK.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.760
I can hear that fish cooking.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.551
It's talking to me.

00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:48.080
It wants to come out of the pan.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.934
OK, yes, I hear you.

00:33:50.934 --> 00:33:52.600
And the funny thing
about it is, as soon

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.683
as you flip over the fish,
the skin is not crispy.

00:33:54.683 --> 00:33:59.580
But once it gets a chance to
sit for a minute, I can hear it.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.840
It's kind of-- tick, tick,
tick, tick!-- crispy skin.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.940
I like crispy skin.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.070
Delicious.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.810
Full of nutrition.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.389
Mostly the omega-3 fatty acids
that are so good for our brain,

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.020
our body-- every
function of your body--

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.310
is located between the
skin and the flesh.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.690
So it's a little, thin layer,
there, generally speaking.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.629
So whenever possible,
whenever you're cool with it,

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:22.219
eat the skin.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:23.120
Or consume the skin.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.750
So I'm adding the lentils
to this beurre monte--

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.164
this emulsified butter.

00:34:30.825 --> 00:34:32.969
It's basically just
reheating them.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:34.009
SHEILA BOWMAN: And sometimes
at the grocery store,

00:34:34.009 --> 00:34:36.340
you have to ask for fish
that still has the skin on.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.927
We're very much
into white fillets.

00:34:38.927 --> 00:34:41.510
But I know a lot of people are
starting to ask for that, Rick,

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.940
because it's kind of fun
to cook and good flavor.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.330
RICK MOONEN: I'm 100%-- I've
been eating skin on fish

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:48.830
forever.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.690
But not everybody-- I find
that plates come back,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.690
and the skin's been pulled
off nicely and placed

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:54.739
onto the side.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.130
So I'm encouraging you to
step outside your comfort

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.930
zone, maybe a little bit.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.240
So I'm putting down
this spicy, fiery

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.500
hot-- we didn't do something
that's real important.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.150
Obviously tomato.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.500
It's got some good heat.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.830
Great acidity.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.700
Level of Moroccan spices?

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.070
You know, what the heck?

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.471
I'm feeling a little bit more.

00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:21.970
You know?

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.060
Why not?

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.680
I really want to
prove a point, here.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.430
I want you to
taste those spices.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.679
So put a little bit more.

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:30.220
Push it down the
middle of the plate.

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.430
This could be a little smoother.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.630
Doesn't matter.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.260
You know why?

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.259
You just turn to people
and go, "That's rustic."

00:35:38.259 --> 00:35:40.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.770
Right?

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:45.130
And now we get our lentils.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.550
Place them down the center.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:47.490
Nice and creamy.

00:35:52.529 --> 00:35:54.820
SHEILA BOWMAN: So I know
we're in the wrapping-up mode.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.200
We're going to do a few
questions here at the end.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.910
I know that the tastes are
coming along in the area

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.470
directly behind us.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.570
Rick has a book.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.230
Is this recipe in the book?

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.330
Or something like it?

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.787
RICK MOONEN: Um-- I think so.

00:36:08.787 --> 00:36:09.870
Pretty sure it's in there.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:10.245 --> 00:36:11.078
SHEILA BOWMAN: Yeah.

00:36:11.078 --> 00:36:11.939
We think so.

00:36:11.939 --> 00:36:12.730
RICK MOONEN: It is.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.360
SHEILA BOWMAN: So
books will be on sale--

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.443
RICK MOONEN: If it's not,
here's my business card.

00:36:16.443 --> 00:36:18.430
I'll be glad to send you
a copy of the recipe,

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:19.950
if it's not available today.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.200
And then I put a little
cilantro on top, as a garnish,

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.740
just to give it a little
bit of green color.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.800
And the cilantro
works really well.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.600
Cilantro has a cooling
effect on your palate.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.850
Whenever you see something
spicy such as guacamole, salsa,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.870
all that-- that's the reason
cilantro works so well.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.480
And you know what?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.900
It's cilantro two ways, if
you really think about it.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.615
Because in the
Moroccan spice mix

00:36:45.615 --> 00:36:49.310
is coriander, which is the
seed that made the cilantro

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.630
in the first place.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.877
So there you have a
super simple dish.

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.460
A discussion, maybe, of a little
bit of a better understanding

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.817
about aquaculture.

00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:58.400
"You know, I went
into that room today

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.090
thinking aquaculture was bad."

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.070
It's not as bad
as it used to be.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.220
There are people that
are doing a great job.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.250
There's people that are
doing a much better job.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:10.030
And there's some people that
are still doing an OK job.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:14.290
So what I try to do to
celebrate the great,

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.455
recognize the better,
encouraging them to be great,

00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:19.330
and hoping that the guys
that aren't doing it

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.705
so well either go
out of business

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:22.250
or figure out and
go back on board.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.940
And then we have
widespread solutions

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.960
that are pushing us
in the right direction

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.020
to a more sustainable world.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.900
We're not eradicating species.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.300
We're closer to our food.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.140
We have a better understanding.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.980
I mean, the discussion
can go on forever.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.200
I mean, it's--

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.920
And when it's
wild, see-- there's

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.190
overfishing, because
that's technology's ability

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.150
to out-fish a species.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.660
They can't keep
up with the hunt.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.804
There's byproducts-- the
by-catch that comes up.

00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:51.220
When they're going after one
targeted species in the wild,

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.900
other stuff comes up with
it that we're not really

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.420
targeting.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.822
So by the time you filter
out everything you wanted,

00:37:57.822 --> 00:37:59.030
those fish are dead or dying.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.529
They get pushed
back into the ocean.

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:01.222
What a waste.

00:38:01.222 --> 00:38:02.430
What a waste of good protein.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.380
There's aquaculture, the effect
that it has on the environment,

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.510
and the effect that it
has on the fish itself.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.870
The fish itself.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:09.940
Antibiotics.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.850
Chemicals.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.460
You know, all the
things that need

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.380
to be added in order to keep it
a healthy and viable investment

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.750
for an aquaculture owner.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.980
But there's also
the environment.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.870
The byproduct.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:21.480
The effluent.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.150
The escapes.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.057
The fish around it.

00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:25.640
All the other things that need
to be taken into consideration.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.639
You think, like, really?

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:30.180
Aren't we exhausting this to--
we're beating a dead horse.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.400
Does it really have that
much of an effect on a world

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.390
that two thirds of it
plus is covered in water?

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.310
Yes, it is.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.470
Yes, it does.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.780
It has a major effect.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.590
We've treated our oceans as our
receptacle for way too long,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.710
expecting perfect food
to come out of it.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.399
Because you can't just
dump all of the junk

00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:49.690
that you don't want to deal
with on land into the ocean

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.970
and think that it's going
to come out pristine.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.230
So all back, circle
around, put your toys away

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.390
at the end of the night.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.656
Put them back in the box.

00:38:57.656 --> 00:38:58.780
Put them back on the shelf.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.800
Next day, you take them down.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.740
They're perfect again.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.010
And you can enjoy
great-tasting food.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.810
All right?

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.851
SHEILA BOWMAN: So Rick,
how do you choose seafood

00:39:05.851 --> 00:39:07.669
that you serve and eat?

00:39:07.669 --> 00:39:09.210
RICK MOONEN: How do
I choose seafood?

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.950
I use Seafood Watch,
generally speaking,

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.460
as my-- I-- here we go.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.080
Look at this.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.009
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.800
SHEILA BOWMAN: That
was a leading question.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.383
RICK MOONEN: I had
a feeling that was.

00:39:17.383 --> 00:39:18.897
No, this is the beauty of it.

00:39:18.897 --> 00:39:20.730
Seafood Watch-- there's
these little cards--

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.450
and outside there's a display.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.810
Please come out and pick one up.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:24.726
Put it in your wallet.

00:39:24.726 --> 00:39:25.440
Talk about it.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.440
It's super simple.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.060
Seafood Watch.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.840
What they do is they have
three categories-- red, orange,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.590
and green.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.900
Green means "best
choice; go for it."

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.650
And guess who's done all
the research on overfishing,

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:41.580
habitat destruction, byproduct--
I mean, by-catch, and all that?

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.470
Monterey Bay has.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.860
Because they've got
an incredible network

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.190
of connections to scientists,
to environmentalists,

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.430
to government
organizations, both non-

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.960
and government organizations.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.850
All of it gets boiled down
to a red, green, and yellow.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.995
So, green-- you can't get
green, but ask for it.

00:39:59.995 --> 00:40:02.120
Yellow's OK, but there's
still some issues with it.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.410
But it's a better
choice than the red.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.310
The red means
[BUZZER SOUND] "avoid.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.330
Avoid, for now."

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.930
What do you mean "for now?"

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.100
That's why you have an app.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.910
Because at any given
moment, it could change.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:13.420
Tomorrow.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.350
So you just push
in on-- you search

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.660
for "seafood" or "sushi."

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660
You push on that.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.750
You put in your species.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.270
I punch in "trout."
(MUMBLING) T-R-O-U-T.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.590
It's going to tell me
"Don't serve it at Google."

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.090
No.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:26.589
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:29.570
It's going to say "best
choice." "Best choice."

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.020
Basically, trout is
a pretty-- doesn't

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.224
leave a heavy footprint.

00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:33.890
It's affordable.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.707
It's delicious.

00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:36.790
You're about to have a
little bit of a taste of it

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.420
as soon as we're
finished over here.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.900
But while that's happening,
download Seafood Watch.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.150
It's a free app.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.240
Why not?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.980
You know?

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.605
It's one more cool
thing on your phone,

00:40:46.605 --> 00:40:48.260
as you go down the
50 pages of stuff

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.200
you got on there, probably.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:49.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.891
But, you know, I've been
talking about this for decades.

00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:56.890
In the beginning, it
certainly wasn't very cool.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.950
People were, like,
oh, Moonen, really?

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:58.560
What the hell, now?

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.140
You're going to make me take
something else off of my menu?

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.080
You're gonna--

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.650
It's not that complicated.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.290
It doesn't need to
be that complicated.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:06.030
You know, when you go
into a gas station,

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.970
you're sort of picky
about your octane level,

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:09.140
because you don't want
to mess up your motor.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.770
You know, you pick
the right thing.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.530
Pick the right thing here.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.120
You know?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.510
And food is what
connects us all.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.110
It's the common language
of the entire world.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.860
No matter where I go, I
have a conversation going.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.517
I'm in Greece.

00:41:22.517 --> 00:41:23.600
I'm talking about octopus.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.760
How do you cook octopus?

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.218
Oh, well-- Next
thing you know, you

00:41:26.218 --> 00:41:28.800
get a 20-minute conversation
going on with a cab driver.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.100
So it's really what
makes us who we are.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.560
And it's-- I've seen, over my
35-plus-year career, thus far,

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.970
so many changes-- so
many positive changes.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:46.460
But we're at a critical
state as we grow as a planet.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.810
And too many generations
have distanced themselves

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.669
from-- where's the
food coming from?

00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:55.710
Is it really good for me?

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.960
Is it good for my family?

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.200
Is it going to make
me feel better?

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.510
Does it taste good?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.010
All right?

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.020
And I'm a proponent of
all of those things.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.760
For some reason,
early on in my career,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.470
it was instilled within me.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.890
Download the app.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.100
Become a know-it-all.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.230
Ask questions.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.970
Please ask questions.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.380
When you stand up to that
fish counter, I guarantee,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.350
if you have your app
open, you already

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.510
know more than maybe the
guy behind the counter.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.121
Hey-- where's it from?

00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:21.620
You know?

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.820
And then you'll start
to learn a little bit

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.570
about other acronyms of life.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.350
There's millions of
them in this world.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.470
They'll drive you crazy.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.960
MSC is one good one--
Marine Stewardship Council.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.010
Pretty much, if it has
an MSC label on it,

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.630
it had to go through this
incredibly rigorous, almost

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.900
torturous selection process
to get them to be approved.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.560
So that's usually a pretty
sound, sustainable choice,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.260
when something has MSC on it.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.537
But if you look for the green,
you're doing an amazing job.

00:42:48.537 --> 00:42:50.870
You go for yellow, no one's
going to really yell at you,

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:52.430
but keep trying for the green.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.190
Does that answer your question?

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.080
SHEILA BOWMAN: That
was a great answer.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.580
RICK MOONEN: What a lead-up.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.220
What a lead-up.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.845
AUDIENCE: We have a
question over here,

00:42:57.845 --> 00:42:59.850
so if you want to help me--

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.800
AUDIENCE: I think it
was the "LA Times" had

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.630
an article about how mislabeled
fish was in restaurants.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.900
When they did the DNA
testing, it was often wrong.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.530
Do you think that
was-- part of the chef?

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.820
Part of the suppliers?

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.881
RICK MOONEN: Well, it's
a combination of both.

00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:17.630
And it's a great
question, because I'm not

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.580
going to shirk my
responsibilities

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.285
and say as chefs,
it's not our job.

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:21.640
It's the purveyors' job.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.590
It is our job.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.480
It's our job to know.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.320
It's our job to ask.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.410
It's our job to doubt.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.010
And especially because of that.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.280
Great point, actually.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.220
Most fish are mislabeled.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.679
Why?

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:34.095
The darned stuff's
pretty darned--

00:43:34.095 --> 00:43:35.940
it's pretty perishable.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.566
It's the most
perishable inventory

00:43:37.566 --> 00:43:39.690
you're going to ever try
to deal with in your life.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.310
I decided, why not?

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.276
I'll deal with the
hardest-to-keep products.

00:43:43.276 --> 00:43:44.400
And it's like a hot potato.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.090
You've got to get rid of it.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.410
Otherwise, it's not
going to be as good.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.201
And I'll do it in the
desert, in the middle

00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:49.857
of Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:51.690
And talk about
sustainability, as a message.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.250
Why not?

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.680
I like the challenge.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.570
So yeah.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.617
If I'm a purveyor,
and I've got the phone

00:43:58.617 --> 00:44:00.450
call from Rick Moonen
going, "Listen, buddy,

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.330
I need swordfish.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.990
But I need harpooned
swordfish, because it's

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.940
the most sustainable method
of going after swordfish."

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.950
And the guy's going to
go "How much do you need?

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.560
40 pounds!

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.560
Put a hole in that fish.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.570
Make it look like it was a
swordfish that got harpooned.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.778
Yeah, we got harpooned fish!"

00:44:16.778 --> 00:44:18.336
They'll sell it to
you all day long.

00:44:18.336 --> 00:44:19.710
You have to trust
your purveyors.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.090
You have to trust your
sources, as a chef.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:25.950
As a consumer going
into a restaurant,

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:29.550
or a consumer going into a
marketplace, open up your app.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.560
Be a know-it-all.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.940
Please be a know-it-all.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.870
Be a pain in the neck.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.078
Mention my name, if you want.

00:44:34.078 --> 00:44:35.140
I don't care.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.570
Use me as the bad guy,
because it's not being bad.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.180
Because you're doing something
good for the environment

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:39.770
and yourself.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.160
So it's a win-win situation
when you ask questions.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.646
AUDIENCE: Are there any labels
to avoid or specifically

00:44:46.646 --> 00:44:48.640
look for when you're
in the grocery store?

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.920
RICK MOONEN: Labels to avoid.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.550
Hmm.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.150
Sheila?

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.050
Do you have an answer to that?

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.920
I don't want to say-- you know--
there's certain countries that

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.530
do--

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.970
SHEILA BOWMAN: Well, I think, to
answer your question, you know,

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.940
everyone's sustainable
out there today.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.650
Everyone.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.720
So you talk to a purveyor,
and he goes "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.810
It's sustainable trout."

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:13.115
So if you're getting that
line, it kind of is a line.

00:45:13.115 --> 00:45:15.060
And a lot of our chefs
are, like-- you know,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.080
these suppliers can be
like used-car salesmen.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.980
It's like-- yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.220
It's-- where did
you want it from?

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:21.720
Idaho?

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.570
Yeah.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.070
Yeah!

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.361
RICK MOONEN: That's the ticket!

00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:25.170
Sure!

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.830
SHEILA BOWMAN: So
I think what you're

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.700
sort of looking at
is, if anyone just

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.160
says "sustainable,"
I'm always like-- OK,

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.709
they should have
more behind that.

00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:34.500
They should be able to
say where it's from.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.210
How it was cut.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.920
What sustainable?

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.080
So I think the one I
would most worry about

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.420
is this, like, "yeah,
yeah, it's sustainable."

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.970
That's what I would worry about.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.810
If you don't have
anything to back it up,

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.220
then you're-- that's what
asking questions will do--

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.270
add that accountability.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.770
RICK MOONEN: Great
question, though.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.160
Really, there's
no easy solution.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.194
There's no easy answer.

00:45:55.194 --> 00:45:56.610
Hopefully, someday,
there will be.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.545
I doubt it.

00:45:57.545 --> 00:45:58.920
You're just going
to have to know

00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.680
where your food comes from.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.020
You're going to have to have
a little bit more knowledge.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.990
And it's fun.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.120
Make it fun.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.500
Don't make it a drudgery.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.290
Yes.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:05.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you, chef.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.730
So what are some of your
favorites from the green list

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.670
that you think that maybe
we haven't cooked with,

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.550
or we haven't tried, that you
would want to recommend to us?

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.402
RICK MOONEN: Do you
have a green list handy?

00:46:13.402 --> 00:46:14.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.300
No, but he's asking
for my favorites.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.830
I love lower-- if you eat lower
on the food chain-- generally

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.810
speaking, smaller fish-- you're
doing yourself a world of good.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.390
Because they're fast-growing.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.020
They don't have any
health concerns or issues.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.615
PCBs, Methylmercury--

00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:33.740
SHEILA BOWMAN: Arctic char.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.781
RICK MOONEN: Arctic char.

00:46:34.781 --> 00:46:35.780
I love Arctic char.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.179
Arctic char is, categorically,
in the trout and salmon family.

00:46:40.179 --> 00:46:42.220
So trout and salmon are
really-- they're cousins.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.284
So it's all good stuff.

00:46:43.284 --> 00:46:44.450
SHEILA BOWMAN: Striped bass?

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.460
RICK MOONEN: Striped
bass from the East Coast.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.850
We're on the West
Coast, so you're not

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.830
going to see a lot of that.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:49.480
SHEILA BOWMAN: Sturgeon?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.230
RICK MOONEN: Wait!

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.125
But striped bass, also
known as rockfish--

00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:53.110
SHEILA BOWMAN: On
the East Coast.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.485
RICK MOONEN: --on
the East Coast.

00:46:54.485 --> 00:46:56.950
Rockfish on the West
Coast suddenly--

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:02.680
not suddenly, but recently--
became a sustainable category.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.360
Holy smokes.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.040
That opened up, for me, as
a chef, a list of choices

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.980
of 39 different rockfish.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.120
Of 24 different flat fish.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:11.830
Ling cod.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:12.330
Dabs.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:12.930
Sand dabs.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.888
All these things you
probably haven't heard of.

00:47:14.888 --> 00:47:16.900
Eat something you
haven't heard of!

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.480
In a credible environment.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.500
In here, they're
doing a great job.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.866
Well, I mean, you know, you
don't go for bargain sushi

00:47:22.866 --> 00:47:24.740
and then get something
that you've never had,

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.510
because that might
be a little scary.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.340
But you definitely want to take
a step outside your comfort

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.956
zone and get some flavor.

00:47:30.956 --> 00:47:32.080
So anyway, how's the trout?

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.160
You're getting a
chance to taste it.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.060
Is it-- did these
guys do a good job?

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.620
Chefs?

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.400
Good job.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.340
Thank you.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.580
They're thrilled.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.310
Did that answer your question?

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.000
OK, good.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.860
SHEILA BOWMAN: Are we wrapping?

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.140
RICK MOONEN: Yeah.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.350
I think we're going
to wrap it up.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.900
Guys, I have
business cards here.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.590
I highly recommend you take
one-- or encourage you to.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.600
You come to Las Vegas,
come and see me.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.690
You have any
questions, email me.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:57.600
If I don't have the answer, I'll
just send it to Sheila, anyway.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.450
No, but--

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:59.640
SHEILA BOWMAN: Absolutely.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.473
And thank you so much,
Rick, for being here.

00:48:01.473 --> 00:48:04.060
I learn something every time
that I'm around this chef.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.270
So it's really exciting.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.740
RICK MOONEN: How to make a mess.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.980
SHEILA BOWMAN: Just can't thank
you enough for coming out here.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.902
Can't thank Google enough
for having us here.

00:48:10.902 --> 00:48:12.860
Again, I hope you'll come
down to the aquarium.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.360
Join us.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.390
We have some great
exhibits right now

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.160
about octopus and
different things.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.890
Your support brings
chefs like Rick

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.210
into the Google kitchen
and other kitchens.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.170
So we thank you.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.450
We really appreciate
all that you do.

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.260
So we're going to be
signing books and taking

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.200
photos and stuff.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.820
So the fun just goes on.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.607
So thank you all.

00:48:32.607 --> 00:48:33.690
RICK MOONEN: Thanks, guys.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.440
[APPLAUSE]
