00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, we can go back to the original problem--the thing we've been trying to solve this whole unit.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As you remember we have the sun's rays striking perpendicular to the earth here at Syene.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We've seen that these rays all came in parallel like what's around here and here in Alexandria

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which is north of Syene, the rays no longer strike the earth perpendicular to the surface of the earth.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They strike at this angle α.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We showed before that must be equal to this angle α as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And by comparing the full angular measure of the circle 360 degrees to this portion α, we will

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
define that if we knew d and we knew α, we can calculate the circumference of the earth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We got d by timing a camels distance from Syene to Alexandria. Now we just need to find α.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
To determine this angle α, let's imagine what it would be like to be standing here in Alexandria.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Well, if I were actually standing there, I can now say the earth is flat

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because I don't notice the curvature of the earth on a daily basis

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and I can imagine sticking some sort of pole into the ground.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And maybe I know the length of this pole.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now I know the sun's rays are coming in at a certain angle.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to draw the rays in red just to make it a little easier to see.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So here comes the sun's rays, you can tell they're being blocked by the pole in some  places.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So when the pole blocks the sun's rays, we get a shadow--here's the pole shadow.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And now you can see we're almost there. You can see the right triangle that's emerged.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We have the sun's ray that just barely missed the edge of the pole,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we have the shadow of the pole, and we have the pole itself forming a right triangle.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now from this drawing, you can actually see that the angle we called alpha.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If I imagine making a perpendicular line here perpendicular to the earth,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
this is the angle we called alpha.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There's no problem. That's also equal to this angle α and now we're almost there.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So here's our triangle with three sides--one, two, three, opposite, adjacent to α, and hypotenuse

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we just need to know what this angle is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now that we have a right triangle, we just need to consult the trigonometric table

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and we should be able to figure out what alpha is and what's the circumference of the earth is.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So we set up the experiment.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We have our vertical bar with its shadow and what Eratosthenes data may have looked like

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with the length of the bar would have been something around 1 meter

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and the length of the shadow about 0.126 meters which is 12.6 cm.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
He, of course, has access to his trigonometric tables and here's a portion of one such table.

00:02:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, can you put yourselves in Eratosthenes' shoes and tell me what is the value of alpha?
