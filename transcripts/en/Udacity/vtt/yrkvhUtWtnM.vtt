00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.546
I showed how three rotation matrices multiplied together gives a single new

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:09.525
matrix. Interestingly enough, this resulting matrix R is, in fact, a rotation

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.773
matrix itself. Any number of rotation matrices multiplied together always

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:17.976
results in another rotation matrix. This resulting rotation matrix will have a

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:22.597
single specific axis and rotation angle. I have two questions for you. First of

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:27.097
all, can you multiply a series of translations together and get a single

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:32.137
translation matrix? Second, can you multiply a series of scales together and get

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:37.279
a single scale matrix? For example, say you apply a number of scales in a row to

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:41.128
an object. If you multiply all these scale matrices together, do you get a

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.983
single scale matrix? Or do you get something else?
