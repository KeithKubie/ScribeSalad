00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.400
Ok so what the candidate did well,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.700
I think he when I asked about
the model view controller.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.350
He got into more details that I
was really expecting that that's

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.970
perfectly okay.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.150
But he did show that he understands
the basic principles of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.930
the what are the responsibilities of
the model, the view and the controller.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.830
So that's something
that he did quite well.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.990
Something that I liked a lot, is that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.690
he actually has he follows several
well known blogs or news letters.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.420
He is planning to go to a conference,
and most important of all,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.500
at least for me, is that he has his
own side project that he's working on.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.552
He's learning things that
are from a different field in iOS

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:50.940
developement development something
that is very specific to games that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.410
not everybody is interested.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.860
But he's looking to that and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.240
finding ways to apply to whatever
application he is writing right now.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.020
So that shows that he has
passion he's a total nerd,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.950
so that's certainly a plus, that's the
kind of person that we're looking for.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.070
What he couldn't prove well
when I asked about core data.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.210
I asked about NS managed object and he
talked about NS manage object context.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.720
Which is slightly different, so I'm
not sure if he understood my question.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.380
Or if it was a clever strategy
to talk about something else and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.650
hide that maybe you don't know that so
well.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.610
If it is the latter,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.330
I wouldn't worry too much about this,
it's a junior position,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.880
so I'm not expecting him to know
everything about iOS development.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.290
Maybe his knowledge of core
data is not as sound and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.840
solid as it should, but that's workable.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.080
That's something that you
can work on and you can fix.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.190
But I believe that whatever code he
brings to our code base, should work.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.080
It shouldn't break things and
it should be a useful contribution.
