DECLAN FARMER: Sled hockey
completely changed my life.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.120
Finding sled hockey for the
first time when I was 9

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.080
was amazing.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.870
I loved it from the first
time I got on the ice.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.230
I hope that our team playing
on the international stage

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.660
in Pyeongchang and
that being broadcast

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.650
all over the country --

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.950
I hope other kids and stuff
will see that and want

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.590
to be like us.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.700
My name is Declan Farmer.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.290
I'm Class of 2020.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.990
I study economics, and I'm on
the U.S. Paralympic Sled Hockey

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.460
Team.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.920
I was born as a double amputee.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.840
I've been using
prosthetics to walk ever

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.080
since I was 1 years old.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.060
I was always a competitive
kid, and I was really

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.040
just struggling playing
T-ball or soccer

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.480
with able-bodied kids.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.240
I really never got to
be competitive and be

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.680
one of the best out there.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.900
Sled hockey gave me
the chance to do that.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.850
My professors at
Princeton and advisers

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.540
have really worked
with me and allowed

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.880
me to miss the time I need, and
also everyone at the Princeton

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.300
hockey department who
has allowed me to skate

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.080
here and train here on my own.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.900
I really appreciate all
the sacrifices and help

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.460
people in the
Princeton community

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.030
have given me to achieve
the dream of going

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.810
to the Paralympics again.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.030
CARA MOREY: Watching his
approach to what he does,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.220
you can tell that
Declan's a champion.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.190
I think if people
could see Declan

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.940
and what he does
and hear his story,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.610
that any time they feel down
or that the world is tough,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.019
that they can see Declan
and be inspired that they

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:32.185
can do more than they think.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.100
ANNOUNCER: And rival
Declan Farmer--

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.059
he shoots, and it's in!

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:37.016
DECLAN FARMER: The first
Paralympics was really

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:38.510
a special moment for me.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.620
It turned out well for us.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.180
We were able to
win the tournament.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.154
All those years of hard
work coming together,

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.820
and you getting to
hold your gold medal,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.600
and hear the national
anthem and sing it along

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.280
with your teammates --

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.990
it's really a special moment.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.880
This time we hope to repeat
what we did at Sochi.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.530
We hope to win a
gold medal again.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.390
It's just a blast going out
and playing for your country

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.330
and playing the sport you love.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.380
