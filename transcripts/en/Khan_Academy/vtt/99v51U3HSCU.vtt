00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.820
Here I've drawn the
most classic parabola,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.040
y is equal to x squared.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.710
And what I want to do is think
about what happens-- or how can

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.660
I go about shifting
this parabola.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.860
And so let's think about
a couple of examples.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.940
So let's think about
the graph of the curve.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.790
This is y is equal to x squared.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.160
Let's think about what
the curve of y minus k

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.550
is equal to x squared.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.770
What would this look like?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.330
Well, right over here, we
see when x is equal to 0,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.380
x squared is equal to 0.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.120
That's this yellow curve.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.470
So x squared is equal to y,
or y is equal to x squared.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.940
But for this one, x
squared isn't equal to y.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270
It's equal to y minus k.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.090
So when x equals a
0, and we square it,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.770
0 squared doesn't get us to y.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.930
It gets us to y minus k.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.860
So this is going to
be k less than y.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.870
Or another way of thinking
about it, this is 0.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.590
If it's k less than y, y must
be at k, wherever k might be.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.460
So y must be at k,
right over there.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.640
So at least for this
point, it had the effect

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.120
of shifting up the y value by k.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.670
And that's actually true
for any of these values.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.690
So let's think about x
being right over here.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.796
For this yellow curve,
you square this x value,

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:16.670
and you get it there.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.490
And it's clearly not
drawn to scale the way

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.906
that I've done it
right over here.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.930
But now for this
curve right over here,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.085
x squared doesn't cut it.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.950
It only gets you to y minus k.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.340
So y must be k higher than this.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.850
So this is y minus k. y
must be k higher than this.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.710
So y must be right over here.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.540
So this curve is essentially
this blue curve shifted up

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.410
by k.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.950
So making it y minus k is equal
to x squared shifted it up

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.770
by k.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.450
Whatever value this
is, shift it up by k.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.230
This distance is a constant
k, the vertical distance

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.090
between these two parabolas.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.450
And I'll try to draw
it as cleanly as I can.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.370
This vertical distance
is a constant k.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.270
Now let's think about shifting
in the horizontal direction.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.710
Let's think about what happens
if I were to say y is equal to,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.070
not x squared, but
x minus h squared.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.070
So let's think about it.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.230
This is the value you would get
for y when you just square 0.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.160
You get y is equal to 0.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.830
How do we get y
equals 0 over here?

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.470
Well, this quantity right
over here has to be 0.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.550
So x minus h has to be 0,
or x has to be equal to h.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.280
So let's say that h
is right over here.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.940
So x has to be equal to h.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.990
So one way to think about
it is, whatever value you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.890
were squaring here
to get your y,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.590
you now have to have
an h higher value

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.810
to square that same thing.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.601
Because you're going
to subtract h from it.

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:58.320
Just to get to 0,
x has to equal h.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.070
Here, if you wanted to square
1, x just had to be equal to 1.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.280
So here, let's just say,
for the sake of argument,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.080
that this is x is equal to 1.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.310
And this is 1 squared,
clearly not drawn to scale.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.170
So that would be 1, as well.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.590
But now to square 1, we don't
have to just get x equals 1.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.260
x has to be h plus 1.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.970
It has to be 1 higher than h.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.700
It has to be h plus 1 to
get to that same point.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.390
So you see the net
effect is that instead

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.470
of squaring just x,
but squaring x minus h,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.480
we shifted the
curve to the right.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.330
So the curve-- let me do this in
this purple color, this magenta

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.070
color-- will look like this.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.270
We shifted it to the right.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.620
And we shifted it
to the right by h.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.040
Now let's think of another
thought experiment.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.120
Let's imagine that-- let's
think about the curve

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.390
y is equal to
negative x squared.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.415
Well, now whatever the
value of x squared is,

00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:05.040
we're going to take
the negative of it.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.250
So here, no matter what
x we took, we squared it.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.640
We get a positive value.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.670
Now we're always going
to get a negative value

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.687
once we multiply it
times a negative 1.

00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:14.020
So it's going to look like this.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.530
It's going to be a
mirror image of y

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.010
equals x squared reflected
over the horizontal axis.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.040
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.480
So that's y is equal
to negative x squared.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.890
And now let's just imagine
scaling it even more.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:38.520
What would y equal
negative 2x squared?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.340
Well, actually, let
me do two things.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.220
So what would y equals
2x squared look like?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.060
So let's just take
the positive version,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.671
so y equals 2x squared.

00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:49.170
Well, now as we
square things, we're

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.336
going to multiply them by 2.

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:51.730
So it's going to
increase faster.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.480
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.269
It's going to be
narrower and steeper.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:57.810
So it might look
something like this.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.880
And once again, I'm just
giving you the idea.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.890
I haven't really
drawn this to scale.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.110
So increasing it by a factor
will make it increase faster.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.000
If we did y equals
negative 2x squared,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.501
well, then it's going to get
negative faster on either side.

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.250
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.570
It's going to be the mirror
image of what I just drew.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.870
So it's going to be a narrower
parabola just like that.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.670
And similarly-- and I know that
my diagram is getting really

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.810
messy right now--
but just remember

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.580
we started with y
equals x squared,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.830
which is this curve
right over here.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.880
What happens if we did
y equals 1/2 x squared?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.760
I'm running out of
colors, as well.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.180
If we did y equals
1/2 x squared,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.180
well, then the thing's
going to increase slower.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.220
It's going to look the same,
but it's going to open up wider.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.580
It's going to increase slower.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.160
It's going to look
something like this.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.270
So this hopefully
gives you a sense

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.360
of how we can shift
parabolas around.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:04.190
So for example, if I have-- and
I'm doing a very rough drawing

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.940
here to give you the
general idea of what

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.121
we're talking about.

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:13.050
So if this is y
equals x squared,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.360
so that's the graph
of y equals x squared.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.240
Let me do this in a color
that I haven't used yet--

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.991
the graph of y minus k is equal
to A times x minus h squared

00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:36.240
will look something like this.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.440
Instead of the vertex
being at 0, 0, the vertex--

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.899
or the lowest, or
I guess you could

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:42.440
say the minimum or
the maximum point,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.570
the extreme point in the
parabola, this point right

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.069
over here, would be the maximum
point for a downward opening

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.856
parabola, a minimum point for
an upward opening parabola--

00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:50.980
that's going to be shifted.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.630
It's going to be shifted
by h to the right and k up.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.740
So its vertex is going
to be right over here.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.674
And it's going to be scaled
by A. So if A is equal to 1,

00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:04.840
it's going to look the same.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.770
It's going to have
the same opening.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.310
So that's A equals 1.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.440
If A is greater than 1, it's
going to be steeper, like this.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.530
If A is less than 1
but greater than 0,

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.240
it's just going to be
wider opening, like that.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.190
Actually, if A is 0, then it
just turns into a flat line.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.410
And then if A is negative
but less than negative 1,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.172
it's kind of a broad-opening
thing like that.

00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:36.100
Or I should say greater
than negative 1.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.580
If it's between
0 and negative 1,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.600
it will be a broad-opening
thing like that.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.580
At negative 1, it'll
look like a reflection

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.110
of our original curve.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.287
And then if A is less
than negative 1--

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:50.870
so it's even more
negative-- then it's

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.130
going to be even a
steeper parabola that

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.497
might look like that.

00:07:55.497 --> 00:07:57.080
So hopefully that
gives you a good way

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.640
of how to shift and
scale parabolas.
