00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.440
[inaudible] just

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.920
<v 1>a lot about best travel destinations. Where do I recommend people check out,</v>

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.850
and this is a difficult question to answer but I'm going to give it a shot and

4
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm going to name a few of my favorite spots that I have visited.

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.340
Number one would be assuming,

6
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:25.660
let's just say that you're in the u s but even not if you want to visit a spot

7
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:29.500
in the u s and there are many that are perhaps unique,

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.030
even odd in comparison to other places but very, very fun New Orleans,

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.180
I would highly recommend it is a combination of cultural culinary influences

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.120
that come from seemingly almost every corner of the world,

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.480
the national parks. So I would suggest people,

12
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:53.830
if they have not visited the national parks or perhaps they visited one or two

13
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:57.850
when they were younger, make a point of getting on the calendar at least one.

14
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.160
I think that Zion is incredible.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.970
Yosemite certainly is just beyond belief and there are many, many others,

16
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.830
but you can take your pick outside the u s few options. If you are,

17
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:09.664
for instance,

18
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.290
interested in parking up for a period of time and the longer you stay in a

19
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:17.950
particular location outside of the u s the cheaper it will be.

20
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.180
Your primary expenses,

21
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.540
I think it's fair to say are going to be in shorter trips,

22
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.020
airfare and hotels. If you're staying in hotels,

23
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.960
you're going to be paying top dollar per night.

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.520
Argentina spent nine months in Argentina, uh, around 2004,

25
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.120
2005 after I plan to be there for four weeks. I really fell in love with it.

26
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.500
It is a large country.

27
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.240
It is a very long country and you can't find everything from tropical

28
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:48.100
rainforests like Eco Sioux falls and Brazil all the way down to incredible

29
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:52.950
glaciers and killer whales and penguins way, way south. If you go to say Sierra,

30
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.960
they wiggle and you are as close to Antarctica as you really possibly be without

31
00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:02.230
being in Antarctica. Next up if you want to go remote,

32
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.770
if you're looking for a combination of safety and English,

33
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.680
I would recommend going to New Zealand.

34
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.340
And of course there are many different options for English speaking places that

35
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.610
are fun. Uh, but go to the South Island of New Zealand,

36
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.880
get a car and drive your way down to Queenstown. Uh,

37
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.210
which is the adventure sport capital of New Zealand.

38
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:25.990
It's where they filmed a lot of lord of the rings where you find the remarkables

39
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.900
a mountain range and you can do such crazy,

40
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.850
insane stuff as a boogie boarding and rapids, which I tried and quite frankly,

41
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.550
it was more one of the more terrifying experiences I've ever had.

42
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.550
There's a lot of that. So if you'd like ATVs, adventure sports,

43
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.500
it's incredible and it's very, very beautiful.

44
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.700
It looks quite a lot like certain parts of Switzerland.

45
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.940
It's just stunning and people are very, very friendly.

46
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.250
If you want to get a feel for what New Zealanders are,

47
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:55.270
like at least some of them you can watch flight of the Conchords. Alright,

48
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.650
let's look at a very, very safe. And of course bad things can happen. Okay.

49
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.150
And they do, but very,

50
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:06.151
very safe generally and non English super alien environment.

51
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.990
What is the best combination of feeling completely lost,

52
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.490
bewildered in a foreign alien environment and safety that I've experienced has

53
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.324
to be Japan.

54
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
And I spent a year in Japan is my first time really out of s as an exchange

55
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:26.320
student going to a Japanese school in Tokyo, which was huge culture shock.

56
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:31.321
Living with a Japanese family and a Tokyo is just so awesome and so weird that

57
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.790
it's hard to find words to express exactly what it is like. And there's no need.

58
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.180
You should go, uh, it is not going to be cheap.

59
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.650
You can do it at moderate expense though. And uh,

60
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.340
it can be the trip of a lifetime. Then I would say, uh,

61
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.040
and this depends obviously person to person,

62
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:56.041
but take a trip to where some of your ancestors are from to be like,

63
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.700
oh, this is where part of my bloodline comes from. Make an effort.

64
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:04.180
So if you are, let's just say Korean American, you've never been to Korea,

65
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.520
go to Korea. So I would recommend like go somewhere where, uh,

66
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.160
if you trace your bloodline back, you actually have some, uh,

67
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.520
some genetic origins there. That's, that's also a really cool trip.

68
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.350
You can make a real impact on you.
