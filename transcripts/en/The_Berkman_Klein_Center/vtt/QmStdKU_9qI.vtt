00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.600
In the 1940s, in the case of
Fred Fisher versus Witmark,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.410
US courts confronted for
the first time the question

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.880
of whether an author may
assign his so-called expectancy

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.430
interest in the renewal
term for his copyright.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.290
Here's the context in
which that question arose.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.200
You'll recall, I hope,
that the 1909 copyright

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.360
system worked like this-- so
long as he complied with the rest

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.340
requisite formalities,
the author of a work

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.140
received a 28 year initial term
of federal copyright protection.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.340
During the 28th year, he could
apply for a second 28 year term.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.670
If he had died, his widow or
children could apply, and so forth.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.260
As I've indicated, the
renewal term was said

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.940
to be a new estate, not just a
continuation of the earlier term.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.890
It was common during
this period, like today,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.190
for authors to assign their copyrights.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.890
This was especially common
in the music industry.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.650
As we saw in the third lecture in
this series, composers very commonly

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.010
assigned the copyrights in their
compositions to music publishers.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.280
The effect of such an assignment was
that the assignee-- the publisher--

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
acquired the initial 28 year term.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.370
If the composer was still
alive at the end of the term,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.760
he would often renew
the copyright, and then

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.750
assign the renewal term to
a publisher, often but not

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.320
always the same publisher.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.000
If he died, his widow could do so.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200
From the publisher's
standpoint, this was not ideal.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.580
The publisher couldn't be sure
of getting the second term.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.600
And in any event, during
the 28th year, the publisher

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.070
would have to negotiate with the
composer, or his widow, or executor,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.139
concerning the terms
of the new assignment.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.710
If the song in question
had proven popular,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.880
the publisher might be obliged to pay
considerably more to get the renewal

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.650
term than it had paid
to get the initial term.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.580
So publishers, and analogous
assignees in other industries,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.820
frequently asked authors
during the first negotiation

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.070
to assign to them not only the first
copyright term, but also the author's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.260
contingent rights to the renewal
term, known as an expectancy interest.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.050
The reason for this
terminology-- the reason

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.110
that they were called contingent--
is that the author only

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.190
had a right to renew if he was
still alive in the 28th year.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.920
If he had died by then, his widow
or executor had the right to renew,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.550
and the author lacked the power to
assign his widow's contingent rights.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.340
The net effect is that the assignee
obtained the first term for sure,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.560
and the renewal term if and only if the
author survived until the 28th year.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.770
For obvious reasons that too is
not ideal from the standpoint

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.510
of the assignee, because it meant
that sometimes the assignee would

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.860
have to renegotiate with
a widow or executor.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.645
But it was a lot better than
always having to renegotiate.

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:32.260
 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.350
Let's pause for a technical point.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.100
How exactly was this assignment of
the expectancy interest achieved?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.330
The answer is usually
by the author conveying

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.370
to the assignee an irrevocable
power of attorney-- in other words,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.520
legal authority to do what otherwise
the author himself had the right

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.150
to do, namely, to file
the renewal application,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.300
and to get the resultant renewal term.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.400
This prevented the author from
changing his mind in the 28th year,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.960
and filing for renewal himself and
refusing to transfer the renewal term.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.680
As I say, these
arrangements were common,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.730
but it wasn't obvious
that they were valid.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.690
In other words, it wasn't obvious
that the purported assignment

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.260
of the expectancy
interests were enforceable.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.560
The 1909 statute did not
address the issue explicitly.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.360
But the House and Senate reports
explaining the basis of that statute

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.030
contained a passage that
seemed to cast doubt

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.600
on the validity of these assignments.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.946
Here it is.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:44.520
The crucial language is highlighted.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.560
"It not infrequently happens that the
author sells his copyright outright

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.400
to a publisher for a
comparatively small sum.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.890
If the work proves to be a great
success and lives beyond the term

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.960
of 28 years, your committee--" meaning
your congressional committee-- "felt

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.740
that it should be the exclusive right
of the author to take the renewal term,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.140
and the law should be framed
as is the existing law,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.180
so that he could not be
deprived of that right."

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.080
This passage suggests that the purpose
of not giving an author from the outset

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.960
a single term of life plus 50 years,
or something shorter, like 56 years,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.210
but instead requiring him to renew
the copyright in the 38th year,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.440
was precisely to give him an
opportunity to renegotiate

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.970
the terms of any assignment.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.000
And the reason why that's important
is that, as the committee explains,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.330
authors tend to be either
vulnerable or naive,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.930
and therefore, to assign their
initial terms for too little money.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.130
In other words, the law was
designed to protect authors

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.870
from their own foolishness
or vulnerability.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.260
Permitting them to assign
their expectancy interests,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.670
along with the first term,
arguably would defeat that goal.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.320
The upshot is that there
was a plausible argument

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.690
that these assignments of
expectancy interests were invalid.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.750
But for many years, they were used
without being challenged in court.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.430
Finally, one composer did so.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.030
His name was George Graff.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.930
In 1912, Mr. Graff helped compose the
song, "When Irish Eyes are Smiling."

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.108
Here's a brief excerpt of a
1913 recording of the song.

00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.024
[MUSIC PLAYING "WHEN IRISH EYES ARE
 SMILING"]

00:06:38.024 --> 00:06:49.455
 

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.940
(SINGING) There's a tear in your eye.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.407
And I'm wondering why, for it
never should be there at all.

00:06:57.407 --> 00:07:00.886
With such power in your smile,
sure a stone you'd beguile,

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:06.130
and there's never a
teardrop should fall.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.020
When your sweet lilting laughter
like some fairy song, and your eyes

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.040
sparkling bright as can be you
should laugh all the while,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.720
and all other times smile.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.220
And now smile a while for me.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.740
 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.240
When he first wrote this song,
Graff assigned the copyright,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.730
in the initial 28 year term, to a
music publisher, Witmark and Sons,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.410
in return for some royalties.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.260
Five years later, he encountered
financial difficulties.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.010
To raise some cash, Graff
gave up his royalties

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.540
for "Irish Eyes," and
for 68 other songs,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.780
and in addition, assigned his expectancy
interest in the renewal term for all

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:12.040
of those 69 songs to Witmark, in return
for a lump sum payment of $1,600.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.220
Subsequently, "Irish
Eyes" became very popular,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.910
and earned Witmark lots of
royalties, none of which,

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.600
of course, went to Graff.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.070
In 1939, on the first day of
the 28th year of the copyright,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.190
Witmark, the publisher,
exercised its right

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.760
to renew the copyright for
an additional 28 year term.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.690
Graff, unhappy, insisted that his
1917 assignment of the expectancy

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.669
interest to Witmark had
been invalid, and purported

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.430
to renew the copyright
in "Irish Eyes" himself,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.720
and then assign it for more money to a
different publisher, Fred Fisher Music.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.060
The two publishers then fought it out.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.030
Although, as you can see, the case that
grew out of this complicated narrative

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.220
involved two publishers,
it had big implications

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.600
for all other composers and
artists in analogous positions.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.110
If Witmark prevailed, then
many authors would not

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.550
get a second bite at the apple.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.980
They could, and would, assign
their expectancy interests,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.370
along with the first term of
their copyrights, sometimes

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.080
for very little money.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.760
Then, when the time for renewal
arose, they would have no rights.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.270
By contrast, if Fred Fisher Music
prevailed, authors in the future

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.710
would be unable to assign their
expectancies, but on the other hand,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.860
would be in a much better
bargaining position at renewal time.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.370
 

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.460
So the stakes were high.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.710
The case proceeded through
three levels of courts.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.500
The trial judge ruled
in favor of Witmark.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.720
The Court of Appeals affirmed,
by a vote of two judges to one,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.710
and the Supreme Court affirmed,
by a vote of five to three,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.890
one justice not participating.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.740
The law was thus settled.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.070
Expectancy interests of this
sort are indeed assignable.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.410
For our purposes, even more
important than this outcome

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.370
is the language used by the opposing
groups of parties and judges.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.530
Two radically different conceptions
of authors, their characteristics,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.470
and their needs figured in this case.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.560
The first was well expressed
by Judge Jerome Frank,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.500
who dissented in the Court of Appeals.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.870
 

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.320
"In considering those facts,
we should take judicial notice

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.140
of the economic capacities and
business acumen of most authors.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.580
We need only take judicial notice of
that which every schoolboy knows--

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.030
that, usually, with a
few notable exceptions,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.320
such as Shakespeare and
George Bernard Shaw,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.630
authors are hopelessly inept in business
transactions and that lyricists,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:09.460
like the defendant Graff, often
sell their songs 'for a song.' "

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.830
Appreciation of these
facts, Frank contended,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.180
should prompt us to treat
lyricists, and authors in general,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.450
as especially vulnerable, perhaps even
a quote "necessitus class," close quote,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.130
and to curtail their contractual
freedom for their own good.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.530
Specifically, we should disable
them from assigning their expectancy

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:38.920
interests, which Frank argued the
statute, properly construed did.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.440
The opposing narrative and
vision was equally well

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.540
stated by Justice Felix
Frankfurter, who wrote the majority

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.020
opinion for the Supreme Court.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.130
"It is not for courts to judge
whether the interests of authors

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.730
clearly lie upon one side of this
question rather than the other.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.760
We cannot draw a principle of law from
the familiar stories of garret-poverty

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.810
of some men of literary genius.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.940
Even if we could do so, we cannot say
that such men would regard with favor

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.270
a rule of law preventing them from
realizing on their assets when they are

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.840
most in need of funds.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.030
Nor can we be unmindful of the
fact that authors have themselves

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.290
devised means of
safeguarding their interests.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.180
We do not have such assured knowledge
about authorship, and particularly

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.830
about song writing, or the psychology
of gifted writers and composers,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.830
as to justify us as judges in importing
into Congressional legislation

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.100
a denial to authors of
the freedom to dispose

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.110
of their property possessed by others.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:48.590
While authors may have habits making
for intermittent want--" in other words,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.420
they don't manage their
money well-- "they

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.040
may have no less a spirit
of independence which

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:03.670
would resent treatment of them as
wards under guardianship of the law."

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.430
Frankfurter's vision, his
insistence that authors

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.300
were responsible adults,
autonomous individuals,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.600
and should not be treated
as wards of the state,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.940
prevailed in this particular case.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.060
But Judge Frank's competing
vision, that the law

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.010
should be crafted to nurture and protect
improvident authors, to shield them

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.610
from their habitual folly, also
had a significant following.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.790
Three of the Supreme
Court justices dissented.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.970
Instead of writing a dissent
themselves, they merely

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.520
indicated that they agreed with
the analysis of the language

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.569
and history of the copyright law in
the dissenting opinion of Judge Frank,

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:42.360
in the court below.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.930
 

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:50.070
These competing visions are outgrowths
of deeper and broader themes

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.350
in copyright law, and
in US law in general.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.760
Indeed, both of these
opposed visions can

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.530
be found in the legal systems
of most countries, at least

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.810
in Europe and North America.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.310
The broader theme that underlies
the Frankfurter argument

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.010
is sometimes called individualism.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.255
Here's how Duncan
Kennedy, the scholar who

00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:16.090
has done the most to identify and
explore these ideological currents,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.021
describes it.

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.730
 

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.270
"The essence of
individualism," says Kennedy,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.540
"is the making of a sharp
distinction between one's interests

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.110
and those of others,
combined with the belief

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.787
that a preference in conduct for
one's own interests is legitimate,

00:14:33.787 --> 00:14:36.120
but that one should be willing
to respect the rules that

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.210
make it possible to coexist with
others similarly self-interested.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.740
The form of conduct associated with
individualism is self-reliance.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.920
This means an insistence on defining
and achieving objectives without help

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.240
from others-- i.e., without
being dependent on them

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.160
or asking sacrifices of them.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.370
It means accepting that they
will neither share their gains

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.310
nor one's own losses.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.070
And it means a firm
conviction that I am entitled

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.050
to enjoy the benefits of my
efforts without an obligation

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.670
to share or sacrifice them
to the interests of others."

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.730
An attitude strongly
associated with this outlook

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.410
is a hostility to
paternalism, legal rules that

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.340
restrict people's freedom
for their own good,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.220
such as a rule preventing authors
from assigning their expectancy

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.470
interest on the grounds that they
will be better off if they're

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.570
forced to wait until the end of
their initial copyright terms.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.190
 

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.480
Opposed to individualism is altruism.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.040
Here's how Kennedy described it.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.820
"The essence of altruism
is the belief that one

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.740
ought not to indulge a sharp
preference for one's own interests

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.750
over those of others.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.150
It has roots in culture, in
religion, ethics and art,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.860
that are as deep as
those of individualism.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.640
The simplest of the practices
that represent altruism

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.310
are sharing and sacrifice.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.520
Sharing is a static concept, suggesting
an existing distribution of goods

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.600
which the sharers rearrange.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.800
It means giving up to another gains or
wealth that one has produced oneself

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.130
or have come to one
through some good fortune.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.440
Sacrifice is the
dynamic notion of taking

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.570
action that will change an
ongoing course of events,

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:33.500
at some expense to oneself, to minimize
another's loss or maximize his gain."

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.420
This orientation tends to sustain
a much more favorable posture

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.890
toward paternalism.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.540
People, viewed this way, should
not be left to their own devices.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.340
The law should, at least sometimes,
intervene to save them from themselves.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.880
 

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.650
Kennedy's great essay, from
which these passages are drawn,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.120
explores in depth the relationship
between these competing attitudes

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.230
concerning the substance
of human relations,

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.750
and analogously competing attitudes
toward the proper form of legal rules.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.380
If you're curious, I strongly
encourage you to explore that essay.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.920
It's available online at the URL
listed on the preceding slide.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.030
But our concern here is
with the narrower question

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.910
of how the attitudes
I've just summarized

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.180
find expression in copyright law.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.430
Legislators, when adjusting the
copyright statute, and judges,

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.330
when construing and
applying the statute,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.700
are frequently pulled in different
directions by these warring impulses.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.350
Sometimes, as in the Witmark case,
the individualist impulse prevails.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.360
But sometimes the
protective impulse prevails.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.100
One manifestation of
the protective impulse

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.130
was left intact by the
controversial decision in Witmark.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.800
As we've seen, if an author had died
by the time the renewal window opened,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.050
his widow or children could
renew and keep the copyright.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.230
They could do so, even if the author
had assigned his contingent expectancy

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.590
interest.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.130
The reason, to repeat, is that
all the author had, and thus

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.650
all he could assign, was the
right to renew the copyright if he

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.310
was alive at the start of 28th year.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:24.060
If he didn't make it, he had nothing,
and thus his assignee acquired nothing.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.630
The purpose and effect
of this rule, of course,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:33.770
was to shield authors' widows, widowers,
and children, from foolish assignments,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.660
by giving them separate rights.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.950
Now those rights were far from perfect.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:44.140
Most importantly, they only have value
if the author died less than 28 years

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.880
after publication.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.160
But they were better than nothing,
and sometimes quite valuable.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.700
 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.670
Another very important
manifestation of what

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.750
I'm calling it the protective
impulse in US copyright law

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.360
is the set of so-called
termination rights.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.600
These were first introduced
in the comprehensive 1976

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.500
reform of the copyright
statute, and subsequently

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.070
modified by the 1998
Copyright Term Extension Act.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.070
I mentioned these termination rights
at the end of the preceding lecture.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.040
I now want to outline
them in a bit more detail.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.070
Here's how they work.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.420
There are two groups of these rights.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.910
The first apply to works
created in 1978 or later.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.890
You'll recall, I hope, that
federal copyrights in such works

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.230
arise when they are first
fixed in a tangible medium,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.740
and last for the life of
the author plus 70 years.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.270
The authors of such works,
of course, initially

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.470
acquire those copyrights, but frequently
assign them, or portions of them,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.330
to other parties.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.680
For example, as we've
seen, musicians commonly

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.270
assign the copyrights in their sound
recordings to record companies.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.590
These are known as
inter vivos transfers,

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.230
because they occur during
the author's lifetime.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.860
Typically, such
assignments are permanent.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.910
In other words, the assignee
gets the full copyright term.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.980
And notice, this effect is a bit odd.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.780
The assignee's rights
last for a period of time

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.370
tied to the lifespan of the author.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.490
The longer the author lives, the more
valuable are the assignee's rights.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.820
For those of you familiar with the
language of common law real property

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:34.630
law, the effect is analogous to a life
estate pur autre vie, plus 70 years.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.500
Curious, but that's how it works.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.920
Suppose that a particular author
assigns her rights for a pittance,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.790
and then later comes
to regret her decision.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.330
Can she ever get the copyright back?

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.210
The answer is yes.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.300
Section 203 of the statute
gives her the right

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.320
to terminate the assignment
during a five year window that

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.760
opens 35 years after the date
of the original assignment.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.700
If she wishes to
exercise that right, she

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.440
must notify the assignee
between two and five

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.520
years before the termination itself.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.970
If she has died, her
spouse or descendants

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:21.570
get the right to terminate,
and to recover the copyright.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.590
A crucial difference between this
system and the renewal system

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.830
we examined a minute ago is that the
termination rights are non-waivable.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.900
In other words, the author may not,
when she assigns her copyright,

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.810
agree to waive her rights later
to terminate the assignment.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.250
If she purports to do so, that
waiver will not be enforced.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.250
In other words, Congress,
when it created this system,

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:50.000
adopted Judge Frank's view of the
legitimacy and importance of protecting

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.040
authors from their own
ill-advised decisions,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.510
rather than Justice Frankfurter's
hostility to making authors

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.360
wards of the state.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.060
Who enjoys the copyrights after the
original assignments are terminated?

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.240
The person or persons who, according
to the list in the upper right hand

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.020
corner of this slide, are
entitled to terminate on the date

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.450
the notice to terminate is given.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.600
 

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:22.720
What about older works, specifically
those published between 1964 and 1977?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.640
Copyrights in these, you'll
recall, function very differently.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.070
Federal copyright protection attached
to them only upon publication,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.980
with appropriate notice, and
now lasts for an initial term

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.790
of 28 years, and an automatic
renewal term of 67 years,

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.610
for a total of 95 years from
the date of publication.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.770
Suppose that, sometime after
1978, the author, having renewed

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.850
assigns the remainder
of the renewal term.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.420
The assignee will keep it
for the balance of the term,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.920
unless the author can
terminate the assignment.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.900
Again, Section 203 the
statute gives her the right

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.230
to do so during a five
year window that opens

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.900
35 years after the date of
the original assignment.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.535
These rights work the same way
as the set we just considered.

00:23:13.535 --> 00:23:16.330
 

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.850
If the assignment was made before 1978,
a different set of termination rules

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.030
apply.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.697
Section 304 of the statute gives
the author-- or if she has died,

00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:28.280
the members of her family-- the
right to terminate at any time

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.080
during a five year window
that opens 56 years

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.110
after the date of the
original publication.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.070
In other words, when federal
copyright protection started.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.450
Mechanically, these termination
rights work essentially the same way

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:49.290
as the set we just considered, and
can be exercised by the same parties.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:53.500
They, too, cannot be waived.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.710
If the author or her family
members miss that window,

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:03.250
another one opens 75 years
after the original publication.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:09.100
Finally, what about works first
published between 1923 and 1963?

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.510
As we've seen, the subset of
these works that were properly

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.390
renewed during the 28th year of the
original term are still alive today.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.910
If they were assigned by
the author to someone else,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.160
may the author or her family
terminate those assignments?

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.390
Again, the answer is yes.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:31.500
If the assignment was made in 1978 or
later, the Section 203 rules apply.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.490
If the assignment was made before
1978, the double windows of Section 304

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.070
apply.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:44.190
As I trust you can see, these rules
are Byzantine in their complexity.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.170
And their intricacy often defeats
authors or their families,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.840
who lack the money or
knowledge to hire lawyers

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.080
who can guide them through these reefs.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.510
But at least well advised
authors or their families

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.250
can use these procedures to
recover the copyrights they once

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.960
purported to alienate permanently.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.390
In this way, the law attempts to protect
them from their own lack of foresight.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.370
 

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.040
These termination rights represent
perhaps the clearest expression

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.370
in copyright law of the vision
expressed by Judge Frank.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.130
A final manifestation of
that vision we discussed

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.180
at the end of the previous lecture.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.340
Here's a reminder.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.710
You'll recall, I hope
that the law limits

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:35.290
the set of types of works that
can become works for hire,

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.880
through signed written contracts.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.160
Sound recordings don't
appear on this list.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.910
They were briefly added,
and then withdrawn.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.970
That means that record
companies may be prevented,

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.230
for the reasons we discussed
last week, from treating

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.330
the sets of sound
recordings they commission

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.480
from recording artists
as works for hire.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.870
To be sure, the record
companies can, and typically do,

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.250
obtain from recording artists
assignments of their copyrights,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.600
but they may not be able to enforce
the provisions of the typical recording

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.280
contracts that purport, in addition,
to render those sound recordings

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.290
works for hire.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.790
The reason why this highly
technical difference is so important

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.130
should by now be clear.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:27.130
Works for hire are not subject
to the termination rules.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.920
So if the recordings are works
for hire, the recording artists

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.360
and their families will never
get the copyrights back.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.830
Springsteen and Clapton will have to
make do with their current revenue

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.630
streams.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.880
If they are not works for hire,
but are merely assigned copyrights,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.980
then the artists and their families
can begin terminating them,

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:57.160
35 years after those assignments
were initially executed.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.820
Suppose that a particular
assignment was made immediately

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.570
after this set of rules became
effective, namely on January 1, 1978.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.230
When can the assignments be terminated?

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.250
Right now, in 2013.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.860
Thus, the courts will soon
be obliged to determine

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.920
the status of these recordings.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.750
 

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.810
The general point
lurking in these details

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.410
is that this legal doctrine arguably
represents yet another manifestation

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.950
of the protective impulse
exemplified by Judge Frank's opinion.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.050
One possible explanation
for the fact that this list

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:38.020
of potential works for hire
is exclusive, and does not

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.630
contain sound recordings,
is that Congress

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.870
wished to prevent recording artists
from entering into deals by which they

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.730
permanently surrender their
rights for too little money.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.850
In other words, Congress wanted to
ensure that they, or their families,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:56.720
get a second bite at the apple, and
so deprived them of the legal power

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:02.520
to give up the chance in the
future to take that bite.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.990
To summarize, I have discussed today
three dimensions of the copyright

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.510
system in the United States.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.670
First, the vestigial but important
role played by formalities,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.890
and the associated
policy debates concerning

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.970
whether formalities
should be reinstated.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.780
Second, the intricate rules
governing the duration of copyrights.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.640
And third, the equally
intricate rules that

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.395
attempt to shield artists and
their families from exploitation.

00:28:32.395 --> 00:28:35.140
 

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.570
These three features
surely do not exhaust

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.990
the set of important aspects
of the copyright machine.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.370
Other gears and levers
are identified in the map.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.700
They include the rules that
determine how one makes an effective

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.610
assignment, or license of a
copyright, or one of its component

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:59.960
exclusive rights, and the effect
of such licenses and assignments.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.670
The rules governing the relative
rights of the contributors

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.830
to a collective work, such as the
authors of freelance articles published

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:11.130
in a newspaper, and the owner of
the copyright in the collective work

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.640
itself.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.870
The recording system that plays
a limited role in resolving

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.970
disputes that arise when
a copyright owner make

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.950
successive and consistent
transfers of his or her rights.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.000
The messy issues generated
when the United States sought

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.082
to restore the copyrights of
some non-residents, and so forth.

00:29:33.082 --> 00:29:35.540
You're welcome, of course, to
explore the relevant branches

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.432
of the map on your own.

00:29:37.432 --> 00:29:39.140
In addition, some of
these issues will be

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.840
discussed in the classes and discussions
that will follow this lecture.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.600
But the three themes
we have examined today

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.580
should suffice to give you at least
a general sense of how the copyright

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.340
system works in practice,
and the broad policy

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.250
issues implicated by that machinery.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.990
Thank you.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.278
