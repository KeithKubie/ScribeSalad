00:00:00.407 --> 00:00:01.342
- [Voiceover] Hey, Becca.

00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:02.207
- [Voiceover] Hey, Kim.

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:03.621
- [Voiceover] All right,
so you've brought me here

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.744
to talk about Columbus, and
the origins of Columbus Day.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.174
So, what's the deal with
Christopher Columbus?

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:12.137
Was he a good guy?

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.328
- [Voiceover] So that's
a great question, Kim,

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:14.860
and it's something that historians

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.774
and people across the United States

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:19.756
have argued about for over a century now,

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:22.525
since we started celebrating
Columbus Day, especially.

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:24.441
You always see a lot of op-eds

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.291
and a lot of people
arguing on Columbus Day

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.127
exactly about that question.

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:30.559
So, in the last video,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.759
I discussed why Christopher Columbus

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.672
wanted to come to the New World,

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:37.562
and what happened when he
arrived in the Caribbean.

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:38.426
So in this video,

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:40.656
we'll talk a little bit
more about the implications

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.749
of Christopher Columbus's voyage,

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.025
and his legacy and how
it's been remembered

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.474
in the United States.

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:48.457
- [Voiceover] All right,
so between the good,

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:51.681
the bad, and the ugly
of Christopher Columbus,

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:54.155
please tell me that we
can have a Venn diagram.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:55.627
Can we have a Venn diagram?

00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:57.452
- [Voiceover] We can
definitely have a Venn diagram.

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:01.411
So I will make a Venn
diagram of the implications

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.617
or impact of Christopher
Columbus's voyage.

00:01:05.617 --> 00:01:09.691
So this is kind of the
bad, and this is the good.

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.444
- [Voiceover] All right,
and in between we've got,

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:12.878
I guess, yellow.

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:15.019
- [Voiceover] We'll talk
about that over here.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:16.197
- [Voiceover] I like
how we're talking about

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.206
kind of the impact of
Christopher Columbus,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:20.191
because I think that's most important

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:22.198
from a historical standpoint.

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.703
Not whether or not he,
personally, was a good guy,

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:28.997
but whether what he did on the aggregate

00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:32.652
has been positive or
negative for world history.

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:33.485
- [Voiceover] Definitely.

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:35.152
So, on the good side,

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:37.933
a lot of historians and
people in the United States

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.839
like to commemorate Christopher Columbus

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:43.003
for how amazing he was
at navigating the sea.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.844
He was the first person
to cross the Atlantic,

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.502
and he did it in only five weeks.

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:49.652
So, he was a really amazing navigator,

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:52.746
and in that process he
really connected two worlds

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.094
that were otherwise completely distant,

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:57.970
and really, had no idea
that the other existed.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.901
- [Voiceover] Okay, so he
didn't discover the New World,

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.703
because the people who
lived in the New World

00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:05.142
had already discovered it,

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:08.891
but he did connect the
European and African worlds

00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:10.974
with the American worlds.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:13.148
- [Voiceover] Exactly, I think that's

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:14.320
a really good distinction to make.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.474
He connected, but he did not discover.

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:19.787
And so a lot of people like to think that

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.041
something we should remember
Christopher Columbus for

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.027
is that he discovered the United States.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.889
Again, as you can see in my last video,

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.139
he did not discover the United States,

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.709
he actually never went to North America,

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.742
and the person that we
actually have to credit that

00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:33.910
is Leif Ericson.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.932
And so, can you tell me a
little bit about Leif Ericson?

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:38.806
- [Voiceover] Leif Ericson was a

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:41.877
Viking navigator, that
might be all I've got,

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:43.907
but Vikings were a lot earlier, right?

00:02:43.907 --> 00:02:47.181
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so the
Vikings came to North America

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.904
through what is now Alaska

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:53.275
400, 500 years before
Christopher Columbus.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.013
And so they are the people
that actually "discovered"

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:59.677
North America despite the Native Americans

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:00.656
that were already there.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:04.464
They were the first Europeans
to arrive in North America.

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:07.294
So we'll talk a little bit
more about the bad implications

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:09.444
of Christopher Columbus and his contact

00:03:09.444 --> 00:03:10.889
with the New World,

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.528
and that has a lot to
do with his treatment

00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:13.780
of the Native Americans.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.598
So, you can see that in these
kind of two representations

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.153
of the moment of contact.

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:22.153
So, here would be the bad, the ugly.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.819
And this is the kinda good.

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:28.158
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I can see that

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:32.536
this painting here on the
right, it's very heroic.

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.145
- [Voiceover] He goes look very heroic.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.149
- [Voiceover] I know, he's
even looking up into the sky

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:41.028
as though he's maybe making
eye contact with God.

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:44.696
- [Voiceover] Definitely God's up here.

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:46.285
The other interpretation is looking like

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:48.715
a lot of what historians have read

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:50.735
in Christopher Columbus's journal

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:53.715
and in these documents that
he sent back to the Spanish,

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.636
which provide evidence to show that

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.376
Christopher Columbus and his men

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:00.351
on the Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria,

00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:03.845
enslaved the native
people, mutilated them,

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.653
and sexually assaulted many native women.

00:04:07.653 --> 00:04:08.986
So the treatment

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.502
of native people.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.440
- [Voiceover] So he's possibly the father

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.393
of the Atlantic slave trade,

00:04:16.393 --> 00:04:20.155
and I would say, unintentionally the cause

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:23.893
of a fairly significant human genocide.

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:25.782
An unintentional human genocide

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:28.716
in the form of disease
passed to Native Americans.

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:29.549
- [Voiceover] Definitely.

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:31.416
Historical records point towards

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.833
Christopher Columbus's violence
towards the native people,

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.964
but disease was really what
decimated the population,

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:39.815
because when the ships
arrived from Europe,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.559
they brought weapons, but
they also brought new diseases

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.686
that the native people had
never encountered before,

00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:48.707
and they had no immune system
to fight off these diseases.

00:04:48.707 --> 00:04:52.911
The Taino people were
absolutely decimated.

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:55.211
- [Voiceover] I think it's
important to note that

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.654
no one coming from
Europe meant to do this.

00:04:57.654 --> 00:04:59.240
This was before germ theory.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.649
They had an idea that being in contact

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.832
with a sick person might get you sick,

00:05:03.832 --> 00:05:06.813
but they didn't know that
we could carry immunity

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:08.231
to these diseases.

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.187
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:12.238
That's a good segue into talking about

00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:16.060
what would probably be center
on this little diagram,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.836
which is the Columbian Exchange.

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:19.692
So, the Columbian Exchange,

00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:23.146
you can read more about it
in the Khan Academy article

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.682
dedicated to talking about

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.831
exactly what the Columbian Exchange was,

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:29.119
but I'll give you a
little bit of an overview.

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.766
So, disease was really
what came from Europe

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.318
to the New World.

00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:36.737
- [Voiceover] How about also weapons,

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:38.820
like firearms and horses.

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.099
- [Voiceover] Horses, definitely.

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.739
- [Voiceover] There were
no horses in the New World,

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:45.239
so no Native Americans ever rode horses

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.022
until the Spanish brought them over.

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:48.008
- [Voiceover] And that really changed

00:05:48.008 --> 00:05:49.185
Native American culture,

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:52.015
because they became so
mobile with these new horses.

00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:54.094
So, coming in from West Africa,

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:56.207
enslaved people were being sold

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:59.079
and sent on a brutal
voyage across the Atlantic,

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.065
which many of them didn't survive,

00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:04.222
to work in the fields in the New World.

00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:06.805
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
particularly in what we call

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:08.720
the Caribbean today, or the West Indies,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.518
so the islands that were producing sugar,

00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:15.006
like Barbados, the Dominican Republic.

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:17.012
- [Voiceover] And what was
coming back from the New World

00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:19.956
to Europe was mostly gold,

00:06:19.956 --> 00:06:22.199
as well as Native American slaves.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.218
- [Voiceover] So, it's kind of a triangle

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:28.647
between Europe, and
Africa, and the Americas.

00:06:28.647 --> 00:06:30.363
- [Voiceover] Yeah, a lot
of historians have called it

00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:31.812
the Triangular Trade.

00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:33.927
And so I put it in the middle because yes,

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:36.437
humans were transported as slaves,

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:39.825
that is obviously on the bad side,

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:41.778
but there also were new markets,

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:44.779
and there was this kind
of globalization of trade.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.980
- [Voiceover] Yes, and things
that existed in the New World

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.381
that were brought back were tomatoes,

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.457
so imagine a world of Italy
where there are no tomatoes.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.834
It was only after the
connection with the New World.

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:02.884
Corn, if you think about
staples of the American diet

00:07:02.884 --> 00:07:05.163
and the diets in the world,

00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:08.261
many things came from the Americas.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.050
- [Voiceover] I had to draw in some corn

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.802
and tomatoes over here.

00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:13.027
And those are definitely on the good side.

00:07:13.027 --> 00:07:16.125
Next I'm gonna talk a little
bit more about Columbus Day,

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.274
and why we celebrate it,

00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:20.878
and why it's become such
a contentious holiday.

00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:24.349
Really, no other holiday
gets as much criticism.

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.686
- [Voiceover] So, when did Columbus Day

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:30.036
actually start being celebrated?

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:34.662
I'm gonna assume that
it didn't start in 1493.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.232
- [Voiceover] That's correct,
Kim, it did not start in 1493.

00:07:37.232 --> 00:07:42.035
It actually began on a
state level in the 1890s.

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:46.078
So, it had to do with Italian immigration,

00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:48.927
these mostly Catholic Italian immigrants

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.170
coming into the United
States in the 1890s.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.336
In the 1890s there was a very
anti-immigrant sentiment.

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:56.881
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
because this is a time when

00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:58.714
you have a lot of Russian Jews

00:07:58.714 --> 00:07:59.917
coming to the United States,

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:02.791
and also southern, eastern
Europeans in general

00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:04.848
who don't speak English.

00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:08.165
There was much more concern,
and a lot more nativism,

00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:10.059
sort of anti-immigrant sentiment

00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:11.427
directed to these people,

00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:14.599
who many thought were so different

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:18.736
from white Protestant
Anglo-Saxon Americans

00:08:18.736 --> 00:08:21.715
that they would never
be able to assimilate.

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:23.937
- [Voiceover] Exactly, so
nativism was running really high,

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.031
that's the anti-immigrant sentiment,

00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.002
that was mostly held by Protestants,

00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:30.432
white Protestants in the United States

00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:32.519
during this time of immigration.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.576
There were a lot of episodes of violence

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:37.208
against the Italian and
Catholic communities,

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:40.712
and one actually inspired
the first Columbus Day.

00:08:40.712 --> 00:08:43.797
And so, in 1891 there
was a public lynching

00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:46.307
of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans.

00:08:46.307 --> 00:08:47.569
- [Voiceover] Wow, I had no idea.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.017
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and
it's one of the largest

00:08:49.017 --> 00:08:51.211
public lynchings in American history.

00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.060
And so, in response to that,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.443
the first ever Columbus Day was celebrated

00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:58.971
by Italian immigrants
in New Orleans in 1892.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.350
This was before it was a federal holiday,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.387
this was just a celebration
of their heritage

00:09:03.387 --> 00:09:05.093
in a moment where their heritage

00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:08.222
was being violently uprooted.

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:11.275
The first president to
recommend Columbus Day

00:09:11.275 --> 00:09:14.359
was actually Harrison in '93.

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:15.192
So, 1893.

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:19.172
What else was going on at that time, Kim?

00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:21.145
- [Voiceover] Oh, this is
one of my favorite things.

00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.562
So in 1893 Chicago celebrated

00:09:24.943 --> 00:09:27.780
the World's Columbian Exposition,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.009
where the United States

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.743
proclaimed loudly to the world

00:09:32.743 --> 00:09:36.910
that they were a important
cultural and scientific nation,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.387
so they had exhibitions of all
different types of machinery

00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:43.968
that had been invented,

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:46.070
and different types of people

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.113
from all over the United States.

00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:52.196
It was really the massive
national event of 1893.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.099
They did this in 1893
as the 400th anniversary

00:09:57.099 --> 00:09:59.766
of Columbus discovering America,

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.360
but he did that in 1492,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.520
so they were a year late.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.169
It took them an extra year

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.388
to get ready for this World's Fair.

00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:12.990
- [Voiceover] It was a very
patriotic sort of event.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.157
The USA rules,

00:10:16.922 --> 00:10:18.763
and we want everyone to know about that.

00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:20.412
And it really was convenient

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:23.122
to also celebrate Columbus as that time,

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:26.205
as to increase this patriotic morale.

00:10:28.318 --> 00:10:30.866
So it wasn't until the New Deal

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:33.423
when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:10:33.423 --> 00:10:38.226
signed Columbus Day into
law as a federal holiday.

00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:41.137
- [Voiceover] So, why did he
make it a federal holiday?

00:10:41.137 --> 00:10:42.702
- [Voiceover] So, FDR was under

00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:45.726
a lot of pressure from
the Knights of Columbus,

00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:49.465
so this was this Catholic
Italian cultural organization,

00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.090
and they lobbied him heavily

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.455
because they really wanted a cultural hero

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:56.488
for their ethnic identity.

00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:57.699
- [Voiceover] Why are so many people

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.932
upset about Columbus Day today?

00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:03.264
- [Voiceover] So, this sort
of anti-Columbus Day sentiment

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:06.334
started in the late 80s, early 90s,

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:08.378
when different states which had

00:11:08.378 --> 00:11:11.207
very high Native American populations

00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:13.367
started to realize that
we were celebrating

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:17.280
a man who did inflict a
lot of disease and violence

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.756
against the Native peoples
when he arrived here.

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:23.216
In the 90s, Hawaii,
Alaska, and South Dakota

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:26.252
all stopped giving people
the day off from work

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.172
for Columbus Day,

00:11:27.172 --> 00:11:29.091
started to kind of disregard

00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:32.184
the federal mandate of a holiday.

00:11:32.184 --> 00:11:33.644
The significance of these three states

00:11:33.644 --> 00:11:37.032
is that they all have very high
Native American populations.

00:11:37.032 --> 00:11:39.944
And actually in 1992, right over here,

00:11:39.944 --> 00:11:42.886
Berkeley, California renamed Columbus Day

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:44.882
to Indigenous People's Day.

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:46.577
And a lot of other
states have followed suit

00:11:46.577 --> 00:11:49.041
in this kind of renaming of Columbus Day

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.064
to commemorate the native people

00:11:51.064 --> 00:11:52.476
and the lives that were lost

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:54.218
during Columbus's voyage

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:57.546
and the colonization projects that ensued.

00:11:57.546 --> 00:11:58.504
- [Voiceover] So, what do you think?

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:01.228
At the end of the day,
was Columbus a good guy

00:12:01.228 --> 00:12:02.496
or a bad guy?

00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:03.411
- [Voiceover] You know, Kim,

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:04.826
I don't think it's actually about him

00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:07.391
as much as it is about
the long-term effects

00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.387
of colonization on the
Native American population,

00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:13.059
which were really, really terrible.

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:14.998
To chalk it up to Christopher Columbus,

00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:17.194
we can definitely not celebrate him,

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:20.151
but there were so many
other colonization projects,

00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:22.043
and different events that happened

00:12:22.043 --> 00:12:24.110
throughout American history that

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.876
subordinated the Native people,

00:12:25.876 --> 00:12:27.091
and that's really the conversation

00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:28.468
that I wanna keep having.
