00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:02.777
- [Instructor] So after
getting a very late start,

00:00:02.777 --> 00:00:07.191
the English finally
started a New World colony

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:10.358
on the coast of North America in 1607,

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:13.909
and it was here at Jamestown.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.258
The English colonists at
Jamestown could not have been

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:22.258
less prepared to settle a New World.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:26.094
They came from the Virginia Company,

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:29.371
which was a joint-stock company,

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.121
or kind of like a modern-day corporation,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:35.975
which was trying to make
wealth for its shareholders

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.716
as quickly as possible.

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:40.160
Now, if you think about
people in this time period,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.595
they in England are taking
a look over at Spain

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:48.521
and seeing Spain bring ships
full of gold and silver

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.007
back to Europe from the New
World, and they wanna get in

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:51.854
on that action.

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:54.321
And as far as they know,
the whole New World

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.147
is just piled up with silver and gold.

00:00:57.147 --> 00:01:00.814
So in the first months,
they sent gentlemen,

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.762
and the English definition
of a gentleman here is

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:08.691
someone who does not work with his hands,

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.274
to try to find gold

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:12.818
in Virginia.

00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:16.479
Now, spoiler alert, there
is no gold in Virginia.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.850
But that whole first summer,
when they were there,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.340
they could have been planting crops,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.362
they could have been fishing,
I mean this is actually

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:29.529
a pretty bountiful area when
it comes to natural resources

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.483
in plants and animals.

00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:36.418
But they were trying to find
gold, they were trying to

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:39.174
basically get rich quick,
this was the scheme.

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:41.028
But then winter rolled around.

00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:45.486
Those who hadn't already
been killed by mosquito-borne

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:49.532
illnesses, like malaria
or yellow fever, were now

00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:51.365
subject to starvation.

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:55.512
And there the story gets
even more complicated,

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:59.353
because the English settlers,
who were all men, by the way,

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.857
they were adventurers, they were not there

00:02:01.857 --> 00:02:05.130
to start families,
start a long-term colony

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.538
in the New World, they just
wanted to find gold and get out.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.687
So as these English colonists
are starving, they start to

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:15.088
run afoul of local Native Americans.

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:16.665
There were an Algonquian tribe

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:19.462
living in the Virginia
tidewater, who were under

00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:21.629
the rule of this man here.

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:26.440
This is a drawing of him
done by John Smith, who we'll

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.623
talk about in a second.

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:29.435
His name was Powhatan.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:33.018
His real name was Wahunsunacawh,
but the English called him

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:37.185
Powhatan, and the people
that he ruled, the Powhatans.

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:41.011
And as the English settlers
realized that they had not

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.354
put away enough for practically
any stores to get them

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:48.106
through the winter, they started
raiding the food supplies

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:50.695
of the Powhatans, which,
of course, didn't make them

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:53.553
very happy, they were also
trying to survive the winter.

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:57.651
Then the Powhatans kidnapped John Smith,

00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:00.623
and there's an engraving of him here.

00:03:00.623 --> 00:03:04.169
Uh, and they kinda tried
to show him their power.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.336
So there's a legend that
Powhatan was intending to execute

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.385
John Smith.

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:14.609
The daughter of Powhatan,
Pocahontas also wasn't her

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.948
real name, that was her
nickname, it kinda meant

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:19.106
little playful person.

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:23.225
Her real name was Matoaka,
but we know her today

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.144
by her nickname, Pocahontas.

00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:28.771
And Pocahontas intervened
and kept her father

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.615
from executing John Smith,
either out of the goodness

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.459
of her heart or maybe because
she had a crush on him.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.647
This is pretty much completely untrue.

00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:40.297
The Disney version of this
story says that Pocahontas

00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:43.249
and John Smith go on to fall
in love and get married.

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.460
The fact of the matter was that Pocahontas

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.127
was probably about 13
years old at the time.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:53.022
And she will go on to marry an Englishman,

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:56.145
but not John Smith, John Rolfe,

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:59.413
who is famous in another
way, which we'll get to soon.

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:03.306
It's also quite likely that
Powhatan didn't actually intend

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:05.202
to execute Smith.

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:08.756
Instead, what he was
doing was kind of a ritual

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:10.339
of power and mercy,

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.476
so he's doing kind of a mock execution,

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:19.364
saying, "All right, I have
the power to execute you."

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:23.435
But then, Pocahontas, playing
her ritual role, steps in

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.118
to say, "No, have mercy."

00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:28.021
So he says, you know, "I could kill you

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:29.199
"because I'm a strong leader,

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.758
"but because I an also a
merciful and just leader,

00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:32.819
"I will not."

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.598
So after his kidnapping, John
Smith really kinda steps up

00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:41.284
as the savior of Jamestown,
which probably would have

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:44.475
completely collapsed were it not for him.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:48.587
And in 1608, he takes over and says that,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:51.313
"He who shall not work shall not eat."

00:04:51.313 --> 00:04:55.480
So you gotta pull your weight
if you're gonna get supported

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:59.623
by the rest of the colonists.

00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:03.188
Nevertheless, the first
years at Jamestown were

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:04.584
pretty rough.

00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:08.584
In the winter of 1609 to
1610, which they called

00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:13.671
the starving time, the
colonists were so hungry that

00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:17.421
they resorted to eating vermin,

00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:21.967
and they resorted to eating each other.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:26.002
One man actually killed and
ate his wife in one of the

00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:29.346
few known examples of English cannibalism.

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.960
So Jamestown was a
pretty rough place to be.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.543
Only about 15%

00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:40.448
of the settlers who went to
Jamestown actually survived.

00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:45.827
In fact, that following spring of 1610,

00:05:45.827 --> 00:05:49.157
they decided to give up
and head back to England.

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:51.925
They were met, just as they were leaving,

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:53.508
by new supply ships

00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:58.302
that continued the Virginia experiment,

00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:02.922
which will become much more
successful after the discovery

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:03.839
of tobacco.

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:07.428
We'll get to that in the next video.
