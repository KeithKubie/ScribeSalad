00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.030
Well, I think the several factors are fueling
their growth.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.680
One is, of course, that Asians have finally
figured out, the seven pillars of Western

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.570
wisdom that enabled the West to succeed.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.330
My first book was called ‘Can Asians Think?’

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.119
question mark, and the reason I wrote the
book of studying the Asians you are so smart,

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.830
why did it take you so long to catch up with
the West, but now the good news is that they

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.010
finally caught up with the West and by implementing
their pillars of Western wisdom, like free

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.780
market economics, mastery of science and technology,
rule of law, meritocracy, pragmatism, education,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.220
cultural peace, and clearly you can see the
impact that is having on Asian societies and

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.049
all you have to do is remember that Asians
make up 55% of the world’s population and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.770
the West makes up only 12% of the world’s
population.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.740
So, if the Asians only perform half as well
as the West does, they are going to have the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.820
big world’s biggest economies.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.360
Is this mimcry?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.260
Well, I would say that - I would call it creative
copying, instead of mimicry.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.680
The Asians have pragmatically implemented
what works in their own societies, and it

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.080
is not easy to implement practices that come
from other societies, you always have to adapt

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.260
them to your own society.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.550
The fact that Asian societies have been able
to do that shows that they have reached a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.450
certain degree of competence in how to handle
their economy and how to manage their societies

00:01:56.450 --> 00:03:14.680
and that shows this is not just purely about
copying.
