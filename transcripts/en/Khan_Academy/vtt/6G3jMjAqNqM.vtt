00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.396
- [Instructor] A nutritionist
wants to estimate

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:04.017
the average caloric content

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:06.509
of the burritos at a popular restaurant.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.364
They obtain a random sample of 14 burritos

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:11.517
and measure their caloric content.

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:13.865
Their sample data are roughly symmetric

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.877
with a mean of 700 calories

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.617
and a standard deviation of 50 calories.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:19.905
Based on this sample,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.626
which of the following is
a 95% confidence interval

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:27.724
for the mean caloric
content of these burritos?

00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:31.767
So, pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.044
All right, what's going on here?

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:35.956
So, there's a population of burritos here.

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:39.156
There is a mean caloric
content that the nutritionist

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.030
wants to figure out but doesn't know

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.398
the true population parameter
here, the population mean

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.286
and so, the take a sample of 14 burritos

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.800
and they calculate some sample statistics.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.707
They calculate the sample mean

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.581
which is 700,

00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.809
they also calculate the
sample standard deviation

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.009
which is equal to 50

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:01.691
and they want to use this data

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.992
to construct a 95% confidence interval

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.753
and so, our confidence
interval is going to take

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.137
the form and we've seen this before,

00:01:09.137 --> 00:01:13.250
our sample mean plus or
minus our critical value

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.167
times the sample standard deviation

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:20.286
divided by the square root of N.

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.098
The reason why we're using a T statistic

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:23.042
is because we don't know

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:25.349
the actual standard
deviation for the population.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:27.553
If we knew the standard
deviation for the population,

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:30.685
we would use that instead of
our sample standard deviation

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:33.039
and if we use that, if we use sigma

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.553
which is a population parameter

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.924
then we could use a Z
statistic right over here,

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:39.406
we would use a Z distribution

00:01:39.406 --> 00:01:42.146
but since we're using this
sample standard deviation,

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.414
that's why we're using a T statistic

00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:45.306
but now let's do that.

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.765
So, what is this going to be?

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:49.641
So, our sample mean is 700,

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.403
they tell us that, so it's going to be 700

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:53.570
plus or minus,

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:57.650
so what would be our critical value

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.215
for a 95% confidence interval?

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.049
Well, we will just get out our T table

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.253
and with the T table, remember,

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:06.380
you have to care about degrees of freedom

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.388
and if our sample size is 14,

00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:11.748
then that means you take 14 minus one,

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.608
so degrees of freedom is N minus one,

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:16.276
so that's gonna be 14 minus one

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:17.881
is equal to 13.

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.050
So, we have 13 degrees of freedom

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.911
that we have to keep in mind

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.408
when we look at our T table,

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.731
so let's look at our T table,

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:25.946
so 95% confidence interval

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.113
and 13 degrees of freedom,

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:31.858
so degrees of freedom right over here,

00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:35.296
so we have 13 degrees of freedom,

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:38.213
so that is this row right over here

00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:42.970
and if we want a 95% confidence level,

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:46.290
then that means our tail probability,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.851
remember, if our distribution,

00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:50.180
let me see, I'll draw it really small,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.112
a little small distribution
right over here,

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:57.366
so if you want 95% of
the area in the middle,

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.198
that means you have five
percent not shaded in

00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.854
and that's evenly divided on each side,

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:03.645
so that means you have
two and a half percent

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.828
at the tails, two and a half percent,

00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:07.936
so what you want to look for

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.348
is the tail probability
of two and a half percent.

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:13.910
So, that is this right over here, .025,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.952
that two and a half percent

00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:15.857
and so, there you go,

00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:18.690
that is our critical value, 2.160.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.440
So, this part right over here,

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:27.806
so this is going to be two,

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:30.271
let me do that in a darker color,

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:32.354
this is going to be 2.160

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:35.620
times what's our sample
standard deviation?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.453
It's 50 over the square root of N,

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:40.982
square root of 14,

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.899
so all of our choices have the 700 there,

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:46.438
so we just need to figure out

00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:48.955
what our margin of error, this part of it

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.891
and we could use a calculator for that.

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.974
Okay, 2.16, ic an write a zero there,

00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:58.153
it doesn't really matter,

00:03:58.153 --> 00:03:58.986
times 50

00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:03.687
divided by the square root of 14,

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:11.726
we get a little bit of a drum
roll here I think, 28.86.

00:04:12.594 --> 00:04:14.996
So, this part right over here

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:16.913
is approximately 28.86.

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:19.169
That's our margin of error

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.467
and we see out of all
of these choices here

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:22.868
if we round to the nearest 10th

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:24.451
that would be 28.9,

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:28.448
so this is approximately 28.9

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:32.390
which is this choice right over here.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.601
This was an awfully close one.

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:34.657
I guess they're trying to make sure

00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:37.187
that we're looking at enough digits.

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:38.180
So, there we have it.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.679
We have established our
95% confidence interval.

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:44.493
Now, one thing that we
should keep in mind is

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.831
is this a valid confidence interval?

00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:50.348
Did we meet our conditions for
a valid confidence interval?

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:52.257
And here we have to think well,

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:53.745
did we take a random sample

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:57.725
and they tell us that they
obtained a random sample

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.360
of 14 burritos, so we check that one.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.313
Is the sampling
distribution roughly normal?

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:07.627
Well, if you take over 30 samples

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:11.295
then it would be but here we only took 14

00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:13.616
but they do tell us that the sample data

00:05:13.616 --> 00:05:15.146
is roughly symmetric

00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:16.374
and so, if it's roughly symmetric

00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:18.496
and it has no significant outliers,

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:20.701
then this is reasonable

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:21.534
that you can assume

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:24.108
that it is roughly normal

00:05:24.108 --> 00:05:25.255
and then the last condition

00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:26.871
is the independence condition

00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:30.232
and here if we aren't
sampling with replacement

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:31.681
and it doesn't look like we are,

00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:32.917
if we're not sampling with replacement,

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:37.084
this has to be less than 10%
of the population of burritos

00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:41.177
and we're assuming that
there's going to be

00:05:41.177 --> 00:05:43.551
more than 140 burritos

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.468
that this popular restaurant makes.

00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:50.154
So, I think we can meet the
independence condition as well,

00:05:50.154 --> 00:05:53.613
so assuming that you feel
good about constructing

00:05:53.613 --> 00:05:54.629
a confidence interval,

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.235
this is the one that you
would actually construct.
