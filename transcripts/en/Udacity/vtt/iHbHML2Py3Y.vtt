00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.840
So today we've discussed how to plan out actions using formal logic.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.189
We started off by talking about states, operators, and goals in formal logic.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.560
We then used those to contextualize our discussion on detecting conflicts that

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.645
might arise. This introduced the need for

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.560
partial-order planning which helps us avoid those conflicts beforehand.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.120
Finally we talked about hierarchical tasks networks which can be used for

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.390
hierarchical planning. Now, we're going to move on to understanding,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.160
which builds on our notion of frames from a few lessons ago, but if you're

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.110
interested in this, you can jump forward to our lessons on design. Configuration

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.980
and diagnosis leverage some of the concepts of planning very heavily.
