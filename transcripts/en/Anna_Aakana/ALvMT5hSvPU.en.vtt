00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.580
Hey guys, so a few weeks ago I made a video called

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.780
"Stop Saying No."

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.980
And it's about all the times where I would say

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.240
no to new experiences in my life or to going out

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.760
to just kind of being like at home alone and never

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.280
really doing anything different.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.480
But that video kind of like sparked this conversation

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.240
about all the people who struggle with saying no.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.980
And so I wanted to talk about that today.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.960
And I don't know about you but for me

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.320
I struggle a lot with saying no when people ask me

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.420
to do something or when they need something from me.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.960
Whether it's a stranger

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.920
Hey there, I'm so sorry to trouble you but could

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.780
my friends and I catch a ride with you?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180
Not if you're any less polite!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.140
Ahaha, great!

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.960
Thank you so much.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.980
Now drive or I'll shoot you like a rusted tin can on a wooden fence!

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.480
Drive!

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.980
Okay!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.080
Or my friend.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920
Oh my God, I'm not asking you for a lot.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.480
I'm just asking you to elaborately stage my death

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.760
so when I reveal myself, my boyfriend can learn to really listen.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.300
Well...

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.300
Or my cat.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.660
But you already ate.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.360
But as I've gotten older, and more confident

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.480
and wiser, I'm starting to become a lot more comfortable with this idea

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.200
that it is okay to draw a line with people.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.780
You know?  It's totally fine to say that you don't want to do something.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.580
Hey there, I'm so sorry to trouble you but

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.400
could my friends and I catch a ride with you?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.200
Okay, all right.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.840
Back it up.  Thank you.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.840
Thank you so much.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.460
Or that you're uncomfortable.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.280
I just think that's kind of a dick thing to do.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.320
Well how else is he suppose to learn how to really listen?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.440
Or to just create a boundary.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.980
The vet said you're too fat.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.060
What about you?  Do you find it hard to say no?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880
When do you find it hard to say no?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.520
Or are you just like totally self assured and you don't care

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.740
about turning people down?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.880
Let me know below!

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.320
I have a few live shows coming up if you guys

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.000
are in the Los Angeles area.  We do like little meet-and-greets

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.740
afterwards and we have an insane photoshoot with all of the people there.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.800
So you should come!

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.180
And I also have two short films coming out this Summer

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.020
One is called "Supers &amp; Associates" which is a superhero comedy

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.300
and one is called "Loose Ends" which is a thriller

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.980
and crazy stuff happens.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.180
And also Ghosts and Stars has a bunch of new Summer stuff in!

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.860
Like this!  The Chill Out cool cat shirt and a bunch of rompers

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.800
so if you want to check out my clothingline, feel free!

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
And I want to say thank you to NuMe for sponsoring today's episode.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.780
They sent me this glorious pentacle wand that you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.240
cast spells with.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.880
But I love the NuMe Wand because it's such great quality.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.480
I can use this wand for years.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.280
And I love the ceramic magic technology of it all

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.940
because I have like thick Asian hair that will not hold curls.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.580
But whenever I curl my hair with one of their products

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.260
it will last for a good like 2 days.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.080
Which is awesome because I hate doing touch ups.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.540
They also sent me some Argan oil

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.500
which is like anti-frizz heat serum protectant.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.300
And my hair just looks so shiney and nice when I put it in.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300
It's just like I'm a queen.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.640
So thanks so much to NuMe.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.400
You guys can use the code PentacleMagic

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.540
to get $100 off of any curling set

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.600
or, if you just want one wand, you can use the code Unicorns

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.680
to get any wand for $39.00.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.180
I'll have those in the description box if you're interested.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.320
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
