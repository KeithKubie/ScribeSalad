00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.212
This might be one of the most
beautiful camps I've ever...

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.851
had the pleasure to stay at.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.285
( Hilaree laughing )

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:24.657 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.426 line:0%
Only at this camp

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.027 line:0%
at 18,200 feet,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.763
were we finally on our route

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.798
which is totally insane.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.068
<i>And we were only, maybe a
thousand feet below the summit</i>

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:38.404
<i> when we were like,
 "Oh, yeah! This is it!</i>

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.406
<i>We're definitely here. We're
where we're supposed to be."</i>

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:43.943 line:0%
You can see how narrow this
ridge is that we're camped on.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.278 line:0%
And it was just big
enough to set up

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.280 line:0%
a three-man tent and
a two-man tent.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.415
<i> And this was where</i>

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.718
<i> a lot of hard decision
 and human dynamic</i>

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.553
<i> kind of came into play
 and I also think</i>

00:00:54.553 --> 00:01:00.392
that's what's, this is what
makes this trip so interesting.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:03.763
And... so hard at the same time

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:07.467
was that essentially we
knew from this point on

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:11.304
we knew we only had food
for two, maybe three days.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:14.407
And... we didn't
have the resources

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.042
for all five of us
to go to the summit.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.044
And the climbing was only
getting more complicated

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.447
as we went higher and...

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.415
a lot of back and forth
went on at this point.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.085
I think, Emily knew that she was
gonna be staying at the camp

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.687
and not climbing higher.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.889
And at one point early on,
I was...

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.560
sort of talking with Mark and
they were very clear that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.196
they didn't have
confidence in me climbing.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.332
They did not want me
to go to the summit.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:43.136
And it was very hard for
to me to swallow that.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.674
I felt really strong, I was very
motivated to go to the top.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.909
I thought a lot of the
trip was about Mark and I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.079
and our partnership and so...

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.884
<i> to be told that was very
difficult, to say the least.</i>

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.286
<i> What followed was kind
 of this back and forth.</i>

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.023
Eventually we... I was going
to be on the climbing team

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.026
but something just, just
wasn't sitting right with me.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.161
And that night,
I went to bed and

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.365
just to give you a little bit
of like, what was going on

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.735
while we're trying to make
these decisions is that

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.937
the wind on this
ridge was blowing

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.972
it was gusting, up to
70 miles an hour.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:22.207
And we were really
exposed on this ridge

00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:23.742
so it's coming under the tents

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.377
it feels like you're
gonna get blown away.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:27.547
We all had every
stitch of clothing on

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.948
that you could possibly...
that we had!

00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:32.151
And we're still kind of
these shivvy-bivvys.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.619
We're still freezing.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.755
We knew we only had enough
food for three days.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.392
We had very limited ropes and

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.994
no idea how far it was
to the summit, still.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:43.496
So, kind of, all
these pressures.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.433
We were, you know, almost
40 days into this expedition.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.836
We'd all probably lost like

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.237
I'd lost ten pounds off
of this frame already.

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:55.175
Mark was like, bone thin and...

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.744
we knew we still had, you
know, two weeks to go.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.346
So, there was a lot of stress.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.981
And it was probably one of

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.582
the hardest decisions
I've ever made.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:06.953
But, there had been this...
seed of doubt

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.721
placed in me from
the day before.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.223
And over the night
it just grew and

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:15.328
I felt like our trust as a team
had really been compromised.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.498
And my place in the team,
was to be with Emily.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.032
And I made the decision...

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.168
you know at like,
five in the morning

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:25.805
to not go to the summit
and Cory took my place

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:29.008
and the three of them
left right after.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.510
<i> So, this is the
 three of those guys</i>

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.680
<i>heading out from our high camp.</i>

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.748
<i>So, just to give you an idea</i>

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:39.118
<i> of the complicated
 climbing that followed.</i>

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.120
We were at 18,200 feet.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.989
They climbed for
eight hours that day

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.225
and they gained about 400 feet.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.194
And these are like,
pretty good climbers.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.497
They didn't get very far.
And they went up and down.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.565
That's why it was kind of
like the jungle.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.800
It's like going up these ridges
and down these ridges.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.301
And they set up a two-man tent

00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:58.204
and the three of them
slept in that.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.639
And this is just a
short video about

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.441
what their climbing experience

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.809
was like going towards
the summit.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:08.815
( instrumental music )

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.896
Conrad:<i> Now we're on the south
 side of the sun.</i>

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.798
<i>We can see our objective.</i>

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.133
<i> We have high hopes.</i>

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.838
It's hard, it's real climbing.
This is alpine climbing.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:38.444
( wind rustling )

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.352
But meanwhile, Emily and I
were still at high camp.

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.955
And we were there for four days

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.092
<i> on this tiny little
 ridge, trying to</i>

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.560
<i> just survive and
 make it through.</i>

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.898
<i>And Emily is pretty cheerful.</i>

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.933
<i>She was trying to cook these,
 like scones</i>

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.736
<i> that are supposed to be
 cooked on a stove on...</i>

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.506
<i>on the top of our pot and
they never cooked, obviously.</i>

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:11.077
<i>We ate them anyways and totally
had horrible stomachs after.</i>

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.279
<i> So in those four days...</i>

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.315
we stopped eating
after the first day

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.316
because we were trying to
save food for the guys.

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:19.451
We realized as we
walked around the tent

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:21.854
that the guys had taken
all of the ropes.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.689
And this was totally
an accident...

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:26.892
with all the conditions
and everything going on

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:27.860
none of us thought it through.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.763
But, we had no ropes and it was
really dangerous climbing.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.665
And if those guys didn't come
back, we had no way to get down.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:36.302
So, it was... pretty terrifying.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.536
At one point I sent--

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.872
and I'll get into some of
our communications.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.308
But, our communications
were so crazy

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:46.178
that we were communicating with
Emily's dad in the United States

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:49.181
and he would call on a satellite
phone to Taylor at base camp.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.783
And at one point, I texted him

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:54.320
"So, you know, we don't
have any ropes.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.422
So, if you could
tell Taylor that

00:05:57.422 --> 00:05:58.724
that if we have
to come down

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.527
it's gonna be, it might
take us a while."

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:04.831
And I'm like, "Oh my God, I'm
writing this to Emily's dad!"

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:08.133
And he writes back and
he's like, "What?"

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:09.468
( audience laughter )

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:11.037
I was like, "Yeah!"

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:16.776
But, this is a, this a
little video from Emily

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:19.645
about base camp,
or high camp.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.349
This is the fourth day
that we are stuck...

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:27.453
at 18,000 feet.

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.991
In this tent, in the wind...

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:36.996
Going a little stir crazy.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:43.335
But, this is our view.
I'll show you.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.572
( wind rustling )

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.715
<i> That's Tibet.</i>

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.019
<i> That's Burma.</i>

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.291
<i>This is where base camp is.</i>

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.727
So, Emily and I watched...
she had like, her phone and

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:10.463
you could see that,
sort of, a solar panel

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:13.499
We were watching like, episodes
of "Portlandia" on our phone.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.566
( audience laughter )

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.402
Laughing hysterically and since,

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:19.438
I've tried watching them at home
and they're so not... as funny.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:21.540
But, they were really
funny up there.

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:24.911
<i>So, Mark made the decision,
 when he was at...</i>

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.847
<i>you know, I think the high
point was about 18,800 feet.</i>

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.216
He thought it looked like
the summit was still

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.817
almost a thousand feet
above them

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:32.852
which would definitely make it

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.620
the highest peak
in Southeast Asia.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:36.822
But, they turned around.

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.523
And it was a really
tough decision

00:07:38.523 --> 00:07:40.726
but, it was definitely
the right one.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.528
We were too strung out.

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.930
<i>And Emily and I had already
 made the decision that</i>

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.964
<i>as soon as they were back</i>

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:47.566
<i> we were gonna set up the
 two-man tent.</i>

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:50.536
<i>The next morning, early, we were
gonna grab one of the ropes</i>

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.772
grab as much gear, as we
could and take it down.

00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:56.475
Because, we still had to set up
anchors all the way down and

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:59.011
do all these rapps in order to
get back to base camp, rappels.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:02.347
<i> So, we got up at about
five-thirty in the morning</i>

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:05.017
<i>and the two of us started
heading down the mountain.</i>

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:11.023
<i>And, the relief I felt, as soon
as we started walking down.</i>

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:15.895
<i>It's indescribable. And I think,
I've thought about it a lot.</i>

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:19.031
<i>I think it was the first time,
 in over a month</i>

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:24.002
<i>that we were walking on terrain
and knew where we were going.</i>

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:25.705
<i>So, if you can imagine that.</i>

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:28.373
<i>We were like, retracing our
 steps for the first time</i>

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:29.909
<i>since we'd landed in Yangon.</i>

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.411
<i>We were setting up anchors
 and rapping down</i>

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.880
<i> that huge north face,
 trying to get down.</i>

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.516
<i> Finally, we walked
 down to camp one and</i>

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:41.319
<i>we had a little stash of food
and we had all this extra fuel.</i>

00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:44.790
And we got totally like,
crazy like, maniacal

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.559
and we're like,
burning everything...

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.727
that was in our packs.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:50.229
Which was sort of funny.

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:51.897
But, we ate a little
bit of the food

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.299
and we went down to base camp.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.835
<i> And not too long after,
the guys came down, because</i>

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.003
<i>you know, all the ropes were
 in place and everything.</i>

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:00.439
And, it was like,
this crazy re-entry.

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:03.075
All of a sudden, we were like,
sitting on dry ground.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.910
There was a fire.

00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:08.547
We were eating real food,
instead of freeze dried food.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:12.451
<i> And then, slowly as we
 were walking out like,</i>

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.021
<i> things from civilization
started coming back at us.</i>

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.692
<i>Like, I remember the first time,
like, sitting in a chair.</i>

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.927
<i>All that kind of stuff hits
you as you're coming down</i>

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:24.162
<i> when you've been
 that stretched out.</i>

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:26.432
<i>And this picture, was kind of</i>

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:29.835
<i> at the height of how
 hungry we were.</i>

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.704
<i> I mean, these villages
 don't have anything.</i>

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.405
<i> So, we were just,
 we had basically</i>

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.906
<i> two bowls of rice a day</i>

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:38.511
<i> for ten days over
 130 miles of walking.</i>

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.545
<i> This picture is awesome</i>

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.746
<i>because everything sounds
 so grim and desperate.</i>

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.849
<i>But really, we laughed a lot.</i>

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.518
<i> And Emily, is totally
 smoking a cigarette</i>

00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:48.921
<i> and drinking rice wine
 out of this bottle</i>

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.522
<i> that we were sharing
 with the locals</i>

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:53.425
<i> because it was the first
alcohol we'd had in six weeks.</i>

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:55.427
We hadn't had
showers in a month.

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.629
Emily doesn't smoke, by the way.

00:09:57.629 --> 00:09:59.632
Neither of us, none of us, do.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:05.204
But, like, smoking really helps
if you're absolutely starving.

00:10:05.737 --> 00:10:06.571
And we were.

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:07.906
So, that might
be the only cigarette

00:10:07.906 --> 00:10:08.974
I've ever seen her have.

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:11.544
Just saying that, because
she doesn't smoke.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:15.014
<i> Finally, we made
 it back to Putao.</i>

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.583
<i> And we had showers and
 we were so strung out</i>

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.452
<i> that I literally
 like, saw the shower</i>

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.586
and freaked out.

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.087
I couldn't take a shower.

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:25.390
I... pulled out my
disgusting sleeping bag

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.193
and laid it on this
bed with nice sheets

00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:29.561
and I slept in my sleeping bag.

00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:30.996
And I didn't take
a shower for like

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:32.931
24 hours after getting
back to Putao

00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:34.733
because I just didn't
know what to do.

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:38.404
Like, my clothes were like,
part of my skin at that point

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:41.006
and so I was afraid to
kind of, take them off.

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.275
But, this was post shower.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.378
Emily even put on some make
up and we were drinking beer.

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.847
It was really
surreal, basically.

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:51.917
So, just one more video

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.920
kind of, taking us
out of the mountains.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.923
( instrumental music )

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:03.329
( speaking in Burmese )

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.731
Wow, you guys, oh, my God!

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.801
Decompressing a little?

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:14.172
( speaking in Burmese )

00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:17.309
( unclear ) are not easy...

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.912
( instrumental music )

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:33.892
Hilaree:<i> Full stripping down
 of all the mirrors</i>

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:39.865
<i>and the most stretched out and
beaten down I've ever been.</i>

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:47.606
So, I'm gonna go back to this
picture that I started with.

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:50.275
Because, now you have a better
idea of why we were like that.

00:11:50.275 --> 00:11:52.644
<i> I'm just gonna, kind
 of, end with a quote.</i>

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:53.979
<i>This is a quote from Mark Twain.</i>

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.880
<i> "Twenty years from now</i>

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.949
<i>you'll be more disappointed
by the things that you didn't do</i>

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:59.418
<i>than by the ones you did do.</i>

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:02.487
<i>So, throw off the bowline,
sail away from the safe harbor</i>

00:12:02.487 --> 00:12:04.690
<i> catch the trade winds
 in your sails.</i>

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.758
<i>Explore. Dream. Discover."</i>

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.395
<i>And then to add, in my own words</i>

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.129
<i> kind of what I learned
 from this trip is--</i>

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:14.566
<i> Don't let the fear
 of failure stop you.</i>

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:17.002
<i> Fear of failure is a
 really powerful thing.</i>

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:19.204
<i>It's paralyzing at times.</i>

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:21.973
<i> But, there's no courage,
 without fear.</i>

00:12:21.973 --> 00:12:26.045
<i>So, embrace the fear, love
the suffering, take a risk</i>

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:30.048
<i>laugh at yourself, a lot.
 And dive in and try</i>

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:34.219
'cause, you'll never have an
adventure without a little fear.

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:36.521
That's it. Thanks!

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:38.257
( applause )
