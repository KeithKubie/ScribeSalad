1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.080
Well,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.940
the disingenuous media that's being less and less taken seriously taking less

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.000
and less seriously.
It's,
it seems to me that that trend,

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.690
which is a common trend that's existed for the last few years of these click

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.600
baity bullshit articles and mislabeling people,

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.000
it's going to go away because your,
your,

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.450
your perspective is not going to be appreciated.
It,

8
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.260
it's not going to be respected if you,

9
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:27.150
if you're obviously making disingenuous statements like that.
And I think,
um,

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.650
we're in this weird position where it's very difficult to find real journalism

11
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.510
and real objective takes on things that aren't flavored by their ideology and

12
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.450
everybody's trying to shape everybody and they feel like it's their obligation.

13
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.450
They feel there's many people that write things that feel like it's their

14
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.451
obligation to change your perspective on a national subjects and things that are

15
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:51.600
important to us that it's not their obligation just report what's going on,

16
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.830
but also their obligation to flavor things in a way that'll make one side look

17
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.840
favorable to the other.

18
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.920
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I'm,
I'm very much in favor of journalists revealing their biases.</v>

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.641
I think that the,

20
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.250
the greatest line media is that objective journalism is a thing.

21
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.920
So I'm conservative.
You only go to my site,

22
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:08.170
you'll get a conservative spend on the news.
That's the way it's gonna work.

23
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.011
Right?
And guess what?

24
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.470
CNN is liberal and they are going to give you the liberal spin on the news.

25
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.850
And that's just the way this is going to work.

26
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.670
Did you see the video when the Mueller report came out and they look like

27
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:20.290
somebody got killed?
Oh my God.
It was crazy.
Shit.
Kennedy got shot.
Yeah.
Exit.

28
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.890
Shouldn't you be happy if you guys believed in Mueller?
Everybody was like,

29
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:28.390
Mueller is the fucking man.
He's going to go get Trump.
This guy is methodical.

30
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.420
He's precise keeping,
he's getting voted out and everything.

31
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.780
Votive candles with his face on them that they could like burn.
They were pumped.

32
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.420
Yeah.
And then he came out and it was like,
well,
no collusion or it was like,
well,

33
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.190
I guess that now to cover up.
It's like,
what?
Wait a minute.

34
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.460
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe the narrative has it.
Maybe the narrative has,
has,

35
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.920
has trumped the actual job you were supposed to do guys.

36
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.511
<v 0>Wow.</v>

37
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:52.350
It's just so many people were so convinced and there were so many people that

38
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.650
were making statements that in retrospect

39
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
<v 1>probably like you could probably,</v>

40
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.120
I mean I don't want to say I'm not a litigious person,

41
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.860
but if I was a guy like Donald Trump,
oh man.
Yeah.
There's so many people to sue.

42
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.480
Is it?
It was amazing.

43
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.690
I mean I remember as on Bill Maher's show and we're supposed to talk about free

44
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.520
speech stuff in like five minutes before and he's like,

45
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.100
let's talk about Russia is producer came in and let's talk about Russia.

46
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.160
And I was like,
okay,
fine.
So we get on producers are that,
yeah.

47
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.920
This is like right before they switched the topic for your TV shows where they

48
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.720
just tell you what you have to talk about.

49
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.200
I know it's your guy comes in with a clipboard.
Yeah,
it was,
it was a little bit,

50
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.100
it was a little bit strange.
And we got on stage and he's talking about Trump,

51
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.320
Russia collusion.
And I said what I've always said,

52
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.990
which is I'll wait for the evidence to come out and then I will make a decision

53
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.200
as to whether Trump,
Russia collusion was a thing and Bill Maher's radical.

54
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.410
I know.
And Bill Margot's you don't,
you don't believe it was a thing.

55
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.510
And I was like,
well I don't see any evidence yet that it was a thing.

56
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.290
Like I see some evidence of attempts to collude like John Jr I see some attempts

57
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.730
of people trying to get information.

58
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.070
I don't see evidence of like actual legal collusion.

59
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.060
And why don't we just wait like you guys keep wanting Mueller to give us like

60
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.550
let's just wait on it.
And Mark could not believe that this was my perspective.

61
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.850
Right.
It was like,
it was like shocking to him.
Why should,

62
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.930
why should the perspective,

63
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.870
I'm waiting for more evidence be shocking to anyone when it is obvious the

64
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.820
evidence is not out.
Like why?
Why is that in any way controversial?

65
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.790
It's but willing to me,

66
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.040
<v 0>it's because people have this need to let everyone know that they're on the</v>

67
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.660
right side and they want you to know that they do believe in the collusion.

68
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.210
If you disagree with that for whatever reason,

69
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.680
you must either be a right wing person,
a Trump supporter,

70
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.210
or someone who's in denial,

71
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.010
someone who doesn't look at the evidence and you're a part of the problem.
Yep.

72
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.510
But the,
the real problem was jumping to conclusions.

73
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.600
There obviously seem to be some attempts.
There's,

74
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:48.010
there's obviously some fuckery with that IRA company that the Internet research

75
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.570
agency that is responsible for millions of interactions with people online where

76
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.100
they pretended to be,
right.
Different supporters roles.
Yeah.
They,

77
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.790
they caused conflict,
like constant conflict in regards to political opinion.

78
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.750
And that's all real.

79
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.360
That was coordinated effort to try to change people's opinions.

80
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.450
But how much did that had to do with Donald Trump?
How much did he ask for?

81
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.830
First of all,
you've got no evidence.

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.380
<v 1>Also,
I was always bewildered by this theory.
Like,
did you watch that campaign?
Um,</v>

83
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.860
that was not the most well coordinated campaign and it was chaos.
It was chaos.

84
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.500
I mean I knew everybody who is in the campaign.
Like it was a,

85
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.710
it was a shit show then the idea that they're sitting there but there,

86
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.720
but when the mask comes off at night,

87
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.560
they call it Vladimir Putin and they put together a point by point plan on how

88
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:32.450
they're going to swing this particular precinct in rural,

89
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.530
in rural Michigan.
It's like,
what?
What are you,
are you guys hi?
Like really?

90
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.310
What are you talking about?
Like what?

91
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.410
Like if you could attribute this to any here,

92
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.840
here's a good rule of thumb for politics.
Attribute everything to stupidity.

93
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:47.310
Unless you can prove malice.

94
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.090
<v 0>The real problem,</v>

95
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.900
and this is something that is very similar to what we were talking about
earlier.

96
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.410
When you say something and you say it over and over and over again,

97
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.520
and you say it with such conviction and it becomes a giant part of your news

98
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.880
narrative and then that something turns out to be horseshit.
Yup.

99
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.400
You just massively empowered Trump.

100
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.590
<v 1>Well that's it.
That's exactly right.</v>

101
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:12.380
And I'm gonna ask for a long time that you know,

102
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:15.140
I'm not a big fan of Trump's fake news shtick because I think he applies it to

103
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:18.050
broadly.
I think that whenever there's a bad piece of news,
he's like fake news.

104
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:20.480
And it's like,
well sometimes yes and sometimes no.

105
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.990
But now that you just blew a two year narrative where he was clearly in Putin's

106
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:24.824
pocket,

107
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.460
how many people you think gonna listen to the nuanced view of fake news now and

108
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.800
how many people do you think are going to actually believe Trump when he says

109
00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:33.310
that a bad piece of news is legitimately a fake piece of news.

110
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.810
<v 0>Yeah.
It empowers him in a,
in a,
in a spectacular manner.</v>

111
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.340
They made a giant mistake.

112
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.740
<v 1>Oh yeah.
And they blew,
they blew this one in spectacular.
Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.340
<v 0>And people are still hanging in there.
Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.980
<v 1>All they had to do.
This is true for so many people right now.</v>

115
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.770
All you have to do is not be crazy.
Just stop it.

116
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.801
<v 0>Got It.</v>

117
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.770
It was talking about the possibility that Trump has been a Russian assets since

118
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.190
like 1987 or some shit.
I mean Andrew Mccabe,

119
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.850
<v 1>the former FBI director was asked whether Trump was legitimately a Russian asset</v>

120
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.684
and he's like,
I don't know.

121
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.170
It's like you're using the power of the institution you used to run to spread

122
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:10.490
this nonsense and you got that from John Brennan.
He got it from James Clapper.

123
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:12.620
These are all former heads of the intelligence agencies.

124
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.580
Just makes me think the intelligence agencies need to be wildly car back.

125
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.460
If these were the heads of them.

126
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.690
I mean if like the heads of the intelligence agencies are using their platform

127
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.880
to proclaim that they have inside information about Trump,

128
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.110
that turns out to be utter nonsense.

129
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.370
I'm not sure that these people should have that much power to like she said that

130
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.550
what he's saying or is he saying he doesn't know?
He didn't say,
I dunno.

131
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.590
He was saying like I have basically I expect that Mueller is going to indict as

132
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.400
a former intelligence professional.
I expect that.
Yeah,
the the the,

133
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.430
there's a lot of that.
It was ugly.
Adam Schiff on the,

134
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.920
on the Intel Committee doing the same thing.

135
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.940
It's crazy now because like what do they do now or how do they rebound from this

136
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:51.350
if this is the letting go once.
This is something you said for two years,
right?

137
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.290
You've seen the compilation video.
Yeah.
The whole are amazing.

138
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.060
They've done them to rap music,
so they're like,
they've,

139
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.980
they've put a beat behind it.
If you seen it.
Now I know there's some great ones,

140
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.840
some great comp.
There's compilations of people saying possible collusion.

141
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.480
Possible collusion.
Possible.
Yeah.

142
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.090
And this music that goes with it and they just cut to possible collusion with

143
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:15.500
the Russians.
Possible Russian collusion.
Possible Russian collusion.
It's,
