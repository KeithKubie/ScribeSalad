00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so we want to look up all of our artwork

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
out of our database.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In theory, we just put something in the database.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's see if we can find it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We want to do this every time we render that front page.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We want to both show the form, and we want to show the artwork.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I'm going to add some text to this render front function.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Our arts equal--and this is how we run a query.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We say db.GqlQuery,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then we can include our query.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But first, I would like you to tell me what that query is going to be.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So what I'd like you to do is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
write for me the SQL--in this case, the GQL--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to fetch all of the instances of arts

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
from our database, sorted by the creation time.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, I know this is a little bit much to ask.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In this case, Arts is going to be the name of the table.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's how you do GQL queries.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And remember creation time?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That field was called created.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Okay, good luck.
