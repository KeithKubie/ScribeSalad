well I mean I think a low-calorie diet

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110
well I mean I think a low-calorie diet
 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.929
well I mean I think a low-calorie diet
is probably a good thing I think in

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939
is probably a good thing I think in
 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.230
is probably a good thing I think in
humans we don't know there's no data on

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240
humans we don't know there's no data on
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.570
humans we don't know there's no data on
what a low-calorie diet does in terms of

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580
what a low-calorie diet does in terms of
 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.010
what a low-calorie diet does in terms of
diseases and longevity as I said before

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020
diseases and longevity as I said before
 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.740
diseases and longevity as I said before
by analogy to rodents you would think it

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750
by analogy to rodents you would think it
 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.380
by analogy to rodents you would think it
would be a good thing on the other hand

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390
would be a good thing on the other hand
 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.240
would be a good thing on the other hand
if it made you really miserable to eat a

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250
if it made you really miserable to eat a
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.150
if it made you really miserable to eat a
thousand calories a day and people who

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160
thousand calories a day and people who
 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.910
thousand calories a day and people who
are on that diet tend to be cold they

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
are on that diet tend to be cold they
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.350
are on that diet tend to be cold they
tend to have very low sex drive they

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
tend to have very low sex drive they
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.180
tend to have very low sex drive they
tend to in some cases be irritable and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190
tend to in some cases be irritable and
 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.370
tend to in some cases be irritable and
so if you're not happy then that gets

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380
so if you're not happy then that gets
 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.990
so if you're not happy then that gets
back to what we're saying earlier you

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000
back to what we're saying earlier you
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.709
back to what we're saying earlier you
may be undoing some of the good that

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719
may be undoing some of the good that
 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.720
may be undoing some of the good that
that diet would otherwise produce so my

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730
that diet would otherwise produce so my
 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.260
that diet would otherwise produce so my
feeling is to live sensibly I'm there

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270
feeling is to live sensibly I'm there
 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.840
feeling is to live sensibly I'm there
the work would advise that I think is

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850
the work would advise that I think is
 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.580
the work would advise that I think is
good it's hard to follow but I think

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590
good it's hard to follow but I think
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.469
good it's hard to follow but I think
what everybody should do if everybody

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479
what everybody should do if everybody
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.499
what everybody should do if everybody
could do this it's the best you can do

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509
could do this it's the best you can do
 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.510
could do this it's the best you can do
right now is decide what is your perfect

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520
right now is decide what is your perfect
 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.490
right now is decide what is your perfect
weight your body weight what's perfect

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500
weight your body weight what's perfect
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.680
weight your body weight what's perfect
for you and I think what most people do

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690
for you and I think what most people do
 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.339
for you and I think what most people do
is rifle through the past and and and

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:27.349
is rifle through the past and and and
 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.139
is rifle through the past and and and
decide and you know when they were most

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149
decide and you know when they were most
 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.740
decide and you know when they were most
happy with themselves and do everything

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750
happy with themselves and do everything
 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.809
happy with themselves and do everything
possible to get to that weight and keep

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819
possible to get to that weight and keep
 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.230
possible to get to that weight and keep
to it and I think that that would

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
to it and I think that that would
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.180
to it and I think that that would
necessarily make you healthier

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190
necessarily make you healthier
 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.990
necessarily make you healthier
most people healthier than they are now

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000
most people healthier than they are now
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.050
most people healthier than they are now
beyond that I you know I take a vitamin

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
beyond that I you know I take a vitamin
 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.330
beyond that I you know I take a vitamin

I think vitamin D I do not take

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
I think vitamin D I do not take
 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.400
I think vitamin D I do not take
resveratrol that a lot of people do and

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410
resveratrol that a lot of people do and
 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.940
resveratrol that a lot of people do and
the reason is I'm waiting for a 100%

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
the reason is I'm waiting for a 100%
 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.350
the reason is I'm waiting for a 100%
pure and reliable source of it and then

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360
pure and reliable source of it and then
 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.600
pure and reliable source of it and then
I will take it and I drink a little wine

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
I will take it and I drink a little wine
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.680
I will take it and I drink a little wine
and all the data says again there's an

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
and all the data says again there's an
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.809
and all the data says again there's an
optimum I think the data says that too

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819
optimum I think the data says that too
 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.259
optimum I think the data says that too
much wine is bad but no wine is not

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269
much wine is bad but no wine is not
 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.500

such studies it's been a long time since
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.040
such studies it's been a long time since
there's been good data on humans on

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
there's been good data on humans on
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350
there's been good data on humans on
calorie restriction and part of the

calorie restriction and part of the
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.980
calorie restriction and part of the
problem has been that humans tend to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990
problem has been that humans tend to
 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.820
problem has been that humans tend to
cheat on the diet so controlled studies

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830
cheat on the diet so controlled studies
 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.940
cheat on the diet so controlled studies
end up not being so controlled but

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950
end up not being so controlled but
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.440

it's protecting them against diseases

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
it's protecting them against diseases
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.930
it's protecting them against diseases
but you can't ask if it's eliciting the

but you can't ask if it's eliciting the
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.780
but you can't ask if it's eliciting the
kinds of physiological changes that you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790
kinds of physiological changes that you
 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.300
kinds of physiological changes that you
expect in calorie restriction which

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
expect in calorie restriction which
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.210
expect in calorie restriction which
would be a loss of body fat a lowering

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
would be a loss of body fat a lowering
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.490
would be a loss of body fat a lowering

calorie restriction in humans that's
roughly the same thing that it does in

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270
roughly the same thing that it does in
 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.800

now just one footnote on one of those

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830
now just one footnote on one of those
 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.470
now just one footnote on one of those
studies so in rodents what we knew is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480
studies so in rodents what we knew is
 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.479
studies so in rodents what we knew is
that some of these sirtuin activators

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489
that some of these sirtuin activators
 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.680
that some of these sirtuin activators
could activate muscle to process glucose

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
could activate muscle to process glucose
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.620
could activate muscle to process glucose
better and it was doing that at least in

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630
better and it was doing that at least in
 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.280
better and it was doing that at least in
part by activating the synthesis of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290
part by activating the synthesis of
 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650
part by activating the synthesis of
mitochondria these are organelles in

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
mitochondria these are organelles in
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.900
mitochondria these are organelles in
cells they're called the powerhouses of

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
cells they're called the powerhouses of
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.800
cells they're called the powerhouses of
cells that make energy for cells and by

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
cells that make energy for cells and by
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.350
cells that make energy for cells and by
activating mitochondria you sort of

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360
activating mitochondria you sort of
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.690
activating mitochondria you sort of
drive metabolism and you drive the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700
drive metabolism and you drive the
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.610
drive metabolism and you drive the
uptake of glucose from the blood into

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
uptake of glucose from the blood into
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.380
uptake of glucose from the blood into
the muscle and the processing of glucose

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390
the muscle and the processing of glucose
 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.610
the muscle and the processing of glucose
so it's a good thing it's an anti

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
so it's a good thing it's an anti
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.630
so it's a good thing it's an anti
diabetic thing and this process is can

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640
diabetic thing and this process is can
 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.509
diabetic thing and this process is can
be driven by thirty-one the survival

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519
be driven by thirty-one the survival
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.620
be driven by thirty-one the survival
gene in muscle in rodents now it was

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630
gene in muscle in rodents now it was
 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.510
gene in muscle in rodents now it was
done first with resveratrol but it turns

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520
done first with resveratrol but it turns
 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.460
done first with resveratrol but it turns
out calorie restriction in rodents does

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470
out calorie restriction in rodents does
 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.620
out calorie restriction in rodents does
the same thing you activate the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630
the same thing you activate the
 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.470
the same thing you activate the
synthesis of mitochondria in muscle okay

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480
synthesis of mitochondria in muscle okay
 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.420
synthesis of mitochondria in muscle okay
and that makes them more metabolically

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
and that makes them more metabolically
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.159
and that makes them more metabolically
active and it's a good thing

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169
active and it's a good thing
 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.150
active and it's a good thing
metabolically

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160
metabolically
 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.580
metabolically
okay now to get back to the humans what

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
okay now to get back to the humans what
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.250
okay now to get back to the humans what
they were able to show

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260
they were able to show
 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.550
they were able to show
this trial is they took punch biopsies

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560
this trial is they took punch biopsies
 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.500
this trial is they took punch biopsies
of muscle from the people that were on

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510
of muscle from the people that were on
 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.690
of muscle from the people that were on
the calorie restriction diet for six

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700
the calorie restriction diet for six
 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.250
the calorie restriction diet for six
months and what they found in their

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260
months and what they found in their
 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.950
months and what they found in their
muscles was an increase in mitochondria

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960
muscles was an increase in mitochondria
 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.950
muscles was an increase in mitochondria
and an increase in the levels of the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960
and an increase in the levels of the
 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.110
and an increase in the levels of the
thirty-one protein the protein was

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120
thirty-one protein the protein was
 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.170
thirty-one protein the protein was
actually increased in the muscle in

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
actually increased in the muscle in
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.600
actually increased in the muscle in
response to calorie restriction so that

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610
response to calorie restriction so that
 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.590
response to calorie restriction so that
says that the congruence between mice

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600
says that the congruence between mice
 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.580
says that the congruence between mice
and humans may be quite profound with

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590
and humans may be quite profound with
 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.320
and humans may be quite profound with
regard to calorie restriction so we

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330
regard to calorie restriction so we
 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.240
regard to calorie restriction so we
can't say any there's no direct evidence

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250
can't say any there's no direct evidence
 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.030
can't say any there's no direct evidence
in humans about diseases certainly not

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040
in humans about diseases certainly not
 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.340
in humans about diseases certainly not
about lifespan but at least basic

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350
about lifespan but at least basic
 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.150
about lifespan but at least basic
physiology looks like it might be

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160
physiology looks like it might be
 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240
physiology looks like it might be
similar in humans so that might make a

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250
similar in humans so that might make a
 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.680
similar in humans so that might make a
good prediction about the effects of

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690
good prediction about the effects of
 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.330
good prediction about the effects of
calorie restriction but nobody wants to

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340
calorie restriction but nobody wants to
 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.890
calorie restriction but nobody wants to
practice calorie restriction because

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900
practice calorie restriction because
 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.450
practice calorie restriction because
it's it's so unpleasant

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460
it's it's so unpleasant
 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.700
it's it's so unpleasant
and so what everybody would like is a

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710
and so what everybody would like is a
 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.550
and so what everybody would like is a
mimetic a drug that would elicit at

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560
mimetic a drug that would elicit at
 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.560
mimetic a drug that would elicit at
least some of the benefits of calorie

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570
least some of the benefits of calorie
 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.960
least some of the benefits of calorie
restriction
