[music playing]

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.500
NARRATOR: Paracas
skull number 44.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.120
Discovered in 2012, it has
a weight of 2.8 pounds--

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.790
25% heavier than the
average adult male skull.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.500
It has a cranial capacity
of 1,500 cubic centimeters--

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080
20% greater than normal.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.330
And it is missing
a sagittal suture,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.380
the connective
tissue joint found

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.580
between the parietal
bones in all human skulls.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.170
This is just one of hundreds
of strange, misshapen skulls

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.580
that have been found on
the southern coast of Peru,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.380
dating back to 1927.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.710
It was at this time that
archaeologist Julio Tello first

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.580
excavated a massive burial
complex thought to have been

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
built by the Paracas people, who
lived in the region from 800 BC

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.620
to 100 BC.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.750
Julio C. Tello was the
father of Peruvian archeology.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.790
And in the 1920s, he
discovered mummy bundles.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.790
And in each mummy bundle was a
person with an elongated skull.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.380
They were buried in
family mausoleums,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.420
in some cases as deep as
30 feet into the bedrock.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.250
NARRATOR: Mainstream
archaeologists

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.420
say the elongation is most
likely the result of head

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.250
binding, which involves
wrapping the heads of infants

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.620
while their skulls
are still soft

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.290
in order to change the shape.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.120
It is a practice found
in numerous cultures

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.960
throughout the world that
dates back thousands of years.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.330
But why would people
desire to elongate

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.790
the heads of their children?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.620
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that head binding

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.120
originated with
primitive humans who

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.670
were attempting to
imitate the appearance

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.000
of extraterrestrial visitors.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
But according to
researcher Brian Foerster,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.460
the assistant director of
the Paracas History Museum,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.290
head binding would not account
for the other anomalies

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.790
that the Paracas skulls exhibit.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.380
About 5% of the elongated
skulls that we find in Paracas

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.210
are so complex in shape
and size that it's

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.880
hard to believe that
they're the result

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.120
of any form of cranial
deformation or head binding.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.290
Not only are they
elongated vertically,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.960
but also the eye sockets
are much larger than normal.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.710
There are two holes in
the back of the skull

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.830
called foramen through which
blood and nerve flow occurred.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.460
And also their jaws
were very robust.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.170
And among the
largest of them, we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.290
find skulls 60% heavier than
normal human skulls and a brain

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.170
capacity that is
2.5 times larger

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.420
than the normal human brain.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920
NARRATOR: But if these
elongated skulls were not

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.420
the result of the ancient
practice of head binding,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.080
then just who or what were
these mysterious beings?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.880
In 2014, DNA testing
was performed

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.750
on Paracas skull
number 44, which

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.880
rendered surprising results.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.580
Some initial DNA
testing has been done.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.920
And the results according
to the geneticists

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.830
are quite startling.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.580
There were certain segments
of the DNA that didn't match

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.120
anything known to be human.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.460
What it suggests to me is
that Paracas could very well

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.540
have been an ancient bloodline
related to Homo sapiens

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.460
but not specifically
Homo sapiens itself.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.960
When you look at this kind
of archaeological evidence,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.460
you're seeing
concrete, tangible,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.380
DNA-testable proof
that extraterrestrials

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.290
walked on Earth right among us.
