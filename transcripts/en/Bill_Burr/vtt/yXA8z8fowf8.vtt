1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:01.661
All right.

2
00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:05.080
What's up this is Bill Burr hanging out at the comedy store during the day cause

3
00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:07.510
I have no life. And uh,

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.660
that guy just asked me if my Prius was Alexis.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.600
I Dunno what he's listening to,

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530
but I'm going to download it the second I get out there.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.363
<v 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.801
<v 0>yeah,</v>

9
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:24.430
I'm a huge fucking sports fan and all that Lebron Shit that was going on this

10
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.830
week. Uh, out of everything that was annoying about that,

11
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.300
that players are actually getting together now to decide what team they're going

12
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:34.960
to piggyback on. The thing that bugged me the most was all those New York fans,

13
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.860
all the knick fans when Lebron didn't pick New York,

14
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:43.861
we're trying to say that the guy was afraid of New York and the big stage at a,

15
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:48.070
I just wanted to address this point because I have no fucking life and I

16
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.190
actually have the time in the middle of, I have so, so what,

17
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:55.570
so little going on in my career that I can actually address this in the middle

18
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:59.330
of the fucking day. Um, big stage.

19
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.900
Are you talking about nick fans? What do, what are you talking about? What?

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.740
Madison Square Garden you guys are acting like,

21
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.450
like it's fucking Yankee stadium.

22
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.970
You haven't won a championship since like 1973 so what, what is he afraid of?

23
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.950
What pressure is there to carry the fucking torch to not win it for the 38th

24
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.180
39th and 40th fucking year. I just, you know,

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.330
I would never as a red sox fan act like Fenway park is this big stage in

26
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:29.460
baseball.

27
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.900
No one that the Yankees are down the street with 20 more fucking championships.

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.050
The Celtics have 17 fucking banners hanging from their arena.

29
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.600
All right, so stand the fuck down. You don't have a big stage.

30
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.590
You know what a Madison Square Garden,

31
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.410
you know what's a big stage for fucking like, ah, what's that?

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100
Chico can't talk anymore. Who went on the road with Frank's lies and Minelli.

33
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.540
It's a big stage for her when she goes down there and she does her Fauci fucking

34
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.030
hands in front of all those Elton John Fans.

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.060
That's how much you haven't noticed the fucking draft.

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.810
When you go to a Knicks game or a rangers game for that matter,

37
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.600
you know what that is? That's from all the open air,

38
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.200
from all those lack of championship banners up there. All right,

39
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.860
the fucking Minneapolis Lakers who disbanded in the early sixties have three

40
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:19.310
more fucking championships than you. Okay? I'm not trying to be a con here,

41
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.910
even though I am. You guys don't have a big stage here.

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.320
You got a little fucking stage. Little fucking, let's go do some a summer stock.

43
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.550
Maybe do a little bit of Shakespeare. All right. The big fucking stage. Why?

44
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.050
Because you've got to look around Tyra banks.

45
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.870
We've got that makes it a big fucking stage.

46
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.100
Fucking who's that little shit with the, with the buddy Holly glasses.

47
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.390
Spike Lee spin in his towels. The last guy in Madison Square Garden.

48
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.270
Should I just, Jersey brought up to the rafters was fucking Reggie Miller.

49
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.750
All right, though. Brian was not afraid to go there.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500
There's no winning tradition in New York City. What was he afraid of?

51
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:58.790
Fucking Phil machinic and his fucking man tits in his laptop. His Go, Lebron.

52
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:03.490
Isn't it done? Nobody gives a fuck so much. Nick is never a good move.

53
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.550
He makes me look like a happy guy and you fucking pussies are sitting there

54
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.030
giving Lebron shit that if he goes to the Miami Heat that if he wins down there,

55
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.340
it's Dwayne Wade's team. So you know,

56
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.580
no one's going to respect a Lebron if he wins down there.

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.150
Well then what the fuck are the Yankees last 12 years,

58
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.180
everybody from fucking Kevin Brown to a rod if piled on that team.

59
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.410
You guys invented that shit. So put your fucking crime. All right.

60
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.370
If you get on your fucking knees and think thank, thank the fucking look.

61
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
Give him run. I'm stuttering because it's dead. Stay a taillight out here. No,

62
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.480
it's bugging the shit out of me. All right. I fucking respect the Yankees.

63
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.960
You guys are the epicenter or professional fucking baseball,

64
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:51.250
but don't fucking try and act like the fucking nicks are. You're not.

65
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.060
You're not the fucking spars. Have more flex than you.

66
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.210
Have you ever been to San Antonio?

67
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.540
You have it and I'm sick of people acting like New York is a hard fucking place

68
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.320
to live. You can make it there. You can make it anywhere. Look at your life.

69
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.810
Look around your apartment right now. You're in New York, right?

70
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.650
You're making it. You can get a fucking slice. It's not that hard.

71
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.070
Frank Sinatra was from New Jersey, stopped trying to claim him too.

72
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.950
He was bridging tunnel and he came in and he took over.

73
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.660
Your fucking town came in there.

74
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.570
He ate your pizza and he fucked your women and you did nothing about it,

75
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.840
and now you play a song at the end of the Yankees game. All right?

76
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.050
That's all I want to say is you don't have a big stage in MSG until you get into

77
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.340
double digits with your fucking flags. First.

78
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.840
Have a little bit of fucking respect.

79
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.390
That's like the twins talking shit to the Yankees,

80
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.340
so whatever your fucking conclusion, you don't have a big stage down there.

81
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.820
You don't. All right. Yankees are the big thing. Other than that,

82
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.250
New York City is a horrific failure in sports.

83
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.420
You doubled down in half the fucking major sports. You know,

84
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.030
jets haven't wanted since 69 Nick's haven't wanted since 73 the fucking rangers

85
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.830
have one, one cup and 70 years.

86
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.750
Where is this big states a fucking met seven one one since 86 the giants are

87
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.960
respectable franchise, but they're respectable. That's it.

88
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.050
They've got three Superbowl rings, you know those else has three.

89
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.670
It's the fucking patriots, the Green Bay packers, the fucking Oakland Raiders.

90
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:16.870
You're in the middle of the pack.

91
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.430
Upper Echelon and football is fucking Steelers cowboys and 40 nighters.

92
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.230
Then there's a moat cause nobody has four.

93
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.270
So you really don't have a big fucking stage there.

94
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.060
And Ray's famous pizza isn't fucking famous. Stop.

95
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.250
And everything in New York is shit just because times squares up there and you

96
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.820
can jerk off in front of the fucking MTV building. All right,

97
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.500
that's it. Have a nice day in New York and I'm glad you didn't get cliff league.

98
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.340
Your fucking cons.
