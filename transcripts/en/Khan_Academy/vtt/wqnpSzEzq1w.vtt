00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.700
What I want to do is
another "proofy-like"

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.550
thing to think about the sum of
an infinite geometric series.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.310
And we'll use a
very similar idea

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.820
to what we used to find the sum
of a finite geometric series.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.890
So let's say I have a geometric
series, an infinite geometric

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.810
series.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.000
So we're going to
start at k equals 0,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.040
and we're never going to stop.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.880
We're it's going all
the way to infinity.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.480
So we're never going to
stop adding terms here.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.330
And it's going to be our first
term times our common ratio.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.770
Our common ratio
to the kth power.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.680
Actually let me do
k and that color. k

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.900
equals 0 all the
way to infinity.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.000
And so let's just call
this thing right over here,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.790
let's call this s sub infinity.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.790
We're going all the way to
infinity right over here.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.530
And so this, if we
were to expand it out

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.129
is going to be equal to a
times r to the 0-- actually

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.710
let me just write it out
like that which is just a.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:18.690
a times r to the 0 power plus
a times r to the 1st power.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.410
r to the 1st power.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.940
Plus a times r to the 2nd power.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.850
r to the 2nd power.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.510
Plus-- and we could just
keep going on and on and on.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.940
I think you get
the general idea.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.890
Now just like when
we tried to derive

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.610
a formula for the sum of
a finite geometric series

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.900
we just said, well what
happens if you take the sum

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.000
and if you were to
multiply every term

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.150
by your common ratio.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.340
Every term by r.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.550
So let's do that.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.980
Let's imagine this sum.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.866
And we're going to
multiply every term by r.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.240
And the reason
why I said this is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.750
"proofy" is this is not always
clear-- It's a little bit,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.150
when you're multiplying
something times infinite terms

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.760
or an infinite sum, at
least this will be at least

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.343
give you the general idea.

00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:10.259
Or when you start thinking
about and infinity,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770
sometimes I just think about
things a little bit deeper.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.370
So r times this infinite sum?

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.400
Well that's going to
be equal to-- We're

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.520
just going to multiply
every term here times r.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.780
So a r to the 0'th power times
r is going to be a times r.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.730
a times r to the 1st power.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.250
Multiply this one times r?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.940
You're going to get a
times r to the 2nd power.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430
a times r to the 2nd power.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.110
I think you see
where this is going.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.540
Multiply this one times r?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.160
You're going to get plus a
times r to the 3rd power.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.110
And we would just keep on going.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.630
We'd just keep on going.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.910
So let me just show that.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.236
So plus dot dot dot.

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:01.210
Now what happens if
we were to subtract

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.704
this sum from this top sum?

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:05.120
So on the left
hand side, we could

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.930
express that as our sum s sub
infinity minus our common ratio

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.300
times s sub infinity.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.710
Is going to be equal to--

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.480
So when you subtract you're
going to have a times r

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.730
to the 0'th power, which is
really just the same thing

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.656
as a.

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:27.800
That's just going to be
a. a times r to the 0

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.745
is just a times 1 which is a.

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:32.050
We'll write in that same color.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.260
Is equal to a.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.060
But every other
term, you're going

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.833
to have a times r to
the 1st, but you're

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.972
gonna subtract a
times r to the 1st.

00:03:38.972 --> 00:03:40.680
You have a times r to
the 2nd, but you're

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.660
going to subtract a
times r to the 2nd.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.190
So every other term is
going to be subtracted away.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.320
And this happens all
the way to infinity.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.695
It never, never ends.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:54.070
So the only term
that you're left

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.150
with is just that
first one, is just a.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.930
And so now we can actually
try to solve for our sum.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.530
If you factor out
the s sub infinity,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.830
you are left with 1 minus r.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.726
1 minus r.

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:13.195
s times s, our sum, times
1 minus r is equal to a.

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.070
Divide both sides
by 1 minus r, and we

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.667
get that our sum, the
thing that we cared about--

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.750
And once again, this is
kind of an amazing result.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.980
That we're taking the sum of
an infinite number of terms

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.540
and under the
proper constraints,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.760
we are going to
get a finite value.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.650
So this is going to be
equal to a over 1 minus r.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.740
So once again,
it's kind of neat.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.620
If let's say I had the sum,
let's say we started with 5,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.850
and then each time we
were to multiply by 3/5.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:03.660
So 5 plus 3/5 times 5 is 3,
times 3/5 is going to be 9/5.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.360
9/5, or I'll multiply by 9/5
again-- Oh, sorry not 9/5.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.760
My brain isn't working right!

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.330
5 times 3/5 is going
to be 3 times 3/5.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.010
Is going to be-- 3
times this is going

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.825
to be 9/5-- actually
that was right.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.070
My brain is working right.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.710
Times 3/5 is going
to be 27 over 25.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.040
Times 3/5 is going to be 81/125.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.432
And we keep on going on
and on and on forever.

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:41.890
And notice these
terms are starting

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.640
to get smaller and
smaller and smaller.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.820
Well actually all
of them are getting

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.153
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:47.860
We're multiplying
by 3/5 every time.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.627
We now know what the
sum is going to be.

00:05:49.627 --> 00:05:51.210
It's going to be our
first term-- it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.730
going to be 5-- over 1
minus our common ratio.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.960
And our common ratio
in this case is 3/5.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.900
So this is going to be
equal to 5 over 2/5,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.210
which is the same
thing as 5 times 5/2

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.570
which is 25/2 which is equal
to 12 and 1/2, or 12.5.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.550
Once again, amazing result.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.990
I'm taking a sum of
infinite terms here,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.710
and I was able to
get a finite result.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.670
And once again, when
does this happen?

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.130
Well, if our common ratio--
if the absolute value

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.945
of our common ratio--
is less than 1,

00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:36.320
then these terms
are going to get

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.653
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:41.160
And you'll even see here it
even works out mathematically

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.260
in this denominator
that you are going

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.050
to get a reasonable answer.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.709
And it makes sense
because these terms

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.500
are getting smaller
and smaller and smaller

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.000
that this thing will converge.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.880
Even if r is 0.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.850
If r is 0, we're still
not dealing strictly

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.440
with a geometric series anymore,
but obviously if r was 0,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.470
then you're really only going
to have this-- well, even

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.140
this first term is
kind of under debate

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.770
depending on how you
define what 0 to 0 is.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.770
But if your first term
you just said would be a,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.170
then clearly you'd just be left
with a is the sum, and a over 1

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.330
minus 0 is still a.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.280
So this formula that we just
derived does hold up for that.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.300
It does start to break down if
r is equal to 1 or negative 1.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.730
If r is equal to 1 then
as you imagine here,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.370
you just have a plus
a plus a plus a,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.720
going on and on forever.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.120
If r is equal to negative 1
you just keep oscillating.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.800
a, minus a, plus a, minus a.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.300
And so the sum's value keeps
oscillating between two values.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.240
So in general this
infinite geometric series

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.990
is going to converge
if the absolute value

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.030
of your common ratio
is less than 1.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.860
Or another way of saying
that, if your common ratio is

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.870
between 1 and negative 1.
