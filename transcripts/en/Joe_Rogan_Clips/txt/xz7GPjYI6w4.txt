Speaker 1:          00:03          Hello you on. Hi. Charlie was crazy man. What's happening? Yeah, good. I've just, we're just saying we want to cover the, I uh, I've met a note to myself that says, talk slow, talk American because although I spend about half the year here, we British people, there's a reorientation where you suddenly realize I was once in a, uh, an Ihub in cactus Arizona and I was saying to the woman, right, like I'll have some pancakes, whatever it was. And she kept looking at me going, what? I know after about literally three minutes, she goes, do you speak English? That's like, let people fucking invented it. Right. But no one was there to laugh at my such cause they didn't understand what the fuck I was saying. Arizona is a strange place. I really love Arizona. There's great parts. Like Phoenix is amazing. Tucson's a great place too, but it's a wild west sort of a state.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's one of those weird hold over states and have a lot of weird old school laws. Like, like a, I think you could just walk around with a gun. Yeah, you can. My main experience in Phoenix was in Arizona in fact, was going out with a group of women who were made to go out on a chain gang wearing tee shirts saying I was a drug addict when members of the public mock them in Jira at that right. Cause written this book about very spoke about the war on drugs and I said, Joe Arpaio, sheriff our Pio, no longer sheriff now thankfully. But uh, yeah, and it was, yeah, Arizona is a deeply weird place. It's weird. A lot of really nice people, but it's 150,000 degrees. Yeah. Well literally almost nobody lived there until I conditioning was invented. Right. You see what I once met a horrendous mistake in fact in Phoenix where I had to walk somewhere and I could see on the map it was like a mile away.

Speaker 1:          01:36          So it's not just walk, it's fine. And I got like halfway there and people are literally stopping that car is going, are you okay? Because the only reason anyone would ever walk in eggs was basically if your car had broken down the car to them. I might have actually just chosen to walk. Right. Plus you're so white guy. I'm literally like a tomato with a Brazilian who would literally just look up my body and laugh and be like, you're so white. How can a human be so like, right. I don't always, I never have a nice color. Like I'm either this albino color or red rock. I never, there's no rich brown hue that none of my ancestors, the Scottish and Swiss. So they never saw the sun. Right. And none of my ancestors, my friend Jamie was over my house once and he's not this friend Jamie, different friend Jamie who's a British as well. And um, my daughter who was a at the time, I think she was like 10 or something like that, she goes, she goes to my wife, she goes, mommy, he's so white. She, and she goes, yeah. She goes, no, no, like he's white, like paper.

Speaker 1:          02:36          So from then on, Jamie became Jamie White, like paper, very accurate description of my lack of pigment is currently true. It's funny that we, how much we appreciate the English accent though. The English accent is like one of the best tools for selling things to very gullible Americans. Whether it's like people benefit from constant positive discrimination in the United States. Right? It's like having a 10 inch Dick just having a British accent people cause they like, oh my God, you got an accent at all. Humans have accents. I've just got a, you know, let's say to provide itself a cherished one we looked at were really into it. It makes you feel like you're more sophisticated. You're, you're more well read. They're more aware of the world. I mean, I just am sophisticated and well ride anyway. No, but you've got this called stood. Um, yeah. Coastally people ascribing to you much better qualities than you actually have.

Speaker 1:          03:26          But what does it work in reverse? Like in, in England? What is the reaction to American accents is it's mostly discussed, right? I don't know. There's a mixture. Americans, we grow. I always think like the relationship with Britain and America, it's like I'm one of those police mirrors because we grow up constantly looking at the United States, right? We're constantly staring through. We are immersed in American culture, right? When Americans look back cause they're just seeing like a reflection of themselves. I mean Americans watched Downton Abbey and know about like the queen or whatever, but there isn't that two way dialogue that there is that the, the, the, you know, the, yeah, so it's a slightly weird, so I think we feel very American, right? And I spent half of the year here and I, you know, every now and then you come up against these deep cultural differences that you're just like, oh fuck, okay.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Right. This is really not my culture. Right? And it's those moments of disorientation or a really strange, like, give me one if for an example. Well, there's a question that Americans ask all the time that I have literally never heard of European ass, right? I asked the question, what's your story? Right? Every American, you can go to the most crusty, right wing person coming out and Mara Largo or a kid in West Baltimore and you can say, well, it's your story. And they'll have an answer. The only context I can imagine a British person saying, what's your story? Would be in a police interrogation. It would be an extremely hostile question. What's your story? Right? It would be, you just wouldn't ever say it, right? We don't Americans narrativize their lives in a way I absolutely love. And as a journalist who writes books about like depression and addiction and you want people to talk about their lives, it's an unbelievable gifty, right?

Speaker 1:          05:01          That people will tell you, I've never once been on a bus in Mississippi and sitting next to a woman and within five minutes of chatting tell, she told me about like her two miscarriages, how her mother hated her. And I thought if we were switched where my dad's from, you wouldn't tell me this until we got married and maybe not even that. Right? So there's a level of candor and storytelling among Americans. It's one of the best things about this, this, this, you know, fucked up an amazing place. I just love it. There's something about, there's a, there's a kind of a narrative openness that's very different about this place than Europe, anywhere in Europe. Now when you talk to people in England, you guys don't have the same level of social media, not social media, but of um, reality television. You have some like big brother, but you don't have it to the extent that we have it here.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Right? Yeah, it hasn't, well, I mean your country has literally been taken over by reality television, right? We have a relative term president. Uh, no, it hasn't conquered the whole culture in that way. Well, he's a reality television president, but he's sort of a game show host president. Like that's how I used to describe myself and I was hosting fear factor. They were like, you host a reality show, Mike, sort of, it's a game show. It's just a fucked up game show. It's like Trump was hosting a game show essentially. Right. It was a contest. It wasn't like keeping up with the Kardashians. That's in true reality show because there's literally nothing going on other than these people's lives and whatever orchestrated bullshit they put in to make it more interesting. Yeah. I hadn't thought about it that way. I think this class because, but I think that's part of the thing that it was getting to about Americans always wanted to give you their narrative.

Speaker 1:          06:40          They always want to give you the story of their life. So when someone says, what's your story? They already have it ready. You know? Cause it's almost like we feel like we're in some sort of a small television show all the time or some sort of small production. It's like almost a part of our who we are. Yeah. Every American can thinks that the star if their own movie. Right. And I forget who said this, but someone realize, you know, sometimes in life you realize that you're just the extra, right? Yeah. You'll do the, you're in the corner of the shawl. Right, right. And, um, yeah, I think that's true. And I think that's, that's not as true of British people or I think there's certain, how to put it. Like there's a certain kind of self deprecation. You're taught as a British person, you're taught.

Speaker 1:          07:20          And I had to kind of unlearn it living here. So what would be examples? Uh, I forget where I read this story, so maybe it's not true, but I remember in it years ago, so we had these terrible subway bombs in 2005, I'm sure you remember for young British men go onto the London Underground and murder, I think it was over 50 people and two weeks later, another group of, um, jihadis tried to do the same thing, but they hadn't built the bombs very well. So they go down into the subway and the owl, there's a loud bang, but it doesn't connect with the detonator. So there's a loud bang but doesn't actually blow everyone up. Obviously people freak the fuck out, as you can imagine. Right. And I forget, maybe this isn't, maybe this is a story that someone told them that wasn't factually true, but he's, I think it reveals something very, very, something about British character.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Cause if I remember rightly, um, three of the bombers escape on the escape on the day in a court like a few hours later and one of them's caught on at the time, right. And someone, I think it was an off duty fire officer in the story chases after them for ages, chasing after the guy for ages while everyone else is running the fuck away and you can't just the guy and he throws him to the ground. And what he said to him was that the opportunity fire officer says to the attempted suicide bomber, you rude, rude man. Right. And what I love about that is like the idea that suicide bombing is just like bad manners. It's like it's just impolite, right? Or even a better example, which is true. It was reported at the time, definitely was um, during the riots we had in 2011, uh, in London, um, there was one place, I forget where it is, where they broke into a luxury goods store and they could only make a, it was a very strong window so they could only make a hole in the corner of the window and it was caught on the security cameras that the rioters formed a to go in and look at the store.

Speaker 1:          08:56          Right. That's how deep the idea of like Keurig and making a line is in British culture. Even in a riot where like, I don't know, I think you where you were before me right there. I've got to chill out in front. Isabelle Bank. Hey, he lives in, he lives in London and she liked if I her phone to be able to, she read that. I'd be like, you fucking English. You don't know how to riot this and I'm Roger. Probably a Q. What's wrong with you people? Right? You guys don't have black Friday sales. Do you know? They've just started. Yeah. It's an unfortunate business. Might be the end of you. Humility. Exactly. We're not going to make it. We survived. The Nazis were not fucking survive in black Friday. Right? There's something about those deals when people get that bargain and then they open that door ready, go and people pile through. All humanity gets tossed aside, get you in this line to the fucking financial desperation of ordinary Americans. Right? It's a little bit of that, but it's also the competitive nature of those things where you're trying to grab the few remaining items that are 25% off and even saving for this TV for six months, and there it is right in front of you and you charge and people are fighting left and right. It's awful. It says it's just a terrible way for people to, you know, interact with each other.
