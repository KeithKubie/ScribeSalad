00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.550
Thank you for coming to LJ-119
in the Library of Congress

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.600
and the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.440
It's a great pleasure to
welcome our speaker today.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.020
Before we start the
program I want to ask you

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.720
to take a moment to
silence your devices.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.030
We'll also be filming this program,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.630
so think about a good
question before you ask it.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.700
Our lecture today is
sponsored by the Kluge Center

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.330
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.360
We bring together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.440 position:56%
to distill wisdom from the Library's
rich holdings and to interact

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.390
with Congress and the public.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
And we find our talented
writers and scholars

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.610
from around the world
in a myriad of ways.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.060
We have many scholars in place.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.330
But in today's instance it was a
really nice act of serendipity.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.610
Our speaker was speaking
in Atlanta at a meeting

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.320 position:56%
of the American Library Association.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.980
And our new librarian, Dr. Carla
Hayden, was in the audience and was

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.000
so riveted by our speaker
that she said,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.170
"I've got a place for
you to give a talk."

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.500
And that was the Kluge
Center a few months later.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.420
I believe it was a Martin
Luther King Day speech.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.120
So we're so happy to
have our speaker.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.540
Our speaker is Dr. Daina Berry, who
an associate professor of history

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.940
and African and diaspora studies
and the Oliver H. Radkey fellow

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.240
in American history at the
University of Texas at Austin.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200
She's a prolific author.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.230
She's the author of <i>Swing the
Sickle for the Harvest is Ripe:</i>

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.530
<i>Gender and Slavery in
Antebellum Georgia</i>.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.490
She's an award-winning editor
of <i>Enslaved Women in America:</i>

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.340
<i>An Encyclopedia</i> and <i>Slavery
and Freedom in Savannah</i>.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.340
She has recently published a book
she will be talking about today.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.440
And I want to note it was published
in one of my favorite presses

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.130
in the United States, the Beacon
Press, which is true to its name,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.620
a beacon of liberal -- it used
to be liberal Protestant writing

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.230
and now I think we can
just call it liberalism.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.250
But it's a wonderful
press in Boston.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.930
And the book is <i>The Price
for their Pound of Flesh:</i>

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.550
<i>The Value of the Enslaved
from the Womb to the Grave</i>

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.220
<i>in the Building of a Nation</i>.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.830
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Daina Berry.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.630
Thank you.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.280
[ Applause ]

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.990
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Thank you
so much for your introduction,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.370
and I want to thank you and your
staff for allowing me to come

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.670
and speak about my work here.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.790
It's an honor to be here,
and I was very happy

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.750
when Dr. Hayden extended
the invitation.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.250
What I'd like to do is to talk
a little bit about this project

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.120
that I've been working on for ten
years, and to talk a little bit

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.370
about some of the motivations
behind the research,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.060
and then share a little bit
of reading from parts of it.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.510
And I also want to give time
for Q&amp;A because oftentimes

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.710 position:56%
when I've presented since January,
I've had a lot of really interesting

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.410
and very lively discussions
about the subject matter.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530
Because this is the
history of the enslaved.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.590
And I said that during the writing
process that I really learned more

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.090
about myself than I did about the
people that I was writing about

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.520
and that I was more a
scholar of the enslaved

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.940
than I am a scholar of slavery.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.360
And that's something
that I've learned:

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.740
The slavery is the institution
that houses the people

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.820
that I'm interested
in writing about.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.650
And so I wanted to begin with just
a quick overview about the book

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.630
and about the project,
and then I'm going to talk

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.170
about a couple sections from there.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.370
The book is structured around
six different chapters.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.540
And it came out of -- it
grew out of my first book.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.930
It was supposed to be chapter
six of <i>Swing the Sickle</i>,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.820
and the editors thought that
this discussion of slave prices

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.930
and slave people's values
just didn't fit with the rest

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.230
of what was in the manuscript.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.720
And they said, "You know, that
would be a great separate study."

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.140
And when I had written
that particular chapter --

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.770 position:56%
so I've been working on this stuff a
little bit longer than the ten years

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.490
because this was part of that
first book project that I did --

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.550 position:56%
I found evidence of enslaved values,
monetary values on their bodies.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.690
And I found that women were
priced higher during their

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.490
child-bearing years.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.170
And I wanted to know why I had not
seen that in historical literature,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.050
why I had not seen that outside of
some conversations women were sort

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.040
of put as secondary but outside
the conversations that were

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.750
in the slave price
literature as well.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.370
And so I wanted to know if
this was a national trend.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.930
I wanted to know, you know, for
all these years between the ages

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.500
of let's say 15 to 30
were women priced higher?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.570
And that's sort of what
started me off on this.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.370
And I was basically
collecting a database

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.850
of enslaved people's values --
the name, their age, their sex,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.620
their prices, and so forth.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.000
And some of these values come
in the form of appraisals,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.870
which are the annual appraisals
that were done every year to figure

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.840 position:56%
out the projections of how much they
would be over the course of a year

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.540
or over the course
of their lifetime.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.930
And some of them also came
in the form of market sales.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.020
And market sales represent the
highest value that a person has.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.580
It's the price that they
command in the auction block.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.390
So this one little
chapter that I had written

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.100
for a different book
became its own study

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.200
when I started doing
the research and learned

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.260
that women were not priced higher
than men and that there was just

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.960
that group of plantations
that I was looking

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.480
at were actually the anomaly.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.870
They were the outlier.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.560
And that for across the board --

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.140
and I'll show you a slide in a
few minutes of the numbers --

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.430
men were priced higher than
women across the board.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.680
And so you'll see a
little bit of this.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.830
And I'll show you my
influences where some

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.270
of you may know Stanley Engerman,
he's an economic historian,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.010
co-author of <i>Time on the
Cross</i> with Robert Fogel.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.890
He saw me give a talk at Duke when
I was doing the research for this,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.730
when I was still thinking
that women were priced higher.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.090
And he came up to me
afterwards and said, "You know,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.140
I think I have something
that might be useful to you.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.600
Do you have time to
come to Rochester?"

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.920
I said, "Sure, why not?"

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.360
And I went up there with a
graduate student and my family

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.320
and literally left
with eight boxes --

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.130
or seven boxes of archival
data that they had collected

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.430
from <i>Time on the Cross</i>.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.930 position:56%
So this was, like, one of the most
generous academic donations somebody

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.230
could ever had.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.500
And it totally catapulted my
study in terms of the number

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.370
of data points that I had.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.660
But one of the things that I've
wanted to do with this book was

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.330 position:56%
to not just make people dots on
graphs and lines on charts, positive

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.450
and negative signs, I wanted to
show their humanity and I wanted

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.890
to focus on their humanity.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.870
And I wanted to find a way to
tell their story as a commodity

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.760
but as a commodity that's also
a person and a human being,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.860
similar to what Walter
Johnson did in <i>Soul by Soul</i>.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.100 position:56%
And one of the ways I did this was
to center the voices of the enslaved

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
and to allow them to
tell these stories

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.780 position:56%
about how they understood themselves
as human beings and as products.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.250
And I'll talk a little bit
about that in a few minutes.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.890
So just the data, this is what a
lot of people are interested in.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.750
I only really have it at
the tops of each chapter.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.190
I ended up with about 80,000
individual slave values,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.270
as I mentioned, appraisal
and market sales.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.020
Some of this came from insurance
records were people were ensuring

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.880
their enslaved people from as young
as age nine to as old as age 89

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.790
or 90, life insurance policies so
that if the enslaved person passed,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.120
they could then purchase
another laborer with the money

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.150
that they had given in with
the premium and so forth.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.750
So that's the dataset.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.270
I think by the time I
cleaned up everything

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.090
and made sure there was not
any overlap between the Fogel

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.810 position:56%
and Engerman data and my own data,
I think I ended up with about 55,000

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.180
or 56,000 cases that are
used throughout the book.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.820
And each chapter uses about 10,000
to 12,000 to make up the averages.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.580
And this is what I came up with.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.030
This is what I found.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.640
This is a slide -- I realize when
I've been talking about my book,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.730
I've been sharing the
stories of the enslaved,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.580
which is the most important part
for me personally, but I realized

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.580
that a lot of people wanted to
know, well, what were the numbers?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.070
So what you have here is this
is based on each chapter.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.440
And I show you the age ranges.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.480
They're not just typical
ten-year age increments.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.220
The first number with the dollar
sign in the column is the value

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.970
at that time, it's
converted into 1860 dollars.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.800
And then the number in parentheses
is what it is in 2014 money, okay?

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.000
And I used the lowest
income value translators.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.370
So these numbers are actually
a lot larger depending

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.700
on which chart you
want to use through --

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.340
Economic History Net is where
I went and got those figures.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.470
So but the average enslaved
person was about $10,000

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.970
to $15,000 in today's money.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.320
If you think about that, you think
about it in terms of, you know,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.900
the number of enslaved people
folks owned, that's a lot of money.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.590
And a lot of these people had
large plantations, 300 people.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.750
They sometimes had more
money in human bodies

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.070
and human chattel than
they did the land.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.290 position:56%
So that's something to keep in mind.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.120
I can come back to this slide
later during the Q&amp;A if you like.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.540 position:56%
This is just an example of a bill of
sale, just one sample of the types

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.990
of records that I used
to characterize

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.820
and find this information.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.590
But one of the things
as I mentioned,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.380
this here is from the
eve of the Civil War.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.420
So it's probably, you know,
in Confederate dollars.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420
This is an inflated price.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.570
This is probably not --

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.310
this particular value
has not been inverted.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.720
And the advertisement here
talks about a 32-year-old male,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.710
but they refer to him as a boy.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.490
They have in this particular
ad his height, his complexion,

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.020
and they mention stuff about his
skill, that he was a brick mason.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.080
So just this little slip of paper.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.860
I don't even know how
many characters it is.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.120
It's probably the same
as a contemporary tweet

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.790
or a little bit longer --
has a lot of information

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.090
about an enslaved person.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.390
And those are the people to whom

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.390
which I wrote this
book for and about.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.770
So switching to the structure,
I wanted to read a little bit

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.010
from how I looked at how enslaved
people understood and learned

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.530
to understand that they
were treated as commodities

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.070
and how they responded to that.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.000
Because my other question that
was driving this study was:

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.590
What did the enslaved people
think; what did they feel;

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.660
how did they respond; how did
they react; what did they know

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.180
about their values; did
they care; were they happy

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.720
to have high values or low values?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.020
And I will read briefly.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.930
In 1854 Rachel, an infant girl,
was placed on the auction block.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.520
Although she was wrapped
in a coverlet

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.210
and she was asleep,
her face was exposed.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.260
An enslaved man had
delivered her to the auction

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.100 position:56%
on the instructions of his enslaver.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.660
Rachel was about a year
old and she was for sale.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.230
As the enslaved man sat on the
courthouse steps with Rachel,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.700
waiting for the noon
hour, the time and place

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.490
of many public auctions,
one wonders how he felt.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.410
Was it excruciating for him to
carry out his enslaver's demand

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.610
and bring little Rachel
to the market?

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.880
Or was he unmoved?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.600
What kind of exchange had
he had with her parents?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.910
Did he feel partially responsible
for what was about to take place?

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.020
Imagine trying to keep the baby
calm after she was separated

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.210
from her mother and then
handing her over to the sheriff

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.460
at the start of the auction.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.230
While the enslaved man sat
holding Rachel in his arms,

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.130
the Reverend Nehemiah
Adams, a visitor from Boston

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.370
on a three-month tour of the South,

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.940
approached him to ask
a few questions.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.680
Adams was startled to see an
enslaved man holding an infant.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.010
"Is the child sick?"

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.340
Adams asked.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.320
Responding with deference,
the man replied, "No, Master.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.480
She is going to be sold."

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.300
Puzzled, Adams inquired
about the child's mother,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.820
to which the man answered
that she was quote, "At home."

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.160
The minister's mind was filled with
questions, but most importantly,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.060
he worried about Rachel's mother.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.580
How did she feel?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.200
How much did she miss her child?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200
Was the infant taken
openly or in private?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.640
Who did this?

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.850
By now Rachel was weeping
and refusing to be comforted.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.600
This was too much for Adams,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.200
who chose not to stay
and witness the sale.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.680
Later he learned that Rachel
had been sold for $140.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.080
Imagine her confusion as
she looked at the group

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.610
of potential buyers gazing at her,
evaluating her earning potential.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.070
How did Rachel even begin
to process what occurred?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.440
Her inconsolable crying is one
clue, but she was too young

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.500
to express her feelings
in any other way.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.550
So I open with infancy because
when I was doing this research,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:04.230
I've said this before, I had
columns in my dataset of years old.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.790
And I had to create a
column for months old

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.810
when I found an 8-month-old
baby for sale.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.090
And then I had to create a column
when I found a 6-week-old baby

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.950
in the market with
no parent for sale.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.610 position:56%
And then when I found a 3-day-old
baby, I actually had to take a break

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.450
from the research for about
a week because it moved me

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.590
in a way I wasn't expecting.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.060
I wasn't expecting to see it.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.260
And I didn't even know how
to process it at the time.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.060
I thought -- I can't imagine
and I can't even imagine it

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.620
from this particular
child's perspective.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.290
But I wanted to think about
ways for teaching my students

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.510
and for teaching the general public
to whom this book is also written

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.980
of how do we understand how
enslaved people were commodified?

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.070
How do we understand they were
treated as a person with a price,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.190
as Walter Johnson refers to it?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.360 position:56%
And how did they make sense of this?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.500 position:56%
So moving ahead, there's a time
period where enslaved children start

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.660
to transition into
understanding what's happening.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.390
Not only are they learned
and raised to know

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.690
that they're also commodities
because their parents teach them

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.670
that or the people that
are caring for them do,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.490
so they're living in a dual world.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.160
Sort of like W.E.B. Du Bois talks
about in the double consciousness.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.100
So they're already being
raised in that space.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.260
But this often happens
around five or six,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.200 position:56%
that they recognize there's
something different about themselves

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.950
and about the white
children that they're around.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.020
"Many a man 50 years old had
not seen what I had before my

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.670
20th year."

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.370
These are the words of Jordan H.
Banks, who was born into slavery,

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.600
sold three times, escaped twice,
and ultimately reached freedom.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.130
His early years were
pleasant compared to those

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.260
as he matured into adulthood.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.200 position:56%
In his narrative which was published
in 1861, we learn many things

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.960
about the value of the enslaved
and the ways enslavers, traders,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.810
and medical doctors
trafficked human chattel

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.660
from birth to death and beyond.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.760
Banks lived on a Virginia
plantation with his parents

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.680
and 16 siblings, which
is pretty unusual.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.220
His mother served as a cook,
his father was the head man,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.440
and the family was intact.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.190
As a young child, he played with
his enslaver's son, Alexander,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.840
who was just about a year older.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.110
But by age five Banks
began to realize that he

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.150
and Alex were different when
his playmate began beating him.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.000
Banks fought back because
his father warned him

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.430
that had he not responded, he
would suffer continued beatings.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.580
Embracing this spirit,
Banks kept track

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:40.900
of how many whippings he owed Alex
and he returned them blow for blow.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.800
Even in childhood, Banks' actions
showed a nascent understanding

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.000 position:56%
of what I call his soul value, which
was separate from his enslaver.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.370
As he processed the distinctions
between himself and his nemesis,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.780
Banks experienced another epiphany.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.580
Alex attended school while
he was sent to quote,

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.710
"Scare crows in the fields."

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.940
In his words, the dreary days
of boyhood began in the fields.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.690
Now, this moment during enslaved
childhood served as a turning point

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.230 position:56%
in Banks' life and the understanding
of the reality of their condition.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.190 position:56%
Historian Wilma King calls this the
quantum leap into the world of work.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.260
And as they aged, enslaved
youth and young adults learned

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.960
and intimately understood
their place in the world.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.200
Banks' maturation solidified his
understanding of enslavement,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.400
especially during three
pivotal events

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.720
of his youth and early adulthood.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.390
The first was the sale
of his two sisters,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.430
the second was the nearly-fatal
beating of his mother,

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.020
and the third was the slow
death of his enslaver.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.620
Of the latter, Banks
remarked, "I saw him in life.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.120
I saw him in death.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.930
But he left me in chains."

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.580
So to me this just is a way

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.410
to understand how enslaved
people are starting

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.210
to recognize what it
means to be a commodity,

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.120 position:56%
to recognize that there's
something different about themselves

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.500
than their white playmates
to whom they had been playing

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.800
with for most of their lives.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.670
And they also start paying
attention to their values.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.640
There was a slave, a young woman
named Merlida [assumed spelling]

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.860 position:56%
who talks about how she was put on
the auction block, and she remembers

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.020
that they put her up for $600.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.920
And her mistress came and
said, "No, you can't sell her,"

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.860
and she was crying because she
didn't want her owner to sell her.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.730
And they took her down
off the block.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.630 position:56%
And she says, "Although I wasn't
sold that day, I remember my price."

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.190
And this interview was taken 80
years later, but she remembers

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.640
on that day exactly
how much she was worth

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.690
and that her owner didn't think
that that was the right time

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.100
or value to sell Merlida.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.290 position:56%
And so this even, regardless of what
other kind of memories they have,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.600 position:56%
there are vivid memories of pricing.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.500
And they talk about this
throughout their work.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.680
And one of the things that I
found difficult was that I felt

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.680
like scholars spent most of their
time focusing on male prices,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.950
particularly inflated
males in their prime years

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.130
and very few people looked
at how women were valued.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.840
But I also felt that they
were missing how enslaved

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.250
people survived.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.260
And there's a lot of people that
have written about resistance

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.440
and so forth, but I
kept thinking to myself,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.490
"How did 4 million
people end up in 1865

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.510
to have survived this institution?

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.960
You know, what did they turn to?"

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.870 position:56%
They weren't all socially dead, they
weren't all in a melancholy state.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.560
They might have experienced
depression --

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.480 position:56%
what we're calling depression today.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.930
They might have experienced
grief and sadness,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.230
but how did they survive?

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.530
And there had to be something.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.440
And one of the things I came up
with was that they had a notion

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.690
of a value that could
not be commodified.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.330
And I'll share what that is.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.710 position:56%
The pubescent years were terrifying.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.810
Not only were their bodies
changing, but this was also a time

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.780
when enslaved children
experienced a separation

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.930
that they had feared
all of their lives.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.600
Daughters and sons were taken from
their parents as the external value

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.740
of their bodies increased.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.630
Market scenes from childhood
now made sense and haunted them

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.700
for the rest of their lives.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.670
At this stage in their
maturation they knew full well

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.960
that others claimed
ownership of them

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.190
and that sexual assault
came at any age.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.650
However, their parents, if present,
as well as other kin reminded them

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.580
of a value that enslavers and
traders could not commodify:

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.080
The spiritual value of
their immortal souls.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.960
Soul values is my term
for such valuation.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.290
And it often escapes calculation
and developed during these years.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.230
Soul values are enriched through
an inner spiritual centering

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.200
that facilitated survival and they
were reinforced by loved ones.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.950
Sometimes this internal value
appeared as a spirit, a voice,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.330
a vision, a whisper, a premonition,
a sermon, a ancestor, a god.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.120
It came in public and private
settings and occasionally described

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.750
as a personal message from a
higher being or a heaviness

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.120
in the core of their bodies.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.450
"My soul began singing," one
enslaved person recalled,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.670
"and I was told that I was
one of the elected children."

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.580
This telling, this uplifting,
this singing of a fearful thrill

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.240
of things unknown but longed

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.780
for still made the enslaved
feel free during captivity.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.620
Freedom of the soul
matured in puberty.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.480
And so it's really at this stage
when they're in their teen years

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.380
and going into puberty when girls
are going through their cycles

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.770
and now their values are increasing
because they can give birth

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.890
to additional laborers
where planters don't have

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.920
to then purchase them because
their value of the enslaved,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.520
the status of the slave
is defined by the mother.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.660
So if your mother was
enslaved and you gave birth,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.660
those children were
also enslaved as well.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.080
So this is why during those
eight plantations that I found

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.150 position:56%
in <i>Swing the Sickel</i> that I found
women were priced higher, I thought,

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.780
"Well, this has got to be the case
across the whole country, right,

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.410
in terms of other enslaved
communities?"

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.410
And the only thing I
can say for that --

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.650
because I've been trying to figure
out why that was the case --

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.080
is that most of those plantations
were on one island community,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.840
St. Simon's Island, Georgia.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.750
They were, like, 12 plantations
there total, but eight of them

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:19.640
where the female plantation
mistress was serving as a manager

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.760
because either their husbands were
deceased, they had gone off to war,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.770
they had gone on political
leave, and so forth.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.990
So some of these plantations
were managed by women

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.750
and perhaps that's why
their values were there.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.050
I don't know.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.360 position:56%
But that's one of the things that I
think about and one of the solutions

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.670
that I think would make sense.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.760
So now shifting to how
enslaved people responded

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.810
and what do they know
about their values,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.920
we know that they were
given a rating system

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.450
where they were either a full
hand, three-quarters hand,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.800
half hand, one-quarter hand.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.490
A full hand was A1 prime, which
was someone between the ages of 18

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.800
and 30 years of age who
could do certain amount

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.210
of work in a given day.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:08.030
And most other enslaved laborers
were sort of judged based

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.860
on that person but on
a decreasing scale.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.150
And that value, that rate was
often correlated with their prices.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.450
So if they kept rates.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.700
Not all plantation owners kept
track of the rating system,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.200
but when they did, we're finding
direct connections with the values.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.930
And so one of the things
that you hear when you look

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.060
at the auction records and you hear
bid callers and you read the text

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.160
from bid callers and they'll say,
"This is a first-rate person,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.640
there's a first-rate bargain,
he's A1 prime, he's strong;

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.480
or she's got -- look at her arms,
look at her healthy babies,"

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.240 position:56%
when they're trying to bid them off.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.130
And here's what enslaved
people say about first rate.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.850
Bid caller and criers shouted
out the values of enslaved people

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.580
as prime, first-rate, and A1.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.880 position:56%
But from freedom in Canada, Benjamin
Miller explained what he thought

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.260
first-rate meant.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.930 position:56%
Before his escape in North Carolina,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.890
his North Carolinian enslaver
had trusted him to travel to

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.630
and from the market, running
errands and to do favors.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.600
Sometimes his enslaver gave
him small amounts of money.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.300
He says quote, "But
I was still a slave."

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.140
On one occasion, Miller said he was
trying to purchase himself for $450

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.300
and neighbors told his enslaver
that that was too low of a value

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.030
and that he needed to increase it.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.930
So his enslaver said,
"You can purchase yourself

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.520
if you give me $800."

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.820
All right?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.410
And at this point, he felt
like that was too much

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.520
and he didn't have
the money, obviously.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.600
So when he heard that
he had raised the price,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.710
Miller was unwilling to pay for it.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.070
Instead, he fled without paying
and made his way to Canada.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.700
Reflecting on this pivotal event,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.470
Miller discussed what it
meant to be first-rate.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.740
"I have done first-rate
here," he says from Canada,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.130
"I will tell you what
I call first-rate.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.760
I say first-rate from the fact
that we have to row against wind

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.050
and tide when we get here.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.340
And being brought up illiterate,
I consider that if we live

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:05.970
and keep our families well-fed and
clad, we have done first-rate."

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.700
So this is, like, the first
time where we're thinking about,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.560
you know, what did enslaved
people think, what did they know

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.630
about their values, how
do we make sense of this?

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.830
And shifting just a
little bit further

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.880 position:56%
to two other slaves I'll just tell
you about quickly, and then I wanted

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.830
to end with an aspect
of this research

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.020 position:56%
that took me on a three-year detour.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.680
And it's really where I think I had
to just decide I was going to stop.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.830
And it's where I hope to
pick up from here forward.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.410
But Mingo was an enslaved man who
I write about, and I found a poem

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.120
of his that was written on
the beam of a prison wall.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.880
And he had ran away when his family

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.660
and he were separated
from one other.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.870
And he didn't want to live
without his wife and his children.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.780
And apparently he had been
writing poems all his life.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.750 position:56%
And he wrote this poem and he's
thinking about this is his last life

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.710
on earth and he probably
won't see his family again.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.770
And he wanted to leave
something for them

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.900
to think about if they ever knew.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.080
But this was just his way of sort
of addressing his enslavement.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.400
I'm not going to read
the whole poem,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.100
but I'll just read what
he would say to his wife.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.030 position:56%
"Dear wife, they cannot sell the
rose of love that in my bosom glows.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:19.520 position:56%
Remember as your tears may start,
they cannot sell thy immortal part."

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.320
And so for me, Mingo recognized
that there was a place in him,

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.430
in his wife, and in their bodies
and their souls and their spirits

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.900
that could not be commodified,
that could not be sold.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.200
And I feel like he's trying
to leave that message for her.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.460
Isaac is another enslaved man
that I think out of everybody

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.580
in the whole book --
he's in chapter five --

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.920
really exemplifies soul value.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.850
He was caught for planning
an insurrection.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.280
It was a conspiracy because
somebody found out about it.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.760
And they captured him, put him in
jail, and they were trying to find

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.060
out who else was involved in this.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.630
And they kept asking him
questions, you know, like --

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.930
and he said, "I'm the one.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.230
Take me. I'm the one.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.530
There's nobody else."

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.830
And they said, "Well, there's got

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.130
to be other people
that were doing this."

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.430
He's like, "No, take me.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.730
I'm the one.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.030
I'm the man.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.330
I'll live with the consequences."

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.170
And so that night his minister,
who he was very close to,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.130
came to visit him in jail.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.090
And they had a four-hour
conversation.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.820
And they talked, they laughed,
they cried, they prayed together.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.210
And we have this evidence
from a newspaper writer

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.940
who was there at the jail.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.950
This is how I know
the story about Isaac.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.290
And the minister was that
tears because the minister felt

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.590
like he was the guilty one.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.170
He said, "I feel like
I'm the guilty one.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.470
I feel like I'm the hypocrite."

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.810
And he said this is a noble man.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.830
You know? And when he asked him,
he said, "Well, don't you love us?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.290
Why would you plan
this rebellion, Isaac?

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.590
I don't understand."

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.480
And Isaac says, "I love
you and I love master.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.160
I love my master, I love
my mistress," he said,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.680
"But I will kill you, too,
first if I have to," he said,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.980
"Because I want to be free.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.320
And I believe that God is a god
of the black and the white,"

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.590 position:56%
this is the language he uses, "and
that I'm not supposed to be captive.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.530
I'm not supposed to
be held captive."

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.700
And so the next day after they
finished praying and crying,

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.130
it was the day of his execution.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.160
He was there and he was
getting ready to be hung.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.250
And he was there and there
were other men there.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.880
There were four or
five other men present.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.250
And one of them was his
brother, Isaac's brother.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.120
And they said, "Do you
have any final words?"

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.330
A rope is around his neck,
he's standing at the gallows.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.780
They're about to put the latch
to let the floor underneath him

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:16.020 position:56%
and he says, "I have no other words,
except for if you just let me die,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.150 position:56%
you know, I will die a noble death."

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.370
And he said -- and he looked at
the other men, he said, "Comrades,

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.740
be men and die like men."

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.870
He jumped before they
could pull the latch,

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.070
lifted up his feet,
and hung himself.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.880
And although it's like from
our perspective it might seem

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.030 position:56%
like suicide, it's his way of
expressing his own power in deciding

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.060
when he's going to die, in deciding
when his life is going to end.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.600
For so long his life was
controlled by other people.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.190
He did not tell whoever
else was involved.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.380
And as soon as that happened,
the other four or five men

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.550
that were there did
the exact same thing.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.540
And so they all took their lives

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.560
without letting somebody else pull
the latch from under their feet.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.150
And I think that is one of the
strongest evidence of soul value

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.860
for me out of all the cases
that I tell in this story.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.130
And so I thought that
I would end the book

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.180
and when I was writing it
thought that the book would end

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.440
with them reflecting on life and
life after death or life at death.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.470
Because some of them,
death meant freedom.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.070
Elizabeth Keckley says --
thinking about death she says,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.410
"At the grave at least we should be
permitted to lay our burdens down,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.730
that a new world, a world of
brightness may open to us.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.340
The light that is denied us
here should grow into a flood

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.260
of effulgence beyond the dark,
mysterious shadows of death."

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.670
So they're looking towards death
as a place, a respite place, right?

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.800
And one of the descendants of Nat
Turner, Lucy Turner also speaks

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.620
of death, and she says, "Sometimes
there is a victory in the grave,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.970
which leads to a bright eternal
heaven where faith, hope, charity,

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.420
love, and justice shall last
forever without ceasing."

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.730
And this is where I was thinking
that I was going to end the book.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.020
And I then discovered
that once their bodies --

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.430
once they died, there was
an illegal traffic and trade

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.880
in their cadavers were planters
were then selling their bodies

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.770
to medical schools for
anatomical research.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.380
And so that the commodification
extended beyond the grave,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.280
beyond their natural lives.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.840
And I just want to show
you a few slides of that.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.630
This is what I call the
domestic cadaver trade

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.730
where enslaved people were put
sometimes -- and I should say this,

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.290
it's not just enslaved people.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:30.630
Any unclaimed bodies, white,
black, any nationality,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.990
whether they were unclaimed,
whether they were

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.890
from an alms house,
a jail, a hospital.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.930
There was a certain period that
if the body wasn't claimed,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.930
then they could be turned over
to medical schools for research.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.230
All right?

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:45.620
Now, I was interested in those
that were of the formerly enslaved,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.420
and I was trying to find, you
know, where are these bodies?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.770
I don't know whether or not all of
them were, but I did find a number

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.890
and numbers of black bodies
on dissection room tables

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.310
and in the records of
these medical schools.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.880
And this is the three-year
detour I took.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.640
So one of the things that they
did, they had these resurrect men,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.950
grave robbers exhume
bodies out of graves

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.560
and they would put
them in bags like this.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.410 position:56%
Or they would put them -- I thought
I had the whiskey one there, next --

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.540
this is an outdoor dissection
that took place at the University

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.300
of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.590
It's a disturbing image.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.430
And you'll see the black
gentleman in the front sitting

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.340
on the pail is the janitor or
probably the resurrection man.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.530
This picture was taken
after slavery.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.020
But one of the things
I found was most

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.420
of the medical schools had
African-American janitors,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.500
and the janitor's role was to
procure bodies for dissection.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.450
So there were African-American men
that were owned by universities --

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.870
we're learning a lot about
slavery in universities now;

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.740 position:56%
there will be a watershed of studies
in the next few years coming --

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.970
but they were owned
by the university,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.730
and the university paid them to go
get bodies and get fresh subjects

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.860
for dissection is the
language they used.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.630
These men were resurrection men.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:05.470
At the top of the screen you'll
see the very top of the picture --

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.330
I don't know if you can see --

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.440
the very top here is an
African-American man whose name is

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.550
Grandison Harris, he worked for
the Medical College of Georgia.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.900
And he worked there
for a number of years.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.850
Seven faculty members owned
one-seventh of his body.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.610 position:56%
So they actually used his body as --
you know, if you left the college,

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.570
you could then sell your
one-seventh share of Grandison.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.150
But he was property
of the university.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.620
And these are the whiskey
casks that was the other --

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.770
they were taking them
long distances.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.920
If they were traveling over state
lines, they would hide them.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.220
They would sometimes ship them.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.860
After 1842, they'd put them on
the railroad industry as well

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.340
after railroads were built.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.610 position:56%
And I found that a lot of the routes

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.680
for the domestic cadaver
trade were the same routes

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.290
as the domestic slave trade,
which I think is really ironic.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.200
So even on ships, in the bellies
of these ships, or even steamboats

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.820
where enslaved were kept, there
were also deceased enslaved people

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.850
in casks being sent to medical
schools for anatomical research.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.890
This is a picture of Chris
Baker at the Medical College

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.720
of Virginia, which is VCU today.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.610 position:56%
He was one of the major
resurrection men who was born there.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.780
His father was in the
business before that.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.280
So we know that this was going on
as early as the 1820's, 1830's.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.150
And it wasn't until the
1880's in most states

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.080
that they had anatomical acts
where they could then try

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.880
to regulate this traffic.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.590
This is another picture from 1896.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.020
This is from <i>Murder in Virginia</i>,
a book by Suzanne Lebsock.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.590 position:56%
And she talks about Chris Baker here
because there was a murder case.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.480
And there was a dispute about
who was going to have the body;

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.520
was the family going to
have the body to bury

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.190
or was the medical school
going to have the body?

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.980
So there was this fight
over the body.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.970
And you see Chris Baker
even after slavery

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.620
in 1896 is still the go-to
person for transporting bodies.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.890 position:56%
And after I finished the book, I
found a notice about Chris' funeral.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.230
And one of the things
that I'm working

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.310
on now is a new book
called <i>Blood Ties</i>.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.820 position:56%
And the it's history of these
resurrection men and their offspring

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.170
because a lot of them were two

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.000
or three generations deep
working at these institutions.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.770
And I'm trying to understand
what their lives were like

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.500
and how they grew up
to learn this business.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.710
But they had elaborate funerals for
them because they were well-liked

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.290
and they were well-respected
among the medical community.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.960 position:56%
But a lot of the people whose bodies

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.160
that they traded never
had a proper burial.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.450
And so I thought that was a
really interesting contrast.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:37.330
And they paid to go to
these anatomy lectures.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.870
So there was money
generated out of the lectures.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.170
There was money for the bodies.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.560
There was money to pay
the faculty members.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.140
These are just some anatomy
admission lecture tickets.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.650
And in 1882, these were all from a
scrapbook from the medical college

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.220
in Philadelphia, College
of Physicians.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.380
This is just them writing out
the story of body snatching.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.610
I had to start in the 1890's

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.930
and move my way back
to find this history.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.880
And I knew it would be like
a needle in a haystack.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.660
Michael Sappol from the National
Library of Medicine talked about it

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.460
in <i>A Traffic of Dead Bodies</i>.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.860
Margaret Washington talked

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.590
about this particular trade
briefly in <i>Medical Apartheid</i>.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.060 position:56%
And Todd Savitt also did write about
this in <i>Medicine and Slavery</i>.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.590
And so I wanted to look for
that needle in a haystack

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.650
and spent three years in medical
libraries, medical schools looking

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.750
at their admissions books,
looking at their account records

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.810
and lecture notes and found
a number of quote unquote

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.970
"Negro subjects" for
dissection there.

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:38.420
Stephen Kinney out of Liverpool is
also doing work on this as well.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.090
He's looking at medical museums.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.750
So there's going to be more
work coming out in this area.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.190
And this is just a draft of
the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.490
which then says, you know,
there's regulation on who gets

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:51.920 position:56%
to have these bodies and how they're
equally distributed amongst the

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.020
medical colleges.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.380
This is just some more
documents on that.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.780
The post-Anatomy Act,
they have the list.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.260
This is before it becomes
more institutionalized,

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.890
and then it becomes records
of an anatomical review board.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:10.730
And Dr. [inaudible] at UVA,
who's here, is doing work on this

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:16.430
from the 20th century forward, late
19th century through, like, 1930's.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.500
And so she's looking at these
particular records as well.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.810
So you'll see more
work in this area.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:27.330 position:56%
And I wanted to just close with this
fact that the bodies that were found

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.900
from the Medical College of
Georgia where Grandison Harris was

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.020
for several years serving as the
chief body snatcher or janitor,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.890
they were finally laid
to rest in 1998.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.570
So this history's a lot closer
to us than people realize.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.480
People always want to say,
"Oh, slavery was so far away."

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.310
But these bodies were just
buried not too long ago.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.320
The Medical College of Virginia
or VCU has also uncovered a number

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.240
of bodies that were in a well
that we believe were the bodies

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.430
that Chris Baker had helped exhume.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.770
And they're in debates now about
what kind of ceremony they want

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:06.330
to have to honor those that were
dishonored in a previous lifetime.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.240
And they were buried
here in unmarked grave.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.590
Their remains were there.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.850
They put in a 2,500-pound vault
so that no one would tamper them.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:20.520
And the last sentence here says,
"May they rest in external peace."

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.510
Thank you very much.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:30.570
[ Applause ]

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.950
So I have this here
because I did a piece

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.880
in the <i>Times</i> last year
about this body trade.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.200
And I started getting
emails like this

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.740
where people were sending me facts

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.700
that there are catalog
entries for skulls today.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.260
Nat Turner's skull was recently
turned over to the family.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.420
They're doing forensic testing
on it right now to find out,

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.720
and the family wants to do
a particular burial for him.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.650 position:56%
So this is not a history that's old.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.950
It's still here.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.790
This is a newspaper ad about
the bones and the remains

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.390
from Virginia Commonwealth
University that I mentioned.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.030
So we are still dealing with
this history, and I would love

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.120
to have conversation about
anything I've talked about,

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.410
including the contemporary
ramifications

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.710
of this history as well.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:24.920
And there's a microphone
circulating for Q&amp;A.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.770
Over here, yeah.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for this.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.630
I actually was very curious to
know more about the cadaver trade

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.940
and maybe the kind of
anthropological element of it

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:43.030
in terms of I know that up until
probably only the last five decades

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.780
or so there was a lot of kind of
hair-splitting between the idea

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.220
of people of different races
being different species.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.110
So as these cadavers are being
brought in and being tested

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.470
and being examined, are
they kind of feeding some

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:01.510 position:56%
of those very racist ideas,
species-ist ideas or are they looked

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.720
at as, "Well, hey, we have body
that we can finally look at.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.020
Let's make the" --

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.320
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry:
Great question.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.620
Yeah, great question.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.220
So I'll respond to that based
on the records that I covered.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.840
Because I was studying the medical
records, I was looking at doctors

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.120
and even students that were
training that were working

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.530
on their medical degrees
in the 19th century.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.330
And one of the students wrote
in his journal that he was happy

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.160
because it was time for the
dissections and there's a time

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.750
of the year where they
do the dissections

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.050
in the winter and the spring.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.630 position:56%
And he said, "I was happy to do this
and we had our first negro cadaver."

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.230
And he said, "And I was so
surprised when we cut it open

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.530
that the inside looked the same."

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.110
The inside looked the same as
the white cadavers, you know?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.690
So this is on the eve
of racial science.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.530
You know? A lot of what I'm writing

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.070
about happens before the American
Medical Association was founded.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.930
So it's before the regulation,
it's before cremation,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.540
it's before formaldehyde and some

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.280
of the preservation chemicals
that were being used.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.960
Some of these physicians that
were training the students,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.470
one of them had nightmares
about his body being tampered.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.680
And he was one of the first
cases of cremation in US history.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.110
So he made sure that
his body was cremated

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.410
because he didn't want that.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.290
But then there's others, there
are a few physicians at Harvard

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.820
who wanted their bodies and their
skeletons to be fully articulated

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.660
and on display so students
could study them.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:26.430 position:56%
So it's a tough balance because this
is also advancing American medicine,

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.730
you know?

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.170
And there's that.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.910
But then there's also
the exploitive part of it

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.450
that we can't really ignore.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.000
So those are some of the things.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.180
They also measured Morton --

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.210
Samuel Morton was part of a larger
trade in skulls in particular.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.300
And Favin [assumed spelling] wrote
about this in The Skull Trade.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.200
And they would measure the brains
because they were trying to decide,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.740 position:56%
like, were black brains smaller or
larger, what's the cranial capacity?

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.550
So there was a lot of that and
there was conversation about that.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.570
But often I would find in these
records they would say whether the

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.480
cadaver was negro or not.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.350
It would often say -- it would use
the word negro or negro skeleton.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.260 position:56%
There was one where they were
talking about a skeleton, they said,

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.710
oh, this skeleton when
it was fully macerated,

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:10.380
when they cleaned off all the
skin and the ligament and tendons,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.830
they got it all fully
articulated on the stand,

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.610
they said the bones
washed up so white.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.670
And this was a negro skeleton.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.300
And they said when he was
alive he stood six feet five.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.060
I remember when I saw that, that's
all I had on this particular case.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.840
But I was thinking did they know
that because they measured him

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.760
when he was laying down or is
this something they actually knew?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.060
Like, I have no idea.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.510
But I was, like, they talked
about how stood six foot five,

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.720
was it just because it
was the height or not?

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.650
And they talked about how they were
surprised that the bones could wash

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.740
up that white coming
from a negro cadaver.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.700
So those are the only
examples that I can think

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.710
of off the top of my head.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.010
Other questions?

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:52.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Dr. Berry
for this riveting lecture.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.500
I also am intrigued and disturbed

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.410
by your discussion
of the cadaver trade.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.800
And I'm curious whether either
the resurrection men or the kin

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.850
of the dead commented at all,
given your earlier discussion

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:12.680 position:56%
about soul value and the stress that
the enslaved and freed black men

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.740
and women placed on the
immortality of the soul regardless

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.410
of what happened to the body,
whether the resurrection men

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:25.490
or the kin of the dead commented
on perhaps the immateriality

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.170
in some sense of what
was done to the cadavers,

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.310
given the life of the souls.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.610
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Right.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.910
Good question.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:34.900
So in terms of the actual -- like,
Chris Baker, Grandison Harris,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.280 position:56%
the actual resurrection men that I
write about, that's what I'm working

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.050
on now, is to try to find what they
-- you know, their own testimonies.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.050
I've just found them -- I
found them in records books,

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:50.120
but I haven't found stuff
written and produced by them.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.170
I found a few quotes
from newspaper articles.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.910
Like, one of the schools,
there was a school play.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.210
They did a Christmas ceremony.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.850
And they talked to Chris on stage.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.970
So I have some, like,
voice from him.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.320
They said that he was very
comfortable with bodies.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.350
And I think that for him
-- and I don't know this;

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.270
I'll hopefully learn this as
I'm working on the next book --

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.560
that there's a separation.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.710
I'm hoping or I think that he might
believe that there's a separation

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.240 position:56%
from the spirit, the soul leaves
the body when it departs this world.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.620
And I think there were some
people that believed that so

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.470
that they could stomach
this if they knew about it.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.870
I mean, there was one slave
narrative that I found

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.390
by Charlie Grant who was
told to go exhume the body

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.960
of a two-year-old infant and
bring it to his enslaver.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.970 position:56%
And his enslaver was then -- as
Charlie says, "He's going to send it

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.080
to Virginia to a doctor and
they're going to cut it up."

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.220
So there's an understanding from
some enslaved people, you know,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.640
even in the 20th century
that are talking about that.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.100
There's also newspaper
advertisements of stories

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.970
where they talk about
people being afraid

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:56.730
to see Chris Baker on the street.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.320
You know, watch out,
he might snatch you.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.170
So there was this sort of lore
among the free black community

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.770
to watch out for him.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.340
But I don't have a sense yet of
what he felt or what he thought.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.930
I don't know about his spiritual
belief system, but people say

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.580
that he and Grandison
Harris were really good.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.280
Like, there was a newspaper
article that talked about Harris

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.170
and he could break open
a casket and get the body

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.650
out within a few minutes.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.860
And they just said he
was good at his craft.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.400
You know, it's kind
of a creepy craft,

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.330
but they said he was
very good at what he did.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.050
And there were other body
snatchers that were Irish

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.120
out in the Baltimore area.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.540
They were Irish, they were
not all African-American.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.170 position:56%
Sometimes -- and they worked as part
of a trading system where they had,

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.050
like, middlemen just like we
see with the slave trades.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.290
And so it's a very elaborate system

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:49.020
that we're still trying
to find out more about.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.320
Thank you.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you for this talk.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.080
Your idea about a soul
value is really provocative.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.960
And I think it's something we'll
talk about as historians for,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.060
you know, the next
few decades to come.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.710
But it seems like having
an individual recognition

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.750
of one's own soul value is a
resistive act in and of itself

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.000
as your powerful example
with the suicide showed.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.600
And so I'm wondering how this
sort of played out day-to-day

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.600
and what were the consequences
of an individual recognizing his

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.770
or her own soul value
or spiritual value?

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:30.380
Because it seems like, you know,
if a slave holder notices this,

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.100
there are very real
tangible consequences.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.300
What measures did enslaved
people have to take

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.240
to conceal this recognition?

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.540
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Right.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.840
I think it's great.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.710
I'm actually -- I've been working
on an article on soul value just

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.850
to tease it out more than
what I do in the book,

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.100
and I've been doing the
research for a couple months now.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.780
And just tracing, like, just
Frederick Douglass is one example.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.040
You're not going to see them
call soul value, you know,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.340
I'm not seeing that there.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.950
But he's talking about what I
would describe it, there was times

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.890 position:56%
where he felt like he couldn't take
anymore and he was going to give up.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:03.520
And he describes this feeling
in the core of his soul.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.400
He says it's like a flame
that's going to go out.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.700
It's almost done.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.730
He said than something came
over him and it rose again,

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.400
he was able to stand up and move

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.920
through that painful experience
whether it was a beating,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.880
a whipping, a sale,
or what have you.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.230
And so I'm trying now to look at
how people went in and out of this.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.730 position:56%
Because I do think that some of
them struggled and some of them went

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.190
through periods where
they were very low

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.990
and they may not valued
themselves much.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.290
They may have felt like
they wanted to give up.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.800
And then there was something else
that kind of kept them going.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.890
And Douglass describes
it as a flame.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.480 position:56%
And I think that's a really great
analogy and a way to think about it.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.780
It's something that almost --

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.770
for me it's got a dual purpose
because a flame burns, you know?

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.100
So you think about the heat
and the power of that, of fire,

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.510
and you also think of the fact

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.960
that a wind can either take
it out or make it stronger.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.940
And so that's one place.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:56.020
So I think it also is expressed
through day-to-day resistance,

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.430 position:56%
but then also having to measure when
to scale back so that your owner

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.750 position:56%
or your enslaver doesn't see that
you have this will that's different.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.090
And I think a lot of enslavers
recognized enslaved people

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.490
that had strong wills, and
they would try to do all kinds

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:08.830
of things to combat that.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.840
So slavery is a system, I always
say, of negotiation, you know?

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.250
And sometimes literacy, writing
yourself a pass, you know,

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.350
getting away, finding a way to
escape slavery might have been

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.240
that one person's way of
expressing soul value.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.280
And I don't know that
I'm committed to saying

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.160
that soul value is
all based on, like,

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.250 position:56%
a Christian belief system, you know?

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.310
I think that there's some that
are African belief systems

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.780
that would fall along this,
and it may even be people

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.010
that don't believe in a
higher power, but they believe

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.710
in something about
will and survival.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.950
And so I do see that, but that's
something that I'm sort of trying

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.890
to tease out a little bit.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:52.260
I hope that answers your question.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.560
Okay, good.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your talk.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.480
This was amazing.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:03.070
And you kind of just touched on a
little bit what my question was,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:11.240
was this idea of soul or spiritual
value, did you see it more fleshed

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.000
out in the enslaved
who were Christian?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.300
I mean, you talked about Isaac
met with his minister and how --

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.540
you know, if they both
believed in the same god.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.020
So I'm just curious,
did that come up?

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.320
How did that develop?

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.620
And I liked the fact that
you mentioned that those

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.820
who didn't believe in a higher
power still believed in themselves

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.870
and also the culture they
came from, from Africa.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.600
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Yeah,
it's easier to see it with those

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.210
that were Christian because they'll
talk about it because they believe

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.030
that there's something
above them that governs,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.950
like a higher being, a god.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.110
But even people with African
religious belief systems believe

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.990
in ancestor gods and other people
that have influence on their lives,

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.720
even people that came before them
that they may have never met.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.630 position:56%
And so there's that influence there.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.550
But I think for me, I saw a lot of
soul value in those that ran away

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:09.440
and I always say to
people it doesn't mean

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.620
that most enslaved people
escaped -- successfully escaped --

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.270
it just that the records
that survived

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.120
because abolitionists wrote
them, wrote about these stories

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.640
in newspapers or I've used William
Still's Underground Railroad

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.190
and found evidence
of soul value there.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.220
Even in the published
narratives from 1825 all the way

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:33.120 position:56%
through 1870's, the published
primary narratives, there's evidence

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.480
of soul value woven all throughout.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.720
Some of them recognize
god as a Christian being

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.550
and recognize their soul and
their spirit as something

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.990
that lives beyond this here and
now in this space that they're in.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.320
And there's others that did
not necessarily say that

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.830
or mention a Christian god but
still believed in something

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.530
about themselves, that there's
got to be a better place.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:01.820
And for some, a better place
was Africa or parts of Africa.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:13.210 position:56%
For some a better place was to be on
the other side of the here and now,

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:17.010
whatever that is for them.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:27.420
And so I'm sort of working through
how I want to describe that.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:35.050
But here I use evidence
of where they're talking

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:40.190
about these pulls inside them to
know that they're not the commodity

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:42.960
or that value, that dollar
value that's on their bodies,

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.690 position:56%
to know that that's not who they are

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:49.530
and that there's something
beyond that, that there's someone

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:54.130
that encompasses much
more than that.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.430
Thank you.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.730
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more question.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.030
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Okay.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.330
&gt;&gt; What wonderful talk, thank you.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.030 position:56%
One of the most complicated families

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:08.610
in American history's is Thomas
Jefferson's, patron of this library

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.350
and buildings named after him.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:14.140
And his slaves in many
cases are his children.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.450
He's also a math guy and he
knows values of object --

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.950
have you looked into his papers
and does he go into this?

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:18.250
&gt;&gt; Daina Ramey Berry: Yes, I have.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:19.550
And actually, I want to read
you a quote that I use here.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:20.850
I looked at his work for
a while and I was trying

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:22.150
to decide how deep I wanted to go.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.450
I have some of the values of
his enslaved people in the book,

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.750
but they're part of the dataset.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.050
But what I did with Jefferson
here, just at the beginning

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:27.350
of the introduction I have a quote
from Benjamin Banneker who writes

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.650
to Thomas Jefferson in
August 19th of 1791.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.970
He says, "We are a race of
beings who have long labored

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:31.270
under the abuse and
censor of the world.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.570
We have long been looked
upon with an eye of contempt

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.050 position:56%
and that we have long been
considered rather brutish than human

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.350
and scarcely capable
of mental endowments."

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.140 position:56%
so he's trying to look at him and
say let's not just make us a number.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.440
We're human beings, we've
helped build this country.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.110
So I didn't go into too much
detail about him there in the book,

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:41.410
but I do have the figures in there.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.710
There was something else
I was trying to think

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.010
of I wanted to say about Jefferson.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.310
It's escaped me.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.610
Yeah, sorry.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.910
But thank you.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:49.210
Thank you very much.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.510
Appreciate it.
