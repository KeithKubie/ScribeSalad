00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:22.730
A 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:34.530
common 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.450
image in pop-culture is that of a castle moat
filled to the brim with water and hungry crocodiles.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.910
So did anyone ever actually do this?

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.089
The short answer is that it doesn’t appear
so.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.540
That said, while there’s no known documented
instance of crocodiles intentionally being

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.839
put into moats, we do know of at least one
castle that had (and has, in fact) a moat

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.570
full of bears…

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.650
Before we get to that and why crocodiles in
moats are probably not the best idea in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.610
world, or at least not a very efficient use
of resources if your concern was really defence

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.620
of a fortress, we should address the fact
that the common image most people have in

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.200
their heads of a moat isn’t exactly representative
of what historical moats usually looked like.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.120
To begin with, moats have been around seemingly
as long as humans have had need of protecting

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.530
a structure or area, with documented instances
of them appearing everywhere from Ancient

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.730
Egypt to slightly more modern times around
certain Native American settlements.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.000
And, of course, there are countless examples
of moats being used throughout European history.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.210
In many cases, however, these moats were little
more than empty pits dug around a particular

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.190
piece of land or property- water filled moats
were something of a rarity.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.740
You see, unless a natural source of water
was around, maintaining an artificial moat

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.140
filled with water required a lot of resources
to avoid the whole thing just turning into

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.810
a stinking cesspool of algae and biting bugs,
as is wont to happen in standing water.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.660
As with artificial ponds constructed on certain
wealthy individuals’ estates, these would

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.770
have to be regularly drained and cleaned,
then filled back up to keep things from becoming

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.770
putrid.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.030
Of course, if one had a natural flowing water
source nearby, some of these problems could

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.230
be avoided.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.420
But, in the end, it turns out a water filled
moat isn’t actually that much more effective

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.380
than an empty one at accomplishing the goal
of protecting a fortress.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.080
And as for putting crocodiles (or alligators)
in them, introducing such animals to a region,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.650
beyond being quite expensive if not their
native habitat, is also potentially dangerous

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.340
if the animals got out.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.980
Again, all this while not really making the
act of conquering a fortress that much more

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.490
difficult- so little payoff for the extra
cost of maintaining crocodiles.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.200
Unsurprisingly from this, outside of a legend
we’ll get to shortly, there doesn’t appear

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.790
to be any known documented cases of anyone
intentionally putting crocodiles or alligators

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.520
into their water filled moats.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.870
It should also be mentioned here that while
at first glance it would appear that the key

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.920
purpose of a moat is to defend against soldiers
attacking at the walls, they were often actually

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.650
constructed with the idea of stopping soldiers
under the ground.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.340
You see, a technique favoured since ancient
times for breaching cities, fortresses and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.080
fortified positions was to simply dig tunnels
below any walls surrounding the position and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.580
then intentionally let them collapse, bringing
part of the wall above that section tumbling

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.580
down.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.489
Eventually this was accomplished by use of
explosives like gunpowder, but before this

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.360
a more simple method was to cart a bunch of
tinder into the tunnel at the appropriate

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.209
point and set the whole thing ablaze.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.670
The idea here was, after all your diggers
were out, to destroy the support beams used

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.819
to keep the tunnel from collapsing while digging.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.700
If all went as planned, both the tunnel and
the wall above it would then collapse.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.660
To get around this very effective form of
breaching fortifications, moats would be dug

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
as deeply as possible around the fortification,
sometimes until diggers reached bedrock.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.640
If a natural source of water was around, surrounding
the fortress with water was a potential additional

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
benefit over the dry pit at stopping such
tunneling.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.079
Either way, beyond making tunneling more difficult
(or practically impossible), dry and wet moats,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.199
of course, helped dissuade above ground attacks
as well thanks to moats being quite good at

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.639
limiting an enemy’s use of siege weaponry.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.120
In particular, devices such as battering rams
are rendered almost entirely useless in the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.349
presence of a large moat.

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.960
Though the later advent of weapons such as
trebuchets made moats less effective overall,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.110
they still proved to be formidable barrier
capable of kneecapping a direct assault on

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.559
a castle’s walls.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.639
All this said, it wasn’t as if proud moat
owners didn’t put anything in them.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.800
There are plenty of ways to beef up moat defences
without the need for water and crocodiles.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.800
Pretty much anything that slows an enemy’s
advance works well.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.129
And, better year, anything that is so daunting
it deters an attack at all.

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.930
In fact, archaeological surveys of moats have
found evidence of things like stinging bushes

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.819
having once grown throughout some moats.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.650
Whether these were intentionally planted on
the part of the moat owners or just a byproduct

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.029
of having a patch of land they left unattended
for years at a time isn’t entirely clear.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:27.270
But it doesn’t seem too farfetched to think
this may have been intentional in some cases.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.610
As you might imagine, wading through stinging
or thorny plants while arrows and rocks and

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.479
the like are raining down at you from above
wasn’t exactly tops on people’s lists

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.409
of things to do.

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.659
As for moats that were filled with water,
while filling them with crocodiles or alligators

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.999
wasn’t seemingly something anyone did, some
savvy castle owners did fill them with fish

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.889
giving them a nice private fishery.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.439
(As mentioned, artificial ponds built for
this purpose were also sometimes a thing for

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:59.249
the ultra-wealthy, functioning both as a status
symbol, given maintaining such was incredibly

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.409
expensive, and a great source of food year
round).

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.469
Moving back to the dry bed moats, when not
just leaving them as a simple dug pit or planting

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.969
things meant to slow enemy troops, it does
appear at least in some rare instances fortress

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:20.349
owners would put dangerous animals in them,
though seemingly, again, more as a status

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.189
symbol than actually being particularly effective
at deterring enemy troops.

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:29.749
Most famously, at Krumlov Castle in the Czech
Republic there exists something that is most

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:36.529
aptly described as a “bear moat”, located
between the castle’s first and second courtyard.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.520
When exactly this practice started and exactly
why has been lost to history, with the earliest

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.430
known documented reference to the bear moat
going back to 1707.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:54.330
Whether designed to serve as a stark warning
to potential intruders, a status symbol, or

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.189
both, the castle’s grizzliest residents
were tended to by a designated bearkeeper

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:02.679
until around the early 19th century when the
practice ceased.

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:07.929
This changed again in 1857 when the castle’s
then resident noble, Karl zu Schwarzenberg,

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:13.089
acquired a pair of bears from nearby Transylvania
intent on reviving the tradition.

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:17.309
From that moment onward, outside of a brief
lapse in the late 19th century, the castle’s

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.589
moat has almost always contained at least
one bear.

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:26.499
Today the bears are most definitely completely
for show, and each year bear-themed celebrations

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:30.819
are held at Christmas and on the bears’
birthdays during which children bring the

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:31.819
bears presents.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.839
If bears aren’t you thing, Wilhelm V, the
Prince Regent of Bavaria, in the late 16th

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:44.020
century supposedly kept both lions and a leopard
in the moat of Trausnitz Castle while he lived

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.020
there.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.069
However, again, it appears that Prince Wilhelm
kept the animals more for show and fun than

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.809
he did for defence.

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:55.520
Beyond dangerous creatures, his moat also
contained pheasants and a rabbit run.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.869
Moving back to crocodiles being put in moats,
the earliest reference to something like this

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:05.319
(though seemingly just a legend), appears
to be the legend of the Coccodrillo di Castelnuovo.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:11.449
This story is recounted by the 19th and 20th
century historian and politician Benedetto

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.719
Croce in his “Neapolitan Stories and Legends“:

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:19.749
In that castle, there was a moat under the
level of the sea, dark, humid, where the prisoners,

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.899
who they want to more strictly castigate,
were usually put.

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:27.369
When, all of a sudden, they started to notice
with astonishment that, from there, the prisoners

00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:28.369
disappeared.

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:29.369
Did they escape?

00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:30.369
How?

00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:33.190
Put a tighter surveillance and a new guest
inside there, one day they saw, unexpected

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.440
and terrifying scene, from a hole hidden in
the moat, a monster, a crocodile entering

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.680
and, with its jaws, it grasped for the legs
the prisoner, and dragged him to the sea to

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.690
eat him.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.540
Rather than kill the creature, the guards
decided to make the fearsome creature an “executor

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.290
of justice”, sending prisoners condemned
to death to meet their end in its toothy maw.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.910
Exactly where the crocodile came from and
when this supposedly happened depends on which

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.470
version of the legend you consult, though
our favourite version suggests that Queen

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.420
Joanna II smuggled it over to Naples from
Egypt sometime in the 15th century with the

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.460
sole intention of feeding her many, many lovers
to it.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.760
A consistent element in most versions of the
legend is that the beast bit off more than

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.769
it could chew when it tried to eat a leg of
a giant horse, ultimately choking on it.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:28.140
Of course, this is generally thought to be
nothing more than a legend, with no evidence

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.910
that it actually occurred or even exactly
when.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.230
At least the story does show that the idea
of a crocodile in a moat isn’t just something

00:09:36.230 --> 00:11:14.260
found in modern 

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:22.490
pop culture.
