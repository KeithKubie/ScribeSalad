00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.490
Tattoos have existed for millennia.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.170
But testing what it does to your body?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.320
That’s new.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.030
And research has found the ink breaks down
and spreads nanoparticles throughout your

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.030
body.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.030
But is that bad?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.250
What does it mean?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.850
Tattooing has a bit of a dark side.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.850
The ink itself.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.299
Which is not regulated by the FDA.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.299
Which is fine.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.940
You’re just putting it into your body forever.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.060
When you get a tattoo, the ink is repeatedly
injected into your skin with a needle.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.490
The needle penetrates the top layer and deposits
ink into next layer.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.680
All this stabbing causes the immune system
to freak out (a lot).

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.410
Macrophages swarm to the area, and eat the
ink particles.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.260
This is how they’d stop a bacterial invasion,
but unlike bacteria, the ink doesn’t break

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.760
down inside the cell.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.530
Instead, the macrophage remains trapped in
the dermis, with a belly full of ink.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.940
The big problem is, because it’s unregulated,
inks can use “contaminants and preservatives

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.170
like nickel, chromium, manganese or cobalt.”

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.480
There are 200 different colorants and additives
in inks… and no one is really testing what

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.250
they might do to your body.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.720
In a new study, researchers attempted to find
out about one of these colorants: Titanium

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.430
Dioxide -- commonly used in white tattoo ink
-- also in foods, paints and sunscreens.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.890
They found, the ink broke up into nanoparticles,
which might cause chronic problems with the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.350
lymphatic system.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.190
No one knows exactly what these nanoparticles
could be doing.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.800
Or how long they remain there… we used to
just assume they were cleaned out!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.251
The lymph system is the unsung janitorial
system of the body; it’s how macrophages

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.250
clear the body of waste and pathogens.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.650
And, after a tattoo they’re tinted with
the color of the ink from your tat.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340
This was known, but people figured it was
cleared eventually.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.040
Now, it appears that may not be the case.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.170
Just make sure before you get your next tatt,
ask about their ink.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.600
Because no one else is going to on your behalf.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.170
