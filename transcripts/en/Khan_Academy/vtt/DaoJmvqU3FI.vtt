00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's do a few more
examples from the orders

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.940
of magnitude exercise.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.150
Earth is approximately
1 times 10

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.080
to the seventh
meters in diameter.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.760
Which of the following
could be Earth's diameter?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.490
So this is just
an approximation.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.700
It's an estimate.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.700
And they're saying,
which of these,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.960
if I wanted to estimate
it, would be close

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.640
or would be 1 times
10 to the seventh?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.300
And the key here is to realize
that 1 times 10 to the seventh

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050
is the same thing as one
followed by seven zeroes.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.542
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.000
Let me put some commas here so
we make it a little bit more

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.680
readable.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.212
Or another way of
talking about it

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:40.920
is that it is, 1 times
10 to the seventh,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880
is the same thing as 10 million.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.160
So which of these, if we were
to really roughly estimate,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.710
we would go to 10 million.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.090
Well, this right over here is
1.271 million, or 1,271,543.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.907
If I were to really
roughly estimate it,

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.490
I might go to one
million, but I'm not

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.030
going to go to 10 million.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.040
So I'd rule that out.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.510
This is 12,715,430.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.580
If I were to roughly
estimate this, well, yeah.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.830
I would go to 10 million.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.380
10 million is if I wanted really
just one digit to represent it,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.550
if I were write this
in scientific notation.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.412
This right over here is 1.271543
times 10 to the seventh.

00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:23.370
Let me write that down.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.479
12,715,430.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.020
If I were to write
this in scientific

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.642
notation as 1.271543
times 10 to the seventh.

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:38.100
And when you write
it this way, you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.683
say, hey, well, yeah, if I was
to really estimate this and get

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.160
pretty rough with it, and
I just rounded this down,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.210
I would make this 1
times 10 to the seventh.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.092
So this really does look
like our best choice.

00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:49.050
Now let me just verify.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.360
Well, this right over here,
if I were to write it,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680
I would go to 100 million,
or 1 times 10 to the eighth.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.890
That's way too big.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.600
And this, if I were to write
it, I would go to a billion,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.730
or 1 times 10 to the ninth.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.270
So that's also too big.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.790
So once again, this feels
like the best answer.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.650
Now let's try a couple more.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.980
So here we're asked,
how many times larger

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.160
is 7 times 10 to the fifth
than 1 times 10 to the fourth?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.250
Well, we could just divide
to think about that.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.640
So 7 times 10 to the fifth
divided by 1 times 10

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.650
to the fourth.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.790
Well, this is the same
thing as 7 over 1 times 10

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.370
to the fifth over 10 to
the fourth, which is just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.330
going to be equal to--
well, 7 divided by 1 is 7.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.480
And 10 to the fifth, that's
multiplying five 10's.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.317
And then you're
dividing by four 10's.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:41.900
You're going to have
one 10 left over.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.770
Or, if you remember your
exponent properties,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.300
this would be the
same thing as 10

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.110
to the 5 minus 4 power,
or 10 to the first power.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.230
So this right over here,
all of this business,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.437
is going to simplify
to 10 to the first,

00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:59.020
or I could actually
write it this way.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.590
This would be the same thing
as 10 to the 5 minus 4,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.470
which is equal to 10 to the
1, which is just equal to 10.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.750
So this is 7 times 10,
which is equal to 70.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.050
So 7 times 10 to the fifth is
70 times larger than 1 times

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.950
10 to the fourth.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.320
Let's do one more.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.620
So here, they're asking
us 3 times 10 to the ninth

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.080
is 30,000 times larger
than what number?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.010
So once again, we can divide.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.470
So we have 3 times
10 to the ninth

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.260
is 30,000 times larger
than what number?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.990
So let's just divide by
30,000 and see what we get.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.990
And here we've written
something in kind

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.805
of an exponential
notation, or we

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.830
should say scientific
notation actually.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.457
And here, we just
wrote the number out.

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.290
So one way we could do
it is we could either

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.320
write this number
out and then divide,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.280
or we could write this
in scientific notation.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.450
So let's do it either way.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.460
So if we were to expand
the top number out,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.660
we could write that as 3
followed by nine zeros.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.610
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.070
Let me put some commas
here to make it readable.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.570
And then we're dividing that
by 3 followed by four zeros.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.160
One, two, three, four.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.470
And then we could
cancel out the zeros.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.710
We could say, OK, let's divide
the top and the bottom by 10.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.950
Let's divide it by another 10,
by another 10, by another 10.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.470
And then, let's see, we've
done all the dividing by 10.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.840
And now let's divide the
top and the bottom by 3.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.340
So this would become a 1.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.770
This would become a 1.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.650
So on the bottom, we're
just left with a 1.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.830
And we'd have 1 followed by one,
two, three, four, five zeros.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.840
So this would be 1 followed
by one, two, three, four,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.260
five zeros, or 100,000.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.901
Now let's write it, both of
these, in scientific notation.

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:57.400
So 3 times 10 to
the ninth, I'm just

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.870
going to rewrite that as
3 times 10 to the ninth.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.430
And we're dividing
that by 30,000,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.390
which is the exact same thing
as 3 times 10 to the-- we

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.840
have one, two, three,
four zeros here.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.290
3 times 10 to the fourth.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.950
Or I guess I really
should say, we

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.500
have four places
after the three.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.670
So one, two, three, four.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.810
So 3 times 10 to the fourth.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.300
And so we could
divide the 3 by the 3,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.410
and then that will simplify.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.290
So 3 divided by 3 is just 1.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.390
And then 10 to the ninth
divided by 10 to the fourth,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.440
well that's going to be 10 to
the 9 minus 4, 10 to the fifth.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.690
So it's going to be 1 times
10 to the fifth, which,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.260
once again, is 1
followed by five zeros,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.840
or the exact same
thing as 100,000.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.620
So it's 30,000 times
larger than 100,000.
