00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.960
Solve the equation and
find excluded values.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.100
And what they're talking about,
about finding excluded values,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.000
is we need to think about what
values would make these either

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.119
side of this equation undefined.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.660
And the reason why
we want to do that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.200
is because as we
manipulate this,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.824
we might lose things
in the denominator.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.240
And then we might
get some answer.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.739
But if it's one of
those things that

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.890
made the original, the original
expressions, or either side

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.220
of the original
equation undefined

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.110
then that wouldn't be
a legitimate solution.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.530
So that's what they're talking
about, the excluded values.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.488
So what values do we have
to exclude here right

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:36.460
from the get go?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.790
Well 4 over p minus
1 won't be defined

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.050
if p is 1 because if p is
1, then this, then you're

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330
going to be dividing by 0.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.440
And that's undefined.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.930
So we know that p
cannot be equal to 1.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170
And over here, if p
was at negative 3,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.080
then this denominator would be
0 and it would be undefined.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.410
And so p cannot be equal
to 1 or negative 3.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.460
So these right here are
our excluded values.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.240
So now let's try to solve.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.027
Let's try to solve
this equation.

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:05.610
And I'm going to
rewrite it over here.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.170
So we have 4 over p minus 1
is equal to 5 over p plus 3.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.920
So the first thing we
could do, especially

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.070
because we can assume now that
neither of these expressions

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.520
are 0.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.353
And this is going to
be defined, since we've

00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:21.082
excluded these values of
p, is to get the p minus 1

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.040
out of the denominator.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.080
We can multiply the left
hand side by p minus 1.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.650
But remember, this
is an equation.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.590
If you want them to
continue to be equal,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.690
anything you do
left hand side, you

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.710
have to do to the
right hand side.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.230
So I'm multiplying by p minus 1.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.020
Now I also want to get this p
plus 3 out of the denominator

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.650
here on the right hand side.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.550
So the best way to do that is
multiply the right hand side

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.850
by p plus 3.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.530
But if I do that to
the right hand side,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.950
I also have to do that
to the left hand side.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.780
p plus 3.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.850
And so what happens?

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.930
We have a p minus 1 in
the numerator, p minus 1

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.760
at the denominator.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.099
These cancel out.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.765
So you have just a 1
of the denominator,

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.580
or you have no
denominator anymore.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.370
And the left hand
side simplifies

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.200
to 4 times p plus
3, or if you were

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.060
to distribute the
4, 4 times p plus 3.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.410
So that is 4p plus 12.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.590
And then the right
hand side, you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.040
have plus 3 canceling
with a p plus 3.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.870
This is p plus 3
divided by p plus 3.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.530
And all you're left with
is 5 times p minus 1.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.500
If you distribute the
5 you get 5p minus 5.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.930
And now this is a pretty
straightforward linear equation

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.700
to solve.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.750
We just want to isolate
the p's on one side

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.410
and the constants on the other.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.730
So let's subtract
5p from both sides.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.030
I'll switch colors.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.690
So let's subtract
5p from both sides.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.340
And we get on the
left hand side,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.050
4p minus 5p is
negative p plus 12.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.650
Is equal to, these cancel
out, is equal to negative 5.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.785
And then we could subtract
12 from both sides.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.740
And we get, these cancel out,
we get negative p is equal to,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.970
negative 5 minus
12 is negative 17.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.910
And we're almost done.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.720
We can multiply both
sides by negative 1

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.450
or divide both
sides by negative 1

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.160
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.900
And we get, negative
one times negative p is.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.700
So let me just scroll
down a little bit

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.610
so I have a little
bit of real estate.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.260
That's positive
p is equal to 17.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.160
p is equal to 17.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.590
And let's verify that
this really works.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.090
Well, it wasn't one of our
excluded values, but just

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.480
in case, let's verify
that it really works.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.630
If we go, if we have p is 17.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.780
We get 4 over 17 minus 1,
needs to be equal to 5 over 17

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.550
plus 3.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.330
I'm just putting 17 in for p,
because that's our solution.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.270
So this is the same
thing as 4 over 16,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.370
needs to be the same
thing as 5 over 20.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.900
Or 4/16 is the
same thing as 1/4,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.990
and that needs to be
the same thing as 5/20,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.330
which is the same thing as 1/4.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.990
So it all checks out.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.230
So these are excluded values.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.590
And lucky for us, this
wasn't one of them.
