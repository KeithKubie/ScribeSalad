00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.222
- [Voiceover] In the last
video, we tried to find

00:00:02.222 --> 00:00:05.948
the area of the region, I
guess this combined area

00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:08.999
between the blue and this
orange, the area, I guess

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.876
the overlap between these two
circles and we came up with

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.612
nine pi minus 18 all of that over eight.

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:18.316
What I want to do in this
video, you could have also

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:21.754
used a typical graphing
calculator to come up

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.211
with the same result, and
it would have actually

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.039
evaluated the definite integral.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.206
So let's see how you do that.

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:30.706
Now this, what I'm doing
here, you could do this

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:34.154
for a traditional, what if
you're dealing with Cartesian

00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:35.385
coordinates, rectangular coordinates,

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.033
or for polar coordinates,
cause it's really just about

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.834
evaluating the definite integral.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.921
So we wanted to evaluate nine
times the definite integral

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:45.617
from zero to pi over four
sin squared theta d theta,

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:47.309
so how do I do that?

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
Well I can go to second,
calculus, then I do the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.266
F N INT, that's definite integral.

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.868
So let's use that function,
and then the first thing,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.203
you want to say "well, what are you taking

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:01.795
"the definite integral of?"

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.424
And we're taking the
definite integral of...

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:09.775
Sine, actually I want
the parentheses, sine,

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.178
and I could use any variable
here, as long as I'm

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:15.732
consistent with what I'm
integrating with respect to.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:18.092
So I tend to use just the "x" button,

00:01:18.092 --> 00:01:19.261
because there is an "x" button,

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.168
but we'll just assume that
in this case x is theta.

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:26.168
So sine of x squared, instead
of sine of theta squared,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.227
we're once again assuming
that x is equal to theta.

00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:31.234
And then the next one, you specify,

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.437
"Well what's the variable you're taking

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:34.292
"the integral with respect to?"

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:36.912
In this case it's x, if
we'd put in a theta here

00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:39.600
then we would want to put
a theta there as well.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.741
And then you want the
bounds of integration,

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:43.873
and you should assume
that your calculator,

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.475
or if you're doing this,
if you're in radiant mode,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.375
or if you're dealing with
radiants, you should assume

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.443
you're in radiant mode, I just
did before I evaluated this.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.311
We're going between zero and pi over four.

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:59.394
Zero and pi over four.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.480
And then, we get...

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:07.941
So we get this number,

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.460
and then we wanted to
multiply it times nine.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.578
So my previous answer times nine.

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:14.088
If I just press times, it does this,

00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:16.363
"Previous answer times" nine,

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:18.603
is equal to this number,

00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:20.701
one point two eight four two nine.

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.658
So let's verify that
that's the same exact value

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:26.154
we got when we actually
evaluated the integral by hand.

00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:31.154
So if we take nine, nine pi
minus 18 divided by eight,

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.149
divided by eight, what do we get?

00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:44.002
We get the exact same value.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.940
So anyway, hopefully that's satisfying,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.698
that we got the same value either way,

00:02:47.698 --> 00:02:50.286
and a little exposure for
how you might be able to

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.636
evaluate some integrals
using a calculator,

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:54.923
which can be useful
when you can't actually

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:56.888
evaluate them analytically.
