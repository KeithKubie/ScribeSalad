00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:03.638
- [Announcer] This UCSD
TV Program is presented

00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:06.567
by University of California Television.

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:07.869

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:14.164
to keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:23.076
(lighthearted piano music)

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:25.764
We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:28.097
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.084
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:39.314
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:42.648
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:44.731
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.446
We grow up slowly,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.898
we hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:52.981
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:57.243
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:57.243 --> 00:00:58.243
of the past.

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:03.623
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:07.790
to exchange insight on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.179
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.262
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:33.591
(energetic piano music)

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:04.117
- It's an especial
privilege for us at ASU,

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.723
Arizona State University
to be collaborating

00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:08.420
for the first time
officially with our partners

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.133
here at CARTA to create this symposium

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.579
on evolution of medicine.

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.939
I've actually had the privilege
of working with Ajit Varki

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.700
on several previous ones on
medicine, one on the origins

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.192
of morality and I must say
that all of the efforts you see

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:24.318
from all these different people
and the quite extraordinary

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:26.553
production value, it's not just pretty,

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:28.379
it actually makes the science
better and we can hear

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.807
each other clearly and talk to
each other in wonderful ways.

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:35.076
I think it's a wonderful
investment and we thank everyone

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:36.993
who's made it possible.

00:02:37.898 --> 00:02:41.432
This field really, in terms
of the new version of it,

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:45.458
began about 25 years ago with
a question and it's a simple

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.800
question we all ask
ourselves at times that is,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.551
"Why didn't natural
selection do a better job?".

00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:53.154
(audience laughing)

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.587
You feel like when you're
sitting with your back pain,

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:57.861
and you think it's your back
pain and you go to your doctor

00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:59.606
and say, "Why do I have back pain?".

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.676
But, many of us have
been encouraging asking

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.895
a different question.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.387
The question is, "Why do almost
all of us have back pain?

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:08.455
Please couldn't we have a better job?".

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:11.134
And then then a kind of
off joke I make sometimes,

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:13.980
"We have figured out what
women want, we really would

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.229
like to know why is the birth
canal so narrow, really?".

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.504
So many things about the
body seem as if they could

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:24.716
be made better, in a way
that improves health simply,

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:27.520
but for some reason they haven't

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.731
Enormous efforts and have
gone in recent decades to try

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.884
and understand this whole
different kind of explanation

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:34.717
for disease.

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:36.242
Not why one person gets sick,

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.642
not why the mechanism is
broken in that person,

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:43.354
but why the mechanism is
vulnerable to failure in everyone.

00:03:43.354 --> 00:03:46.026
We're taking the transition
from a view of the body,

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.667
from a mechanics point of view which is,

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.030
hey it's broken, what's
broken, let's fix it.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.732
To an engineer's point of
view of asking instead,

00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:56.436
"Who designed this thing?

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.551
Why isn't it better?

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:01.399
Why can't it be made
better in the future?".

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.066
You'll hear marvelous examples of that

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.899
in the next few talks.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.779
The last couple decades however,

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.018
have vastly expanded the scope.

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:12.496
That question about why
our bodies aren't better,

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:14.648
is only one small part
of evolutionary medicine,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:16.553
which really includes everything

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:18.467
having to do with the basic
science of evolutionary

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.554
biology, being applied to
medicine and public health,

00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:24.034
really for the first time.

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:25.411
CARTA has been instrumental in

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.839
helping that transition happen.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.335
The medical school here is one of the few

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.363
where medical school
students are starting to get

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.048
a grounding in evolutionary
biology of the same kind

00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:38.093
of grounding that they get
in genetics, physiology,

00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:40.698
biochemistry and all of the other sciences

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:42.693
that are equally useful for medicine.

00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:43.901
The field that (mumbles)

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.813
We have the editor of the
main journal, "Evolution,

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:48.845
Medicine, and Public
Health", with us here today,

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:50.550
Stephen Stearns.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.786
There are societies,
international societies

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.613
for evolutionary medicine
and public health,

00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:57.676
it's having it's third meeting
in Europe, this August.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:59.531
There are all kinds of other meetings,

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.767
I'll show a slide in my talk briefly later

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.165
about how you can find more
information about those.

00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:06.320
For right now, I just want to emphasize,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.042
not only how much fun this all is,

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.339
but how important it is for us

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.533
to have chances to talk to each other.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:14.363
There will be only a 20 minute break,

00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:16.557
but we're going to try to
get you out on time for that.

00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:17.657
Do write down your questions,

00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:19.932
there's no chance for
questions between these talks,

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:23.586
all the questions will be at the end.

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.919
