00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:01.947
- [Voiceover] So let's see
if we can find the limit

00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:04.134
as X approaches negative
one of six X squared

00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:05.967
plus five X minus one.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.370
Now the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.699
is this right over here,
this expression could be used

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.965
to define the graph of a parabola.

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:16.219
And when you think about
this, I'm not doing

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.935
a rigorous proof here, parabola would look

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.780
something like this and this would be an

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.027
upward opening parabola,
look something like this.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:25.862
It is a, this graph,
visually, is continuous,

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:28.006
you don't see any jumps or gaps in it.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.256
And in general,

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:32.801
a quadratic like this

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.777
is going to be defined for all values of X

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.233
for all real numbers, and
it's going to be continuous,

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.013
oh, for all real numbers.

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:43.423
And so if something is
continuous for all real numbers,

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:45.905
well then the limit as X
approaches some real number

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.683
is going to be the same
thing, it's just a value

00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:50.535
within the expression at that real number.

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.652
So what am I saying, I'm just
gonna say it another way,

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.069
we know that some function is continuous,

00:00:57.151 --> 00:01:01.276
is continuous at some
X value, at X equals A

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:05.193
if and only if, I'll
write that as iff, or iff,

00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:08.048
if and only if the limit

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.535
as X approaches A of F of X

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:13.962
is equal to F of,

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.487
is equal to F of A.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:18.581
So I didn't do a rigorous proof here,

00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.431
but just, it's conceptually not a big jump

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.632
to say, okay, well this
is, this is just a standard

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:24.937
quadratic right over here,

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:27.577
it's defined for all real numbers,

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:30.528
and in fact it's continuous
for all real numbers.

00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:32.487
And so we know that this expression,

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:34.451
it could define a continuous function,

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.789
so that means that the
limit as X approaches A

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.474
for this expression is just the same thing

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.732
as evaluating this expression at A.

00:01:41.732 --> 00:01:44.175
And in this case, our A is negative one.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:46.262
So all I have to to is
evaluate this at negative one.

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.583
This is going to be six
times negative one squared

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.833
plus five times negative one minus one.

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:57.399
So that's just one, this is negative five,

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.048
so it's six minus five minus one,

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.266
which is equal to

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.212
zero.

00:02:03.212 --> 00:02:04.545
And we are done.
