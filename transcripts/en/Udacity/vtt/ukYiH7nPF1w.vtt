00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
First, congratulations on making it through the course.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You have learned so much.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You've learned how to calculate the circumference of the earth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How to quantify motion. &gt;&gt;How to use Newton's laws to calculate acceleration.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
How to keep The Netherlands dry. &gt;&gt;How to find your location at sea.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How to protect tall buildings from lightening.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And even a bit of special relativity.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, it's time to use what you've learned and put it in practice on the final exam.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This exam will have no deadline, and you can take it whenever you want.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You'll get instant feedback on each question,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so you can submit as many answers as you'd like without penalty.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Once you're finished with the exam, you can complete the course

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
by going to your transcript page and clicking on the "Complete Course" button.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You will get one of four certificates based on how many answers you get correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The criteria for each of these certificates is below the video.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Good luck on the exam.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Teaching this course has been an incredible experience.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I've been really blown away by the amount of curiosity and helpfulness

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that I've seen in the forums.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'd like to say thank you to Jonathon for everything he's done to make this class possible,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to Grant, the editor and videographer.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Without him this wouldn't have happened.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And, of course, to you for everything you've done to make this class such a success.

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I can't wait to see you in future Udacity classes. Good luck on the exam.
