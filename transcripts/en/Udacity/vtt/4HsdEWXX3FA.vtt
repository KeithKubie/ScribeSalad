00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome to lesson two.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.670
We're going to start by digging into one
of the key materials in material design,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.150
paper surfaces.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.020
Material design seeks to describe
what your UI is made out of.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.570
We use the metaphor of distil
paper to build on top of

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.840
people's real world experiences to
make your UI easier to understand.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.530
&gt;&gt; Right.
We'll explain how the idea of

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.270
tangible surfaces can make your app
easier to interact with, how it can

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.630
focus attention, promote key actions,
and delightfully respond to user input.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.000
&gt;&gt; Once we've covered the theory,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020
we'll go over how to apply this
practice to our Android apps.
