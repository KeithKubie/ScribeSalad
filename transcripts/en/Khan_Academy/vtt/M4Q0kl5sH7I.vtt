00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.980
- [Instructor] We have spent many videos

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.700
talking about the three branches

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.470
of government of the United States,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.110
the legislative branch,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.030
which passes the budgets and makes laws.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.320
The executive branch,
which runs the government,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.870
and the judicial branch,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.780
that determines whether
things that are happening

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.500
are constitutional or not
and can interpret the laws.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.760
When we talk about these separate powers

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.710
and we talk about the checks

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.440
and balances they have on each other,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.950
the thing that you might
not have thought about

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.350
until this point is how many
employees each of them have.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.130
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.570
and just make a guess.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.610
How many employees do
you think each of these

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.670
branches have, or more importantly,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.980
which of these do you
think is the biggest?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.510
Well to answer your question,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.570
the great majority of federal employees

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.880
are within the executive branch.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
We're talking about a very
large number of people.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.960
If you don't include soldiers,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.000
we are still talking about
more than 2.5 million

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.580
people under the executive branch.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.530
If you include soldiers
then we're starting to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
approach closer to four million people

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560
under the executive branch.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.320
So what you see on this org chart

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.760
is that most of it sits
under the executive.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.420
That's because the executive branch

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200
is charged with running the government.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.790
So you have the familiar roles,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.300
the president, the vice-president,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.310
the executive office of the president.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.930
Then you have the various cabinet

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.410
departments right over here,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.410
and I could move to the left and the right

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.430
so you can see them.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.910
Things like the Department of Agriculture,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.730
Department of Interior,
Department of Commerce,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.780
Department of Justice,
Department of Defense,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.170
Education, State, on and on and on and on.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.180
Then within each of these departments

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.730
they can be quite, quite large.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.220
You could be talking about thousands

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.650
or in some cases even tens
of thousands of employees.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.260
But it's not just about those departments.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.260
If we go further down in
this diagram right over here,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.890
you see independent establishments

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.710
and the government corporations

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.270
that are under the executive branch.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.970
Things like the United
States Postal Service,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.540
the Peace Corps, you have
the Federal Reserve system.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.920
These are all under the executive branch.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.520
When you take all of these
things in total together

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.070
it's known as the federal bureaucracy.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.270
Now the word bureaucracy might

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.490
conjure up some images for you.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.920
You might imagine going to some
type of a government office

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.700
and trying to apply for something

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.770
and then having to fill
out a bunch of paperwork,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.320
or sit in line and then
wait for something.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.970
And so sometimes it gets a bad name.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.340
Even the word bureaucratic
tends to mean something that is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.470
a lot of process and not necessarily

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.040
something that moves quickly
or moves efficiently.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.980
But it's worth noting that
even though a lot of people,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.540
we like to pick on the bureaucracy,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750
and it is worth debating on how efficient

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.500
government is at certain things,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.260
we do need some form of a bureaucracy.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.010
Without a government bureaucracy

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.980
you would not have experts checking

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.000
on whether your food is safe,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.590
checking on which drugs actually work.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.490
You would not have thoughtful people

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.880
who are thinking about how
do we run our military,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.930
how do we determine how we
engage with other countries?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.650
So we do need a federal bureaucracy.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.990
These are the folks that are doing things

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.380
like writing and enforcing regulations.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.570
They're issuing fines
if you have bad actors,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.770
maybe a corporation that is polluting

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.800
where they're not supposed to.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.170
Now where do these people come from?

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.240
Well a lot of times the heads of these

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.980
various departments, say
the Secretary of Defense,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.660
who's at the top of the
Department of Defense,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.410
or the Secretary of State,
they are political appointees,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.900
they are appointed by the president

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.370
and confirmed by the Senate,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.140
we talk about that in other videos.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.530
But the great majority of the bureaucracy

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.620
does not come from what is
known as political patronage.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.010
Political patronage is,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.330
"Hey, you really helped
me with my campaign

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.380
"and I think you're a
pretty decent person,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.090
"I'm gonna give you a plum job

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.600
"at the top of the bureaucracy."

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.100
And even the word plum job,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.630
you should maybe take
it with a grain of salt

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.760
because some of these jobs

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.000
do require a lot of responsibility.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.140
But the great majority of the bureaucracy

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.880
is not from political patronage,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.510
but it's actually merit-based.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.030
These are folks, they might
take the civil service exam,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.833
they might have graduate degrees

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.420
in something that's relevant,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.380
let's say if they're working in

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.640
the Food and Drug Administration

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.030
they might know a little bit
about chemistry or biology

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.780
and will often, and no
organization is perfect,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.120
oftentimes people get
promoted for the wrong reason,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.000
but for the most part

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.660
they're going to be
promoted based on merit.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.840
So it's completely
reasonable for us to debate

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.650
how large this bureaucracy should be.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.660
For sure our federal bureaucracy
is sometimes inefficient,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.520
but we do need it,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.100
and we're talking about
millions of people,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.060
many of whom are experts in their field,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.910
who are really just trying to
help us run our government.
