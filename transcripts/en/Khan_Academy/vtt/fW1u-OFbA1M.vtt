00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.133
- [Voiceover] The number of
mosquitos in millions, M,

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.737
so M is the number of
mosquitos in millions.

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.895
In Brooklyn, New York
it depends on the June

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:09.287
rainfall in centimeters, R.

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:11.888
So R is the amount of rainfall
measured in centimeters.

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:14.094
And can be modeled by the function

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:16.160
M, so the number of mosquitos in millions,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.667
is equal to negative R times R minus four,

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.266
where R, once again, is the
rainfall in centimeters,

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.567
I guess in June.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.727
Alright, fair enough.

00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:26.261
Now let's see if we can
answer these questions.

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.651
And like always, I encourage
you to get inspired

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:32.576
and try to answer these
questions on your own.

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:34.225
(laughing) Alright, first one.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.934
How many centimeters of
rainfall will there be...

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.784
After how many centimeters of rainfall

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.291
will there be a population
of zero million mosquitos?

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.218
Or will there be just no mosquitos?

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:47.866
Zero mosquitos.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.747
Well let's just rewrite this function.

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:51.721
So our population of mosquitos,

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:53.554
it actually just helps
my brain to rewrite it,

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.436
to kind of process what's going on.

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.989
My population of mosquitos in millions

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.377
is going to be negative
R times R minus four,

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:04.909
where R is the number of,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.649
the number of centimeters of rainfall.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.831
So in order to have a
zero million population,

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.176
so that means M is going to
have to be equal to zero.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:15.208
So we have to figure out at what Rs,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.784
at what Rs is M equal to zero?

00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:21.012
So we just have to solve
this right over here.

00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:23.055
Well in order for this
expression right over here

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:23.927
to be equal to zero, notice it's

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:25.715
the product of two expressions.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.736
We are multiplying, you could view it as

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:32.402
we're multiplying negative
R times R minus four.

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:34.353
Let me do R minus four
in a different color.

00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:36.187
Times R minus four.

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:38.857
So if you're multiplying two
expressions and you get zero,

00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:41.645
one or both of them need
to be equal to zero.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:42.968
So let's see how that happens.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.334
So either negative R is
going to be equal to zero,

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:49.295
negative R is equal to zero, or

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:54.335
or you're going to have R
minus four is equal to zero.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:57.098
Or R minus four is equal to zero.

00:01:57.098 --> 00:01:58.816
So how does negative R equal zero?

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.279
We divide both sides by negative one

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:01.719
or multiply both sides by negative one

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.435
and you get r would need
to be equal to zero.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.456
How does R minus four equal zero?

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:07.848
Well you add four to both sides,

00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:11.284
you see that R would
have to be equal to four.

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:15.046
So it either is no rainfall,
zero centimeters of rainfall,

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:17.067
or four centimeters of rainfall,

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:19.691
you get a population of zero mosquitos.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.549
Now why does that,

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.268
let's just think about
whether that makes sense.

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:24.148
Of whether this is a good model for

00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:26.424
for the number of mosquitos.

00:02:26.424 --> 00:02:29.141
Well we always imagine mosquitos
need some standing water,

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:30.998
so if you have no rainfall,
there's not going to be

00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:32.624
any place for them to breed.

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:34.853
There's not going to be
any standing water, maybe.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.966
And the way this model seems, it's like

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.544
well if you have enough rainfall,

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:40.518
so some rain is gonna
help the mosquitos breed,

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:42.144
but then if you have enough rainfall,

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.164
they're just gonna get I
guess washed out someplace.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.090
i guess raindrops are
gonna hit them (laughing)

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.461
as they fly, I don't know what the,

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.852
what's actually happening
at the mosquito scale,

00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:51.803
but it's implying that if
there's a lot of rainfall

00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:53.683
it would actually be hard.

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:55.100
I guess you don't have
standing water any more.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.398
The water is moving
around and is overflowing

00:02:57.398 --> 00:02:59.326
and it's going into the
gutter and whatever else.

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:01.827
It would make it vey hard
for the mosquitos to breed.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.008
What is the maximum possible
number of mosquitos?

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:08.236
So the very idea that
they're asking us a maximum

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:11.395
implies that this quadratic over here,

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:12.904
and it is a quadratic and we'll see that

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.063
more clearly in a few seconds,

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:18.639
is shaped like this in order
to have a maximum point.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.707
Because if it was shaped like this,

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:21.100
it would have a minimum point,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.842
it wouldn't have any one maximum.

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:25.001
And because we have
this negative out here,

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.836
that makes us pretty confident

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:29.924
it is going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:32.547
But to understand what
this maximum point is,

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:34.777
let's write it in vertex form.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:36.959
Just as a reminder what
vertex form would be,

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.675
it would be writing it in the form of M

00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:41.975
is equal to

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:45.639
A times R minus

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.355
B squared, plus C.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:49.888
This right over here would be vertex form

00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:51.977
and it's very useful
because you get a sense

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:54.253
of when you hit a
minimum or maximum point.

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:55.925
If thing right over here is negative,

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.385
then the maximum value,
because this thing can only be

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.032
non-positive, the maximum
value would be this,

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.821
and then we could figure out
when does this equal zero?

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:04.863
And that's when you
hit that maximum value.

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:06.814
And if any of this seems foreign,

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:08.440
I encourage you to watch the videos

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.716
on vertex form.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.898
And I'm about to complete
the square on this character

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:14.361
in order to get here, so I encourage you

00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:16.885
to also watch the videos
on completing the square.

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:18.976
So let's do that.

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.788
So let's start with this expression

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:22.528
and I'm gonna start by,

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.456
actually, let's start by,

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:27.149
I'm gonna just distribute the R.

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:28.786
So if you have M

00:04:29.588 --> 00:04:31.806
is equal to, I'm gonna keep
the negative out front,

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.060
but I'm gonna distribute the R.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.522
R times R is R squared.

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:38.842
R times negative four is minus four R.

00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:40.304
And I want to complete the square.

00:04:40.304 --> 00:04:42.302
And once again, I encourage
you to watch those videos

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:44.949
if what I'm about to do seems like voodoo,

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.271
but to complete the square I want

00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:47.317
to add and subtract the same thing.

00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:48.687
I don't want to actually change the value

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:49.894
of the expression.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.195
And so I'll look at this coefficient,

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.679
this first degree coefficient
here, it's negative four.

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.955
Half of that is negative two.

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:58.834
If I square it, I want to add four.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:00.436
I want to,

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.989
I want to add four.

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.259
I want to add,

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.396
let me make it a different color.

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:10.013
I want to add four.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:12.545
Now once again, I can't just go around

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.774
adding numbers to expressions and assuming

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:16.214
the equality still holds.

00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:18.555
I have to add and subtract the same thing.

00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:21.852
While you might be tempted
to write a minus four

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.291
out here, because hey, I added four

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.592
and then I subtract four.

00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:26.658
But remember, when I add this
four in this parentheses,

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:28.168
i have this negative out front.

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:29.863
If I were to distribute this negative,

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.860
I essentially, this is a minus four.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.716
So if I wanted to add them out to be zero,

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.527
distribute this negative,
this would be a negative four.

00:05:35.527 --> 00:05:37.200
If I wanted to cancel out
this, this needs to be

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.732
a positive four.

00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:40.497
So once again, when
you look superficially,

00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:42.378
it looks like I just added four twice,

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:43.214
but I didn't.

00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:44.746
this right over here since
it has this negative sign,

00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:45.884
is a negative four.

00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:47.532
Negative four plus four is zero.

00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:50.713
I have not changed the
value of this expression.

00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:53.104
But anyway, now that I've done that,

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:55.124
this piece right over here,

00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:56.472
the whole reason why I added four

00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:58.028
is to make it a perfect square,

00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:02.579
this is now the same thing as R minus two,

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.457
R minus two squared.

00:06:05.457 --> 00:06:07.362
I have the negative out front.

00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:11.658
We have M equals negative
R minus two squared

00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:13.236
plus four.

00:06:13.236 --> 00:06:14.444
Plus four.

00:06:14.444 --> 00:06:17.578
And just like that, I've
written it in vertex form.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.552
So what's the maximum number of mosquitos?

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:21.618
Well let's just look at the structure

00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:23.823
of this expression a little bit.

00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:25.241
This piece,

00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:27.238
this piece right over here,

00:06:27.238 --> 00:06:28.004
that thing,

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:29.860
actually, let me not do it in
the same color as the four,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.742
let me do it in this orangish color.

00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:35.132
This piece right over
here is always going to be

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:36.897
less than or equal to zero.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.335
So that's always going to be less than

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:39.288
or equal to zero.

00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:41.738
It's always going to be non-positive.

00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:46.486
And so this whole expression
hits a maximum value

00:06:46.486 --> 00:06:48.344
when this thing is zero,

00:06:48.344 --> 00:06:49.363
because at any other point,

00:06:49.363 --> 00:06:52.219
it's gong to just take away
from this right over here.

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.448
So you hit a maximum value when this

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:55.886
is equal to zero.

00:06:55.886 --> 00:07:00.019
When negative R minus two
squared is equal to zero.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.040
Well that's going to happen when,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.337
well you can see when R
minus two is equal to zero.

00:07:05.337 --> 00:07:07.706
Or when R is equal to two.

00:07:07.706 --> 00:07:11.234
And when R is equal to two,
what is M going to be equal to?

00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:13.440
Well when R is equal to two, this is zero

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.182
and M is equal to four.

00:07:15.182 --> 00:07:18.317
R equals two and M is equal to four.

00:07:18.317 --> 00:07:20.128
So what's the maximum possible number

00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:21.382
of mosquitos?

00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:24.656
Well M equals four, it's gonna
be four million mosquitos.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:27.023
Remember, M is measuring in millions.

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:28.859
Four million mosquitos.

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:31.877
And then they ask us after how
many centimeters of rainfall

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:34.199
will the maximum number
of mosquitos occur?

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.824
Well, we figured it out.

00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:37.171
After two.

00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:38.332
After,

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.515
after two centimeters.

00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:42.465
Two centimeters of rainfall.

00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:43.974
So if we go back to our,

00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:46.064
if we go back to our model,

00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:49.244
at zero rainfall you have no mosquitos,

00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:50.569
then as it rains more and more,

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:51.660
you have more and more mosquitos.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.773
I guess more and more standing water.

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:54.260
You have a maximum number of mosquitos

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.141
at two centimeters of rainfall.

00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:58.091
At two centimeters we have
four million mosquitos,

00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:00.878
but after that I guess the
rain starts washing away

00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:02.572
the mosquito eggs or something

00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:04.338
and you start having
fewer and fewer mosquitos

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:07.007
all the way until you get to
four centimeters of rainfall.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.236
And I guess after four
centimeters of rainfall,

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:10.578
in theory you have

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:13.453
negative mosquitos, I guess.

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:14.963
I don't know what that would mean,

00:08:14.963 --> 00:08:16.124
and that might just be a situation

00:08:16.124 --> 00:08:17.633
where the model just breaks down.

00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:18.980
You obviously, I don't know what negative

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.302
million mosquitos would actually mean.

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:22.324
The relevant,

00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:26.526
the relevant area where
this model should hold

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:28.802
is between zero centimeters of rainfall

00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:30.543
and four centimeters, because after that

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:34.792
the model starts describing
negative values for M.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:37.066
So anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
