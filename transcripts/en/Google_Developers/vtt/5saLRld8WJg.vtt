MANDY WAITE: How popular is
Google App Engine for Java?

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.701
Most examples seem
to be written for

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:08.020
Google App Engine Python.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.985
FRED SAUER: I hope that's
not the case as far

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:12.300
as the sample mismatch.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
It is true that we launched
App Engine Python a year

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.410
before the Java runtime.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.090
So in 2008, it was Python, and
then in 2009, we added the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000
Java runtime, and later
we added Go.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.970
So there may be just a little
bit of bias still left in the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.785
system, because we originally
set out to just have a Python.

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:39.470
But I think things are
fairly evened out.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.880
If you go to the Google Cloud
Platform user on GitHub,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.170
there's many samples there.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.820
There's Java and
Python samples.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.160
Documentation, there should be
samples in both languages.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.010
I don't recall the exact kind
of popularity, but I thought

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.100
it was fairly even.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.050
It may be a 60/40 split, or
something like that with some

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540
percentage going to Go.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.170
But you shouldn't feel like
Java's an underappreciated

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.080
language on App Engine.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.620
That's definitely
not the case.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.130
And if you look at the talks
at I/O, you'll then see our

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.370
focus on Java users and making
sure they have a just as good

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.100
experience as Python.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.231
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:19.610
That's excellent.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.500
FRED SAUER: So, pick the
language that's good for you.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
MANDY WAITE: Yeah,
definitely, yeah.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.250
Absolutely.
