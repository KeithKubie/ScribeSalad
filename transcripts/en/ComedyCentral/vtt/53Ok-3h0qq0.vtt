- This is one for
the whole family.

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:04.070 line:0%
We see all these
beautiful bodies or faces,

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.272 line:0%
and we hear R.
Kelly song playing.

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.508
No actually, fuck R.
Kelly, cause he peed

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.842
on my grandma one time.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.210
He came to our church
and did a speech,

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.212
and he just-- the
whole front row.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.981
Alright, Brandy. We use Brandy.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.616
Brandy is way better.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.184
Like sweet Brandy, back when
she first got her titties,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.219
like around when
Moesha was coming out.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.621
Okay, so we hear
the Brandy song.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.690
People are like hooping,
dancing, performing,

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.059
like a little talent show.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.727
And then we hear
Brandy comes out.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.662
Now, we gotta do wide shot
of Brandy because Brandy's

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.264
eyes is where her ears is at.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.766
She might be the hammerhead
shark of the R&amp;B world.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.369
Brandy's like, "At Emerson
Funeral Home, we want you to

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.237
die looking sexy as hell,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.872
cause you might
be going to hell".

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.009
Kyron, Emerson Funeral
Home, die sexy.
