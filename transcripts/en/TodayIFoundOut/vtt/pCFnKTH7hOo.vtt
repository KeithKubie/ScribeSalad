00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.710
Whether in D.C., London, Adelaide or Madrid,
nearly all giant pandas in today’s zoos

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.110
are technically there on a 5 or 10-year loan
from China, and at a substantial price.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.020
It hasn’t always been this way, though.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.580
Beginning in the late 1950s and through the
early 1980s, the People’s Republic of China

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.680
used the gift of a giant panda as a means
of diplomacy; during those three decades,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.050
they gave over 23 pandas to nine countries
including Great Britain, Japan, Spain, United

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.350
States and Mexico.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.000
Most of these gifted pandas have perished
(in captivity, giant pandas have an approximate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.420
30 year lifespan compared to about 20 years
in the wild), although at Mexico City’s

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.970
Chapultpec Zoo, two “grandfathered” pandas
who are offspring of former gifted parents,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.100
Shaun Shuan and Xin Xin, remain.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.370
However, other than these two, it is difficult
to find a giant panda that doesn’t belong

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.370
to China.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.370
Why?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.901
In the early 1980s, China changed its policy
and decided to make a little money off of

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.700
this one-of-kind creature that, up until recently,
was really difficult to breed in captivity.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.990
Accordingly, today China charges around $500,000
to $1,000,000 per year for the loan of a giant

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.930
panda, with, at least in the case of the United
States rentals since 2011, a considerable

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.159
amount of that money required to go to giant
panda conservation efforts.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.680
As for the offspring of rented pandas, according
to the terms of the loans, any cubs born to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.219
rented-out giant pandas are China’s property
and must be returned to the country after

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.950
roughly two years; in addition, if a cub dies
while on loan and it is deemed to be because

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.650
of human error, a penalty in the hundreds
of thousands of dollars range may also be

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.710
assessed.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.049
The Chinese government also requires a life
insurance policy be taken out on each panda

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.049
loaned out.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.130
In the United States, the contracted life
insurance policy must be $1 million, set to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.680
be paid to the Chinese government should the
panda die.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.770
In addition, according to the current U.S.
contract, if the death is deemed to be from

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.490
improper care or otherwise caretaker error,
an additional $800,000 must be paid to China.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.080
Beyond the cost of acquiring them, giant pandas
are also expensive for zoos to maintain, as

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.440
they require special housing and, of course,
enormous amounts of fresh bamboo – with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.590
an adult eating up to 40 pounds of the fibrous
plant each day.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.690
(Note: if the bamboo isn’t fresh enough,
the pandas simply won’t eat it, requiring

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.620
that it either be grown nearby or imported
regularly.)

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.980
For reference on the total costs here, in
the last two decades the San Diego Zoo claims,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
after all associated costs have been tallied,
they’ve spent over $40 million on their

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.150
giant panda exhibit.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.879
However, the president of Zoo Advisors, David
Walsh, notes that “Yes, they are expensive

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.640
to maintain and exhibit, but they are a tremendous
draw.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.560
It does make economic sense, if you have the
right market.”

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.170
For example, in the year 2000, the first year
the Atlanta zoo had giant pandas, it broke

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.200
attendance records, and after its first cub,
Mei Lan, was born in 2007, it saw another

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:28.209
attendance surge 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:37.409
of 25%.
