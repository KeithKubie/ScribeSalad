00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.510
When I was younger, I was much shier and I
was really fortunate to have these teachers

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.000
in my life who saw something in me and brought
it forward.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.910
They saw that there was a light there, but
it was hidden by a lot of obstacles.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.009
I think it was probably as early as seven
or eight that I was really committed to being

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.009
a comedian.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.599
I had very vivid dreams about performing standup
comedy . . . and I really couldn’t hear

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.210
what I was talking about, but I could see
myself as an adult, getting huge responses,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.710
getting a lot of laughter and applause.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:48.899
And there was just a real sense of this was
my destiny and I know that I am this.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.750
So I started out my career at 14.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.149
I started doing comedy at school.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.429
I was attending a high school for performing
arts, and, for me, my main obstacle was probably

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:02.429
shyness.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.720
And I had an English teacher who would pass
a notebook between us -- and it was very silent

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.909
-- and I would write in it, and he would critique
it in the margins.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.840
And it was always very positive critiques
and really beautiful encouragement.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.500
He was somebody that I trusted very much.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.270
He was a gay man who was rather flamboyant
for my school.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.909
And even though it was San Francisco, it was
still, you know, this was in the ‘80’s,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.630
so it was still… it was tough for him, I
think.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.440
And one day he didn’t come to school, and
it was really alarming to me.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.869
And I held the notebook, and he had written
in the margins, “You’re such a good writer.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.640
Just never stop writing.”

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.460
And “never stop writing” was in such big
bold red letters.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.299
Finally, I went to this class and there was
all these boys in the class and they were

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.920
laughing.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.930
And I got closer to them and one of them said,
“That faggot got killed.”

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.000
And it turns out that my teacher had been
murdered by an act of homophobic violence.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.560
And it was so heartbreaking to me, yet, from
that day and from then on, I always remember

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.190
that he said, “never stop writing.”

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.500
And this is something that I live by and that
I will never stop because, you know, he brought

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.360
that out in me and then he was gone.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.270
And it reminded me of the immediacy of life
and the necessity of living your life and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.330
living it because it can be gone in a moment.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.000
And so I feel that that’s the best advice
I’ve ever gotten and the best mentor I’ve

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
ever had.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.700
And it’s a very simple, simple thing: whatever
you’re doing, just don’t stop.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.580
Just never stop.
