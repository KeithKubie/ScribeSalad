00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.809
"It's a little bit of a big day for me
because I happen to have three members

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.840
of the Class of 2018 that share the same last name."

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.600
Meet the Bowden triplets: Lauren, Stephanie, and Alison.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.860
The girls' dad, Dr. Scott Bowden runs the Emory Orthopaedics and Spine Center.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:33.020
Now his three oldest daughters are going into the family business. "The Bowden triplets are gonna be all

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.860
three going into orthopaedics and they all matched at excellent programs and they're ecstatic."

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.280
"It runs in our bones, apparently."  [All three laugh.]

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.220
"Yeah, it makes it even more special that all three of us were able to match at the same time and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.800
kind of go through this whole process together."
The girls have done a lot together over the years.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.340
Combined, they weighed less than 10
pounds when they were born, but the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.620
struggles they faced as infants were soon overshadowed by their later successes.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.080
As teens they were all-star athletes and graduated with the highest GPAs in their high school

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.740
The three went on to Pomona College 
in Claremont, California,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.320
and are now members of the 2018 Emory University School of Medicine graduating class.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.580
"Today, at least for the three of us, it's huge.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.080
It's basically a culmination of everything we've been working for for the last 3 1/2 - 4 years"

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.060
Since retiring as an internal medicine physician, the girls' proud mom, Dr. Mary Caulfield Bowden,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.000
has kept busy with the couple's five children.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.860
She says the triplets are anxious to blaze their own trails, even though it means

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.400
they will have to live in separate cities for the first time in their lives.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.220
"They're ready. You know, they kind of tried to go their separate ways in college,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.640
but they all kind of like the same program, you know at Pomona,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.940
and then same thing here at Emory. They just really all kind of gravitated to this school.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.320
And then they kind of all agreed that this was a time to kind of be their own person

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.580
and spread their own wings. It'll be good for them."

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.220
"It's been amazing. And so we're finally parting ways.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.580
Bittersweet, but I think we're all ready for it."
"It's been a lot of fun. I mean it's kind of like one step at a time.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.680
We've always been there to  help each other out. We've had good friends,  good, kind of teachers and role models and mentors.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.500
And we've always been prepared for the next step."

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.840
"It's exciting that we're all going to be going through similar experiences at different locations.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.900
So I think we'll all stay very close. I mean, we're a very tight-knit

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.480
family, if you haven't noticed."
"This is something they know has been coming,

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.760
and I think they're looking forward to it and absolutely ready for it.
