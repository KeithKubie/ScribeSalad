00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:03.004
Voiceover: Now that we
know what a trader means

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.070
when they say that a
market is in contango.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.163
Let's think about whether
it would be a bullish

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:12.082
or a bearish signal for
prices in that commodity.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:14.744
So, as I mentioned in the last video,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:17.753
it's actually normal for
things to have a contango

00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:20.502
because it takes into
account the opportunity cost

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:24.004
of the cash and the storage
cost for that commodity.

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.835
So, if something is kind of
in a, in a reasonable contango

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:30.671
you really can't make a call
on it one way or the other

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.498
whether it's bullish or bearish.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.208
It's really just something
that you would expect.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:39.338
What's not as usual is a severe contango.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:40.801
Severe contango.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.416
And that's when the current
spot price is a lot lower

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:48.447
than the future's price
or the forward price.

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.070
And in that situation as we've
mentioned in the last video

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.584
it's because that there's
perceived to be a big glut

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:55.607
in the market.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:57.666
There's a surplus on the spot market

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:02.200
or maybe there's a perceived
shortage at some point in the future.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.402
And in general this is
perceived although once again,

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.340
you can't just look at one simple
signal and be able to you know,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.414
bet your life savings on
the direction of the market.

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:12.579
It's a very quick way to lose your money

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.003
but the general view is,
is that a severe contango

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.270
is a bearish signal.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.751
Is a bearish signal for the
future price of that commodity

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:25.005
and the reason why it's
perceived to be bearish

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.833
is because if you have
this huge discrepancy

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:34.007
all someone has to do is
buy a bunch of oil today.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:35.746
We assume that these are oil prices.

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.672
So, buy a bunch of oil today for cheap.

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:42.466
Store it and once again, we're
assuming this is severe contango.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.542
So this, it won't cost a
$100 a barrel to store this,

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:50.608
this oil for a year and then
we agree to sell it for $150.

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:54.416
So, we agree, agree to sell it

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.143
and assuming the storage
cost is less than $100

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:59.940
we're going to guarantee some money.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.402
So, if you have a bunch
of people doing this,

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.082
buying on the spot market

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.603
it will increase demand
on the spot market,

00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:07.836
raise prices there

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.586
but for the future's market,

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:13.275
there's a bunch of people who are
now agreeing to sell in the future.

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:15.004
So it's going to lower,

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:19.207
it's going to increase the supply on the
selling side of the future's contract

00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:21.874
so to lower the future's prices.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:26.920
So, in general severe contango is
bearish for the future's price.
