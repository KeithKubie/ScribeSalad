00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.780
I just pulled the carbon rods out of a 6 volt
lantern battery, and used them to complete

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.380
a makeshift arc reactor furnace. Which apparently,
is powerful enough to completely liquify steel

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.299
in under 2 minutes. In this project let’s
harness the power of electrified plasma to

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:21.460
melt high temperature metals, and take backyard
experiments to a whole new level.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.539
Let’s start this project with the AC arc
welder we made in a previous project. It runs

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.500
on modified parts from a microwave oven, and
you can see how I built it in another project

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.960
video. Now if we power up the reactor and
try touching the two carbon rods together,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.400
they spark up a blinding arc of electrically,
that gets impressively hot, impressively fast.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.070
The heat of the arc pulls the plasma upward,
but if we tilt the electrodes down a bit,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
we can change the direction of the beam and
splash it down into the reactor core. Let’s

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.100
test the power of the arc furnace on this
little aluminum muffin we made in a previous

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.941
project. You can see it’s the perfect size,
for nestling down into the 2” chamber. With

00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.261
the lid in place, it’s time to insert the
carbon electrodes, and when they touch, you

00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:07.460
can see they start sparking, then stabilize
into a steady and continuous electrical arc.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.460
The electric light is white hot, and so bright
it can burn out your retinas. But if you wear

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.460
a protective welding mask with a face shield,
you’ll safely be able see what’s happening

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.470
inside. I’ll show you what it looks like
in just a minute. Now after only 45 seconds,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.750
you can see the rods are white hot and could
start a fire, so let’s push them through

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.890
the insulating holes in the lid, then carefully
remove it from the furnace. You can see the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.040
aluminum’s melted and glowing bright orange,
but surprisingly enough, the outside is still

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.550
cool enough that I can pick it up barehanded.
Now, just for fun I poured the aluminum into

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.720
a mold I quickly hacked out with a screwdriver,
and ended up with a crude casting of my “King

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.060
Of Random” logo. That’s kind of cool.
Now you might have noticed this furnace is

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.880
made from an insulating fire brick, and I
chose this material because refractory bricks

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140
like these, withstand extremely high temperatures.
They’re lightweight and extremely soft,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.531
so it only takes a few minutes to carve a
furnace, and the best part is, one $6 brick

00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.620
can make two of them. You’ll see how to
make these in another project video. Now to

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.960
see if this thing will handle higher temperature
metals, let’s clamp an old copper pipe to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.210
my bench vise, and use a hacksaw to cut it
into smaller pieces. The melting point of

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.090
copper is about 60% higher than aluminum,
so I’m really curious to see what happens

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.530
when we nuke this with plasma. Now I designed
the furnace with a little viewing port so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.170
we can have a look down inside to see what’s
happening when it’s in operation. Here you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.750
can see the arc is holding steady and pointed
downward, heating the chamber thousands of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.150
degrees within seconds. And if you look closely
here, you can see bits of copper liquifying,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.349
and collapsing, under the arc. Alright, it’s
been a little over a minute, so let’s see

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.200
what happened on the inside. Amazingly it’s
so hot it’s nearly too bright to look at.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.590
But as it starts to cool a bit, you can see
clearly, that the copper has melted completely.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.769
Now I designed the furnace so the viewing
port will double as a makeshift pour spout

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.790
as well. This keeps everything self contained,
and makes it easy to pour glowing pools of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.160
liquid copper. Now I’m using fire brick
to cast my ingots because it’s the only

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.200
material aI have that’ll handle temperatures
this high. Ok our copper ingots are poured,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.169
and at this point, they kind of look like
radioactive egg yolks. That’s really cool.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.730
A couple minutes later you can see they’ve
blackened over, but they’re still incredibly

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.969
hot. And watch what happens if we touch them
with a piece of paper. The copper turns bright

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.629
and shiny again wherever the paper touches
it, but quickly goes black again when the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.540
paper moves, and the air can get back to oxidize
it. I’m super excited this furnace will

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.439
take down copper. The question now, is, what
will it do to steel? I used a hacksaw to cut

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.689
1/4” off the end a steel pipe, and after
only 20 seconds in the furnace, you can see

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.439
the steel’s gone incandescent, and could
easily be hammer forged into a custom ring

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.669
of power. Let’s go one step further. I chopped
a steel grounding rod into 2” pieces and

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.180
threw them in the reactor, then fired it up
over 3,000ºF (1,648ºC), which in this case

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.529
is hot enough to make a shower of sparks fly
out of the view port. This is why it’s important

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:40.109
to have fire and safety equipment nearby,
and backup plans, in case something goes wrong.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.760
Now check this out. The power of the plasma
is so incredible, that it just reduced this

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.459
grounding rod into a flowing fountain of liquid
steel, that’s so bright it looks like sparking

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.099
liquid light. How crazy is that?! Now to finish
up, let’s see what would happen, if we threw

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.730
in these 3 small rocks I found in the back
yard. I torched the rocks for 3 minutes, and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.269
the electrodes got so hot I could barely hold
onto them, but it’s worth it for what you’re

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.919
about to see. That’s right, you can’t
see anything, because it’s so hot right

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.579
now it’s like looking directly into the
sun. If we give it a couple of minutes to

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.230
cool, then look down at the bottom, you suddenly
realize, you’re looking at liquified rock.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.359
I’m not exactly sure, but I think we just
cooked up a batch of lava. Well now you know

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.139
how to use an improvised arc welder and a
6 volt lantern battery, to power an experimental

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.340
arc furnace. With electric fire so hot, it
will melt any metal you can get your hands

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.210
on, or forge one ring to rule them all. By
the way, I tried melting a whole load of copper

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.639
tubing, then casting it in a mold made from
plaster. Which apparently releases very flammable

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.370
gasses because it spewed molten metal all
around the workshop. Even so, I ended up with

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.659
an awesome looking copper ingot, to add to
my metal casting collection. Well that’s

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.210
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you’ll like some of my others. Check them
