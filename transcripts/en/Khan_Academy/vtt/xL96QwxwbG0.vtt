00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.280
- [Instructor] We are asked,
who is a secondary consumer

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.970
in this diagram?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.973
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.650
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.930
So let's just make sure we
understand this diagram.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.230
When we have an arrow
from grasses to mouse,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.890
it means that the grasses
go into the mouse's mouth.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.190
It means that the mouse eats the grasses.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.400
Similarly, the grasshopper
eats the grasses.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.780
And then we have these
arrows from the mouse,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.140
to the coyote, the hawk,
the snake, the vulture.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
That means that all of these
characters may eat the mouse.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.120
Likewise, a hawk eats a grasshopper.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.990
So now that we understand this diagram,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.990
let's label where these various
folks fit in the food chain.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080
So the grasses right over here,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.870
they are a primary producer.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.880
They are using photosynthesis
in order to take

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.750
light energy from the sun in
conjunction with carbon dioxide

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750
in the air and water, in order
to store energy in its bonds.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.670
Now the grasshopper and
the mouse eat that grass

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.490
for that energy.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.630
And so, the grasshopper and the mouse,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.950
since they directly eat
that primary producer,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.130
they would be primary...

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.400
Primary consumers.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.120
Consumers.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.410
And I think you see where this is going.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.720
The folks who then eat
the primary consumers,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.190
so this would be the hawk,
the coyote, the vulture,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.170
and the snake, these would
all be secondary consumers.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.890
Secondary...

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.160
Secondary consumers.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.993
And we're done.

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:42.910
Who is a secondary
consumer in this diagram?

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.840
We could say the coyote's
a secondary consumer.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440
The hawk is also a secondary consumer.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.350
The vulture is a secondary consumer.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.500
And so is the snake.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.410
And as you can see, that's
okay, even in a situation

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.520
where some secondary consumers eat

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.227
other secondary consumers.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.640
The coyote might eat a hawk,
or a vulture might eat a snake,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.160
and a coyote might eat a
vulture, which eats a snake,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.250
which might eat a mouse,
which eats the grass.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.813
But any of these could be
considered secondary consumers.
