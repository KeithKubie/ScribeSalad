00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.610
Taylor Branch: Alright.
John Bishop: We are rolling.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:34.120
Taylor Branch: It is Monday, May 13, 2013.
We are in the home of William F. Russell,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
here before me�
William F. Russell: Esquire.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120
TB: Esquire. Doing an interview for the National
Museum of African American History and Culture.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.510
My name is Taylor Branch. Bill Russell. The
videographer is John Bishop, assisted by Noah

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:57.540
Bishop. And from the museum we have Elaine
Nichols and we have Mr. Russell�s longtime

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.610
assistant and friend Anita Dias. And we are
here to record an interview for posterity

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.050
and this museum about Mr. Russell�s life
and views and this is the most formal part

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.580
of this interview and we hope to just sort
of have a good time talking about the career

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.180
of a legendary figure in American sports and
American life.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.890
WR: Did you say posterior?
TB: Post�[laughing]. Alright, so we�re

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.860
off to a roaring start. Well let me ask you
the first question. Where do you remember

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.410
getting the extraordinary laugh which is one
of the first things that people ask me about

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.401
when they say, when they find out that I know
you, is, �Where did his laugh come from?�

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:57.830
WR: My mother. She told me never to hold back
on anything. If I have to sneeze, sneeze.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.370
If you have to laugh, laugh. Don�t hold
it back. She said it�s good for your health.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.380
TB: Well, that�s good. You followed that
advice. When we were working years ago�Bill

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.140
and I have a history of doing a book together
about his life�we talked an awful lot about

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.109
your mother. She died long before then; I
never met her. But I did know your father,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.939
Mr. Charlie. And it seemed to me in discussing
and getting to know you that an awful lot

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:34.260
of your character comes from those family
people. I think the most memorable line you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.359
ever spoke to me was that you thought your
character was formed by the fact that you

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.419
never had a doubt that both of your parents
loved you. Is that correct?

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:52.659
WR: That�s the first thing that I can remember
as a person. You know, you are a baby and

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:00.530
then the world opens up to you. Well, I always
had the confidence that my mother and father

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:12.160
loved me. And what they taught me was that
if they loved me I must be OK. So if other

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.389
people encounter me, and they have a problem
with me, my father said, then that�s their

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:36.359
little red wagon. And so I never worked to
be liked because that would be hypocritical

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:43.120
to them, if I were to do things to make somebody
like me. Most important.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:55.500
TB: A little background: you grew up in Louisiana,
born in 1934 in Monroe, Louisiana, the second

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.480
son of Katie and Mr. Charlie Russell. The
other figure we talked about a lot was your

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.439
grandfather, well, both your grandfathers
but primarily Grandfather Russell whom you

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:19.599
called The Old Man.
WR: Yes. He was extraordinary. One time in

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:29.729
Louisiana the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
had this black guy out in the woods, and beat

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:38.949
him. You could hear him screaming and crying
for mercy at least a mile away. So my grandfather

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:50.669
heard that, went and got his shotgun and loaded
it up with birdseed and shot into the crowd

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.009
about half a dozen times. And it dispersed
the crowd. And he never went to see if the

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:05.030
guy � he just left. And he used to tell
me old Doc Something or other was picking

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:14.909
out birdseed for a week. [Laughs] And [5:00]
when my father was born my grandfather realized

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:25.620
that in that part of Louisiana there was no
school for the black children So he decided,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.830
he talked to some other guys, and they got
together their money and they went to the

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.449
lumber yard and bought some lumber. And they
bargained and negotiated and paid for the

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.909
lumber, and when they got the wagons and the
mules to take the lumber to the site, they

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:50.129
were going to build a schoolhouse.
So when they got back to the lumber yard to

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.150
pick up the lumber, the guy said, �So what
you boys going do with all this lumber?�

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.500
Well, one of them in the crowd says, �Well,
we gonna build a schoolhouse for the kids.�

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.219
He said, �Well they don�t need to know
how to read to pick cotton. In fact, I�m

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.280
not going to let you do a thing like that.
I�m not going to sell you the lumber.�

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.349
So my grandfather says, �OK, let me get
my money back.� He said, �No, I�m not

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:27.780
going to do that either. There is no agreement
a white man has to respect with you black

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:40.439
boys.� So my grandfather said, �Let me
get this straight. You�re not going to give

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:49.300
us the lumber and you�re not going to give
us our money back. Well, the third opinion-

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.009
option is I�ll have to kill you.� He went
to get his shotgun.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:01.479
So the guy in the lumber yard says, �Well,
you know, you guys can have that lumber.�

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:10.889
[Laughs] And so they built the schoolhouse
and they got together fifty-three dollars

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:21.020
to hire a teacher for a year to teach at this
school they�d just built. And that�s the

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:36.310
kind of stuff where he said, �Bill, be sure
you don�t take nothing from nobody.� [7:22]

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:44.850
My grandfather never went to school one single
day. My father went to sixth grade then he

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:51.620
dropped out. I did four years at the University
of San Francisco and my youngest child, my

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.389
daughter, graduated from Harvard Law School.
So it�s the evolution of my family from

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:06.669
my grandfather to my kids, from no school
to Harvard Law School.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:14.370
TB: At the time you were born in 1934, your
mother already, although your father had practically

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.800
no schooling and your grandfather had none,
she admired, she valued education so much

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.090
she named you, your middle name is Felton,
after the president of, I think Southern University

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.639
at the time. Is that right?
WR: Yes. His name was Felton Clark. And so

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:37.880
she gave me Felton to set me on a path that
I respected by going to college. In fact,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.550
my mother died of kidney failure. And she
was in the hospital sick and she knew she

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:54.380
was dying. So she called my father and said,
�I want you to promise me something: that

00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:02.410
you will send my boys to college.� And my
father said, he promised. So when she died

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:10.940
we took her to Louisiana to be buried and
while I was there, she had five sisters and

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.260
they were debating who was going to take me,
who was going to take my brother. And he says,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.890
�That debate is no matter. I�m gone take
them back to California and raise them myself.�

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:27.950
They says, �No man can raise kids!� He
says, �I promised their mother I would try.�

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:37.530
So he sold his business and went to work in
a foundry for less a week than he�d been

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:43.520
making a day.
TB: And the reason he did that is he wanted

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.790
the time at home.
WR: Yes, he had to be home every night. He

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:58.210
said, �You can�t let kids raise themselves.�
And I understood that, and I appreciated that.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:10.320
I loved him. It was like his seventy-fifth
birthday and I said, �You know I love you.�

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.780
[10:00] And he says, �Well, I love you,
too.� That was the first time he�d ever

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:25.550
said that. But I knew it.
TB: I think you said at one time that when

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:31.890
he took you and your brother back to Oakland�you
went back on the train, right�from your

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:37.960
mother�s funeral. This is in 1946. You�re
twelve. It�s very, very unusual that a single

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:45.890
father, a widower would raise these two boys.
I think you said he talked to you the whole

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:52.730
way back about how you were going to live
without your mother.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:11:00.870
WR: Yes. He said, �You have a tremendous
loss, but you�ve got to live the way she

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:11.840
wanted you to live. And she wanted you to
be educated. And I don�t know much about

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.420
it, but I�ll help you whenever I can.�
TB: And you�re going to cook and clean,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.330
and �
WR: Well, we had a setup where the week I

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:32.620
cooked, my brother washed the dishes. And
then the next week, he�d cook and I�d

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.670
wash the dishes. There was no gourmet cooks
in that house. [Laughter]

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:45.690
TB: I think I remember even earlier at one
point you said that down in Louisiana Mr.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.940
Charlie come home from work sometimes and
the whole family would go out to play and

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.090
he would carry all of you?
WR: He was a big, strong guy, OK? 6�3�,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:06.950
220 pounds. And we had this huge field with
tall grass right in front of the house. And

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:13.200
we�d go play hide and seek in the tall grass.
To get to our starting points, he�d put

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:20.271
my brother on one arm, me on the other arm,
and my mother on his back, and run full speed

00:12:20.271 --> 00:12:25.210
across that field. And I thought he was such
a superman.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:37.120
TB: I remember.
WR: When I was playing for the Celtics, and

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.630
I was up in the country, in the Catskills
and Red Auerbach and I were talking and one

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:50.350
of the waiters came up and said, �You hear
what happened to Wilt (Chamberlain)?� I

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:58.330
said, �No. A car wreck or something?�
He used to drive fast. And he said, �No,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:05.950
he just signed a contract for $100,000 a year.�
That�s the first time any NBA player had

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:14.680
reached that plateau. In fact, I think Mickey
Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, and I think Willie Mays

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:24.340
were the only pro athletes making $100,000.
So I says to Red, �I know what I want.�

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.890
And he says, �What�s that?� I says,
�One hundred thousand, and one dollar.�

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:42.600
Because I had just won the MVP in this league.
So he said, �OK.� So I go back to my room,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:49.650
I call my father and I says, �Dad, you won�t
believe this. They�re gonna pay me $100,000

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:55.750
a year to do this. Tell you the reason I called
you is to tell you you don�t have to work

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:04.070
anymore. I make enough that I can take care
of you the rest of the way.� He says, �I

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:12.690
don�t want your damn money. I got my own
money.� I says, �But that job you�ve

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:21.680
got�s terrible.� He was working in a foundry.
He says, �Listen. I give these people thirty-five

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:31.280
of the best years of my life. Now, I�ma
give them a few of the bad ones.� [Laughter]

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.210
TB: That sounds like Mr. Charlie. I�d like
to back up just a little bit to when you left

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:43.950
Monroe, Louisiana because as I understand
it at any rate your family was part of what

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:52.760
we now understand as the Great Migration,
or at least the World War II migration. A

00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:00.100
friend of mine wrote a book about it: Isabella
Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.370
WR: I met that lady.
TB: She�s a wonderful writer. Anyway, he

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:09.790
left before your mother�s funeral, he left
Louisiana and migrated first to Detroit and

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:16.100
then to [15:00] Oakland. Can you tell us exactly
how that happened and why it happened?

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:26.270
WR: Well, he first was working at a bread
factory and asked for a raise. And the boss

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.140
said, �Well, I can�t give you a raise,
Charlie. If I give you a raise you�ll be

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.960
making as much as some of the white fellows
and I can�t pay one of you boys as much

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:44.110
as I pay the white guys.� And he used the
n-word to my father, just like it was nothing.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:53.060
So my father was at home that night, he was
talking out loud, he said, �You know, I�m

00:15:53.060 --> 00:16:02.630
going to have to leave here because if I stay
here who will raise my kids?� And they said,

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:10.750
�Well, you can raise them.� He said, �No,
if I stay here either I will kill one of them

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:16.950
or one of them will kill me. And either way
there will be nobody to raise my kids.�

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:30.560
So he started working on going to Detroit
and the Ford Motor Company was hiring anybody

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.680
that showed up.
TB: This is during World War II?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:46.530
WR: Yes. So he made arrangements to go to
Detroit. Well, Saturday at noontime was payday

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:56.250
at the factory. And he says to the boss, �This
is my last day.� �What do you mean?�

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:04.490
�I�m not coming back. This is it.� This
is after he got the check. [Laughs] The guy

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:10.090
says, �Charlie, if you�re worried about
that raise, I tell you what. You just log

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:14.880
in two more hours and that�ll be the work.
You don�t have to do the work. Just log

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:22.750
in.� And my father said, �No. This is
it.� See, the guy thought he was upset about

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:30.540
the raise. But he was upset about the boss
saying the n-word to him to his face.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.670
TB: And that wasn�t the only incident like
that he had had.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.670
WR: Right. That type of stuff happened all
the time.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:40.210
TB: I remember you told one about a gas station
once where the guy just pumped other people�s

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:47.200
gas and left him sitting there.
WR: Well my father thought he was being totally

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:55.650
disrespected, all the time. So when he told
the guy he was leaving, it was noontime. At

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.990
six o�clock the same day, he got a train
to Little

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:11.210
Rock, headed for Detroit. That was Saturday.
Monday morning, this guy shows up at the house

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:18.000
looking for him. He was from the draft board,
and he was come to tell my father that if

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.430
he didn�t come back to work he was going
to be drafted into the Army. But he was not

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:30.740
eligible because he had a wife and two kids.
And they wasn�t drafting those guys. But

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:41.410
they didn�t care about that. So I think
my father only went back when we went to my

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:51.390
mother�s funeral. [Pause in recording]
TB: Alright, Bill, let�s pick up again with

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.950
the move out of Louisiana. Your father decided
he couldn�t stay there. This is right at

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:02.600
the beginning of World War II and he moved
first to Detroit and then from there to Oakland

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.660
and he sent for the family from Oakland, is
that right? How does that occur?

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:16.290
WR: Right. Well, if you�ve ever been to
Detroit in the wintertime � [Laughs] He

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:22.030
said it was killing him. It was too cold.
So he moved to Oakland, California and went

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:32.090
to work in a shipyard. He worked in shipyards
until the war was over, and then they closed

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:39.720
the shipyards. They stopped everything. So
he had an idea. He bought himself a truck

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:49.520
and started going out to the valley, which
was forty-five or an hour away, and started

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.730
talking to the farmers about getting fruit
pickers. And he made quite a business out

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:02.010
of it. And so, from the time I was, after
we went back from my mother�s funeral until

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:15.970
I got to college, I [20:00] always bought
my school clothes picking fruit. I was so

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:21.040
proud of how much money I could make. It wasn�t
any money, but it was the money what I could

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:33.980
make. And so then I enrolled in the university.
You know what�s really funny about that?

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:41.860
When I was in Louisiana, my mother kept me
away from white people as much as she could.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:49.850
And she kept white people away from me because
she said, �You don�t know what they�ll

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:59.081
do.� And so when I first went to California
I went to school with some white kids, but

00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:05.320
by the time I got to high school it was an
all-black school, except for the faculty.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.190
And then I went to university and there were
nine black kids on the

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:20.340
campus, of the whole student body. And so
I�m back into that, and you might say cultural

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:33.420
shock. [Laughs]
But I had a pretty good career and I was self-taught,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:45.580
how to play. And the reason I say that is
I got cut from the junior varsity in eleventh

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:54.380
grade. So when I was absorbing it, the varsity
coach, who had been my homeroom teacher in

00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:01.470
junior high school, says to me, �I�m glad
you got cut.� �Why are you glad?� He

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:08.270
says, �Because today, you can come out for
the varsity.� I says, �I just got cut

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:16.070
from junior varsity.� He says, �I�m
not the junior varsity coach. I�m the varsity

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:23.520
coach.� So I�m on the varsity. And he
says, I want you to wait after practice, first

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.760
practice. I says, �What do you�?� He
says, �Let�s go,� and got in his car

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:43.790
and drove us to the boys� club. [Sneezes]
And then he took two dollars out of his pocket

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:48.180
and bought me a year�s membership and said,
�After practice here, I want you to go to

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:55.150
the boys� club and play basketball every
day.� And so that�s what I did, and that�s

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:04.010
where I learned to play. And so I had the
good fortune of not being influenced by a

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:17.559
coach. [Laughs] Could you hold up for a second?
Firstly, all the clich� things that a college

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:32.660
basketball player does, I didn�t do any
of them. So they figured I couldn�t play.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:45.430
So during my whole freshman year they considered
that a waste of a scholarship and so my sophomore

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:56.850
year they did not renew my scholarship but
the coach, I guess feeling guilty, he went

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:08.780
to the dean of the College of Business Administration
and found an unused scholarship. So I played

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:17.450
my sophomore year on an academic scholarship.
And so my career, my sophomore year there

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:34.920
were a couple things that made an entry. Four
of the top six players on the varsity my sophomore

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:41.950
year told the coach that they did not appreciate
him making them have to play with black guys.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:50.929
Now, he never told me that until I had retired
from the Celtics. I knew I didn�t get along

00:24:50.929 --> 00:25:02.760
with these guys and I knew how things happen,
and I just said that�s a part of life.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:15.950
And my first varsity game set the tone [25:00]
of my relationship with the coach. We were

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:28.870
playing Cal-Berkeley and their center was
a pre-season All-American. The game starts

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:37.130
and the first five shots he took, I blocked.
And nobody in the building had ever seen anything

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:46.390
like that. So they called timeout to discuss
it, what it was I was doing, because they

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.920
didn�t know what I was doing. So again in
our huddle, my coach says, �You can�t

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.150
play defense like that.� �What? I just
stuffed it five times in a row.� �That�s

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:06.870
not the way you play defense.� So he showed
me on the sidelines there how he wanted me

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:12.130
to play defense. So I go back out and I try
it, and the guy shoots layups three times

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:25.059
in a row. I said, �This does not make sense.�
So I went back to playing the way I knew how.

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:32.510
He was really insulted by that. He was trying
to help me and I was hard-headed and stubborn,

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:38.179
and didn�t know what I was doing, and he
was trying to help me figure out what I was

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:44.780
doing, and I rejected it. So he never liked
me as a player from then on.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.929
TB: Are we talking about the beginning of
your basketball career at the University of

00:26:49.929 --> 00:26:53.700
San Francisco, �52 to �56.
WR: Right.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.970
TB: Basketball was taught differently then.
I mean, some of the things that people now

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.980
wouldn�t be familiar with was that you weren�t
supposed to leave your feet.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:09.530
WR: Yeah, no good defensive player ever leaves
his feet. Well, basically what I was doing

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:20.040
in retrospect was bringing the vertical game
to a game that had been horizontal. And this

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:27.780
was, we get a new element. See in high jump,
which I had participated in in track and field,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:37.210
I can jump over my head. Well, in basketball
in the gym, we should do an exercise where

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:44.820
we take chalk and put it on your finger, and
run and jump as high, and put a chalk mark.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:53.059
Well, I can put a chalk mark thirteen feet
above the court. Which is the height of the

00:27:53.059 --> 00:28:02.320
top of the backboard. And that was going to
waste.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:15.780
So for three years this coach did not like
me. But I made up my mind that I was going

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:26.170
to see how good I could be. So I really worked
at developing the game. Part of my game was

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:41.880
logistics. So I learned how to cover great
distances in a short period of time. So I

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:55.280
developed how to play. Well, he never agreed
with that, although my junior, senior year

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:03.843
we won fifty-five straight games. Which is
not bad. It was a record at the time. And

00:29:03.843 --> 00:29:15.679
we also won back-to-back Final Fours. And
I set a record that still stands today, in

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:29.460
2013. I had twenty-seven rebounds in the championship
game, and that�s still a record. And I had

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:35.740
fifty rebounds in the two games, the semi-finals
and finals, which is still a record.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:47.010
But my coach, who was kind of a purist, �this
is the way the game is supposed to be played,�

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:53.549
and I wasn�t doing that.
TB: Some of this, you once said that even

00:29:53.549 --> 00:30:01.700
before you got to the University of San Francisco
that a lot of your skills in basketball came

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:10.320
from mental games, that you did, from drawing.
You had drawn out of the library, imagining

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:20.630
[30:00] things in art on a trip into the Northwest?
WR: At that time I had the ability to use

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:30.230
my imagination. And so I went on this trip
with these really first-class basketball players,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:39.200
and I watched them do everything. And I watched
the total person: footwork, head fakes, whatever.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:49.480
Dribbling, the whole thing. And the next day
at like a shoot-around I would try to do that.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:59.230
And so as I told one of the guys in Oakland.
He said, �What about San Francisco?� And

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:05.111
I said, �Well, the best way to explain it
is, I was already where I was going to be

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:16.160
when I got there.� You know.
Have I told you about when we first moved

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.760
to the projects? And my mother was getting
the apartment together, and I was sitting

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.809
on the steps staying out of the way. And these
five guys ran by, and one of them slapped

00:31:28.809 --> 00:31:34.169
me as they went by. Well, I was nine years
old, and I did what

00:31:34.169 --> 00:31:43.720
nine year-olds are supposed to do: I went
and told my mother. And she said, �What!?�

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.429
She grabbed the keys to the house and she
grabbed me, and we went all through the projects

00:31:47.429 --> 00:31:53.740
looking for those five guys. And she said,
�Are these the guys?� And I said, �Yes,

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.940
ma�am.� I didn't know what she was going
to do. I thought she was going to take care

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:02.640
of it. But the way she took care of it was,
�OK, you�re going to fight every one of

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:12.880
them, one at a time.�
�Thanks, mom.� [Laughs] So I go into five

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:20.890
fights and I lose three and win two. And so
we�re going back to our place and I�m

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:28.710
crying and she says, �Don�t cry. You did
what you supposed to do. It doesn�t matter

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:35.549
that you won or lost. It matters that you
stood up for yourself. And that�s what you

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:47.500
must always do: stand up for yourself.�
And so that day changed my whole attitude.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:33:00.150
She says, �I don�t want you to ever, ever
pick a fight. But always finish the fight

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:10.950
that you�re in.� And so that�s the kind
of stuff I got from my mother. My father,

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:19.700
the roles were almost reversed. She taught
me to be a tough fighter, and he told me to

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.460
be philosophical.
TB: Well, he was philosophical.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:30.360
WR: Yes, he was. You know Greg Taylor? I�ll
tell you how my father was. He would never

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.250
take anything from you. I was making a lot
of money. He would never take anything. He

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:42.890
just, his attitude was: �I got my own money;
I don�t need yours.� So for his birthday

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:51.220
one year, I went to a local automobile dealer
and bought a car. And told the salesman, �I

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.160
want you to take this car and deliver it to
this address. And don�t say anything. Man

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:06.480
comes to the door, hand him the keys, say,
�That�s your car,� and leave. No explanation.�

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.609
So I called him up, I said, �Did you get
your car?� He said, �Yes. I just can�t

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:17.482
believe anybody would do something that nice
for me.� I said, well, uh, okay. So a week

00:34:17.482 --> 00:34:30.970
later he calls me up, I say, �How�re you
doing?� He says, �I ought to kick your

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.669
ass.�
�What? What�d I do?�

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:43.149
�I just got my first speeding ticket.�
[Laughs]

00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:51.280
TB: At San Francisco, I think you once said
1956 was a pretty amazing year in sports.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.849
That�s your senior year and you were not
only in the NCAA Final Four for the second

00:34:55.849 --> 00:35:01.970
year in a row winning it but you also went
to the Olympics and then straight into the

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.130
NBA.
WR: Right. Well, we won the Final Four.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:13.329
TB: Who did you beat? Do you remember?
WR: We beat Iowa. [35:00] Nice bunch of men,

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:23.510
too. When you play against guys, and those
guys at Iowa were a first-class bunch of guys.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:33.749
In fact for years I kept up with them, long
after we played against each other. In fact

00:35:33.749 --> 00:35:42.130
my counterpart Bill Logan, who was the center,
was the head of Iowa Bankers� Association.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:52.530
A few years later I went to speak at one of
their conventions. But anyway, I was on the

00:35:52.530 --> 00:36:07.599
Olympic team and in the gold medal game, we
beat the Soviet Union by thirty-five points.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:19.720
We were kind of mean guys. In the tournament,
we played a team from Thailand, OK? Their

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:31.400
center was 5�10�. And so you would say,
�Well, these guys are no competition, let�s

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:39.770
just walk through it. Let�s find out how
bad we can beat these guys. We were going

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:52.880
to try to beat them by one hundred points.
I only think we got maybe to eighty-five.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.109
[Laughs] But I had a lot of fun.
So, after the Olympics, I went home, got married,

00:36:59.109 --> 00:37:12.960
and then went to Boston. I had not talked
to the Celtics before that. I was really an

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:22.630
amateur, and I got there and we had an idea
what it was going to be. It took about half

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:31.800
an hour to work it out. And so in just thirteen
months, the Final Four, the Olympic gold,

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:38.609
and my rookie year we won the NBA. So we were
the college championship, the world amateur

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:45.530
championship, and the professional championship
in thirteen months. And that�s a pretty

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:50.569
good run.
TB: Is it true that when you went to Boston

00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:57.109
that Walter Brown, the owner of the Celtics
and Red Auerbach and Bill Sharman, they met

00:37:57.109 --> 00:38:00.739
you at the airport?
WR: I think Red was on the road. But Bill

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:07.979
Sharman � no, it was all three of them,
you�re right: Red, Walter Brown, Bill Sharman.

00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:18.039
Now, Walter Brown was one of the most marvelous
people I�ve ever encountered.

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:24.269
TB: The owner of the Celtics.
WR: Yes. See, there were things that the Celtics

00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:38.700
did that I don�t think are common knowledge.
The first black player drafted in the NBA

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:44.599
was a guy named Chuck Cooper from New Canaan.
Celtics drafted him, and at the draft one

00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:46.556
of the other owners said to Walter Brown,
�You know he�s colored.� And Walter

00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:54.450
Brown said, �I don�t care if he�s polka
dot. That�s who we�re drafting.�

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:08.529
Ok. Fast forward. The Celtics were the first
NBA team to start five black guys. It was

00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:16.190
an accident. And I�ll show you how the Celtics
were. We had been doing it for over a week

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:25.619
and didn�t know it until we read about it
in the paper. Tommy Heinsohn was one of the

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:34.349
forwards and he got injured and so his substitute
went in and filled in until Heinsohn got back

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:42.810
and so we had five black guys start. And like
I said, we didn�t know about it until we

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:49.270
read about it in the paper. Of course these
was the five, these were the guys in our rotation,

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:57.869
you know? So now you�ve got the first black
guy signed, the first five black guys started.

00:39:57.869 --> 00:40:05.690
We had a guy named Sam Jones from North Carolina
College, one of the quote traditional Negro

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:13.819
colleges. Well, we drafted Sam in the first
round. [40:00] That was the first time in

00:40:13.819 --> 00:40:23.250
any sport when a guy from one of the Negro
colleges was drafted in the first round. You

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:27.480
see, the difference is, if you draft in the
first round, you�re on the team. You have

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.089
to play your way off. If you�re drafted
in the second round, you�ve

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:46.259
got to make the team. And so your compensation
is different. So Sam was our first pick. He

00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:57.849
turned out to be a great, great pick. And
then the Celtics were the first team to hire

00:40:57.849 --> 00:41:00.750
a black coach.
TB: You.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:10.940
WR: Yeah. And the way that happened was Auerbach
says to me, �I�m retiring, but I�ll

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:21.230
have to pick the next coach. I will not hire
anybody that you do not approve of one hundred

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:28.799
percent. So,� he says, �what we�re going
to do is you make a list and I�ll make a

00:41:28.799 --> 00:41:35.829
list. You�ll have five guys that�ll be
ok with you and I�ll have five guys who�ll

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:43.960
be ok with me. And whoever is on both lists,
that�s who will get the job.� Well, there

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:49.160
was nobody on both lists. And so Red says,
�Well, I�m going to hire this one guy.�

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.910
I said, �Red, if you hire him, I will retire
with you.� He said, �What�s the matter?

00:41:54.910 --> 00:42:02.710
Don�t you think he�ll make a good coach?�
I said, �He�d make a [41:55], I don't

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:11.740
even want to be in the same room with him.
So he said, �Well, what am I going to do.�

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:17.660
Well, going back he had offered me the job
first. And I said, �Red, I watched the stuff

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:24.549
you went through. No. Way.� And so he said,
�Well, what am I going to do?� And I said,

00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:28.510
�Ok, I�ll take it.� I said, �Here�s
the deal, though, Red. I�ll take the job

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:38.460
if it doesn't work you will know after a half,
by the All-Star Game. If we agree it�s not

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:48.099
working, you can hire anybody you want and
I guarantee to give them one hundred percent

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:55.299
cooperation. But we never got to that.
TB: So that was the deal. This was 1966, right.

00:42:55.299 --> 00:43:01.280
You�re the first black, not only a coach
but a player-coach. Had there been other player-coaches

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.579
in the NBA?
WR: I don�t know.

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:11.190
TB: And no assistant coaches. People today
must be shocked. I don�t know how many assistant

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:14.089
coaches there are.
WR: Well, Red says, �Do you want an assistant?�

00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:22.029
I said no. He said, �Why not?� I said,
�Ok, Red. Give me one of your assistants.�

00:43:22.029 --> 00:43:30.229
Well, Red had never had an assistant, ok?
So I asked

00:43:30.229 --> 00:43:40.930
him, �Why didn�t you have an assistant?�
He said, �That�s another guy you have

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:49.650
to coach.� [Laughs] And the atmosphere in
Boston would have been detrimental to the

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:58.109
situation, I thought, if I had an assistant
coach, because half a season into it, they�d

00:43:58.109 --> 00:44:04.660
say, �Well, they�ve got that other coach
and Russell�s just a figurehead,� no matter

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:19.779
what. Well, if I was going to be the coach,
I was going to be the coach, ok? And so that�s

00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:27.240
[44:07].
And it was very interesting that Red�s last

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:39.890
year as a coach he got thrown out of twenty-two
games, including the All Star Game. And so

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:48.569
as the captain I had to take the rest of the
game, so I went in with some experience about

00:44:48.569 --> 00:44:57.549
how to do it. And as a captain, we used to
play gin rummy at night after games because

00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:04.660
neither one of us could sleep after games,
and we�d talk about coaching philosophy

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:16.160
and what he wanted to do was set up a [45:00]
system, make sure that everybody knows it,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:25.539
then get the hell out the way. And that was
the way he coached. And that�s the way he

00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:34.519
got a team together. Because I trusted him
completely, and he�d used to do some things

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:42.460
I�d asked him about. For example, I played
for Boston for thirteen seasons. And during

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:50.970
those thirteen seasons we only made one trade.
We picked some guys up after they retired,

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:58.660
and we�d give them another year, but he
never said to anybody, �The way you played

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:05.220
there, you got to play different here. I got
you here because of the way you played there,

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:13.490
so I don�t want you to change. That�s
the way I want you to change. And so guys

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:20.890
did not have to, quote, play for the Celtics.
They did not have to learn a new way to play.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:25.069
He got you there because of where you were
before you got here. And he had a place for

00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:30.789
you in that system.
TB: Why did he get thrown out of so many games?

00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:37.450
Why did Red Auerbach get thrown out of so
many games? Did it serve a purpose or was

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:45.140
it just his personality?
WR: A combination. He was never a coach on

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:50.839
the sidelines who said, �What the heck.�
He says, �I can�t get my team to fight

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:57.009
for me if I won�t fight for them.� In
fact my first game, the

00:46:57.009 --> 00:47:05.509
referee called goaltending, which was not
goaltending. Red went nuts. He cussed and

00:47:05.509 --> 00:47:18.009
yelled and screamed and stomped until the
referee called a technical on him. And, but,

00:47:18.009 --> 00:47:24.319
they were careful after that when they called
goaltending. That was his purpose. And after

00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:32.609
the game I said, �Red, you�re the first
coach since high school that looked out for

00:47:32.609 --> 00:47:41.359
me.� He says, �I can�t expect my players
to fight for me if I won�t fight for them.

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:43.750
That�s the way I coach. It wasn�t you.�
Thanks, Red! [Laughs]

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:53.180
TB: Can you 
talk a little bit, you played on storied Celtics

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:59.200
teams, you won eleven championships in thirteen
years. Just a little bit of personality sketches

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.099
of the various players on the team, like Sam
Jones and what they were like?

00:48:04.099 --> 00:48:13.180
WR: Well, I�ll tell you. First of all, more
important to me than winning eleven championships:

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:23.989
we won eight in a row. That was difficult.
Of course you�ve got the do the same things

00:48:23.989 --> 00:48:36.999
without repeating yourself, which takes some
planning. I played with some guys that � we

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:50.390
had a family. I liked all the guys except
for two, and they will never know who they

00:48:50.390 --> 00:49:07.190
were. At least two, I was ambivalent about,
you know? Bill Sharman: the most thoughtful

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:23.749
player I have ever played with. He did everything
by the numbers and would fight at the drop

00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:32.380
of a hat and [49:14]. I think Sharman led
the league in fights.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:44.499
Cousy could not fight, ok? So one of the things
that Red did, it was very interesting. We

00:49:44.499 --> 00:49:49.849
would play Syracuse (Syracuse Nationals) and
those guards used to beat up Cousy. They�d

00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:58.380
beat him up. Ok, that�s a foul. �Well,
we�re gone still beat him up.� So Red

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:04.229
got so incensed about that that one night
he says, �Ok��we had a guy Jungle Jim

00:50:04.229 --> 00:50:15.319
Loscutoff, he�d been lifting [50:00] weights
and all that. He says, �Loscy, listen, I

00:50:15.319 --> 00:50:23.119
want you to watch, and the first guy hits
Cousy, I want you to turn around and knock

00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:28.450
the hell out of Dolph Schayes.� Schayes
was their best player and he played forward.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:33.150
So over here this guy hits Cousy, whack! And
Schayes is saying, �What

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:40.180
the hell is going on? [Laughs] Why�d you
hit me?� In fact the next time we played

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:47.819
there, all the fans had cardboard hatchets
that said, Loscutoff the Hatchet Man. But

00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:56.109
what they hadn�t noticed was every time
the guy hit Cousy, that was a cue for Loscutoff

00:50:56.109 --> 00:51:06.779
to hit Schayes. And so they figured out that
maybe we shouldn�t be beating up on Cousy.

00:51:06.779 --> 00:51:13.640
And so Red always had a purpose for everything
he did.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:23.420
TB: Cousy was the star of the Celtics when
you arrived. How did the two of you get along?

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:41.940
WR: Yes. Perfect. There was never any negative
exchange between the two of us. In fact, I

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:50.910
took the attitude, and I don�t know if it
was proper, but Cousy�s not a star on defense,

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:52.950
ok? [Laughs]
TB: Gentle!

00:51:52.950 --> 00:52:04.609
WR: But I never complained to him or to anybody.
I looked at the situation and I talked to

00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:16.630
Cousy about it. And I says, �Well, when
this guy comes up and you�re guarding him,

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:27.039
make him go left if he�s right-handed and
as soon as he gets past you, run to the center.

00:52:27.039 --> 00:52:35.209
And I want him to maybe throw a bounce pass
to the center because he can�t throw it

00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:44.239
over the top because I won�t let him. So
now Cousy [52:32] intercept a lot of passes

00:52:44.239 --> 00:52:55.880
because they tried to throw a bounce pass
and he was in the lane. And so I used to lead

00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:02.890
the league�way, way lead�in blocked shots.
Well a great majority of them were on Cousy�s

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.500
man.
And we turned that, and then he and I would

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:13.460
talk and one day he says to me, �You know,
on the rebounds and blocked shots, you come

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:20.099
on the ball, you�re looking for me. When
the shot�s taken, I�ll run over to this

00:53:20.099 --> 00:53:26.270
spot over here, halfway between the free throw
line and half court on the left side. And

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:34.869
so we�re on the road, I�m looking for
the green (road uniform). And out of the corner

00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:38.739
of my eye. I didn�t have to turn around
and look. I could catch the ball, catch the

00:53:38.739 --> 00:53:42.420
rebound
and just change direction. He would take two

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:53.079
dribbles and he�d have a layup. And so I
felt, see my whole thing was, I found out

00:53:53.079 --> 00:54:07.469
that in order to get any recognition I would
have to change my complexion. [Laughs] And

00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:17.739
so what I decided to do, and that was in college
also, was try to win every game so when my

00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:22.849
career is over and they�re saying, well
so-and-so is better, and he�s better, and

00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:28.869
he�s better � in fact, my second year
in the league, the players, in those days

00:54:28.869 --> 00:54:34.249
we had to vote for the MVP. You could not
vote for your own team but you could vote

00:54:34.249 --> 00:54:46.140
for anybody you wanted. Well, I was overwhelming
MVP. It wasn�t even close. The writers or

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:53.969
the media, whatever you call them, picked
me second team all-league. So I think I�m

00:54:53.969 --> 00:55:03.190
still the only guy ever to be MVP and be second
team all-league. And so I wasn�t going to

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:16.390
let that bother me.
Of course my [55:00] emphasis was on winning

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:24.259
in the team game.
TB: Cousy never referred to Red Auerbach as

00:55:24.259 --> 00:55:30.430
Red, is that right? He had eccentricities.
WR: Yeah, what did he call him?

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:34.749
TB: Arnold?
WR: Arnold! Yes. Well you know they had straight

00:55:34.749 --> 00:55:42.209
out of college a shaky relationship that evolved
into a good relationship. When Cousy was a

00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:53.000
senior at Holy Cross, Red had, when he came
to his pick he did not pick Cousy because

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:02.099
Red�s theory about winning was put a team
together that could play against the best

00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:10.390
team, and the rest of it would take care of
itself. Which is solid, I think. Well, the

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:22.770
dominant player was a guy named George Mikan,
incidentally one of the great guys who ever

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:30.160
played in the NBA. The other kid was a big
guy from Bowling Green, who could match Mikan

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:40.839
physically, and he had some skills, so Red
drafted him. And I asked Red what happened.

00:56:40.839 --> 00:56:47.980
He says, well�the press in Boston tried
to crucify Red because they said how stupid

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:56.930
he was not to draft Cousy when everybody knew
he was the best player in the world. So Red

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:01.079
said, �Well I swear I wanted, that�s the
way I think I should do it.� Well the guy

00:57:01.079 --> 00:57:05.190
says,
�We�re going to run you out of town. You

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:12.380
insulted all of us. And besides that, you�re
a Jew and we don�t like Jews, either.�

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:17.200
[Laughs]
So I asked Red, �How do you handle that?�

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:30.231
He says, �I�ll just outlive the bastard.�
TB: So he had some of Mr. Charlie�s, of

00:57:30.231 --> 00:57:35.299
your mother�s advice: that�s their little
red wagon.

00:57:35.299 --> 00:57:46.279
WR: Oh, yes. See, Red knew what he was doing.
I don�t know if most people know this. Red

00:57:46.279 --> 00:57:54.309
used to practice with us. He was a decent
shooter. We had a game, we�d play 21 and

00:57:54.309 --> 00:58:00.910
he�d be out there with us all the time.
He played college ball. In fact, my first

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:08.249
tournament in college was the All College
Tournament in Oklahoma City (now the Oklahoma

00:58:08.249 --> 00:58:16.849
City All-College Classic). Very interesting.
The coach of Wichita, who was � There were

00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:24.599
eight teams, and we were seeded eighth and
Wichita was seeded one. So what they do to

00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:30.420
you if you�re seeded eighth, they throw
you to the wolves and you have to play the

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.799
top-seed team the first game. It�s like
a warm-up for them. Ok. So, the coach says

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:47.719
he�s never heard of USF. He thought it was
San Francisco State. Well, we got ready for

00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:56.529
the tournament they found out it was USF.
So he sent his brother out to scout us.

00:58:56.529 --> 00:59:09.930
Well, he picked the last game we lost in college
to scout us. UCLA at Westwood. So he says,

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:13.039
�Guys, I don�t know a thing about these
guys��this is just before the game��I

00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:17.330
don�t know a thing about these guys but
my brother scouted them and he�s going to

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:22.099
give you a quick rundown.� So the brother
says, �Well, guys I don�t know how to

00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:31.529
tell you this but these guys cannot play a
lick. In fact, most of the good high school

00:59:31.529 --> 00:59:37.550
teams in the state of Kansas can beat these
guys. They�ve got two guards�we changed

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:46.119
it, one of the guards since the last game
that we lost. He said, �The two guards,

00:59:46.119 --> 00:59:51.880
they can�t put the ball in the ocean.�
But one of those guards was a guy named Casey

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:57.239
Jones, who was a fair player. He said, �They
got this tall colored kid

00:59:57.239 --> 01:00:05.769
who plays center. He does not do anything
and they never pass him the ball.� In their

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:15.950
system I had never [59:59]. [1:00:00] �All
he does is he stands around, and he jumps

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:22.049
a lot. Sometimes for no reason. He just stands
there jumping. [Laughs] Don�t worry about

01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:34.190
it. Let�s go out, and just run them out
of the gym, and then the subs can play the

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:40.509
rest of the game. I don�t think the coach
can play you starters over fifteen minutes.�

01:00:40.509 --> 01:00:54.619
So, the game starts. Three minutes into the
game they call time out. The score is twenty-five

01:00:54.619 --> 01:01:03.319
to three. First of all, Case and Perry, full
court press, they couldn�t get the ball

01:01:03.319 --> 01:01:08.430
over half court. And when they got it over
half court, they threw up a shot I�d block

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:17.299
it, they�d shoot layups. And so it was a
disaster for them. Halftime we were thirty

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:23.690
points ahead. And then the next game we played
Oklahoma City University and we only beat

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:32.369
them by nineteen. And so the championship
game we played George Washington. That�s

01:01:32.369 --> 01:01:43.020
where Red went to college. His coach was still
coaching. Start of the second half, we outscored

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:57.489
them twenty-two to one. After the game, Red�s
old college coach called Red up at midnight.

01:01:57.489 --> 01:02:07.440
�Hey, Red. I just saw something. I just
saw the player that�s the one you want to

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:16.079
get for the Celtics. Now, he�s a junior.
So you got two years to figure out how to

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:24.670
get him for your team. �And so that�s
when Red started work on getting me to Boston.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:34.519
TB: It�s amazing to me. You�re talking
about games nearly sixty years ago. You�d

01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:41.489
think any athlete at the level you played
remembers these, they�re still vivid to

01:02:41.489 --> 01:02:45.869
you.
WR: Well, I�ll tell you what. My late wife

01:02:45.869 --> 01:02:54.059
was always trying to do something for me.
And so she, I bought her�both of us got

01:02:54.059 --> 01:03:00.140
computers, same time. And she had her computer
and I had my computer. And so in learning

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:06.499
the computer, she started going to eBay and
seeing if there was anything on there. So

01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:10.479
one day she says, she says, �I got something
for you.� �What�s that?� �It�s

01:03:10.479 --> 01:03:23.309
the basketball game, University of San Francisco,
1955. And I think you were in college

01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:31.539
then, playing for the University of San Francisco.
So we have a video of it, a tape. So we sat

01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:38.189
down and turned it on, and I said, �Oh,
that�s Oregon State. That�s them.� She

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:45.021
said, �How�d you know?� I said, �I
just saw that introduction.� And I told

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:54.900
her, truthfully, every play before it happened
for the whole game. And she said, �Now,

01:03:54.900 --> 01:04:00.190
how did you remember that? That was forty
or fifty years ago.� I says, �There was

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:06.140
a time before I tried to consciously stop
doing it, I remembered every play of every

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:18.499
game I ever played.� I did that for scouting
purposes, so that if I play this guy again

01:04:18.499 --> 01:04:29.849
I know exactly what he done. Because my defense
was not reaction; it was action. You come

01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:37.119
up to me, Taylor, and you�re a player, and
you know the shot you want, I know. I�m

01:04:37.119 --> 01:04:44.289
going to make you take the shot that I want
to take. And then I play that.

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:50.599
TB: That�s a remarkable way your brain works,
though. The only thing I know that�s comparable

01:04:50.599 --> 01:04:55.979
to it is friends of mine who can remember
the lyrics of every music, you know, because

01:04:55.979 --> 01:05:02.039
that�s an emotional tie. Their head is stuffed
with lyrics from music from their childhood.

01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:07.059
That you can remember the plays from a long
career like that is�

01:05:07.059 --> 01:05:14.160
WR: I�ve tried constantly to forget most
of it. [1:05:00] I remember plays that I did

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:26.749
in high school. The game that I got the scholarship
from. We were playing Oakland High, at Oakland

01:05:26.749 --> 01:05:37.259
High. And I had one, three, and five leading
scorers in the conference on my team. So there

01:05:37.259 --> 01:05:49.650
was not much left over. So we had a close
game in the first half. I scored the last

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:59.380
three baskets of the first half, so we went
into the second half up by one point. We got

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:10.309
down to the last few minutes and I scored
the last four baskets for my team and we won

01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:18.199
by one point. You know, I remember every one
of those plays. And there were also plays

01:06:18.199 --> 01:06:31.400
getting offensive rebounds. But it was mostly
for scouting, for me, because I was never

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:48.059
going to be reactive. The first time you might
do a move, and �Hey, ok. Don�t do it again.�

01:06:48.059 --> 01:06:54.489
[Laughs]
TB: And McClymonds, just for historical purposes,

01:06:54.489 --> 01:07:00.979
McClymonds, your high school, you were there
the same time Frank Robinson, the baseball

01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:05.710
player was. Did you know him?
WR: Of course. Frank, in fact, Frank, today,

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:13.369
if I wrote to Frank he�d tell me, �You
know, I was a better basketball player than

01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:19.779
you at McClymonds.� What�s remarkable
about Frank�he�s a really good guy�and

01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:34.769
my coach in high school was a wonderful, wonderful
guy. He was the only white guy that would

01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:45.219
let the black kids play on these American
Legion teams. And so at one time he had thirteen

01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:52.839
guys in the major leagues. And Frank was one
of them. [1:07:39] And just as important,

01:07:52.839 --> 01:08:05.249
a guy named Curt Flood. These guys. And I�ll
tell you the truth. When we were in high school,

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:11.671
Frank was a great player. But all we ever
heard about was a guy named J.W. Porter. He

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:21.489
played for Oakland Tech. Big redheaded guy.
And according to the local press J.W. could

01:08:21.489 --> 01:08:30.609
walk on water without getting his ankles wet.
But Frank, you know, he might have been all-city

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:40.060
but J.W. was the man.
I�ll tell you a story about Frank, if you

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:48.089
don�t mind. We were in a golf tournament
down in San Diego. Seated to my right is Frank

01:08:48.089 --> 01:09:02.190
Robinson. To my left is Bob Gibson, the Hall
of Fame pitcher. So, I strike up a conversation.

01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:08.359
I said, �Frank, don�t you hold the record
for the most hits by a pitcher in the major

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:22.949
leagues?� He said, �Yeah.� I said, �Who
hit you the most?� [Laughs] So, Bob Gibson

01:09:22.949 --> 01:09:33.219
was one of the few college guys in the major
leagues when he was in the major leagues.

01:09:33.219 --> 01:09:38.679
He went to Creighton. So, Bob is embarrassed
by this. Sincerely embarrassed. So he says

01:09:38.679 --> 01:09:46.529
to me, �Bill let me tell you. I did not
want to say this all this time.� Said, �But

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:58.139
Frank put his left elbow over the plate so
he took away the inside pitch. You couldn�t

01:09:58.139 --> 01:10:07.179
throw inside because he was up over the plate.
If you threw an inside pitch, you hit him.�

01:10:07.179 --> 01:10:18.630
He says, �So one day I just decided, I�m
just not going to hit him anymore. I�m just

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:29.800
not going to do that. [1:10:00] So I threw
a pitch to the outside. They never did find

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.090
that baseball. [Laughs] [1:10:13]
TB: Was it at USF you also high jumped with

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:40.990
Johnny Mathis, the singer?
WR: No, Taylor, you�ve got it backwards.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:47.630
TB: He high jumped with you. [Laughter]
WR: No, I�m just kidding. He�s been a

01:10:47.630 --> 01:11:04.940
friend for at least sixty years. And he was
a good high jumper. I was in the top five

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:14.559
in the world entering my freshman year. And
I went to a track meet up at the University

01:11:14.559 --> 01:11:25.830
of Nevada-Reno. And I set the field record
in high jump. It lasted three weeks. Johnny

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:37.449
Mathis went up there and broke it. And I never
forgave him for that either! [Laughter] He

01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:45.320
was a good basketball player. So we had a
summer league, and he played in it. So we

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:52.829
had an awards dinner, ok? So all the guys
in the league were at this dinner and so for

01:11:52.829 --> 01:12:00.329
entertainment at the dinner, the emcee said,
�We are going to have one of our participants

01:12:00.329 --> 01:12:11.389
sing a song for us.� Oh, boy. You know,
we didn�t know any basketball player who

01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:24.080
could sing. So he gets up, a capella, and
sings �Stranger in Paradise.� After the

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:36.349
song, dead silence. Nobody in the place could
believe what we just heard. He was so good

01:12:36.349 --> 01:12:44.829
and nobody even suspected he could sing. None
of us were ever surprised when he went off

01:12:44.829 --> 01:12:52.719
to this great career.
TB: He has had a great career since. Let�s

01:12:52.719 --> 01:12:57.159
cover just a few of the other Celtics that
you played with, to do personality sketches

01:12:57.159 --> 01:13:01.380
of them. I know you�ve talked about Sam
Jones a little bit but I think I remember

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.369
you were saying that he could be exasperating
because on the one hand he could be a great

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:09.159
leader on the other hand, you would tell him
to call the plays, he�d say, �I don�t

01:13:09.159 --> 01:13:13.790
call the plays.�
WR: Well, we started out with Sam as a rookie.

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:30.719
In practice, Sam was as good a player as I�ve
ever seen, ok? The way the Celtics structure

01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:37.690
was, you didn�t get paid until the season
started. So all through training camp, all

01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:48.489
you got was meal money. So I brought Sam home
with me and let him stay with me until he

01:13:48.489 --> 01:13:53.110
started getting paid. So on the way home after
practice, I�d

01:13:53.110 --> 01:14:00.610
say, �Sam, you can really play.� He�d
say, �I know.� So I says, �Why don�t

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:04.320
you play like that all the time? You could
be first team all-league. You could make a

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.230
lot of money.� He said, �I don�t want
to do that.� I said, �Why not?� He said,

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:17.860
�I don�t want to have to play like that
every night.� He said, �That would wear

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:24.929
you out as much as playing. The responsibility
of playing like that. You know if you don�t

01:14:24.929 --> 01:14:31.790
play well, the team�s not doing well.�
I said, �Ok, Sam, I can live with that.�

01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:43.889
You know? And so Sam could have been, I thought,
one of the all-time greats. He was great,

01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:59.380
I thought, because he was on ten championship
teams. He was never an innocent bystander.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:08.130
And at least six times, and I can recall,
Sam took the shot that meant the season. And

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:19.250
he never hesitated to take the shot, and he
[1:15:00] never missed.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:28.469
A couple of other guys were, like Tom Heinsohn.
Everybody thought of him as a big, gruff,

01:15:28.469 --> 01:15:41.630
hard-nosed guy. Tommy was an artist and a
poet. �Heinsohn, a poet?� [Laughs] And

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:51.989
one of the all-time good guys, ok? And one
of my favorite teammates.

01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:59.450
TB: You said Red had to motivate him differently
than he had to motivate you. Is that right?

01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:05.030
WR: Well, Red would have a system. Part of
his strategy was, how many minutes can you

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:12.380
play in a row and be effective. So he�d
start Heinsohn. At the end of six minutes

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:23.510
he�d take him out. No matter how he was
playing. And so Heinsohn said that great public

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:36.719
statement: �Red, you hold me up to public
scorn.� [Laughs] And Red says, �Hell with

01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:43.790
it.� I says, �Why do you take him out
after six minutes?� �If he�s playing

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:50.440
good, he�s tired. If he�s not tired, he�s
not playing good. So I�ve got six minutes

01:16:50.440 --> 01:17:03.130
to get him out of there.� [Laughs] So Heinsohn
considered Red was using him as a whipping

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:14.030
boy. And there was some justification for
feeling that way. But Red actually really

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:20.790
cared for the players.
TB: What about Ramsey? Frank Ramsey.

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:32.962
WR: We got along from the first moment we
met. Because Frank and I, we were only interested,

01:17:32.962 --> 01:17:43.469
we were both interested in the same thing.
Women. And that�s the whole thing. Now Red

01:17:43.469 --> 01:17:54.510
used to, I call it, almost a psych job but
Frank was too smart to be psyched out. Frank,

01:17:54.510 --> 01:18:00.750
when he got there, he had been in the army,
and he got there he was playing with us on

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:15.309
weekend passes. So he was always coming off
the bench. And so next year, Frank is coming

01:18:15.309 --> 01:18:23.969
off the bench. And Red talks to him, he says,
�Now, you should be a starter and I will

01:18:23.969 --> 01:18:32.880
never refer to you as second team. I will
call you my sixth starter, and you will always

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:45.210
be my first substitute.� Well, that took
care of, all of us had egos, and all of us

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:56.340
wanted to be starters over whatever. So Frank
bought it, so Frank personified the sixth

01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:04.559
man. In fact they named an award after what
Frank started. And I�ll never forget one

01:19:04.559 --> 01:19:14.809
night I got one of my front teeth knocked
out. I had never had anything like that happen.

01:19:14.809 --> 01:19:26.889
I look and it�s one of my front teeth in
my hand and I don�t know what to do, so

01:19:26.889 --> 01:19:34.530
I says to Frank, �Look at that.� And Frank
took out his bridge, which was most of his

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:40.880
front teeth, and he says, �Here, Russ, look
at that.� [Laughs]

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:48.321
TB: He was from Kentucky, right?
WR: Yes, and you know what was really funny,

01:19:48.321 --> 01:19:59.500
it was his coach that said they shouldn't
even let these black guys play and the Jews

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:16.210
neither. Coming from that atmosphere, Frank
and I [1:20:00] never discussed it. We were

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:23.329
teammates with this idea we�d both win.
And both of us showed the other guy complete

01:20:23.329 --> 01:20:33.440
and total respect. And I�ll never forget
after one of our championships, Frank says,

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.810
�Hey Russ, after the season�s over, why
don�t you come down and spend a week with

01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:47.900
the guys in Kentucky?� I said, �Frank,
you�re a good guy. There�s no way in hell

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:52.480
I am going to spend no week in Kentucky.�
[Laughs]

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.670
TB: How about Havlicek? He took that sixth
man role from Ramsey.

01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:09.270
WR: Frank showed him how to do it. Havlicek
had played in college. He always hit the open

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:22.030
man. In pro ball, it�s set it up so the
best shooter gets the shot. And so, we�d

01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:28.239
give Havlicek the ball, and nobody would be
within ten feet and he�d look for someone

01:21:28.239 --> 01:21:36.369
to pass to. �Havlicek, shoot the ball.�
�Ok, ok.� So this goes on for a while.

01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:44.630
So one night he took us up. Shot thirty-eight
times. [Laughs] So that shows you the kind

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:53.860
of guys we were and what kind of team we had.
We get to the trainer to leave the bench early

01:21:53.860 --> 01:22:03.880
and go to the locker room, and fill a tub
with ice so when we came out of the game,

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:12.090
after the game, we had to, you know, ice down
Havlicek�s arm. [Laughs]

01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:25.710
TB: Because he had shot so many, ah�
WR: We all had something we did well. And

01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:35.460
we always tried to put our teammates in the
position to do what they did well. So that

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:47.380
every play consisted of five guys doing something.
And so that when you got an open shot, it

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:57.460
was because we all worked to get you the open
shot. That was part of our thing. And it�s

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:09.239
like we almost developed what we called the
Celtic Way, which is that the attitude was:

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:16.679
be kind to your teammates. Now, what does
that sound like in pro ball. Well, what do

01:23:16.679 --> 01:23:26.420
you mean, I be kind? Well, first of all, what
is kindness? Kindness is an act of strength.

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:41.410
I can do this, and I will do that. That�s
strength and kindness, ok? So like Satch (Tom

01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:51.590
Sanders) was guarding Bill Bradley one night.
He was struggling. I mean, Bradley was shooting

01:23:51.590 --> 01:24:04.079
him out of the gym. He was good at moving
without the ball. So I says to Satch, �There�s

01:24:04.079 --> 01:24:18.280
something you ought to know. On the Knickerbocker
uniforms, there�s a small number in the

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:30.010
front and a big number on the back. I know
you haven�t seen that small number.� [Laughs]

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:35.360
[1:24:17]
So the story happened. Bill Bradley told me

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:47.820
about it. The same day, Bradley�s having
a good night. So we line up for free throws,

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.969
me and [1:24:38] on that side, Satch and Bradley
on

01:24:51.969 --> 01:24:56.770
the other side. I was a captain. I called
time out. I walked across the lane. Now, I

01:24:56.770 --> 01:25:05.239
hope this language is ok for your tape.
TB: I think it will be alright.

01:25:05.239 --> 01:25:14.909
WR: So I walk over [1:25:00] to Satch and
Bradley, who told me this story later because

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:29.380
I � I point to Bradley, I says, �Can you
guard that motherfucker?� That shocked Bradley.

01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:37.260
He�d never been called that before. [Laughs]
That was the idea. Satch says, �Yeah,�

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:46.449
so I said, �Guard him, goddammit.� And
I went back across the lane. And Bill Bradley

01:25:46.449 --> 01:25:56.389
told the story later, he said he never hit
another shot. He said because I had told him

01:25:56.389 --> 01:26:03.940
off. That was the idea. We used to do all
kinds of weird things, to get�

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.559
TB: So your comment was aimed at Bradley,
not at Satch.

01:26:07.559 --> 01:26:15.739
WR: Oh, yeah. I was looking at Satch but it
was aimed at Bradley.

01:26:15.739 --> 01:26:21.800
TB: I�d like to shift a little bit to talking
about race themes. You�ve talked about them

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.890
a little bit about growing up, your mom didn�t
want you around white folks and that when

01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:32.760
you went to USF for the first time you were
in a sea of white folks, and Jesuits to boot.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:41.050
You were on a Jesuit campus at San Francisco.
But obviously you�ve dealt with race your

01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:49.849
whole life. A lot of the talk that, when we�ve
discussed it has been basically about perspective,

01:26:49.849 --> 01:26:57.639
about how people see things and what people
are not conscious of. If I�m not mistaken,

01:26:57.639 --> 01:27:03.219
you said that the first time you went to the
movies and you saw King Kong the movie, you

01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:06.270
came out of there with a different perspective
than anyone else in the theater.

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:18.030
WR: Yeah, I think so. I look at it as a big
old gorilla, ok? And he�s been taking these

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:27.380
sacrifices, obviously for years and years.
The first time they put a white woman out

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:38.050
there, he fell in love with her. [Laughs]
Now I just thought that was alright. [Laughs]

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:46.829
TB: But most people didn�t. Most people
saw that as the romance of the film. You said

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:53.660
that often he�d had sacrifices of African
women, that he�d take them and kill them

01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.489
and probably eat them, but the first time
he puts a white woman out there he falls in

01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:59.840
love with his food.
WR: Right! [Laughs]

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.060
TB: So it�s just how people look at things
and what they take for granted. Was it your

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:10.380
high school coach who said you can�t fight
on the court because if black kids fight,

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.380
it�s a riot and if white kids fight, it�s
a scuffle.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:20.340
WR: Right. This was the same guy, my high
school coach who says, �Let�s keep things

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:28.250
in perspective. No fighting. It�s not because
I�m afraid that you�re afraid. I don�t

01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:37.820
think that at all. But if we get into three
fights, we are a bunch of thugs. No matter

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:48.510
how well we play. �This is those thugs from
McClymonds.� So when guys, when they find

01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:54.949
out how good you are, there will be guys who
try to pick a fight because that�s the only

01:28:54.949 --> 01:29:03.980
way they think they can compete. So when they
try to pick a fight, you don�t fight. You

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:12.510
play harder. And you beat them in the game
of basketball.

01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:20.100
TB: You have to play harder, because in effect,
the race, you have to make up for that.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:27.510
WR: I know when I was a rookie with the Celtics,
nobody in the league had ever seen me play

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:38.369
because I played on the west coast. So this
guy I�m playing against told me this story

01:29:38.369 --> 01:29:48.670
years later. He was a center for the Fort
Wayne Pistons, this was before they were in

01:29:48.670 --> 01:29:54.400
Detroit. And we start the game and he�d
never seen me play. And the first five shots

01:29:54.400 --> 01:30:03.599
he took, I blocked. His coach had been a referee,
had a real scratchy voice, and you could hear

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:09.440
him all over the gym [imitates sound of voice].
And he says, �You got to be shameless to

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:15.699
let that rookie embarrass you like that. [1:30:00]
Look at him. You�re making me look bad.

01:30:15.699 --> 01:30:20.130
You�re embarrassing all of us.� Now this
guy�s listening to this for about five minutes,

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:22.880
and he says, �I got to get out of this.
Now what am

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:35.280
I going to do? Ok. I know that he will fight.
Ok. So I�m going to hit him, we�ll get

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.329
in a fight, we�ll both get thrown out of
the game for fighting.�

01:30:41.329 --> 01:30:54.510
Well, a couple things he did not know. I never
fight in the first quarter. We get to the

01:30:54.510 --> 01:31:02.150
last quarter, now we can talk about it. Now,
he just turns around and hits me in the chest�whack!�knocks

01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:12.580
the breath out of me. I just looked at him.
And I didn�t say a word, because I used

01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:23.550
to never talk. What he did not know, was between
high school and college, I had worked in a

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:36.909
shipyard. San Francisco Naval Shipyard. And
we had a lunchtime volleyball competition.

01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:51.829
And so I learned how to spike the ball. [1:31:34]
So, the next time he shot, I spiked it right

01:31:51.829 --> 01:32:05.590
into his head. That�s no foul; that�s
competition. The next three times he shot,

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:13.940
the third time he�d shot enough.
TB: Speaking of race and basketball, I want

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:20.659
to transition a little bit after the break
to talk about your time in Boston. The Celtics,

01:32:20.659 --> 01:32:26.969
as you said earlier, were the first team in
the NBA to draft a black player. Also in Boston,

01:32:26.969 --> 01:32:35.840
the Red Sox were the last baseball team to
take a black player. Not until twelve years

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:43.929
after Jackie Robinson did they get Pumpsie
Green. When you were in Boston you were a

01:32:43.929 --> 01:32:51.679
city, just as its two sports teams were the
first and last on that � How did you learn

01:32:51.679 --> 01:32:58.340
about race in Boston?
WR: Well, it didn�t take that long. Not

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:07.099
long after I got there they started having
problems with the bussing and all that kind

01:33:07.099 --> 01:33:19.760
of stuff and they were very negative about
it. A couple of sports writers told Heinsohn

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:35.820
that they would never vote for me for anything.
I�ll give you an example. 1969. We had won

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:48.750
our second championship in a row. They had
the parade on Friday, Friday afternoon. Friday

01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:53.610
morning, a reporter from the Boston Herald
walked into Red�s office and said, �Are

01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:59.440
you satisfied with the coaching you had this
year?� Red said, �What the hell are you

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:04.930
talking about? We just won the championship.�
He said, �Yeah, but if you had a better

01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:12.000
coach, couldn�t you have won more regular
season games?� All it was is they did not

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.869
want Bill Russell or any black guy coaching
their Celtics. [1:34:08]

01:34:20.869 --> 01:34:26.440
And Red says to me, calls me up after the
guy leaves, says, �You believe this?�

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.210
I said, �Red, it doesn�t make any difference.
I�m not going to do this stuff anymore anyway.�

01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:37.810
That�s how I announced I was retiring, and
the reason I never said anything about retiring

01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:43.639
before: They have a tradition with the Celtics,
the guys announced before the regular season,

01:34:43.639 --> 01:34:49.519
before the season starts, that this was going
to be their last year. Well, Sam Jones had

01:34:49.519 --> 01:34:57.760
announced that this was going to be his last
year. There is no way that I was going to

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:06.719
ever rain on Sam�s parade, and say, �Well,
I am going to retire, too.� No, no, that�s

01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:18.670
not�you couldn't do that. [1:35:00] Not
a player I have such high esteem as Sam Jones.

01:35:18.670 --> 01:35:29.769
So Red says to me, �Don�t tell anybody,
because I am going to try to change your mind.�

01:35:29.769 --> 01:35:42.659
Tell you how respectful Red was. He never,
ever, mentioned that again. Because when he

01:35:42.659 --> 01:35:47.960
decided to retire as a coach, I said, �Red,
why don�t you coach one more year, and I

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:55.280
can retire with you.� He said, �No, I�ve
had it. This is it.� And I never brought

01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:03.059
that up again. Of course I respected that
he was an intelligent, thoughtful man. And

01:36:03.059 --> 01:36:11.000
if he decided to do that, all I could do is
say, �It�s been great fun, Red.� That�s

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:19.170
all you could do. And that�s the same thing
that he said with me, you know? In fact, I�ll

01:36:19.170 --> 01:36:28.270
tell you how the Celtics worked, to me. I
called them my Celtics. That�s Walter Brown,

01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:35.400
and me, and Red Auerbach.
In the middle sixties, Walter Brown called

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:43.480
me up and says, �I need to talk to you.�
�Ok. Where do you want to do it?� He says,

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:50.429
�When can you get in here.� I said, �Well,
Walter, I don�t have a job. I can come there

01:36:50.429 --> 01:36:55.500
right now.� He says, �I�ll wait for
you.� So I go into Walter Brown�s office,

01:36:55.500 --> 01:37:00.800
and he�s sitting in there, with his desk
is filled with papers and stuff. He says,

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:08.210
�You see these papers?� I said, �Yeah.
Not very neat.� He says, �Those are the

01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:16.500
papers of the Boston Celtics. Those are the
books for the Boston Celtics. And the reason

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.369
I am showing them to
you is, I want you to go through them. We

01:37:21.369 --> 01:37:29.969
don�t pay you enough. You know it. I know
it. And anybody that�s interested knows

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:37.389
that we don�t pay you enough. But I�ve
always, I�ve already paid you more than

01:37:37.389 --> 01:37:50.099
I can afford, because we are losing money.
But I want you to know that

01:37:50.099 --> 01:37:59.539
we know that you are underpaid and we can�t
afford to pay you more now. But as soon as

01:37:59.539 --> 01:38:08.280
if we can make enough money so we can, I�ll
make it up to you.� And he says, �Of course,

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:16.020
you�ve never held us up. You could have
held us up, but you didn�t. And I want to

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:25.760
let you know that I appreciate it.� As a
consequence, when Walter died, my late contract

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:37.690
with the Celtics, Red gave me an eight-year
no-cut contract at thirty-five. That means

01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:47.670
I could play for the Celtics if I wanted to
until I was forty-three. But in order to collect

01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:56.130
I did not have to play. I could bring my doctor
in and say, �I want to play this year, but

01:38:56.130 --> 01:39:04.880
my doctor says he doesn�t think I can do
it.� Then they got to pay me for that year.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:14.920
Now, I only played one year of that contract
and then I left. And they said, �Well, why

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:21.679
didn�t you take the money?� I said, �I
could not take money that I did not earn.�

01:39:21.679 --> 01:39:22.840
I got that from my father.
TB: Same reason he didn�t want your money.

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.969
You wanted to earn it.
WR: Yeah. [Laughs]

01:39:25.969 --> 01:39:33.280
TB: Alright, let�s take a break. That alright?
[recording resumes]

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:44.269
TB: Let�s talk some about your philosophical
views and also public life outside of sports.

01:39:44.269 --> 01:39:50.820
We�re going to talk more about sports, too.
But from very early on it seemed to me that

01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:56.809
you started thinking about how sports fit
into other life. You used to say even that

01:39:56.809 --> 01:40:03.639
sports was a mixture of art and war and that
it was like politics, religion, and the arts.

01:40:03.639 --> 01:40:09.150
That sports could gather people. When did
you start thinking philosophically about the

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:14.659
place of sports in life?
WR: [1:40:00] Well, I think it � when my

01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:27.710
high school coach told us no fighting, you
understand me. You have to be aware. I think

01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:38.639
they key phrase to me has been: It is far
more important to understand than it is to

01:40:38.639 --> 01:40:58.840
be understood. And so, take things as they
come. It�s like you walk into this room,

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:10.179
and it is. Now, whether it�s good or bad
is your perception. Right or wrong is your

01:41:10.179 --> 01:41:20.309
perception. And after you make a judgment,
the next question is, what are you going to

01:41:20.309 --> 01:41:42.579
do about it? Ok, so. Now, if you lose control
you will end your life being a bitter, annoyed

01:41:42.579 --> 01:41:53.440
old man. But if you take control of your life
as much as possible, because you understand,

01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:18.039
then you then have a chance to be happy.
Now, when I was in college I found out that

01:42:18.039 --> 01:42:33.190
there were not any blacks that were in the
top of their field, no matter what sport.

01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:43.849
You take Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. If
Willie Mays had hit one hundred home runs

01:42:43.849 --> 01:42:52.309
in a season, Mickey Mantle still would have
been the best baseball player. Now, Willie

01:42:52.309 --> 01:42:56.000
can get annoyed by that or get can go out
and say, �Well, next year I have to hit

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:09.679
two hundred.� You know what I mean. So,
my junior year in college�I may have told

01:43:09.679 --> 01:43:20.730
you about it�we were 28-1. We won the Final
Four. I was outstanding player of the Final

01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:27.590
Four. I was First Team All-America, averaged
twenty points and twenty rebounds and they

01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:33.330
never counted blocked shots until four or
five years after retiring from the NBA. Ok?

01:43:33.330 --> 01:43:45.820
So. First Team All-American. We are going
to go to California for a sports banquet,

01:43:45.820 --> 01:44:01.230
and they pick another center as Player of
the Year. Now, I could have been injured.

01:44:01.230 --> 01:44:21.290
But what I did, for me internally, I dismissed
that award as something that I would like.

01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:34.000
And I really was able to do that. So I had
made up my mind that I was going to be the

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:52.320
best basketball player I could be. And this
team, I have no regard for the coach or the

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:56.329
rest of the players. All I thought about was
being the best in basketball I could be. Well,

01:44:56.329 --> 01:45:07.789
I was very good and that made my team win.
But I wasn�t going to let my self-esteem

01:45:07.789 --> 01:45:16.360
be tied up by what [1:45:00] others said I
was doing.

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:25.389
TB: You said that the Celtics had more fun
than any team around. Was that essential to

01:45:25.389 --> 01:45:31.850
winning or was that an accident?
WR: I think it was essential to winning. Because,

01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:46.519
it may sound overblown, but we actually looked
out for each other and if a guy was having

01:45:46.519 --> 01:45:52.639
a bad night we would counsel him. Always use
humor.

01:45:52.639 --> 01:45:55.650
TB: Toughening humor, right? You made fun
of each�

01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:58.849
WR: Yeah.
TB: You couldn�t be thin-skinned and be

01:45:58.849 --> 01:46:03.039
a Celtic, right?
WR: Right. Well, you know, I know if a guy�s

01:46:03.039 --> 01:46:10.305
having a bad time, and he�s hurting our
team, how can we help him out? Well, first

01:46:10.305 --> 01:46:22.409
of all you can help him out physically, and
let him know that mentally we were there for

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:28.369
him. If he needed help, we�ll give it to
him. And he should not be ashamed for ask

01:46:28.369 --> 01:46:42.340
for help. You see, in the macho world men
are usually reluctant to ask for help. Well,

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:55.000
one night we were playing the Philadelphia
Sixers in Boston Garden. And I was doing my

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.699
very best, and not that well, guarding Wilt
Chamberlain. [Laughs] I knew it, he knew it,

01:47:02.699 --> 01:47:11.090
and everybody in the building knew it. So,
I kept hearing this �whop� sound: whop,

01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:19.440
whop, whop. And what it was, K.C. [Jones]
was trying to help me out and every time he

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:27.670
went by Wilt, he hit him.
And so I looked back and K.C.�s going �whack!�

01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:33.750
He�s hitting Wilt. I said, �Time out.
Time. Out.� We go to the bench and Red says,

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.929
�What�s the matter?� I said, �Red,
excuse me. K.C., what are you doing?� He

01:47:36.929 --> 01:47:41.610
says, �What�s the matter? You afraid of
the big fella?� I said, �You�re goddam

01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:47.469
right I am!� I said, �You go on and hit
him, I got to wrestle with that big monster

01:47:47.469 --> 01:47:58.199
all night!� [Laughs] I said, �It�s hard
enough. But you�re going to get him riled

01:47:58.199 --> 01:48:06.280
up and
make him impossible.� And so there was K.C.,

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:17.880
taking a chance of getting into a fight, to
help me. Because he could see I needed help.

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:26.619
And it went all through the lineup that way.
TB: When you were coming up into pro sports

01:48:26.619 --> 01:48:32.559
did you have and role models or athletes that
you looked up to at all, like Jackie Robinson?

01:48:32.559 --> 01:48:37.429
WR: Well, Jackie of course. In basketball
a guy named George Mikan.

01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:44.650
TB: The center for the Minneapolis Lakers?
WR: Well, you know, when he started playing

01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:51.270
for DePaul, his folks thought he was going
to a seminary to be a priest. And so his father

01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:55.880
said to him one night, �George, there�s
a guy the same name as you playing for DePaul.�

01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:06.960
[Laughs] And they were all shocked that that
was their son that was playing for DePaul.

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:18.520
See, when I was a kind in Oakland, in elementary
and junior high school especially, Oakland

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:26.630
had a minor league baseball team, the Oakland
Acorns. They played in Emeryville. Well, we

01:49:26.630 --> 01:49:31.469
used to go out there�we couldn�t afford
to go in the park�and wait and see if anybody

01:49:31.469 --> 01:49:43.530
hit a home run and you could take that ball
and go and get in. But we found that the worst

01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:50.920
creatures to ever invade the earth were minor
league baseball players. They�d come out

01:49:50.920 --> 01:50:05.949
the games and they�d see us and they�d
call us the n-word, spit tobacco at us. They

01:50:05.949 --> 01:50:10.670
were that indecent. So my view of professional
athletes was not positive at all. [1:50:00]

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:17.670
So I went to an exhibition game. The Lakers
were playing. And this guy that used to, he

01:50:17.670 --> 01:50:23.219
asked if I wanted�he played high school
ball with Jim Pollard, who was a big star

01:50:23.219 --> 01:50:28.699
with the Lakers�he asked if I wanted to
go to the locker room. I said, �I don�t

01:50:28.699 --> 01:50:33.560
want to go there with those people.� And
so I said, �I�ll wait out here.� And

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:41.420
he goes in there. And so while I was waiting,
George Mikan comes out. He sees me and he

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:47.590
walks over, �How you doing, big fella?�
Well, that was a real joke. Mikan was 6�10�,

01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:52.019
280 and I was 6�7�, 100. [Laughs] And
he says,

01:50:52.019 --> 01:50:59.860
�How you doing, big fella?� He says, �You
play center?� I said, �Yeah.� He said,

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:09.190
�Well,� he showed me a couple of moves
that he used. He said, �Now, listen. When

01:51:09.190 --> 01:51:15.980
you get out of college you got to come play
for the Lakers.� Now, I couldn�t even

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:31.270
make my homeroom team. [Laughs] And college
was, I had no scholarships or nothing, so

01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:37.800
I�d been working in the shipyard to save
enough money to go to college. I was going

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.599
to pay my own way.
So Mikan says, �After you get out of college

01:51:41.599 --> 01:51:51.989
you got to come play for the Lakers.� And
that was, he was the number one guy in basketball

01:51:51.989 --> 01:52:02.929
and he talked so nice to me. He wasn�t condescending
or anything. He just talked to me like I was

01:52:02.929 --> 01:52:05.449
another ball player.
TB: That�s going back more than fifty, sixty

01:52:05.449 --> 01:52:11.449
years, something like that. You think race
relations would have been horrible back then.

01:52:11.449 --> 01:52:17.239
And they were; you�ve never been rosy about
it. But you�re saying even back in those

01:52:17.239 --> 01:52:19.530
days there�re always exceptions to the rule.
This is a really decent white guy.

01:52:19.530 --> 01:52:25.619
WR: Well, you remember I told you his folks
thought he was going to be in the seminary.

01:52:25.619 --> 01:52:33.860
But he was just a good person and I tell you,
one of the greatest rewards I had was, after

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:42.159
George died they had a private ceremony for
his family. And I was invited. Because George

01:52:42.159 --> 01:52:52.010
and I had been friends. We�d be taping in
LA, we did a TV show or something, and George

01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:57.020
says, �Bill, I want you to do me a big favor.
I need a big favor from you. I�ll understand

01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:03.550
if you say no.� I said, �What is it, George?�
He said, �I want to introduce you to my

01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:13.789
son.� �Are you kidding? That�s a favor?�
You know. So, he introduced me to his son

01:53:13.789 --> 01:53:24.389
and he says to his son, �I want you to meet
Bill Russell, the greatest center that ever

01:53:24.389 --> 01:53:32.349
played basketball.� And I said, �George.�
People forget, you know, he won three championships

01:53:32.349 --> 01:53:39.110
in five years. He was the man in basketball
but it wasn�t on television and all that

01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:48.450
so people didn�t know that. But I was so
flattered that this man had been so nice to

01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:55.809
me.
You know, a lot of people say very, very insensitive

01:53:55.809 --> 01:54:16.159
things to kids. And I hope that I never do
that. You know? Because you can injure kids

01:54:16.159 --> 01:54:28.780
by not being, just�well, I have this thing
that I get along, that the first thing out

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:38.420
of your mouth should be your second thought.
TB: Because the first one is the one that

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.260
might injure a kid?
WR: Yeah, or even you. [Laughs]

01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:48.980
TB: I think one of your sayings was always
that you don�t believe there�s any such

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:56.550
thing as other people�s kids.
WR: Right, well I was speaking at a school

01:54:56.550 --> 01:55:03.849
in Fort Worth, Texas. And they were winding
down the Vietnam War. I said instead of spending

01:55:03.849 --> 01:55:16.000
all that money killing peasants, we should
take that money [1:55:00] and repair our educational

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.119
system. Because we haven�t paid enough attention
to it, and we haven�t paid enough money

01:55:22.119 --> 01:55:29.010
to it. And so after the speech, well one guy
comes and says, �Well, listen. Your speech

01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:38.210
was alright except for one thing. What you�re
talking about is raising my taxes. Why should

01:55:38.210 --> 01:55:48.360
I pay taxes to educate other people�s kids?�
And I said to him: �Two reasons you should

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:56.760
pay taxes. One, when you were six and your
folks bundled you up and sent you off to school,

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:08.650
there was a school for you to go to, and your
folks did not build it. It was there. And

01:56:08.650 --> 01:56:16.900
second, there are no other people�s kids
in the United States. That�s the next generation

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:28.070
of Americans and if we don�t educate them,
we�ll lost all the things we think are important.

01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:40.369
Because if we�re not one of the top educated
societies we will not be able to compete internationally,

01:56:40.369 --> 01:56:46.893
and so we have a choice of either building
our schools or picking a war. And I don�t

01:56:46.893 --> 01:56:59.999
think picking a war is the best option.�
TB: Can you talk a little bit about your relationship

01:56:59.999 --> 01:57:05.190
with the Civil Rights Movement? I know that
because that was during your playing career,

01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:10.949
it was around for a lot of it. I know once
you went to Mississippi in the summer of 1964

01:57:10.949 --> 01:57:15.480
for Charles Ever, the brother of Medgar Evers,
the year after he was killed.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:27.369
WR: Well, you know I was never big on organizations.
And the reason for that was, if you say something

01:57:27.369 --> 01:57:35.000
as part of an organization, you can be dismissed
as a mouthpiece for the organization and so

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:48.079
they don't have to deal with what you say.
When Medgar Evers got shot, we had a memorial

01:57:48.079 --> 01:58:00.809
service for him in Boston, at the Boston Common,
and I sat next to Charlie Evers, his brother.

01:58:00.809 --> 01:58:16.150
And I don�t know what I was thinking, but
I told him, �If there�s ever anything

01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:19.999
I can do, here�s my home number.� And
he used it! [Laughs]

01:58:19.999 --> 01:58:32.380
So he called me that summer, says, �We�ve
taken a hit, morale-wise, and we�re down

01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:40.100
to the lowest we�ve been and so we need
somebody to give us a boost, to show somebody

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:52.099
from outside cares.� So I said, �Ok, what
do you want me to do.� He says, �Well,

01:58:52.099 --> 01:58:59.150
you know what would be a good idea, right
in your field of expertise, why don�t you

01:58:59.150 --> 01:59:06.329
do some clinics, basketball clinics, in Jackson,
Mississippi, and in the surrounding towns,

01:59:06.329 --> 01:59:12.520
invite everybody. Anybody that wants to come,
can come to your clinics.� I said, �I

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:32.940
can do that.� So I went down and did clinics
and I actually enjoyed myself. Charlie says

01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:43.599
to me, �You know we�re not going to let
anything happen to you.� I go, �Ok.�

01:59:43.599 --> 01:59:53.969
So I had armed guards. But they were like
the Secret Service, you never knew they were

01:59:53.969 --> 02:00:12.090
around. But they gave me such a high.
TB: That was 1964. This is [2:00:00] Mississippi

02:00:12.090 --> 02:00:15.570
Freedom Summer. Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman,
the first three first civil rights workers

02:00:15.570 --> 02:00:23.980
on the very first night were murdered. It
was a frightful place to be going to. And

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:36.300
you�re not exactly inconspicuous.
WR: Yes. [Laughs] Well, you know, I was invited

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:49.869
years later to the McDonald�s high school
all-star game in Indiana. And so I went there,

02:00:49.869 --> 02:01:01.139
and I had a good time, and after I spoke they
asked me to take a picture with each one of

02:01:01.139 --> 02:01:03.260
the participants, boys and girls. Boys�
team

02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:14.030
game and the girls� game. So one of them
was, the female high school player of the

02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:22.590
year was a young girl from Colorado. And so
she was, while they were setting the picture

02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:28.719
up, she says,� Mr. Russell, I�d like to
say something to you. You said something today

02:01:28.719 --> 02:01:37.719
in your speech that I will carry with me for
the rest of my life.� �What?� �You

02:01:37.719 --> 02:01:55.540
said to us, �Do not be afraid.�� Because
all decisions made out of fear are usually

02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:01.190
bad decisions. And you�re going to a new
world from high school to college and then

02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:12.159
from college into the real world. Do not be
afraid, because you�re alright. You�ve

02:02:12.159 --> 02:02:28.310
got this far. Do not be afraid. Well, I may
be not too bright but I cannot recall the

02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:41.219
last time I was afraid. And the society I
live in, every time I could do something I

02:02:41.219 --> 02:02:49.980
see that as an opportunity.
TB: Could you tell me a little bit about your

02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:57.739
relationships with other civil rights figures
from that period? Did you ever meet Malcolm

02:02:57.739 --> 02:03:05.860
X or Martin Luther King?
WR: I just briefly knew Malcolm X. I knew

02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:22.380
Louis Farrakhan. He�d been to my house a
few times, because he came out with, before

02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:29.520
he changed to Ali he was Cassius Clay. And
the reason Cassius was coming to my house

02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:40.300
was, I was a gold medal winner in the �56
Olympics and I always have affection for gold

02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:54.030
medal winners, because I know what it takes.
And I knew, in the March on Washington, I

02:03:54.030 --> 02:04:05.329
stayed in the same hotel as the Reverend Martin
Luther King. So we met in the lobby and had

02:04:05.329 --> 02:04:15.989
a brief conversation. And I told him I was
there for the march. And he invited me to

02:04:15.989 --> 02:04:27.539
go on stage, where he made the big speech.
And I respectfully declined. And the reason

02:04:27.539 --> 02:04:39.269
I declined was, they had worked for a couple
years to put that thing together, and I hadn�t

02:04:39.269 --> 02:04:46.590
done anything. And it would not be right,
I didn�t think, for me to go on stage and

02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:54.949
say, �Hey, listen. This is what we�ve
done.� And I hadn't done anything. So I

02:04:54.949 --> 02:05:03.960
sat in the first row, and enjoyed it, but
I didn�t want to be one of those guys, �Hey,

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.070
look at me.�
TB: Do you know if there is a photograph of

02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:11.791
you at the March on Washington? Have you seen
one?

02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:14.989
WR: What? [2:05:00]
TB: Do you know if there�s a photograph

02:05:14.989 --> 02:05:18.219
of you there?
WR: I don�t know. I don�t think so.

02:05:18.219 --> 02:05:22.670
TB: I�d love to see that.
WR: I was just one of the guys, one of the

02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:31.219
people there to support them.
TB: Do you remember when he was killed. That�s

02:05:31.219 --> 02:05:42.510
during the season in your next-to-last year.
WR: Yeah. Well, we were playing a game the

02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:51.360
night he got killed, in Philadelphia. They
asked both teams, what do you think? Do you

02:05:51.360 --> 02:06:02.739
think we should call the game off or play?
Now, we think it would be a bad thing for

02:06:02.739 --> 02:06:10.079
the city of Philadelphia if we call the game
off and we�ve got twelve or thirteen thousand

02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:22.329
people under great stress and really, really
annoyed. That�s a quiet way of putting it.

02:06:22.329 --> 02:06:28.219
On the streets. And so we said, what we�ll
do is we�ll play the game and we�ll keep

02:06:28.219 --> 02:06:35.389
these twelve or thirteen thousand people in
the game so we don�t have riots in the streets

02:06:35.389 --> 02:06:42.180
of Philadelphia. That�s the reason we played
that game. Then we didn't play for a week

02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:53.219
or so. Those were the things we thought about.
TB: Did you know Ali much?

02:06:53.219 --> 02:07:11.639
WR: Oh yeah, I knew him when he was a kid,
boxing. Always a fan because to reach the

02:07:11.639 --> 02:07:26.940
top of your field, it takes more than physical
ability. You have to know what you�re doing

02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:33.479
to get to the top of your field, no matter
what the field because there are things that

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:45.420
you have to do to execute what it takes to
reach the top of your field. And so Ali was

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:57.010
not only a great, great boxer but he was a
psychologist and a brave, brave man.

02:07:57.010 --> 02:08:10.869
I was in Boston one day and a guy says, �I
want you to disavow Muhammad Ali.� �What?�

02:08:10.869 --> 02:08:21.349
�I want you to put him in his place.�
I said, �I�m not going to do a thing like

02:08:21.349 --> 02:08:31.326
that.� Said, �You won�t disavow him?�
I said, �Heck, no.� He says, �Well,

02:08:31.326 --> 02:08:36.670
I think you ought to do that.� I said, �I
don't care what you think. If I had a choice

02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:45.449
between you and Ali, you wouldn't even be
in the race. Are you kidding?� So he started

02:08:45.449 --> 02:08:52.409
calling me Felton X after that. You know,
they used to call the Muslims with an X, you

02:08:52.409 --> 02:09:03.930
know Malcolm X.
TB: When you got drafted, didn�t you organize

02:09:03.930 --> 02:09:05.969
a group of black�
WR: I didn�t organize. Jim Brown organized.

02:09:05.969 --> 02:09:09.909
TB: But you joined it, right, just to support
his decision?

02:09:09.909 --> 02:09:17.699
WR: You see, the thing is, what you have to
think about is, his decision not to go in

02:09:17.699 --> 02:09:26.420
the army. If you read what it was based on,
arbitrarily they decided to change his status,

02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:35.320
without a hearing or anything. Just, �We�re
going to change it.� Well, that�s not

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:40.829
right. Now, what category he was in, I�m
not sure but they changed it to 1-A. That

02:09:40.829 --> 02:09:53.099
was going to put you in the army. Well, you
can�t do that. You know?

02:09:53.099 --> 02:10:08.309
TB: Was that�I�m groping for a way of
asking what was the time you felt was most

02:10:08.309 --> 02:10:10.610
controversial, your most controversial stance.
WR: Who me?

02:10:10.610 --> 02:10:16.320
TB: [2:10:00] In your career, when you got
the most heat or something for what you felt

02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:24.159
or believed or said or didn�t say.
WR: Well, it started with, when I got to Boston

02:10:24.159 --> 02:10:32.100
I had not started to shave. You know, you
reach a certain age and you say, ok, now I�ll

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:38.300
start to shave. I hadn�t reached that when
I got to Boston. So I spent the first three

02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:47.239
or four months there explaining why I had
a beard and why I shouldn�t shave it off,

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:57.059
and the more they questioned the more I dug
in my heels because going

02:10:57.059 --> 02:11:06.949
back to college as a freshman, they had to
buy you a pair of shoes. Basketball shoes.

02:11:06.949 --> 02:11:19.440
And I bought a pair of white ones. And the
varsity coach says, �You wear black shoes.�

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:24.570
I says, �That�s the varsity. This is the
freshman team.� He said, �You should get

02:11:24.570 --> 02:11:34.010
black shoes, be like the rest of them.�
I said, �Coach, ain�t nothing I can ever

02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:43.560
do to look like rest of these guys.� There
were two black guys, there were four black

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:49.239
guys on varsity and the junior varsity, on
the freshman. So there was no way I was going

02:11:49.239 --> 02:12:05.249
to look like the rest of those guys.
So one thing I got from my dad was to analyze

02:12:05.249 --> 02:12:14.940
and come to conclusions from my own perspective.
See, I cannot tell you who your heroes should

02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:25.920
be. And you�d be wrong if you think you
can tell me who my heroes should be. Matter

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:38.710
of fact, Bill Walton, who is a dear friend
and who is I think a really good guy, ok,

02:12:38.710 --> 02:12:53.570
we were talking about growing up. At the end
of the conversation he said to me, �We come

02:12:53.570 --> 02:12:57.070
from two different worlds.� [ironically]
�Really?� [Laughs]

02:12:57.070 --> 02:13:14.179
A friend of mine is a young guy named Yao
Ming. He�s retired now. He used to play

02:13:14.179 --> 02:13:22.960
for the Houston Rockets. He asked if he could
have a conversation with me. I said ok. So

02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:32.949
he came to my house for dinner, here. And
we were talking about his career, and I says,

02:13:32.949 --> 02:13:42.199
�There�s one thing you should be very
aware of, and never lose sight of. You are

02:13:42.199 --> 02:14:01.159
a very tall Chinese man. Embrace it.� I
says, �Always embrace your mother and father

02:14:01.159 --> 02:14:14.369
and the culture you grew up in.� And I said,
�Always be true to who you are and what

02:14:14.369 --> 02:14:28.620
you are?.� And that to me is a positive
thing and not a negative thing because you

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:38.760
can be Chinese and love the Chinese without
hating the American, which some people will

02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:49.980
try to conclude. You see? You can embrace
who you are and what you are and be a positive

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:56.880
impact on your life. [recording pauses and
resumes]

02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:05.389
TB: Ok, we want to resume talking a little
bit about your relationship with the city

02:15:05.389 --> 02:15:11.039
of Boston, and how it changed from the time
you were back there playing until [2:15:00]

02:15:11.039 --> 02:15:17.599
modern days when you�ve made peace to some
degree with certain people there.

02:15:17.599 --> 02:15:22.150
WR: That never happened.
TB: Never happened?

02:15:22.150 --> 02:15:38.030
WR: See, people thought I was bothered, but
I was never bothered. They got my attention

02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:51.389
about certain things, but I always was able
to maintain control. Just like one of the

02:15:51.389 --> 02:16:03.030
things that annoyed the media there was, they
turned their heads, they looked up, and I

02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:10.790
was gone. I told Red, I�m finished, that
I�m not going to do it anymore. He�s the

02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:27.270
only one I told. They were under the misconception
that the things that they valued and the things

02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:41.860
that I valued weren�t different. Like I
told someone last month: I never, ever need

02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:57.580
to be validated. I came, I did what I did,
and I left. Just like I told those guys on

02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:06.840
NBA TV. They said, �How come they never
pick you as the greatest player who ever played?�

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.040
I said, �First of all, that�s irrelevant
and I don�t even get into that because nobody

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:20.140
can know who the best player was, because
there is not an accepted standard that says,

02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:32.710
this is what a great player does.� Now,
spectators are the only real experts.

02:17:32.710 --> 02:17:45.330
I want to tell you a story if you�ve got
time. I was working for CBS. I remember the

02:17:45.330 --> 02:17:52.750
game. The Lakers played the Sixers in Philadelphia,
and Magic (Johnson) had to play center because

02:17:52.750 --> 02:18:03.841
Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) was home with a migraine.
And we were in a production meeting and the

02:18:03.841 --> 02:18:08.750
announcer, who will go unnamed, started to
say, �We�re going to have to promote it

02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:17.380
as the sixth game. If the Lakers won, it was
over. If the Sixers won, it had to go to a

02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:21.920
seventh game.� So the announcer said, �We�re
going to have to start promoting the seventh

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:31.881
game no later than the end of the first quarter.�
So the third time he said that, I said, �Why

02:18:31.881 --> 02:18:38.510
are you saying that?� He said, �Without
Kareem the Lakers can�t compete, and that

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:44.020
game will be over
the first eight minutes.� I said, �The

02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:49.900
Lakers are going to win the game.� And you
know what he said to me? �You do not know

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:58.250
what you�re talking about.�
Normally, I�d just let it slide, but that

02:18:58.250 --> 02:19:05.099
time I didn�t feel like just letting it
slide. I said, �Yes, I do.� I said, �I

02:19:05.099 --> 02:19:14.070
know more about playing basketball than anybody
you�ll ever meet.� He says, �Well, how

02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:25.540
can you say that?� I said, �Well, there
are certain criteria you use in the playoffs.

02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:31.780
First, there�s matchups. You take Magic
out of the backcourt and you�re left with

02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:43.230
Norm Nixon and Michael Cooper up against Andrew
Toney and Maurice Cheeks. That�s a wash.

02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:50.040
Nobody has the advantage.� I said, �The
way Jamaal Wilkes is playing, he and the Doc

02:19:50.040 --> 02:20:08.200
(Julius Erving), that�s a wash. Jim Chones
and either Caldwell Jones or Chocolate Thunder

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:15.160
(Darryl Dawkins)
[recording pauses and resumes]

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:25.710
TB: [2:20:00] Ok, you said those were a wash.
TB: Darryl Dawkins and either Caldwell Jones

02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:34.870
and Jim Chones. There would be a Sixers advantage.
I said, �Well, the guy who�s left is completely

02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:45.070
out of it. He�s got to try to guard Magic.
Magic is big and strong enough to guard him,

02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:53.010
but he can�t even catch up with Magic.�
In fact, Magic, I surmised, was one of the

02:20:53.010 --> 02:21:02.490
top three fastest guys in the league in foot
speed. So this guy, Magic�s playing center,

02:21:02.490 --> 02:21:12.750
he�d never seen Magic, in fact. I said,
�Ok, that�s just matchups. This will be

02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:22.840
the sixth straight game that the Lakers will
play this Sixers team. During the way to the

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:31.650
sixth team, they�ve made adjustments, made
adjustments. They�ve made adjustments so

02:21:31.650 --> 02:21:41.500
they�re familiar. Now, this is the first
game that the Sixers will have played this

02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:51.470
Lakers team, with Magic at center. As great
as Kareem is, you always know where to find

02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:58.150
him. He�s down on the blocks, either left
or right side. Magic, he might be selling

02:21:58.150 --> 02:22:05.721
popcorn, as far as you know. He could be all
over the building.

02:22:05.721 --> 02:22:11.660
So now the Sixers are going to have to start
making adjustments as they go along, tonight.

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:20.261
By the time they make adjustments for this
team, it will be late in training camp for

02:22:20.261 --> 02:22:33.030
next season.� I said, �So, if the Sixers
were to play the best game that any team in

02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:41.200
the history of the franchise had ever played,
they would still lose. They do not have a

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:45.000
chance.�
TB: Wow. Did you say that on the air, too?

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:52.860
WR: No, I said that in a production meeting.
And so, we go in there and exactly what I

02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:58.460
told him would happen, happened. Jamaal Wilkes
got thirty-five points, Magic was uncontrollable,

02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:08.120
the backcourt was a wash. In fact, a kid named
Brad Holland came off the bench and got ten

02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:15.650
points. And so the Sixers never had a chance.
They were a good team. They basically went

02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:24.420
into the sixth game unarmed. So these are
the kinds of things you have to know to win

02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:32.330
the playoffs, because every game is different
if your coach is any good.

02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:37.870
TB: Let�s go back to where we were talking
a little bit before about your famous autograph

02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:42.771
policy. You surprised me, I didn�t know
this you, by saying that you didn�t have

02:23:42.771 --> 02:23:47.961
it when you first started with the Celtics
but it came about almost by accident a few

02:23:47.961 --> 02:23:52.660
years later over signing basketballs.
WR: Yes, in 1964. This was when I finally

02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:53.660
made the decision I�m not going to do that
anymore.

02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:59.290
TB: And you said it had to do with signing
basketballs?

02:23:59.290 --> 02:24:09.141
WR: Well, that�s where it started. By that
time, I had started to get just a bit cranky,

02:24:09.141 --> 02:24:25.841
ok? Off the basketball court, nobody could
tell me what to do. Ok? I ask Anita to read

02:24:25.841 --> 02:24:44.570
you the letter if you want to. From that time
in �64, when I told you I stopped, until

02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:50.051
today, you�d be surprised the people try
to figure out a way to make me sign autographs.

02:24:50.051 --> 02:25:03.530
When I first took the coaching job at Boston,
Red asked me to do a couple of TV shows. And

02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:09.101
so this one guy says, �Well, now that
you�re coaching you�re going to have to

02:25:09.101 --> 02:25:13.710
start signing autographs.� I said, �No,
I�m not.� [2:25:00] �Hasn�t Red called

02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:17.391
you, told you you had to start signing autographs,
because you�re part of management?� I

02:25:17.391 --> 02:25:26.221
said, �First of all, Red knew what I was
before he offered me the job. I didn�t all

02:25:26.221 --> 02:25:30.641
of a sudden just say now since I�m the coach
I�m going to sign autographs.� It was

02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:36.950
my policy for years at the time. I said, �You
people keep asking me about that and I�m

02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:42.210
going to tell you one thing, ok? If I say
to you, I�m not going to sign autographs,

02:25:42.210 --> 02:25:52.820
that�s the end of it. There�s nobody you
can tell, that�ll say oh, can you sign autographs.�

02:25:52.820 --> 02:26:01.340
I said, �Almighty God says to me, �You
sign autographs,� I�ll say no. Even He

02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:11.120
cannot make me sign autographs. He can strike
me dead. The one thing that God gave us all

02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:24.250
is a free will. So if I say I�m not going
to do it, it�s not going to happen.�

02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:31.931
TB: Didn�t you say that some of the Celtics
faked your signatures on basketballs, though?

02:26:31.931 --> 02:26:40.650
WR: Oh, yeah. Heinsohn, Ramsey, Sam, I think
sometimes K.C. They used to have a contest

02:26:40.650 --> 02:26:47.750
who could do the best Bill Russells.
TB: So there are a lot of counterfeit Russell

02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:51.030
autographs out there on basketballs.
WR: Oh, yeah. [Laughs]

02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:59.490
TB: Well, I can remember in the seventies,
being out at restaurants with you, and people

02:26:59.490 --> 02:27:05.750
would come up right in restaurants and walk
right up and ask you to sign an autograph.

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:12.641
And my memory is that you would say�usually
they would have their kids there�you would

02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:19.011
say, if you want to sit down and say hello
and have a conversation, that�s fine, but

02:27:19.011 --> 02:27:20.011
I�m not going to sign an autograph.
WR: So I said, one of the kids asked me one

02:27:20.011 --> 02:27:29.271
time about not signing autographs. I said,
to me, to you, it�s not personal. It�s

02:27:29.271 --> 02:27:38.211
a matter of policy. I said, I don�t sign
autographs. That goes for everybody, not just

02:27:38.211 --> 02:27:53.080
you. I have a choice and I make the choice.
And so most of the kids

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.990
understand it. One of the things I used to
always joke about, guy says, �Why don�t

02:27:56.990 --> 02:28:05.070
you sign autographs? For my kids?� I said,
�That�s a bad trade.� [Laughter]

02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:21.181
TB: Am I right in remembering that when you
were asked about playing for Boston, you said

02:28:21.181 --> 02:28:24.240
you never played for Boston, you played for
the Celtics.

02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:28.830
WR: That�s right. I played for the Celtics.
TB: For the team.

02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:36.550
WR: After I retired, I moved to L.A. by the
way. And I was a season ticket holder for

02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:46.171
four years for the Los Angeles Lakers. And
they had a ceremony for Jerry West and they

02:28:46.171 --> 02:28:52.794
said would you come. I said of course, I like
Jerry a lot. So while I was there they put

02:28:52.794 --> 02:29:01.681
me in a box next to Jack Kent Cooke, who owned
the team. That was an experience. Anyway,

02:29:01.681 --> 02:29:09.910
a couple days later, I get a call from Jack
Kent Cooke. He says, �I�ve been thinking

02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:15.290
about it, and I made a decision. I�m going
to get you to come out of retirement and play

02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:30.990
for the Lakers.� I said, �You�re paying
a guy named Wilt Chamberlain to play for the

02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:43.090
Lakers. Now, how would he feel being the backup
center?� Jack Kent Cooke didn�t think

02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:51.841
that was funny. [Laughs] So I said, �No,
no. I don�t play basketball any more, and

02:29:51.841 --> 02:30:01.900
if I did, it would only be for the Celtics.�
That�s the only time I would play basketball.

02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:09.040
TB: Would you talk a little bit about your
relationship with the Red Sox over the issue

02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:14.370
of throwing out the [2:30:00] first ball and
your mentoring foundation and how that developed

02:30:14.370 --> 02:30:18.301
after your retirement, recently?
WR: Well, when I was in the company of the

02:30:18.301 --> 02:30:26.150
mayor of Boston, he asked me to come to the
Democratic National Convention and co-host

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:35.461
his reception. And he had these receptions
in community centers all around Boston. And

02:30:35.461 --> 02:30:44.790
so while I was there my agent at the time
had set up for me�it was the last series

02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:50.380
of the year with the Red Sox and the Yankees,
and that�s a big deal

02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:57.141
in Boston�so he had set up for me to go
out and throw out the first pitch. And so

02:30:57.141 --> 02:31:00.811
he says, �We got to be over at Fenway by
eleven.� I said, �I�m not going over

02:31:00.811 --> 02:31:06.240
to Fenway Park.� He says, �Why not.�
I says, �Because I�m not. It�s got nothing

02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:11.000
to do with the Red Sox.� He says, �Well,
I�ve already set it up.� I says, �Well,

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.820
you have to un-set it, because I�m going
to have nothing to do with the Red Sox.�

02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:24.480
I says, �As far as I�m concerned, the
Red Sox can burn in hell for eternity.�

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:32.330
TB: And why was that?
WR: Well, when I was with the Celtics, the

02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:41.061
guy that owns the Red Sox said he would never
have a black player. In fact, they were the

02:31:41.061 --> 02:31:49.620
last major league team to get a black player.
They do not owe or me or any other black person

02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:53.521
anything. That�s their business and they
can run it the way they want to run it. That

02:31:53.521 --> 02:32:05.830
does not mean I have to associate with them.
So I was at a reception and some lady walks

02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:14.130
up and says she works for the Red Sox. I said,
�Ok.� She said, �Well, why don�t you

02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:19.780
come out and throw the first pitch.� I said,
�I�m not having anything to do with the

02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:26.400
Red Sox.� She said, �Well, the Red Sox
have changed. This is different.� I says,

02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:35.931
�Well, you show me that you have a program
to facilitate the change and we�ll talk.�

02:32:35.931 --> 02:32:43.160
I said, �You�re not going to keep the
first policy and get Bill Russell to come

02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:51.971
out and throw the first pitch and say, �See?
We�ve changed.� That�s not going to

02:32:51.971 --> 02:32:56.920
happen.�
So, fast forward. I have a charity that I�ve

02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:06.391
been working with for almost twenty years.
It�s called Mentoring, and we have so far

02:33:06.391 --> 02:33:13.670
a very successful program. We started out
with the name One to One. One mentor, one

02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:26.620
mentee. Last year, 2012, we passed eight million
volunteers throughout the country. Four million,

02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:37.750
I�m sorry. Four million volunteers throughout
the country that are one-to-one mentoring.

02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:54.561
But it�s not just black kids. It�s kids.
In the Boston chapter, we�ve got a lot of

02:33:54.561 --> 02:34:03.170
Hispanic kids, lot of Asian kids, lot of black
kids, lot of white kids. The only

02:34:03.170 --> 02:34:13.051
requirement is that you be a kid. And some
adult will spend some time helping you get

02:34:13.051 --> 02:34:22.500
started. And we have found that the adults
that volunteer to be mentors end up profiting

02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:30.490
more than the kids, because you find out on
a very personal basis how you can be helpful.

02:34:30.490 --> 02:34:39.351
TB: So you asked the Red Sox to become active?
WR: Well, no, I asked the Red Sox � they

02:34:39.351 --> 02:34:48.800
had three or four owners. I said I want one
of those owners to go on the board of my charity.

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:57.300
Not to say, �We support it.� Go on the
board. They said, �Don�t you want a player?�

02:34:57.300 --> 02:35:02.331
I said, �No, I don�t want a player.�
It�s not that I don�t respect the players,

02:35:02.331 --> 02:35:12.280
but the owners can make policy decisions and
the owner�s not likely to get traded [2:35:00]

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:22.880
away. So the players for the Red Sox, as far
as I [2:35:10] are nice, nice bunch of young

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:36.800
guys who are prone to be active in the community.
I said, but it�s not to insult them, that�s

02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:49.910
not the point. I want somebody who can make
decisions and policy. So we got one of the

02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:56.431
owners to go on the board and he�s done
an absolutely marvelous job. In fact, most

02:35:56.431 --> 02:36:05.400
of the people in New England think that Mentoring
is a Red Sox program. I can live with that.

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:13.000
Because that�s the biggest voice in New
England, is the Red Sox, and they went all

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:22.271
out� [phone rings] That�s your phone.
John Bishop: We�re going.

02:36:22.271 --> 02:36:29.550
TB: So the Red Sox stepped up to meet your
conditions and support the mentoring foundation.

02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:37.220
WR: Yes, what they did was, twice a year at
Fenway Park, they have �Step up to the Plate�

02:36:37.220 --> 02:36:46.590
for Mentoring and on the Green Monster they
have a banner that lists the number of people

02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:54.681
devoted to the mentoring program. And for
every Red Sox game, there are four seats set

02:36:54.681 --> 02:36:59.330
aside for two mentors and two mentees who
have been together for three years or more.

02:36:59.330 --> 02:37:08.900
They are the guests of the Red Sox. And they�ve
encouraged their sponsors and, anyway, they

02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:15.240
encourage
people who do business with them to start

02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:21.601
mentoring programs in their companies. So,
they�ve been really super.

02:37:21.601 --> 02:37:28.720
TB: So, when did somebody from the Red Sox
call you and up and say, �We think we�ve

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:36.921
met your conditions, we�ve tried to make
a change, are you ready to throw out the first

02:37:36.921 --> 02:37:37.921
ball?�
WR: I did!

02:37:37.921 --> 02:37:44.840
TB: How did that go?
WR: I didn�t get it over the plate. [Laughter]

02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:47.271
TB: Wow. How long ago was that, that you threw
out the first pitch?

02:37:47.271 --> 02:37:49.710
WR: It was maybe six years ago.
TB: Six years ago. So after they won the World

02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:57.820
Series, the first one.
WR: Yes, because my late wife and I went back

02:37:57.820 --> 02:38:06.380
there a couple of times and the Red Sox did
something very nice. They started a scholarship

02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:13.250
for inner-city kids in Boston and named it
the Marilyn Nault Russell Scholarship.

02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:21.391
TB: Named it for Marilyn.
WR: Yes. That really pleased me a lot, because

02:38:21.391 --> 02:38:29.480
that was my good friend.
TB: So, then, how long after that was it that

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:34.660
the city of Boston, was it the mayor who approached
you about the statue?

02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:43.230
WR: Yeah. Well, after I got the Medal of Freedom,
and Obama said someday there�ll be a statue

02:38:43.230 --> 02:38:52.740
of Bill Russell, and I told him I�d never
forgive him for that. Of course when Tom Menino

02:38:52.740 --> 02:39:03.800
first told me about the statue I said, �You
know a statue sounds a lot to me like a tombstone.�

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:12.920
And he says, �Why do you say that?� And
I says, �You know, if you really, truly

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:22.730
believe in God, he does not need a marker
to find you.� So I said, �I would be willing

02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:28.160
to be buried in an unmarked grave. Because
if you really believe in God he doesn�t

02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:31.490
need a marker to
find you. He knows exactly where you are.�

02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:38.061
And so, but Tom says, �Well��I says,
�And besides that, I don�t need anything

02:39:38.061 --> 02:39:48.580
like that��he says, �Well, it�s not
so much for you as it is for the city. You�ve

02:39:48.580 --> 02:40:09.750
made a tremendous amount of difference in
community and race relations.� Because

02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:18.630
my way of thinking [2:40:00] I�ve not got
past the place where we are beyond race. Even

02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:31.550
I ain�t that dumb. [Laughs] But that can
be, if you want it to be, a healthy part of

02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:44.351
community relations. [2:40:24] They found
out that when I made decisions, it was based

02:40:44.351 --> 02:40:55.771
on competence, not on race. And that�s all
that anyone could ask of anybody, is that

02:40:55.771 --> 02:41:05.030
if you are going to make a decision and race
becomes part of your decision-making process,

02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:12.660
what you have to really go to is competence.
Like I used to always say. Long ago, somebody

02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:19.330
asked me what would I think about a gay person
playing in the NBA. This was years and years

02:41:19.330 --> 02:41:33.740
ago. And I said, I have one question: can
he play? [pause in recording]

02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:45.910
TB: So when is the statue going to be unveiled?
WR: Well, after I conceded they could do it,

02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:54.930
I pretty much put it on the back burner and
so they tell me they�ll give me, Tom says,

02:41:54.930 --> 02:42:03.320
�If we do this, we�re going to have you
make all the key decisions.� And first I

02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:10.540
looked at five different sites in Boston with
the city manager to see where we are going

02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:22.370
to put it. And we ended up in City Hall Plaza,
which is adjacent to the Freedom Trail and

02:42:22.370 --> 02:42:33.570
near the old statehouse. And we are going
to put a little�a little bigger than an

02:42:33.570 --> 02:42:40.091
alley�it�s going to be like the valley
of champions. And so for all the teams that

02:42:40.091 --> 02:42:47.391
won championships, we have a star lead up
to the statue. And they�re going to have

02:42:47.391 --> 02:42:55.061
some of my pet phrases, like, �There are
no such thing as other people�s kids. They�re

02:42:55.061 --> 02:43:02.220
all the next generation Americans.� And
a few things like that.

02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:08.601
TB: On the statue?
WR: No, on little plaques all around the�.

02:43:08.601 --> 02:43:20.721
But Tom did not have me convinced yet. He
says, �Ok, we are going to create a legacy

02:43:20.721 --> 02:43:32.420
foundation to support Mentoring. And so, every
year we will have fundraisers around the statue

02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:43.091
to raise money for Mentoring. And that�s
a good way to get real, personal community

02:43:43.091 --> 02:43:53.450
involvement in the educational system. And
when you get that, you see, like I saw a thing

02:43:53.450 --> 02:44:00.801
on TV the other day, that in terms of literacy
and all that kind of stuff, America�s in

02:44:00.801 --> 02:44:12.790
the second ten. Well, how are you going to
maintain a viable part of the future if you

02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:24.320
don�t educate the next generation. And the
only way you can beat that is start a war.

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:32.000
You know? And so I don�t think wars are
helpful. [Laughs]

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:39.630
TB: You mentioned getting the Medal of Freedom
from President Obama. What was that experience

02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:43.320
like and I understand he said some nice things
to you.

02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:49.580
WR: I think he's an extraordinarily nice man,
first of all, and a good person. But they

02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:55.301
asked me if that was the highest honor I�ve
ever gotten. And I said just second. �Second?�

02:44:55.301 --> 02:45:04.601
�Yeah.� �Second?� �Yeah.� �Well,
if that�s second, what was the highest honor?�

02:45:04.601 --> 02:45:13.881
Well, when he was seventy-five, [2:45:00]
my father said to me one day, �I�m very

02:45:13.881 --> 02:45:25.870
proud of you as my son. I�m also proud that
I am your father.� And this is my hero.

02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:34.000
And you can�t top that, not coming from
the hero.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:41.260
TB: But it was a good second, right?
WR: Oh, yeah. It was a good strong second.

02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:43.870
TB: What did he say about your helping him
become president?

02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:52.910
WR: He just said it was guys like me that
made it possible for him to be president.

02:45:52.910 --> 02:46:07.851
I said, �I don�t see that, but thanks
anyway.� I really like him on a personal

02:46:07.851 --> 02:46:18.110
basis. The first time I met him, we were dedicating
the start of the work on the Martin Luther

02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:24.220
King monument in Washington. And so he looks
at me, �I know you. You�re Karen Russell�s

02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:28.721
dad.� [Laughs] You
know, it�s funny. That�s the same thing

02:46:28.721 --> 02:46:44.940
Bill Clinton said to me the first time I met
him. It just feels funny being a parent having

02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:50.980
someone say that about you. I said, �What
am I? Chopped liver?�

02:46:50.980 --> 02:46:59.690
TB: You also mentioned, speaking of mentors
and role models, you were the only basketball

02:46:59.690 --> 02:47:02.500
pallbearer for Jackie Robinson? How did that
come about?

02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:08.920
WR: Oh, the only non-teammate.
TB: The only non-Brooklyn Dodger teammate.

02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:22.510
WR: Right. Well, when Jackie started with
the Dodgers, I was thirteen. And he was the

02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:31.821
essence of an [2:47:17] who played ball. Not
just baseball, football, but ball. Because

02:47:31.821 --> 02:47:43.590
he was a man that played baseball. And at
that time, up until then, there was nobody

02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:55.790
like that. There were guys who had notoriety,
but they were not stand-up guys. So when Jackie

02:47:55.790 --> 02:48:02.061
died, Rachel Robinson called me and said,
�I want you to be a pallbearer at Jackie�s

02:48:02.061 --> 02:48:12.490
funeral.� Well, that�s right up there
with uh, a close number three. Ok? So I said,

02:48:12.490 --> 02:48:21.480
�Of course. Just tell me when and where.�
Not a lot of kids from the projects in West

02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:25.440
Oakland get to be a pallbearer for Jackie
Robinson.

02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:36.730
And so I said, �Why me?� She said, �You
were Jackie�s favorite athlete.� Well,

02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:49.900
as far as fans and that kind of stuff, nobody
else comes close to that. Jackie was our guy,

02:48:49.900 --> 02:49:01.461
as a kid. And for her to say he turned around
and respected me. And I took the attitude

02:49:01.461 --> 02:49:09.811
because of that when I thought about, I said,
Jackie took us from point A to point B. First

02:49:09.811 --> 02:49:20.940
black guy in major league sports, baseball.
Well, when I got with the Celtics, I did not

02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:31.210
want to revisit that part A to part B I wanted
to go from point B to point C. That�s why

02:49:31.210 --> 02:49:43.820
it was kind of halfway important that I coach.
And the guy asked me once, �How important

02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:53.311
is it that you were the first black coach.�
I said, �It�s not important. First of

02:49:53.311 --> 02:50:00.530
all, I�m the best person for the job, for
this particular job, and I know that. And

02:50:00.530 --> 02:50:14.050
second, it�ll be important when coaches
are hired and fired with no reference to race.

02:50:14.050 --> 02:50:25.920
[2:50:00] Then it�s important.� So like
now, coaches and managers are fired wholesale,

02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:31.440
ok? And nowadays, never is there a reference
to race.

02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:37.880
TB: We should speak just a little bit here
toward the end, because we mentioned Jackie

02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:47.010
as a role model, your relationship with some�we
talked about your teammates but you also had

02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:52.971
some pretty celebrated rivals, that you said,
your relations with your adversaries were

02:50:52.971 --> 02:51:02.700
special because they made you play better.
Oscar (Robertson) and Wilt, and Elgin Baylor.

02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:12.171
WR: At that time, with the NBA, I was really
seriously wished that every player in the

02:51:12.171 --> 02:51:20.910
NBA could find a position where he could play
his best, because then the people who went

02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:27.670
to NBA games would see the best players in
the world play their best. I�d kick their

02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:41.360
ass if they missed. [Laughs]
TB: In a way, didn�t that indirectly lead

02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:50.260
to part of your feud, I guess is not quite
the right word, with Wilt because he didn�t

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:55.030
play in your last game and you wanted him
to make you earn it? Last championship?

02:51:55.030 --> 02:52:03.080
WR: I talked to Wilt about that. I looked
him in the eye and I said, Wilt, I apologize

02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:12.391
for the stuff I said. That was just hubris,
you know? It was my last game and I knew it

02:52:12.391 --> 02:52:22.820
and I didn�t want anything to make it less
pleasant to me. And the reason I said things

02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:32.620
about him I should not have said was I was
speaking to a college group in Iowa, I think

02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:39.290
and there was a reporter in there mixed in
with the kids. I didn�t know he was a reporter,

02:52:39.290 --> 02:52:43.900
ok? And so we�re doing this question and
answer, and he said, �Well, you never would

02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:53.230
have won that last championship if Wilt hadn�t
got hurt.� Well, it annoyed me. Course when

02:52:53.230 --> 02:53:00.740
Wilt left the game we were seventeen points
ahead, and I went off on Wilt, and he had

02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:05.990
nothing to do with it. And so I looked him
in the eye and apologized to him and said

02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:15.790
it was just hubris. Not only that, I was wrong.
TB: But you did want him to be in the game

02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:23.920
because you got something out of the competition.
WR: Well, also, as long as he was in the game,

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:29.040
we were seventeen points ahead! [Laughs] I
didn�t want to change that.

02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:38.400
TB: You said once in one of your books, here,
about Dr. King: [reading] �I had the same

02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:44.250
reservation about Dr. King that I had about
the Vietnam War, which is that the white people

02:53:44.250 --> 02:53:51.761
in Boston liked him, so I knew something must
be wrong.� I guess that�s a light moment,

02:53:51.761 --> 02:53:57.070
because there was a time when they were kind
of superficial about race relations.

02:53:57.070 --> 02:54:09.300
WR: Yeah, well the reason I said that was
also in Boston at the time, was the guy named

02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:22.760
Detroit Red. I think it was Detroit Red. Who
later became Malcolm X. And they loved to

02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:37.230
put them at opposites, you know? And so they�d
choose the doctor. Well, I said, �If these

02:54:37.230 --> 02:54:57.851
people choose him, I�m going to be suspicious.�
I thought this way: there was a major problem.

02:54:57.851 --> 02:55:10.190
There was not one �the solution.� And
those various arms, SNCC, NAACP, [2:55:00]

02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:19.000
about five or six other organizations fighting
the same battles with different approaches.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:27.602
And I thought it was important that they all
be able to maintain. Because, see if you get

02:55:27.602 --> 02:55:35.440
to a place where one organization gets to
speak for a whole race, the race is in trouble

02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:49.760
because they�re smart enough to figure out
how to beat that. That�s like, I had a conversation

02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:57.690
with Nelson Mandela, and I told him how respectful
I was of what he did. One of the things he

02:55:57.690 --> 02:56:12.250
did not do, he did not disavow violence. He
was not going to ever create a civil war but

02:56:12.250 --> 02:56:18.771
he said that if he says he turns his back
on violence, all of his comrades trying to

02:56:18.771 --> 02:56:32.271
change Apartheid, it would put a target on
their back. And so he wouldn�t do that.

02:56:32.271 --> 02:56:37.291
So there were probably a dozen or more groups
in South Africa fighting Apartheid, each with

02:56:37.291 --> 02:56:48.960
their own agenda and their own style of fighting
the same problem. And so I�ve never put

02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:52.841
down any of those groups trying to change
things.

02:56:52.841 --> 02:57:00.500
TB: Let me ask you three sum-up questions
to end. First of all, looking back on your

02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:12.990
career and your life do you have any major
regrets, things you would have done differently?

02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:26.891
WR: I don�t know. Philosophically, I was
opposed to racism being part of the atmosphere

02:57:26.891 --> 02:57:40.070
but I did what I thought I could do to help
change it, or at least expose it.

02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:49.920
TB: Expose it is a good first step.
WR: Yes. You can never help to solve a problem

02:57:49.920 --> 02:58:00.961
until you recognize it as a problem. So, I
don�t know. I was not very intellectual.

02:58:00.961 --> 02:58:09.840
[Laughs] I don�t know what there is if I
could even change it.

02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:17.751
TB: And how do you look at today�s NBA,
because you�re a part of it again�they�ve

02:58:17.751 --> 02:58:22.261
got the award named for you, you go to the
Finals�compared to your NBA, and do you

02:58:22.261 --> 02:58:28.141
think the future of the league is still good?
WR: Well you know, I was watching playoffs

02:58:28.141 --> 02:58:39.790
the other day, and there are a lot of good
players. A lot of them. Like when I was playing,

02:58:39.790 --> 02:58:50.480
maybe four guys could shoot three-point shots.
Now every team�s got four guys who can shoot

02:58:50.480 --> 02:59:01.190
three-point shots. The game has changed. It�s
the most evolving of all the games. And so

02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:10.830
I always say I would never ask a player to
play against a ghost, past, present, or future.

02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:19.620
You know, �How�d he do against so-and-so?�
Well, that�s a different time. You know,

02:59:19.620 --> 02:59:30.710
like this guy asked me one time, �How would
you have done against Shaq?� I said, �First

02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:40.180
of all, you�ve got the question backwards.�
And I love that kid. I really do. I said,

02:59:40.180 --> 02:59:47.780
�But you can�t compare players of different
eras, because for example, for all intents

02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:56.200
and purposes, I invented the blocked shot,
ok? I�d never seen a shot blocked until

02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:03.430
I started doing it. When Shaq was four or
five years old, blocked shots were an integral

03:00:03.430 --> 03:00:15.500
part of the game. So he starts at five where
I started at eighteen. [3:00:00] Well, you

03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:25.740
can never compare that, you know what I mean.
There are certain standards. For example,

03:00:25.740 --> 03:00:33.380
when I was playing, there was no such thing
as a zone defense allowed. You were not allowed

03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:38.260
to play zone. Now everybody plays zones. They�re
variations on them, but they�re all zones.

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:45.360
And we had contempt for teams that played
zones because they had at least one or two

03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:54.760
guys that couldn't play defense, and so the
zone protected them. And now the zone�s

03:00:54.760 --> 03:01:00.210
an integrated part of it and if it�s played
right, it can be very effective.

03:01:00.210 --> 03:01:10.551
TB: So, finally, this interview will become
part of the archives of the new National Museum

03:01:10.551 --> 03:01:16.620
of African History and Culture.
WR: Hey! Taylor! You�re going to put me

03:01:16.620 --> 03:01:19.290
in the archives?
TB: I�m going in there with you!

03:01:19.290 --> 03:01:25.440
WR: Who are you? Indiana Jones? [Laughter]
TB: Well, you�re going to be looking out

03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:30.461
to a whole lot of people. Do you have any
advice for the young people who are going

03:01:30.461 --> 03:01:34.141
to come to this museum as to how they should
go about framing their choices for their life?

03:01:34.141 --> 03:01:46.690
WR: Well, if you�re fortunate to find something
you do well, approach it professionally. Find

03:01:46.690 --> 03:01:56.980
out what it�s all about, and how can you
take what�s it�s all about and make an

03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:16.101
improvement from your point of view. And you
take things from a novelty to a profession.

03:02:16.101 --> 03:02:25.120
You know, things that you enjoy doing well.
Well, when I was active playing basketball,

03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:35.271
first let me get this straight. We used to
travel before the jet fleets. And if it�s

03:02:35.271 --> 03:02:43.340
foggy, you just stay there. And so you might
spend all day in the airport. So we are at

03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:52.740
the airport one time, I forget where and this
guy walks up to me: �You kind of tall!�

03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:58.220
�A very astute observation.� �You a
basketball player?� I said no. So about

03:02:58.220 --> 03:03:02.021
five, six guys come up to me and they ask
me the same question: �You a basketball

03:03:02.021 --> 03:03:07.790
player?� I said no. So Havlicek was there
watching this and he said to me,

03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:13.761
�How come you say you�re not a basketball
player?� I said, �John, that�s what

03:03:13.761 --> 03:03:21.820
I do. That�s not what I am. I am a man that
works at professional basketball.�

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:36.470
See the misnomer is everybody says, �play�
when you�ve long since finished playing.

03:03:36.470 --> 03:03:43.510
The closest we came to playing, was at the
Celtics we had a motto: �Play like children

03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:51.090
without being childish.�
TB: Was that your motto, or Red�s?

03:03:51.090 --> 03:04:03.090
WR: It was just in the air around there. We
took it. And the way we won all those championships

03:04:03.090 --> 03:04:15.450
was we knew how to play. Now that sounds odd.
Everybody knows how to play. But everybody

03:04:15.450 --> 03:04:25.894
does not have the total team concept. When
I was at my best at the Celtics, I could run

03:04:25.894 --> 03:04:34.230
all my plays from all five positions. Point
guard, shooting guard, small forward, big

03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:41.070
forward, post. I could run the plays of all
those positions. Not, that I wanted to run

03:04:41.070 --> 03:04:51.010
the plays but if one of my friends was having
a problem I could understand it and know how

03:04:51.010 --> 03:04:59.830
to help. And you know where help comes from
and how it comes.

03:04:59.830 --> 03:05:08.790
TB: So, finally: have you been back to Monroe
any time? We talked about your mother�

03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:20.930
WR: No. If I go [3:05:00] there it will be
under duress. It�s like this, Taylor. I

03:05:20.930 --> 03:05:38.030
started my life in Monroe. And the white people
in Monroe were really mean to me and my family.

03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:47.881
Told my grandfather � I mean, not just,
well, but they were actually mean. Like this

03:05:47.881 --> 03:05:58.410
one time this under-sheriff, or deputy sheriff.
My mother very proudly bought her a riding

03:05:58.410 --> 03:06:05.431
habit, you know the little jacket and the
pants with the flare, and the boots. And this

03:06:05.431 --> 03:06:08.920
sheriff, this under-sheriff, walked up to
her and said, �You get off the street with

03:06:08.920 --> 03:06:12.480
those new outfits on. You can�t dress like
no white woman. What�s wrong with you? If

03:06:12.480 --> 03:06:21.611
I ever see you like that again I�m going
to put you into the jail.� Scared her so

03:06:21.611 --> 03:06:30.470
bad, she probably shook for two or three days.
Well, I don�t feel like � will I go back

03:06:30.470 --> 03:06:41.740
to my old hometown? No, that does not make
sense to me. And so I don�t go to Monroe

03:06:41.740 --> 03:06:51.700
unless, see, after my mother died. I took
my boys there once and I think that�s the

03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:59.121
only time I�ve been there.
TB: You said you thought you might go visit

03:06:59.121 --> 03:07:01.620
her grave sometime. You�ve never done that?
WR: What�s that?

03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:04.260
TB: Didn�t you say you might go visit her
grave sometime?

03:07:04.260 --> 03:07:10.811
WR: Yeah. You know what? I would not know
how to find it.

03:07:10.811 --> 03:07:18.340
TB: Well, she gave you an awful good start.
WR: Yes she did and I really appreciate it.

03:07:18.340 --> 03:07:25.870
But I just don't get to that part of the country
any more.

03:07:25.870 --> 03:07:35.450
TB: Alright, I think we�re done. Do you
guys have any questions? I think we�re good,

03:07:35.450 --> 03:07:40.430
Bill. Thanks a lot.
Recording ends at 3:07:24.7

03:07:40.430 --> 03:07:42.710
END OF INTERVIEW
