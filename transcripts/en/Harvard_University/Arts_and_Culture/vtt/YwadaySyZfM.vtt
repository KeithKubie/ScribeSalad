00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.130
well i'm delighted to share with you know
that this is really a historic event for us

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.170
I'm Vera Ingrid grant and i am the executive director
of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.199
at Harvard university

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.369
the project

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.789
is like nothing else i've seen

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.390
and uh i am what you call a novice scholar
in this field but i've been studying this for

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.800
over fifteen years myself

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.550
the program actually began

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.790
what we call the image of the black in western
art

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.240
with Dominic danielle she wanted to bring
in some influences from Euroup specifically

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.639
images of blacks

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.670
in european paintings sculpture art and
architecture

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.280
that she felt represented people of color
in a much more positive way

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.090
she published seven volumes and then went
from pre Egyptian time all the way up  

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.610
world war one 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.120
this one century that was missing

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.890
and that was the eighteenth century that dealt
with the expansion of slavery

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.750
and the further development of colonialism

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770
in nineteen uh ninety four

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.950
the mineola foundation

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.900
decided to transfer the project

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.820
to harvard university under the Du Bois institute
with Henry louis Gates

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.010
to go back

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.540
through time and to take  these images
out and put them in the context of European

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.470
art thats been study for centuries and look
at how they were interactions with people

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.290
from Africa all throughout that history
i think this is something new that many

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.470
people don't know about them haven't shared

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.490
so this is important work that i think that
we want to share with everyone today

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.490
white black hispanic asian and all of the people
that make up united states and beyond

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.680
who tragedy people who have experienced

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.319
wonderful things in their lives

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.340
i think will be enriched by understanding
these images and stories behind them
