Hey guys welcome back

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.889
Thanks for joining us today on the king of random. The crossbow is a weapon and tool that dates back

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.649
Thousands of years and has been used for hunting and warfare.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.099
It has great range a lot of power and often takes less training to learn to use wealth and other types of bows. The purpose

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.019
of today's video is to learn how we can build our own crossbow using a 2x4 some PVC and some paracord

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.449
We also have a couple of wooden dowels and a small piece of 3/4 inch plywood. In this video,

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:24.949
We'll be using two by four PVC and paracord to build the body and bow of our crossbow.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.259
In our next video, we'll cover how to build the trigger mechanism and the arrows. Let's get started as a first step

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
Let's measure 2 feet from our 2x4 and cut it off with the chop saw. Well. I've got my chops

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.079
I'll I'm also gonna cut off two pieces of my 3/4 inch schedule 40 PVC

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.619
One piece will be 30 inches long and one piece will be about 1 foot long

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.399
With these pieces cut there are some more details that I need to add to the body of our crossbow,

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.139
so it's not just a block of 2x4. I'm going to draw those out with a sharpie and then cut them out with a bandsaw

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.769
This is going to be the front of the crossbow and this will be the back.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.159
This notch up the front is where our bow will sit

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.019
Resting against the body of the crossbow. This piece that I'm removing is to create a handhold right here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.459
Where it can hold on to the front of the crossbow this larger piece is being removed for two purposes.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.679
First it makes the crossbow a lot lighter. Second, we'll have our trigger mechanism on this part of the crossbow

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.569
There we go. We've got the basic shape of the body of the crossbow.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.040
Now, I'm going to use the belt sander really quick and take down a lot of the sharp edges and plane out the top of it

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040
so it's a little bit flatter and smoother.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.770
The body of the crossbow is cut out. It's sanded, it's smooth, and comfortable to hold now. Let's move on to making the bows

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.330
Clearly to start out with our PVC pipe is round and we want it flat so what we're gonna

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.940
do is we're gonna take our heat gun we're gonna heat up the pipe

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.979
And then we're gonna smash it flat using our vise

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.179
Now the clamps of the vise are not as tall as the PVC pipe and it has this knurled texture

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.410
Which helps you get a lot better grip

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.869
But we don't want that texture smashing into our PVC so what I've done is I've thrown together a couple of blocks

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.039
Using two by four and just glued a couple of scraps of wood onto the top

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.800
these fit nicely in the vise and I can fit the PVC pipe between them and smash it there

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.110
That gives me a much larger surface area

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.180
And it's a lot smoother than the gripping services of the vise.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.600
Now with our heat gun, we want to heat up the PVC pipe four or five inches of length at once we want to make sure we keep the heat gun

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.779
moving and the pipe rotating so that we don't burn it in any one spot

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.140
With your PVC heated up we want to sandwich it between the two blocks.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.309
I'm just going to smash this down until I can't really smash it any farther.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.990
Now the PVC is somewhat elastic so if we were to unclamp it right now

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.160
We can see that it will start springing back to its shape and that's not what we want

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.969
We want it to stay flattened the whole time so what we need to do is leave

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.929
it clamped as it cools down if it cools down while it's in the clamps

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.970
It will hold its flattened shape while this portion is cooling down. We're going to warm up the next four or five inches

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.489
As you heat up the next length of the PVC be sure you support it at the back so that it doesn't sag down

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.720
When the PVC is warm it could even tear if you let it sag too much

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.370
All right

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.850
Got some good squishiness flexibility.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.390
Let's loosen our clamps

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.809
I'm just gonna kind of push it through you can see it's kind of getting squished on its way through and I'm not going to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.640
Push it all the way through so that the already flattened portion is completely out of the clamp

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.359
I want to sort of use that to make sure I don't end up twisting as I go

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.200
If I use this as a guide it will all stay flat in the same plane

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.248
It starts taking longer the farther down you go because the wood blocks themselves

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.379
Get pretty hot and PVC really needs to cool down while it's sandwiched in between them

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:58.069
Which is harder for it to do when the wood itself is not cool

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.478
you can see here that I got a little bit of a bend in the bow and I want to take that out because I

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.538
want it to be a little straighter, so I'm gonna try reheating this portion just

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.379
Bending this end part down a little bit. We'll see how this goes

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.879
It is letting it Bend now, although it's also

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.819
Puffing back up kind of taking on more of its tube shape again, which is not really what I wanted

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.969
I'm gonna help it stay flat. I'm just gonna sandwich it between a couple boards here. It's a waiting game now

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.830
There we go we've got

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.499
The first piece of flattened PVC which will turn into the main bow on our crossbow?

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.379
Now let's do the same thing to our one foot piece

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.770
While our smaller bow is cooling down in the clamp

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.379
We're gonna work on shaping the main bow for our crossbow

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.830
The first step is we're going to try and heat up this piece of flattened PVC

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.570
About 2/3 of the whole bow here in the middle. We'll leave the ends cool the way they are for now

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.520
Similar to when we tried to adjust the curve in the bow before

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.959
it's likely that some parts of the PVC will start to split apart and

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.979
Lose the flattened shape that we've given it as we add the curve. Hopefully the pressure of bending it will flatten it back out

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.770
So you know we're doing I'm gonna try and add just a gentle curve into the whole bow

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.260
Don't want it to be too extreme. We don't need any sharp angles or anything

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.070
And I'll give this a few minutes to cool off and hold its shape

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.830
Now we have a nice curve in the PVC which is going to become our primary bow but to give it a little more strength

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.689
We're going to try and add a little bit of recurve on either end this will make it so as the bow is pulled down

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.390
It not only has to bend on one side, but it has to straighten out the edges this will give us a lot more power

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.390
That feels fairly flexible

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.510
You can see it started to sort of balloon out. I think as I wrap it around the fire extinguisher

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.510
It will just smoosh it back down pretty well

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.629
Down enough to hold its shape do the same thing on the other side

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.409
All right there we have it there's our primary bow

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.369
It's a good curve in the main body of it, and then some recurve on the ends

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.129
This second piece of PVC is actually going to be a second bow that goes on our cross foot

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.899
This piece of PVC with its curved and recurved ends will give us a fair amount of force

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.230
but it is still PVC and traditional crossbows would use either a

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.709
laminated wooden bow or a metal boat to give it extra strength

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.660
Since PVC isn't as strong as either of those there's going to be a secondary bow on top of the first one

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.830
curving in the opposite direction a

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.620
Second string will connect from one

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.520
End of the large bow over the smaller bow and then back down to the other side

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.230
So the same way we did with our large bow we're now going to heat this up and add a gentle curve to it

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.210
All right

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.210
Add a slight curve into this

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.940
Some of you may recognize our original backyard foundry. I'm just gonna use this as a curved surface

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.640
to wrap this bow around

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.349
Here we go we've now got our two separate bows

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.170
And we need to attach these to the top of our crossbow in order to find out the exact center of the bow I'm gonna

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.789
Put it on this stick and try and get it to point where it's perfectly balanced. It'll mark that point

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.189
Let's take our larger bow and line it up on our two-by-four body

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.929
And we're gonna want to pre-drill a couple of holes that go through the bow and into the wooden body

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.640
The large bow will go right here where we've just drilled it out

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.669
The small bow will face the other way so they curve in opposite directions

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.319
With these two bows set up the way that we want them we're going to drill through the holes that we already put in our

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.030
Larger bow and down through the smaller bow to make sure the holes all line up exactly where we want them

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.579
With our screws driven just slightly through the two bows we can now align the two screws with our

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.799
Pre-drilled holes on the body of the crossbow

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.269
Those fit pretty well, let's temporarily remove the screws in the bows and then make our modifications before we reattach them

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.459
On the larger bow we need to add notches to allow for the connection of our bowstring

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.120
For decorative purposes, I'm also going to cut off the very edges of the bow at an angle

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.990
There we have it that should work great

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.649
Our smaller boat doesn't need to be cut in the same way to hold the drawstring

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.259
But we are going to sand some grooves into both sides

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.190
So that as a drawstring passes over it it will stay centered the way, it's supposed to

00:10:08.739 --> 00:10:12.929
With the modifications complete on both bows let's reattach it onto the body of the crossbow

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.859
The bows are complete they're added to the body, let's try adding some bowstring here. I've got some paracord

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.419
I'm going to tie a loop in one end measure out the correct length and then tie a loop in the other end

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.820
you need to be sure that the loop and your knot is large enough that it can fit over the knots you've cut into your

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.550
bow

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.120
Now we also want to make sure that when our bow is strung

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.279
There's already a little bit of tension on the bow

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.930
So I'm going to pull slightly on the bowstring if you can see that the bow starts to give a little bit

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.589
That's the length we want the paracord to be where we add the other loop

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:53.059
Cut myself off plenty of extra here if you keep your knot nice and loose you can easily adjust it as you measure

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.549
That looks like pretty good spot make sure that I've got enough loop fit around the notches

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:06.559
There we go it's under a little bit of tension we can see it if I draw it back

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:11.959
It Springs forward, so I think that is a good length of bowstring right there now

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:16.939
I'm just gonna cut off the excess here, and then I'll fuse the end of the paracord using a lighter

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.419
Now like I said this has some spring to it

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.490
But not as much as we want so we're going to add another string that goes from this end of the bow

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.500
Up on top of the second bow and then connects again to the notch on the other side

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.529
Take our paracord make sure our end is sealed off

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.700
Start with another bowline knot

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.130
slip that over the notch on one side

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.700
And you measure going across the top

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.520
down to the other side

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:50.059
Now I haven't tied it off yet, but if I just wrap it around a couple times

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.829
You can already see that now when I pull on it this cord going along the top is

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.310
forcing the second bow to

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:02.239
flatten out which adds a lot more tension into our crossbow now we want to tie another loop in the end of this piece of

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.810
Paracord so that it's quite snug as it wraps around this knot

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:10.578
To make it a little bit easier to attach the second string you can put it on the notch

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.149
Without it being over the bow and then stretch it over one side at a time

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.519
There you have it

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.739
that's how you can build your very own crossbow using a

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:24.469
Two-by-four for the body some PVC piping for the bow and some paracord for the strings like I said in our next video

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.000
We'll go over how to build the trigger mechanisms and the arrows that used thanks for joining us for this video

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.239
And we look forward to teaching you how to finish your crossbow in the next one talk to you then

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.500
That is toasty holding on to that little part in between the blocks. I'm sure it's still very one
