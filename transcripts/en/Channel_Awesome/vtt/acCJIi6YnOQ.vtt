00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.040
And perhaps you remember the review of the Cloverfield trailer that I did last summer.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.680
I mean, what could it be?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.180
Is it Donkey Kong?

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.080
My money's on Donkey Kong!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.060
Maybe it's Jesus!

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.160
Maybe it's a giant robotic Donkey Kong Jesus riding a puff of smoke!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.360
Hahahaha, hilarious.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.240
Well, January 18th has finally hit, and I feel it only necessary to talk about the film that I ironically helped promote.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.660
So, what is it that's terrifying all of New York in the middle of the night? Well, I'll tell you what it is:

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.320
A monster.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.820
Just... a monster.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.400
Not Donkey Kong or the Second Coming, it's just... a monster.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.480
It's not even a famous monster, like Godzilla or Rodan or anything, it's just... a monster.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.760
No twists, no backstory, no surprises.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.240
Just a monster.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.280
BULLSHIT!!!

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.040
All that buildup, all this time, all that effort, just for a fucking MONSTER?!

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.640
Suck my dick!

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.540
If I wanted to see monsters, I'd go to the DMV to get my license renewed!

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.140
But hell, you don't care about what it is. All you wanna know is, is it a good movie?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.900
Well, let me tell you something.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.580
THIS.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.320
FILM.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.980
WAS.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.460
OKAY.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.040
Just... okay. I mean, not good, not bad, it's just... okay.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.780
How was the monster? It's okay.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.480
How's the acting? It's okay.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.280
How're the special effects? It's all okay!

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.960
It's like a giant, flaming nuclear ball of adequacy!

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.680
So if you like shaky cameras and monsters going "BLEHH!", chances are you're gonna like Cloverfield.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.680
In fact, I could probably just reenact the movie for you right now just using my handheld camera.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.660
In fact, that's not a bad idea. Hold on...

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
*fetus Bum voice*
OH MY GOD, THERE'S A GIANT MONSTER OUTSIDE!

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.200
Things are blowing up, and I can't hold the camera straight!

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.840
I was just at a party where only the most beautiful people in New York could show up, and all of a sudden, all this stuff is happening!

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.140
Look outside—OOOH, LOOK OUTSIDE! Someone took the head of the Statue of Liberty!

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.220
Who would do that?! Who would do that?! A MONSTERRRRR!!

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.200
Oh my God, there it is! It's so big and horrible!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.480
It's-it's kind of hard to explain what it looks like, I guess you'll just have to pay the eight bucks to see it in the movie theater!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.460
That's, uh, that's actually kind of ingenious!

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.040
I'm just gonna shake the camera and, uh, scream some more!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.060
AHHYAHBAHCHABLACHABLOOCHYPLOOCHYPLACHA!!!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.220
Now I'm gonna take a minute, uh, to have a dramatic moment!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.320
*sobbing*
Oh, man... It's all gone... It's all gone....

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.700
OKAY, MOMENT OVER!

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.480
SCREAMING AND YELLING! SCREAMING AND YELLING! AH! AH!

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.260
Oh my God, the big monster's actually spitting out little monsters!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.800
OH MY GOD! One bite to you, and your head actually EXPLODES!!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.760
...ACTUALLY, THAT'S PRETTY COOL!

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.420
Oh my God, they killed the monster! They actually killed it! They destroyed it in the city! HALLELU—

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.480
—oh wait, no they didn't.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.180
AAAAAAHHHHH!

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.120
Oh my God, the monster is about to eat me! Don't eat me, Mr. Monster!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.620
AH! AH! AAAAAAHHHHHH!

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.960
*splort*
Oh my God, he spat me out! He spat me—

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.400
OH MY GOD! He spat me onto the Island from Lost!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400
Locke! Locke, did you see the giant monster? He was so CREEPY!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.100
Hey, is that guy from Lord of the Rings really dead?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.980
I liked that guy! He was COOOL!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.460
And that's pretty much the movie... well, except for that last part. That-that may not have happened.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.320
But you get my drift. It's pretty much just a monster movie, nothing else.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.920
If you like monster movies, you'll probably like Cloverfield.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.000
But wait a minute! What about the title?

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.660
[VO]
In my last review, I said that Cloverfield was merely the code word for the movie and not the actual title.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.340
But then they suddenly started advertising it as Cloverfield! So what the hell?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.400
Well, according to them, the "video" that documented all this was code-named Cloverfield, so that "technically" the movie doesn't have a name.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.580
Just like I'm "technically" not gonna fork over eight more bucks to "technically" see this film again.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.880
Screw you, Mr. Abrams!

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.340
You and your... adequate filmmaking!

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.260
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it because it's... adequate!

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.120
*Donkey Kong game theme*
