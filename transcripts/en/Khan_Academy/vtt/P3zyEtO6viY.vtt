00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.980
I don't think we can do enough
videos on why raising something

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.050
to a negative exponent
is equivalent to 1

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.390
over that base raised to
the positive exponent,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.310
I should say.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.200
And to get more intuition
about why this makes sense,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.940
I look at different
powers of 2, and then

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.100
think about what makes sense
as we go to exponents below 0,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.150
integer exponents below 0.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.470
So let's start with
2 to the third power.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.120
Well, 2 to the third
power is 2 times

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.250
2 times 2, which of
course is equal to 8.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.120
Now what about 2 to
the second power?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.100
Well that's going to
be 2 times 2, which

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.240
is of course equal to 4.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.953
And to go from 2
to the third to 2

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:52.850
to the second power,
what happened here?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.320
Well, we divided by 2.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.060
Now, let's keep going.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.570
What about 2 to the first power?

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.570
Well, that's just
2, and once again,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.730
to go from 2 squared to 2 to the
first power, we divided by 2.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.985
Now things are going
to get interesting.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:13.470
2 to the 0-th power,
and actually this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.300
will help to build the
intuition of why it's something

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.710
nonzero to the 0-th
power is defined to be 1.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.970
Well, so far, every time we
decremented the exponent by 1,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.630
we essentially divided by 2,
so we should divide by 2 again.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.559
So if we divide by
2 again, we get 1.

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:32.975
And this is part
of the motivation

00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:36.730
of why 2 to the 0 power
should be equal to 1.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.740
But let's keep going.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.600
What should 2 to
the negative 1 power

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.860
be, if we want to be
consistent about continuing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530
to divide by 2?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
Well, we divide by
2 again, and so this

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.320
is going to be equal to 1/2.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.690
Notice, 2 to the
negative 1 is 1/2.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.040
2 to the 1 is equal to 1.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.480
This is equal to the
reciprocal of this.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.320
Let's keep going.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.940
This is fun.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.290
So what should 2 to the
negative 2 power be?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.949
Well, we should
divide by 2 again.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.130
Divide by 2 again,
you get to 1/4.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.530
I think you see the pattern.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.080
2 to the negative 3 power, well
we should divide by 2 again.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.370
And we get to 1/8, which
is the reciprocal of 2

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.110
to the third power.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170
So once again,
another way to think

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.010
about why negative exponents
are about taking reciprocals.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.730
Taking something to the negative
exponent is equivalent to 1

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.063
over taking that same base
to the positive exponent.
