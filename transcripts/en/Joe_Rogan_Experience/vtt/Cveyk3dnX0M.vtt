00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.350
The Joe Rogan experience.
Are you from military background?
My Dad,
yeah.

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.070
My Dad was,
so that's what my parents met.
My Dad was stationed in Germany.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.470
My mom was fleeing Thailand,
um,
to,

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.700
uh,
her,
her first husband was like physically abusive to her,

5
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.170
so she was leaving Thailand and she came to Germany to find her a Gi and then

6
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:27.730
found my dad to find a Gi specifically.
Well,
you know,

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.640
I think she was coming to get away,
but you know,
she wanted to,

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.150
she wanted a better life for her son at the time.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.750
And my dad was in the hospital and so my mom was taking care of them and cooking

10
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.150
them food and made him fall in love.
There you go.
It,

11
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:47.500
my dad always jokes,
he says,
he tells us a story all the time.
He's like,
yeah,

12
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.090
your mom was taking care of me.

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
And then she told me that you were pregnant and then 12 months later you were

14
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:58.780
born.
Oh,
that's funny.
So,

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.580
but now they fell in love.

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 1>It was just a really long pregnancy.
This weird,
just kind of weird.</v>

17
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:06.884
I don't know why.
Yeah.

18
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.250
<v 0>12 months.
I don't know</v>

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.280
<v 1>what a character,
Redd Foxx,
Edwin,
he wouldn't pay his taxes.</v>

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.130
So the government came down one night when he,

21
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.330
all the people in the room just took everything,
everything,
went to his house,

22
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:23.260
took everything.
He took a ring off his finger and he took his shoes.

23
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.240
They took it and never,

24
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.510
never my chicken raw to cook in the oven.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.033
And so he,

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.090
they shut him down is the place he had I think don't Los Anica somewhere.

27
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.000
It was in la and la yet.
Um,
so he crying.
Oh God.

28
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.650
He called Sammy Davis.
He Call Sandy called Frank Sinatra.

29
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:46.530
And he [inaudible] took everyday now own.
I worked so hard to be who I am.
I am.

30
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.890
I am doing.
I just,
I only texted anything that bad that they took everything.

31
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.970
So Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis junior and some other other friends,

32
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.140
uh,
went to his club and work two or three weeks every night.

33
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.990
Two shows,
sold them out to get enough money to pay,

34
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.190
get his taxes and get his club back.
[inaudible] he was so happy to everybody's,

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.810
Oh my God.
I want to thank you for doing with this for me.
Oh,

36
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:18.270
please just take my dick,
my,
my,
my hood.
Let me just hug you.
Hugging everybody.

37
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.050
So they all went on our separate ways with Fox.

38
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.920
Still in pays fucking Texas.
No,
I come again with lean on his A's.

39
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.180
You son of a bitch.
You do.
They want [inaudible] name.
But I coming back now,
see,

40
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.550
oh my God,
we'll pay taxes again.
He paid no taxes.

41
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.350
Was this before or after Sanford and son?
It was before.
And I bet,

42
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.340
I don't think he paid after San Fran.
He believed it paid on Texas.
My money

43
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.940
pay my taxes.
I mean,
you don't cater to your craft and maintaining it is,

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.440
there's an art to that,
right?

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.680
Because you worked so freaking hard to get to where you're at and then get there

46
00:02:59.681 --> 00:02:59.980
and it's

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 2>like,
oh fuck,
what do I do?
Like there's no rest.
There's no rest.</v>

48
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:08.170
And everything that was acceptable before becomes unacceptable because now

49
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:12.730
you're up here.
Uh,
you know what I mean?
So it's like,
yeah,
you have to,

50
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.050
you have to,
you have to pick your shots.
And like,
you know what I'm saying?

51
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.240
Can't really like,
just go crazy like you did back in the day.

52
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.790
So there's an art to it,
you know what I mean?

53
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.500
And that's how you really maintain and stay in that spot and even level up.

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.630
So do you consciously think,
okay,

55
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.580
a balance out enjoyment with things that I have to do to stay disciplined?

56
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.170
100% yeah,
100% that's a very smart way of looking at it.
Yeah.
Yup.

57
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.700
100% like those,

58
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.660
there has to be a balance of each because it's like,
all right,

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.400
now I'm at this new level,

60
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.170
like whether I want to behave like this or not.
I put myself here,

61
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.050
I worked hard,
now I'm with these elite motherfuckers.
So this is the,

62
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.660
this is how I have to act because I'm not down here anymore.

63
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.340
I worked from here to get here.
So what happens?
You balanced,

64
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.870
you put things into place,

65
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.830
you do a little bit of this and a little bit in that instead of a lot of that,

66
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.820
you know what I mean?

67
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.070
And you just pick your shots and it's like you're going to get everything in the

68
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.880
end.
This is how it's just planning how it's supposed to be,

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.570
but you just piece it together just a little bit differently.

70
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.390
Like I just turned 31 walk down.

71
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.060
I'm about to be 32 as young too.

72
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.430
A lot of people that's old to some people as well,

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.840
but for me it's like this a whole new mind state,
you know what I mean?

74
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.580
And I feel like through my twenties I was actually like a fucking teenager and

75
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.840
like now I'm an adult.
So now I look at things a little bit differently.

76
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:45.580
It's like,
Yo,
I was really a kid.

77
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.210
This is how you behave as an adult for the rest of your life.

78
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.980
And it still involves a whole bunch of partying and having fun,

79
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.120
but the business gets handled and things get approached totally differently.

80
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.310
That's a balanced way of looking at it,
man.
I love it and enjoy it.

81
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.970
That's how they think too.
Like people have to understand too,

82
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.270
to be someone like you,

83
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.330
to be a very successful rapper and to not expect you to live the way you talk

84
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.470
about all the time.
It's so ridiculous.
Right,
right,
right,
right.

85
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.680
Like you don't think he wants to party.
He's talking about party all the time.

86
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.700
I think he wants to party [inaudible] party.
This is just an act.

87
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.870
It's weird,
right?
It's crazy as fuck because people,

88
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.370
they want you to be you.
They want me to be myself.
Right.
They want to party.

89
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:43.360
They want to take shots,
they want to smoke weed.
They want to stay up all night.

90
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.360
Yeah.
Why is that bad?
It's not so many people want to do it,

91
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.820
but it gives us a image in some people's minds like frivolous life.
Mm.

92
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.770
Frivolous thinking,
partying.
What are you doing?
Drinking and smoking.

93
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.590
What are you enjoying yourself?

94
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.150
And then they come around and do the same thing cause they want it.

95
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.660
It's like I have like a weird place in life where I think I'm like the key to a

96
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:12.770
lot of shit because it's like if you want to enjoy yourself,

97
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.680
I'm a guy.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
aw man,

98
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.990
I'm just fucking going to live through wisdom where it shows up.

99
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.621
He's going to light.

100
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.460
The joint is going to be amazing if you want to fucking be professional,

101
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.470
like especially in what I do,

102
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.940
because there's a whole lot of rappers who like aren't business,

103
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.060
you know what I mean?
They're not thinking like that.

104
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.700
So for those guys,
I'm their guy.
Like they're they,

105
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:38.330
they look at me like where's has his shit together?

106
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:43.160
Like he really handles his business.
He talks to people,
he shows up,
he does this,

107
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.970
he does that.
So to be the party guy and the business guy,

108
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.750
it's like amazing.
You know what I mean?
It's a,

109
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:55.430
it's a lane that I kind of car for myself,
but it's me in real life.

110
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.293
So it's like,

111
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.020
that's the only thing I have to do is really just completely be myself.

112
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.040
Just be 100 fucking show up.
Do my business thing.
Tell people,

113
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.150
do the right thing and fucking light to join.

114
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.970
[inaudible] that's it.
It's a crazy business,

115
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.600
sir.
I'm,
I'm good.
I'm straight like that.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Yup.

116
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.310
People listening to this are probably,
wow.

117
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.470
He could beat yourself or a living for a show bros.
Blessing.
It's a blessing.

118
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.050
<v 3>We were at you ever,
you ever do a podcast and the above,
the comedy cellar,</v>

119
00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:28.820
they've got a studio up there.
Bobby Kelly started it and it's a,

120
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.020
I forget what it's called.
And um,

121
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.290
so I'm up there doing my podcast with Ari and it's an apartment.

122
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.710
It's like there's a,
there's a bedroom and a bathroom and in the studio,

123
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.770
and we got to talking about torture.
And I go,
uh,
I go,

124
00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:48.630
you ever been waterboarded?
He's like,
no,
I go,
this is a bathroom right here.

125
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:53.130
I go,
you want it?
You want me to waterboard you?
And you know Ari's like,
Yep,
sure,

126
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.503
sure,
let's do it.

127
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.620
So we go inside and I put a towel over his face and he leans over backwards in

128
00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:00.900
his head is below his body in the shower stall,

129
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.890
the nozzle comes off the wall and I spray down his face and,
uh,

130
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.930
nothing,
nothing,
nothing.
And then all of a sudden his bodies convulsing,

131
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:14.040
his legs are kicking,
he's fucking screaming,
water is shooting out of his nose.

132
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.390
He's choking.

133
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.920
And it went on for like a couple of minutes and I'm fucking dying.

134
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:24.390
And then he starts laughing and we were just on the podcast laughing without

135
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:27.670
saying a word for probably five minutes.
And then he goes,
well,

136
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.970
I'm going to do it to you.
I'm like,
fuck yeah.

137
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.230
And then he waterboarded me in the same thing happened.
Wow.
Yeah.

138
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.970
Blow waterboarding's legit.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You can't,

139
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.620
that's real torture.
