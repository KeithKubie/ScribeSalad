00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.810
Okay, Michael so I have written out biased on upon your rather impressive way

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.430
of thinking about it. All the possible

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.870
strategies for a. And all the possible strategies

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.970
for b. A, can go left, left, left right, right left, right, right. For states

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.060
one and four respectively. And b can go Left right, middle right or right right.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; Right. In particular, three in stage

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.310
three we can only go R. Which makes me a?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.280
&gt;&gt; Conservative?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.200
&gt;&gt; A pirate.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.690
&gt;&gt; Oh. That makes more sense.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.200
&gt;&gt; It does make more sense. Okay. So,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.680
now why did I write it this way Michael?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.150
Well, I wrote it this way because if I write it this way with all the choices,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.750
all the strategies that b has up here and all the strategies that a have here. I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.240
actually form a matrix. And I can put in each of cells of the matrix the value

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.000
of taking a particular from a and a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.680
particular strategy from b. Does that make sense?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very clever.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is very clever. I'm very happy that I came

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.900
up with it entirely on my own. Okay, so let's start filling

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.060
in these numbers. Or, instead of filling in the numbers ourselves, we

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.160
could ask the students to do it by making it a quiz.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.540
&gt;&gt; Nice, I see.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.970
&gt;&gt; Shall we do that?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.510
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.350
doesn't seem very hard.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's make certain everyone here understands

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.570
and what exactly we're asking you to do. We're saying

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.510
that if for example A takes this first strategy

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.160
go left and stay one and left and stayed four.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.860
And B takes it's first strategy which is go

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.760
left and stay two and right and stayed three. What

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.160
is the value for A that will result? So, let's

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.720
actually do the first one as an example and ask

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.070
everyone to do the rest of them. That seem fair?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was going to suggest too.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.450
&gt;&gt; Okay, good. So let's see. If A chooses to go left in state one, since A

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.090
goes first, we'll end up in state 2, right? And then in this first strategy. B

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.230
goes left in state two, which means we will end up going down this path and the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.160
value there is plus seven. So seven is in fact the value of this game with

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.060
respect to A. Now we know that because this

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.770
is a two player zero sum finite deterministic game

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.940
of perfect information. That if a gets a value

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.640
of seven, b gets a value of minus seven. So

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.710
we could write minus seven here, seven comma minus

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.010
seven here. But since we know that it's equal

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.460
and opposite let's just write down the value for

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.870
a. Okay? Just for compactness-sake. That seem fair to you?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So with that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830
in mind, let's see if we can fill out

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.410
the rest of this table. Think you can do it?

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.060
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.690
&gt;&gt; Okay. Then.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.990
&gt;&gt; Can you give me a place to write everything?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.490
&gt;&gt; It will magically appear. Go.
