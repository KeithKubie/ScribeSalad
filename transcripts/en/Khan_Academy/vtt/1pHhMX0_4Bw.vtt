00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.250
A parallelogram is a blank with
two sets of parallel lines.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.280
So let's see what
the options are.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.880
So one option is
a quadrilateral.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.405
And a parallelogram is
definitely a quadrilateral.

00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:16.120
A quadrilateral is
a four-sided figure,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.350
and it is definitely
a four-sided figure.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.970
A parallelogram is
not always a rhombus.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.830
A rhombus is a special case of a
parallelogram where not only do

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.680
you have to sets
of parallel lines

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.560
as your sides, two
sets of parallel sides,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.410
but all of the sides are the
same length in a rhombus.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.610
And a square is a special
case of a rhombus where

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.400
all of the angles
are 90 degrees.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.450
So here, all we can say
is that a parallelogram

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.080
is a quadrilateral.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.330
And so let's check our answer.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.244
And it's always a good
idea to look at hints.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:49.660
And so it'll kind of say the
same thing that we just said,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.576
but it would say it for
the particular problem

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:53.240
that you're actually looking at.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.120
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.200
Suzanne is on an expedition
to save the universe.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.320
Sounds like a reasonable
expedition to go on.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.130
For her final challenge,
she has to play

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.800
a game called Find
the Rhombuses.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.310
A wizard tells her that she
has a square, a quadrilateral,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.410
and a parallelogram,
and she must

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.220
identify which of the
shapes are also rhombuses.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.580
Which of these shapes should
she pick to save the universe?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.850
So a square is a special
case of a rhombus.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.626
Just to remind ourselves, a
rhombus, the opposite sides

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:29.750
are parallel to each other.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.650
You have two sets
of parallel sides.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.140
A square has two sets
of parallel sides,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.650
and it has the extra condition
that all of the angles

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.900
are right angles.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.120
So a square is definitely
going to be a rhombus.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.240
Now, all rhombuses
have four sides.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.930
So all rhombuses
are quadrilaterals.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.830
But not all quadrilaterals
are rhombuses.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.080
You could have a quadrilateral
where none of the sides

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.770
are parallel to each other.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.380
So we won't click this one.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.600
Once again, a parallelogram.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.370
So all rhombuses
are parallelograms.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.000
They have two sets
of parallel sides,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.620
two sets of parallel
line segments

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.020
representing their sides.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.911
But all parallelograms
are not rhombuses.

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.910
So I would say that if
someone gives you square,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.400
you can say, look, a square is
always going to be a rhombus.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.170
A quadrilateral isn't always
going to be a rhombus,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.210
nor is a parallelogram
always going to be a rhombus.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.108
We got it right.
