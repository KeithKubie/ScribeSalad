up an eroding embankment stories to do

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
up an eroding embankment stories to do
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.660
up an eroding embankment stories to do
with the environment are often tricky

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
with the environment are often tricky
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240
with the environment are often tricky
because they can be very hard to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
because they can be very hard to
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300
because they can be very hard to
visualize change is happening you might

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
visualize change is happening you might
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830
visualize change is happening you might
not see them from one week to the next

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
not see them from one week to the next
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020
not see them from one week to the next
but it's something that will have a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
but it's something that will have a
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.090
but it's something that will have a
great impact of several billion people

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
great impact of several billion people
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.320
great impact of several billion people
so it's a great challenge but

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
so it's a great challenge but
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.729
so it's a great challenge but
nonetheless I think it's very important

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
nonetheless I think it's very important
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.500
nonetheless I think it's very important
that we use photography to talk about

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
that we use photography to talk about
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110
that we use photography to talk about
these issues
