00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.200
- A friend and colleague
of mine, Mark Lytle,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.022
was taught by John Blum and
he says Blum used to say,

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:09.704
"The only people that he
knew of who could write

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:11.712
"almost directly for galleys are Churchill

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.434
and Arthur Schlesinger."

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:16.945
He's a wonderfully fluent writer,

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.696
he's banging out 3,000 words a day.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.240
And that was actually something that made

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.470
him very politically useful, as well.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.058
Galbraith talks about how
when the two of them were

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:31.039
speechwriters for Stevenson
that again Schlesinger

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.895
was the person who would
walk into the Elk's club

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.160
as they were called, he
would take off his jacket,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.493
he would sit at his desk, light a cigar,

00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:46.806
and he would just bang
out a speech and pull

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:50.635
it out of the typewriter
and it was ready to go.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:53.832
There was this kind of
wonderful fluency about

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:55.999
the way in which he wrote.
