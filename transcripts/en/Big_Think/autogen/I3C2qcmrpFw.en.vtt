care of their loved one at home but it's
not always possible and so what we have

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
not always possible and so what we have
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.970
not always possible and so what we have
to do is balance home care

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
to do is balance home care
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.920
to do is balance home care
and institutional care and we have to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
and institutional care and we have to
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.190
and institutional care and we have to
make sure that both of them are quality

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.229
we need to work on that and I don't
think it's a necessarily a negative

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239
think it's a necessarily a negative
 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.670
think it's a necessarily a negative
thing that people have to go into

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
