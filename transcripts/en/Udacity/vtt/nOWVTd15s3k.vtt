00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.810
Next let's talk a little bit about the

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.730
implementation details of XFS. First of all, in any

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.230
Unix file system there are these i-node data structures

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.360
which give you a mapping between the file name

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.760
and the data blocks on the disk. So given a file name and the offset that you

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.810
want to get into that file, the file system

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.358
has a way of looking up a data section

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:29.840
called i-node and deciding where exactly on the disc of the data

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.700
blocks that you're looking for. This is happening in any Unix file system.
