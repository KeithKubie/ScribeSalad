00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.350
So in a normal economy
we know that employment

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.250
will drive overall demand.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.690
If we have high employment
or low unemployment,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.590
then people are going
to have more jobs,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.920
and they're going to
have higher wages,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.970
and that will have
higher demand.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.900
Or if the other way goes
around, if they lose their jobs,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.430
demand is going to go down,
wages will start to go down,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.030
and people aren't going to
have money in their pockets.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.610
So employment drives demand.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.440
And we can view the
demand-- and I'm

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.730
making a huge
simplification here--

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.670
demand will drive production.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.280
Or maybe we could
think of it as supply.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.560
It'll drive supply, and it
can also be a driver of price.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.130
And of course, there is a little
bit of a negative feedback

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.800
loop for both of these things.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.840
If the demand is high
and the price goes high,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.060
that might produce a little
bit of negative feedback

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.280
on the demand.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.090
Instead of an arrow, this line
here means negative feedback.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970
I'll put a little
negative sign here.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.860
And let's say the demand is high
and then the supply goes high.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.550
Well actually, the
supply going high

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.110
would drive the
price going down.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
So maybe I should draw a
negative feedback like here.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.000
High supply would
mean lower price.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.360
But that's not what I want
to focus on in that video.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360
And we could keep
adding more lines here.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.970
But this is roughly
simple take on it.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.820
But the general idea
is supply and price

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.800
will then drive corporate
profits, or just profits

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.300
in general, even for an
individual business owner.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.850
And then profits are
going to drive employment.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.390
Now, let's imagine a scenario.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.567
We are in a bad economy, maybe
a depression-like economy.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.400
So in that situation,
you could start really

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.590
at any point in this circle.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.100
I'll just start at employment.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.890
So let's say employment
is really low.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.640
That's going to make
demand really low.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.700
And if demand is
really low, then supply

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.550
is going to go down, and
price is going to go down.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.520
And then that's going
to make profits go down.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.400
And that's going to make
employment even lower.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.520
And so what we find ourselves
in this kind of recessionary

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.570
or depression area
environment, this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.525
would be called a
deflationary spiral.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.300
And it's a spiral
because a bad economy

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.860
is driving lower
prices, which is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.260
in turn driving a bad economy.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680
And to make matters worse, if
this continues long enough,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
or if these price declines
are severe enough,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690
you could imagine
people saying, look,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.930
I have this dollar in my pocket.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.020
I'm not going to spend
this dollar because, one, I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.570
might lose my job
at any moment, and I

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.810
know that that dollar is
becoming more powerful,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.810
that I can buy more
every minute that I wait.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.450
So as the price goes down,
so as all of this scary stuff

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.610
happens-- so the
employment is going down,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.000
profits are going down,
prices going down-- this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.150
makes people not
hoard goods the way

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.420
that they would do in
an inflationary spiral.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.670
But it makes them hoard money.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.870
And why it's ultra scary
for central bankers

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.580
or for governments
is they start to not

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.600
have as much control
over the economy.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.360
They can't just run
the printing press

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.080
and try to stimulate the
economy in this situation,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.800
because if they did people are
so conservative right now--

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.300
You could imagine
maybe a depression

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.370
is going on for years
and years and years.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.760
And let's say that they take
some type of a helicopter--

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.400
And this isn't how you actually
distribute money to the money

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.472
supply, but it's just to
show an extreme example.

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:28.930
So they take a
helicopter, and they

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.440
start dumping cash on people.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.030
They print cash, and they
start dumping it on people.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.400
So every man, woman, and child
in the country gets a $10 bill.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.784
Well, if people are really
scared and really afraid,

00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:41.450
they're just going
to take that $10 bill

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.810
and stuff it into
their mattress,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.393
and it's not going
to change anything.

00:03:44.393 --> 00:03:46.200
That dollar isn't
going to actually enter

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.290
into the money supply.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.259
The velocity on it will be 0.
