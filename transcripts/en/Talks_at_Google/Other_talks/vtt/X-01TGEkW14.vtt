TED WARNER: So
thank you so much.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.930
So I guess the question
that I am dying to ask

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.420
is, how did you find the
people who are in this?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.380
DRAPER SHREEVE:
I've been doing yoga

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.520
for about 14 years at The
Center on 13th Street, which

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.930
is kind of a crossroads
of the world, especially

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.700
for the gay community.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.160
And meeting all of
these people there,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.990
I was really struck by
the incredible diversity

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.820
of the community and the
people that go there.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.390
And it kind of
forced me to think

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.710
about what it was that I
was really interested in,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.590
and it was people.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.319
What's more interesting
than people?

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.970
And there are so many different
kinds of people that go there.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.330
And through friends that
I had there-- teachers,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.630
other people that I met--
we met friends of friends,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.490
friends of friends of
friends, and so on.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:37.830
And I started to become very
excited about a canvas, a very

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.980
large canvas that
I could create.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.440
And I was excited by
the diversity of people.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.000
And I love making
a movie where you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.870
have a state senator
and a porn director

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:03.330
and a street kid and
an 81-year-old painter.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.730
I found that exciting.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.340
So basically from there.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.475
That was kind of a
starting point, I guess.

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:09.850
TOWNES COATES:
And it really did.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.610
I mean, when I
came into it-- that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.310
was probably a year into your
doing sit-down interviews

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.810
with people.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.510
Draper had done a number of
sit-down interviews with people

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.690
from really across the spectrum.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.570
And part of that was seeing
how people were on camera.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.130
And part of that
was getting stories,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.070
seeing where people came from.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.550
And I think one of the
lovely things about this film

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.480
is that it's not
Manhattan within a very

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.320
certain prescribed boundary.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.890
It really is people from all
across, from the five boroughs,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.250
and really a remarkable
mix of people

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.060
who might not have ways
of crossing otherwise.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.770
And the people who ended
up in the final film

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.240
are truly remarkable.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.540
And there were a lot of
really remarkable people

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.720
who went through the process.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.320
But these were the
ones ultimately

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.610
that he decided to follow
in this very intimate way.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.210
And it takes a big commitment
to be in a film like this.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.150
HENRY CHALFANT: Just
doing all those interviews

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.090
was kind of like auditioning,
because you found out

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.890
the people who were really
the most giving and generous

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.160
with themselves.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.380
And I think that's who we found.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.860
It was very profound
through this process.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.740
DRAPER SHREEVE:
It was a challenge

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.410
to find a balance of
people too, I think,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.780
because we found so
many incredible people.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.960
People are still coming
up to us and saying,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.250
you know, I got this
cousin in the Bronx.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.300
Have you got everybody
for your movie yet?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.710
Because he's really,
really interesting.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.010
And we're like,
yeah, we've got it.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.220
But it was trying
to get a balance.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.423
That was difficult.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.339
TED WARNER: So I also
want to encourage people

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.097
from the audience.

00:04:20.097 --> 00:04:21.680
If you want to ask
a question, there's

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.661
microphones on either side.

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.660
HENRY CHALFANT: Jump in.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.310
TED WARNER: And yeah,
feel free to jump in.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.940
Sure.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.759
HENRY CHALFANT:
There's microphones.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.550
TED WARNER: You can
use-- well, either way.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.050
That's fine.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.190
TOWNES COATES: There's
an audience microphone.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.785
AUDIENCE: Hey,
this is wonderful.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.760
What a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.120
Thank you, Mr. Director.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.520
I sat here very moved,
because I'm 45 years old.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.990
And it is inconceivable
that a documentary exploring

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.500
identity and challenges
and personal existence as

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.370
in gayness would ever not
include AIDS in my lifetime

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.055
as a backbone.

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:04.555
Any other documentary
would have had

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:08.640
it-- we had mentioned briefly
with Tee and her sisters.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.040
But the idea that now that that
imminent threat, that bullet

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.970
to the head, is
diminished, we're

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.330
left with the same issues
of depression and suicide

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.220
and glory and
family and all that.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.130
It was just fascinating
to see that.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.030
But there are also issues
of power and identity.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.160
Did you have any struggle as
a gay white man commandeering

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.880
these stories from people
who are facing challenges,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.670
as you filmed them eating,
which is incredibly intimate?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.130
A lot of food.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.029
But did you ever since
anyone editing themselves?

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:50.320
Or maybe the opposite happened.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.054
They wanted to share,
because this was a--

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:56.359
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Well-- is this on?

00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:58.150
HENRY CHALFANT: No,
that's a different one.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.490
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Let me first say,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.750
we realized from
the very beginning

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.664
we couldn't represent everyone.

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:17.154
[LOUD FEEDBACK]

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:19.210
HENRY CHALFANT: Just go.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.310
DRAPER SHREEVE: We couldn't
represent everyone,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.560
and then we didn't really try.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.390
And then I think other
films, other documentaries,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:42.500
have explored AIDS, gay
marriage, because they're

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.340
whole worlds.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.950
AUDIENCE: My point
is, it was a relief

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.959
to see "Queer City" can
happen without the--

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.000
DRAPER SHREEVE: Without
that particular narrator.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.333
AUDIENCE: --"I have to go
take my meds, la la la la la,"

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.967
which I do daily, by the way.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:00.550
DRAPER SHREEVE: Well,
for many of us--

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.290
it was your
generation-- it's true.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.520
You thought, would we ever
not have that in our lives?

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.050
So that's part of what we
wanted to do with this project,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.150
is make a modern film
about now and about looking

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.670
into the future, thinking
about the future.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:28.030
And things are changing
very, very rapidly.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.190
Talking about the
different-- do I

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:41.640
feel as a white man-- this
whole project for all of us

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.080
was and is such a journey and
a really wonderful journey.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.670
Because when we started
this, you really

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.810
don't know what
you're going to find.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.720
I was interested-- as Henry
said from the very beginning,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.500
we would do these talking
heads with people.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.700
And it would give you kind
of a 101 of their story.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.130
And it helps us gauge
how complicitous

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.040
they would be with the
project to [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.800
But yeah, it was
a great adventure.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:27.960
I knew nothing about making porn
movies and Haitian food, which

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.830
I love, by the way.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.474
And just-- yeah,
all kinds of things.

00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:35.140
HENRY CHALFANT: I
think of lot of credit

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.929
goes to Draper for his
style of engaging people.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.640
You don't come on as a
person who's going to,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.220
well, let's get the
story, and then you'll

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.730
never see them again.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.680
There's a development of a
certain kind of friendship.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.200
And I don't think
you can-- we tend

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.310
to think that, oh, people are
going to be very close to us.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.850
But it's amazing how
much people really

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.330
feel the need and the
desire to tell their story.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.580
And I think that
just obliterates

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.990
all kinds of racial class,
gender lines all the time.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.370
TOWNES COATES: And
Henry, if you don't know,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:29.320
Henry Chalfant is perhaps
best known career-long

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:36.510
for "Style Wars," which was
really the landmark New York

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.540
film about the graffiti
artists in New York,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.000
when no one else was
even looking at this

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.160
and considering
this as fine art.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.760
And I think Draper certainly
turned to Henry's wisdom a lot

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.930
about immersing yourself
in other people's worlds

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:03.540
and not only helping--
the comfort on both sides.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.520
And one of the things we found--
and one of the characters

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.470
in particular who was a
great talker-- at some point,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.430
I said, the fact is
nobody has ever asked her

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.700
her story before.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.460
She's got so much story to
tell, and no one has ever asked.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.490
And she sees this as
a great opportunity

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.790
to get her history
to leave her mark.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.660
And it is a great
opportunity on both sides.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.730
And I think all of the
people who participated

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:49.620
have, in retrospect, been happy
they did it and are incredibly

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.520
grateful to Draper for providing
them the forum to do it.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.590
DRAPER SHREEVE: I
also want to thank

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:06.020
my producers-- Townes Coates
and Henry Chalfant and our story

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:18.120
consultant, Chris Bram--
who gave me so much support

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.150
and freedom to pursue all this.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.720
So thank you.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.890
HENRY CHALFANT: And
I want to shout out

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:34.450
to the aesthetic and artistic
gifts of our director, who

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.150
made this so appealing
to watch, the choices

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:44.710
that he made as editor
and as director.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.790
Really made a beautiful film.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.490
DRAPER SHREEVE: Thank you,
and Henry was one of the DPs.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.079
HENRY CHALFANT: Yeah.

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:52.870
If you want to know
what executive producer

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.920
means, in this
instance, it was-- well,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.640
we bought half a camera.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.100
And we went out and
started shooting.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.010
That's the most
fun part of it all.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.410
And of course,
you're always trying

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.170
to learn the new equipment,
different things.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.360
And you make mistakes
and everything.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.320
But that's how we began.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.150
And then, of course,
you've got to think

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.140
about raising money after that.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.690
What's interesting,
too-- you asked

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.300
about the straight white
man and access and the food,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.250
the eating, at Tee's house.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.290
Draper had the brilliant idea.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.400
Our DP was an old
friend of mine,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.770
who's a straight white man.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.090
But he's a very engaging guy and
is a wonderful cinematographer.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.660
And we got him on board.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.720
Around the time,
we were thinking

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.320
of doing this dinner
at Tee's home.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.110
And Draper said, let's just
leave Mike in there with them.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.460
And we went off for an hour
or two and just let them go.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.630
And it was a tiny
little room, as you saw.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.240
And so he had no
trouble making everybody

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.140
feel at home in that room.

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:08.990
AUDIENCE: A couple things.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.380
First of all, I
love documentaries.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.360
And this really was
an extraordinary one,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.305
it seemed to me.

00:13:18.305 --> 00:13:18.930
DRAPER SHREEVE: Thank you.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.330
AUDIENCE: I was fully engaged.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.220
In particular, the balance
between the interview

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.397
and then the actual scenes.

00:13:25.397 --> 00:13:26.480
You just never were bored.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.954
I mean, you just never-- yeah.

00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:30.495
As a matter of fact,
it made me think

00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:32.850
that if there was
one kind of film

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.970
that we could have from the
16th century about people

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:43.030
who we are absent from most
of history-- a film like this.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.642
The question I had
is simply this.

00:13:45.642 --> 00:13:47.350
There are so many
wonderful scenes in it.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.140
But the one that I know a
lot of people won't forget

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.680
is the one on the bicycle where
the porn star and her friend--

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.740
I mean, the narrative
going along with the--

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.445
but how did that come about?

00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:02.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.340
DRAPER SHREEVE: Well,
first of all, I shot it.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.600
And Henry was driving the car.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.640
And with all of these people,
we were always looking

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.220
for excuses for B-roll
footage, because we

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.590
had these great interviews.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.820
But you can't just sit
there and listen to them--

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.430
you know, what's your life like?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.570
What do you do?

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:36.170
And I knew that Mr. Pam and her
current boyfriend at that time,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.060
Rafael, were big bike riders.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.870
And I thought, they'd be fun.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.670
We can get you on your bikes.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.850
Would you like to do that?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.090
And they said, yeah.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.910
So we started out.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.490
We're uptown.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.650
They're on their bikes.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.895
And the further we came
downtown, more of their clothes

00:14:53.895 --> 00:14:55.910
came off.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.050
And by the time we got
to Christopher Street,

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.960
they were down to
bra and slip and--

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.420
AUDIENCE: And that
was just them?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.110
DRAPER SHREEVE:
That was just them.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.235
And you noticed they were--

00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:10.859
TOWNES COATES: And in fairness,
the same thing happens with me.

00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:11.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.600
DRAPER SHREEVE: Yeah.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.120
That's right.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.340
But they started
out on two bikes.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.300
And then around Christopher
Street, she had a flat tire.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.660
And that didn't
stop them at all.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.960
They hopped on the other.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.600
And by that time, it
was just a circus.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.360
And we thought,
we're getting this.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.080
And we're driving around.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.650
There's a lot of outtakes.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.690
We couldn't include everything.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:49.952
Tourists were-- they were
excited and flummoxed and--

00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:51.660
TOWNES COATES: Why
they come to New York.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.290
DRAPER SHREEVE: Right, yeah.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.395
They love that.

00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:55.124
It was good.

00:15:55.124 --> 00:15:56.040
I'm glad you liked it.

00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:02.360
AUDIENCE: I love the film.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.737
I think it's really beautiful.

00:16:03.737 --> 00:16:04.820
DRAPER SHREEVE: Thank you.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.870
AUDIENCE: I'm not
surprised that it was.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.510
Two things.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.051
One thing, I really
noticed that what

00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:12.460
seemed like one of the
big subthemes of movie

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.870
that emerged was really
how the cities changed

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.580
so much-- like the city
itself, not just Queer City.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.080
But it felt like
so much of this was

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.699
about how the world of this
city is changing so much.

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:25.990
And I was wondering if you
had any thoughts about that.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.281
My other question would be
also about the use of music.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.620
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Well, for those of us

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.585
who have lived here a long time,
it certainly has changed a lot.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.810
Some of that is
reflected in the film.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:49.790
I don't know.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.430
Were there parts
in particular that

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.872
made you think of
old New York or--

00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:56.445
AUDIENCE: You know, sometimes
they would just pass places.

00:16:56.445 --> 00:16:58.070
They'd be like, well,
that's not there.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.030
It's changed very much anymore.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.000
And also, one of the things that
all the people had in common

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.900
is that most of them were
not wealthy New Yorkers.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.880
And I thought that was also
a really interesting thing

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.490
about it.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.281
So that's also what
make me think about it,

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.240
and thinking how these
people-- or all of us-- who

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.680
are not in certain echelons
will be squeezed out eventually.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.055
So I guess there was
a melancholy or almost

00:17:23.055 --> 00:17:25.348
a wastefulness about how
much longer this world

00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:27.806
will be there, which made me
think about the changing city,

00:17:27.806 --> 00:17:29.029
I guess.

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:30.570
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Well, these are a lot

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:35.370
of stories that I didn't think
you would normally hear at all.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.740
And a lot of people
that are very

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:47.220
comfortable-- I don't always
know that their lives are

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.190
that interesting.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.745
Maybe in some respect.

00:17:52.745 --> 00:17:57.990
But these people, they
spoke to me on some level.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.980
I thought they were fascinating.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.430
But for a lot of
them, especially

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.330
as it goes further
and further into it,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.270
they are struggling here.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.680
And it's not just
their orientation.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.280
It's many, many things
that impact them.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.030
You ask about the music.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:22.985
The music is by Eef Barzelay,
who is an Israeli composer.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.460
I found him through
his agent in LA.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.870
And I wrote a letter
kind of explaining

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.610
what I was looking for.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:42.530
And I didn't want to
use synthesized music.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.840
I wanted acoustic.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.870
And I wrote this
very long letter.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.020
These are examples
of what I like,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.410
blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.230
And she came back
with two people,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.690
and he was the first one.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:05.640
And it turns out he
lives in Nashville,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.080
which is where I'm from.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.780
And I thought, wow,
this is interesting.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.010
So we went there to
record the music.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.390
And it was very interesting.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.130
He's a great guy.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.620
He's very talented.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.900
And he wrote all of this for it.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.840
And that's him singing, and
he scored all this as well.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.980
TOWNES COATES: And I think
there was a sensitivity toward--

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.160
and I think part of Draper--
musical vision of this,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.960
was something that
was very rhythmic.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.590
Because you have that
rhythm of the city

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.980
accompanying these
personal stories.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.379
DRAPER SHREEVE: Tell them about
how we found the tap dancer.

00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:56.420
TOWNES COATES: Oh, right.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.060
And the tap dancer
and the drummer

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:03.350
that you see in some of
those interstitial shots.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:08.770
And that was us walking
down the street one evening

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.057
and passing by the old
music store, which was on--

00:20:12.057 --> 00:20:13.140
DRAPER SHREEVE: Music Inn.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.376
TOWNES COATES: The
Music Inn, yes.

00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:19.390
And there was a guy out
front with a piece of plywood

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.480
who was tap dancing, and he was
being accompanied by a drummer.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.750
It was one of those--
you're just walking by,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.840
and this is going on
in the summer night.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.280
And we're walking past.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.580
And of course, then I realized
that Draper is no longer

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.210
walking here and
that he's stopped

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.250
and is going back to wait
until they take a little break.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.420
And said, could I
come back one day?

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.980
I'm doing this.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.780
I think what you're doing is
such an interesting sound.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.120
It really got my attention.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.410
Could I come back
and record sound?

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.190
And they said, sure, of course.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.370
And it progressed from
there, from recording sound

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:01.130
to filming them and
doing a whole recording

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:06.100
session of the sound
and visuals as well.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.020
So from just taking a
break from the music store

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.970
they worked in
out on the street,

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.151
they ended up as these great New
York characters in this film.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.640
TED WARNER: So how long
did it take to make this?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.915
DRAPER SHREEVE: We shot on
and off for about four years.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.640
Some of the subjects
in it were--

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.370
we had already accumulated
a lot of material on them.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.020
And they were great, and
we wanted to use them.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.520
And then sometimes they
just weren't available.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.530
Tom Duane was going out of
office around that time.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:58.020
And I already had
committed to have that.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.560
I really wanted him in the film.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.140
But we had to wait for
months to get to his office

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.490
and shoot a lot of stuff.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.240
TOWNES COATES: And
truly, as I always say,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.960
the average documentary is seven
years from beginning to end.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.160
So if we came in at 5:00, we
were way ahead of the game.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.160
HENRY CHALFANT: So true.

00:22:24.336 --> 00:22:26.210
TED WARNER: It really
feels like these people

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.820
were telling their own story.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:34.320
And I didn't see that there
was a lot of narration.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.010
It was really just the
people talking on their own.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.500
And I'm wondering
how much of what

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.530
happened was something
that you predicted

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.540
or that you wanted to
happen, and how much of it

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:53.730
was organic that happened over
the course of making the film.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.610
DRAPER SHREEVE: It
was all organic,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.040
because when you do
something like this,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.250
you don't really know
what you're going to get.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.250
And the only thing we
really had to judge by

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.330
were the initial talking
heads, the subjects,

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.860
to get a general sense of
their story and who they were

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.300
and how willing they
would to be to be in this.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.020
And so a lot of
things-- like, we

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.200
didn't know what we
were going to get.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.750
We would suggest a
bike ride for somebody,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.282
and it turns into this
circus on the street, so.

00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:37.740
TOWNES COATES: Just
in the same way

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.190
that Geoffrey had
mentioned in his interview

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.630
about working with the
Alzheimer's patients, that

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.200
became a real destination.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.450
And that center could
not have been better.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:59.660
And the families, everyone--
everyone you saw-- everyone

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.530
did their releases.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.300
The families were very
much involved, were

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.570
perfectly willing to have
their family members involved

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.550
in this.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.510
But that's something that
grew out of-- you know,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.270
Geoffrey just mentioning
in the interview

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.120
that this was volunteer
work he was doing

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.590
with Alzheimer's patients.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.960
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Tee, for example--

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:31.450
I had no idea about her
story, about her family,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.110
her catastrophic loss.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.310
And I remember sitting there
when she's telling that

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:43.110
and hearing for the first
time that she had lost five

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.340
members of her family to AIDS.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.020
And I'd never heard that before.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.530
I mean, yeah.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.795
It was a journey.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.990
Yeah.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.480
AUDIENCE: Were the
mothers of the twins

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.670
present when you were
interviewing them?

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.450
Were they, when they
were talking about--

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.230
TOWNES COATES: No, it were not.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:17.920
And it's so interesting,
because Draper and I were there

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.660
together.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:25.710
And the interview area was
set up down in their basement.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:32.710
And I fully expected-- here we
are, like two middle-aged men.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:37.460
And the mothers had-- I mean,
they'd known Draper before.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.280
That maybe have been the
first time they both met me.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.860
And we said, do you want to sit
in when we interview the kids

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.110
and interview the
kids separately?

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.400
And they said, no, they're fine.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.670
And those kids were, as you
saw, incredibly self-possessed.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.770
And they were terrific.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:06.220
And the whole family
has seen-- actually,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.980
maybe [? Leah ?]
hasn't seen it yet.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.950
But the family has seen it.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.930
And they loved it.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.830
And the fact that
they have raised

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.240
those two kids to say
what's on their mind,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.920
and they absolutely do.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.906
DRAPER SHREEVE:
Any more questions?

00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:30.630
TED WARNER: Well,
we thank you all.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.440
Thank you.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.490
[APPLAUSE]
