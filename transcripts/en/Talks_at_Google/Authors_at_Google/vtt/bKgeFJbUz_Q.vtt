JEREMY STERN:
Greetings and welcome.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.770
My name is Jeremy Stern,
with Google Fiber.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.640
And on August 24, 2015, the
Google Doodle for the day

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.620
honored the 125th birthday of
the great Duke Kahanamoku--

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.790
a five-time Olympic
Medalist in swimming,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.530
and the father of
modern surfing.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.700
No American athlete
has influenced

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.180
two sports has profoundly
as Kahanamoku did.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.650
And yet, he remains an enigmatic
and under-appreciated figure.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.620
Our guest today will share his
deep insights and expertise

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.780
on the life and times of Duke
Kahanamoku, a true waterman.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.200
I'm delighted to
introduce to Google

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.100
noted author and
writer, David Davis.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.340
David, an Angeleno, has
published several books.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.030
And his works have been
published and appeared

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.900
in "The Los Angeles Times,"
"The New York Times," "The Wall

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.330
Street Journal,"
"Sports Illustrated,"

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.380
and many other
illustrious publications.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.300
A couple administrate
matters-- of course,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.250
we're taping this for "Talks
at Google," a site on YouTube.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.780
And there will be time
for questions at the end.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.100
And because we're
taping, please make sure

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.090
that you use the microphone to
ask your questions so that we

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.910
capture your questions
for the video audience.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.457
David, welcome to
Google, Los Angeles.

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:37.888
DAVID DAVIS: Thank you so much.

00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:38.842
Thanks, Jeremy.

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.197 --> 00:01:43.530
DAVID DAVIS: Welcome, everybody.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.780
Thanks for having me.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.120
Enjoy your lunch while we
talk a little bit about Duke.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.480
And just to preface this, partly
why I embarked on this project

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.540
starting in 2011 is
there really hadn't

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.750
been-- that I had seen-- a
comprehensive biography of Duke

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.320
Kahanamoku.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.250
And it was one of those
sort of mysteries,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.510
as why hasn't there been,
because of his enormous impact

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.350
and legacy?

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.260
So the interesting thing was the
more research I did, the more I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.190
uncovered that he was
sort of bigger than life,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.940
maybe even than I imagined.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.660
So what I'd like to do today
with you is, in a sense,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.590
give you a little
overview of his life.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.850
And what's sort
of interesting is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.070
that his life-- beyond just
the sports angle, which

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.730
is, of course, an important part
of the book and the research--

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.680
really parallels modern Hawaii.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.180
And really, starting from his
from his birth, from his roots.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.810
And he is full-blooded Hawaiian.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.600
This is his father,
Duke Kahanamoku Sr,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.420
Who was, as you can see,
part of the Honolulu Police

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.560
Department at that time.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.180
And interesting note, one of
his colleagues at the time

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.710
was the real-life model for
Charlie Chan, the detective.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.840
Who, of course, was
made into several films.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.290
But he was a Sergeant,
Duke Kahanamoku.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.770
Everybody at the time-- 1890,
when Duke is born-- Hawaii's

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.720
a monarchy.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.330
It's an independent nation
run by Queen Liliuokalani.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.310
And there was sort of a mystery
about Duke's first name.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.310
A lot of people thought oh, he's
got to be royalty or related.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.210
And actually, Hawaii
royal bloodlines

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.690
are quite complicated.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.440
He wasn't a direct lineage.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.870
But his name really just
came from his father,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.140
which was Duke.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.350
And this is his mother, Julia.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.700
And it's really her family, the
Paoa family-- P-A-O-A-- that,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.500
in a sense, Duke takes
his Waterman roots from.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.740
The Paoa family were quite
influential as waterman.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.440
And I use that term
specifically in Hawaii

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.740
and Honolulu, Waikiki.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.370
Waterman is really
an honorific title.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.010
It's a very important
part of the culture.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.550
Of course, of Hawaii being
such an isolated island chain

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.520
and especially
wasn't even sort of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.210
"discovered" until
very late in the game.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.740
And so to be a waterman, I mean,
that means you how to paddle.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.920
You know how to sail.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.100
You know where the
fishing holes are.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.540
You know the tides, the wind.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.360
It's a very important aspect.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.940
And Duke, in a sense, takes
his roots, his waterman roots,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.120
from the Paoa family.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.290
And the other thing
that they took,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.150
in a sense-- his
mother's family--

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.880
they had a plot of
land in Waikiki.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.200
And 1893, when
Hawaii's monarchy gets

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.920
toppled-- of course, America
having a huge influence

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.760
and stake in this-- the
family retreats to Waikiki.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.590
And Duke is raised
in Waikiki and spends

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.270
much of his formative
years in Waikiki,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.020
which people know today, all
the tourist, hotels, et cetera.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.110
But back then, my gosh,
it was so isolated.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.470
And it was freshwater streams
coming down from the mountains.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.060
There were taro patches, rice
paddies, that sort of thing.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.310
It was this sort of idyllic
water festival of life.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.820
And if you were born
and raised there

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.180
you just ran into the ocean.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.310
That was part of
your upbringing,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.410
part of what you did.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.830
This is really the first example
we have of Duke playing sports.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.270
He went to the
Kamehameha schools.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.700
Frankly, they're very
prestigious in this day

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.260
and age.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.250
But at the time, were
really trade schools

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.150
for native Hawaiians.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:20.220
And it was part of the effort
to inculcate religion and speak

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.860
English language only,
that sort of thing.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.680
And if I can make this work
you can see Duke, of course,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.920
in the back-- I'm not sure I can
make this work-- on the soccer

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.510
team.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.080
Let me see.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.850
Can I make it?

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.750
Yeah.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.880
And this is the
Kamehameha schools.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.020
And he was quite a
good soccer player.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.010
But his forte, his efforts
would really come via the water.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.440
And this is an early shot
of Duke and his surfboard.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.590
And as you can see, these
are enormous planks of wood.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.470
And for those of you who
know surfing history, surf

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.710
historians, back
then the surfboards

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.370
were basically 100, 125-pound
planks of wood-- Koa

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.310
or Redwood, 12-foot,
16-feet long.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.880
It was a very different style
of surfing than today, which

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.900
are the foam boards and
shorter and very maneuverable

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.490
with fins and that
sort of thing.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.300
These, one commentator
called them

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.940
coffin lids as a description.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.800
And that's basically
what they were.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.310
But I will point out-- and
you'll see some photos of Duke

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:38.040
a little bit later without his
top-- it seems to me that this

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.950
is, in a sense, the
first instance or one

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.130
of the first instances
of cross training.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.290
Because he had to lug that
board through the sand.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.831
I mean, if you're
going to go surfing

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.200
you had to lug a 120-pound
board through the sand,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.220
get out there, paddle out.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.371
The thing gets soaked.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.620
You got to bring that back in.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.930
And you're walking around.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.760
And that's a workout.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.100
And you'll see he's
really got a modern body.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.530
I mean, this was probably
taken about 1912, 1915.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.990
And this is what it looks like.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.970
I mean, it was pretty
much you paddled out.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.600
And you came straight in.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.680
And this is shot in
Waikiki, probably

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.680
near Diamond Head area.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.790
And we know today
about the North Shore.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.600
Those are the big surf
contests in Hawaii and Oahu.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.680
And those are generally
coming up actually--

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.840
December, Christmastime.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.280
Nobody could surf the
North Shore back then.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.510
It just wasn't possible with
the equipment, with the boards.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.380
You basically just
went straight.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.510
And Duke comes around.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.140
So we're talking
1900, when he's 10.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.089
America makes Hawaii
a colony of sorts.

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:50.380
However you want to look at it.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.540
It was part of the imperialistic
surge of America in the late

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.550
1890's.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.720
The Philippines,
Puerto Rico, Cuba,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.630
America going beyond
the mainland boundaries.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.140
And very specifically strategic,
military looking to Asia,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.880
Pacific Rim and Britain.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.360
So that makes Duke
an American citizen,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.080
which of course changes
the direction of his life.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.700
And one of that direction is
about sports, and organized

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.030
sports, and America
having something

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.870
called the AAU, which was a way
to organize amateur sports back

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.710
then.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.680
That was something that
Duke could participate in.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.280
And just before I leave
this slide and move

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.420
on to his swimming career, it's
interesting to note that Duke,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.030
we call him the
father of surfing.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.180
And one of the reasons
we say that is he

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.970
and some other mates on
Waikiki formed, basically,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.290
the first surf club, which
was called the Hui Nalu.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.000
And they were, in
a sense, orphans.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.650
Because the main
athletic club at

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.100
the time was the
Outrigger Canoe Club.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.650
And the Outrigger Canoe
Club was whites only.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:11.560
And so Duke and his mates formed
their own more informal club

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.890
called the Hui Nalu.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.670
And that became the
basis of-- and they

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.490
devised some of-- the
rules that we still

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.950
deal with in terms of surfing.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:28.070
And the Hui Nalu became an area
that Duke could springboard

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.240
with when it came to swimming.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.080
Because while in
Hawaii, he maybe

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.720
had been known for
his surfing skills.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.330
And basically, at that time,
the only surfing that was done

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.320
was in Hawaii.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.050
To get beyond that, he turned
to competitive swimming.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.160
This photo is a historic photo.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.430
Again, one of those moments when
Duke's life changes forever.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.885
This is 1911 in August.

00:10:56.885 --> 00:10:59.180
First AAU meet ever in Hawaii.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.310
And it's a swim meet.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.100
And Duke is out in
front by quite a bit.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.670
He sets two world's records
that day in the 50 and the 100.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.260
And as you can
see, it's Honolulu.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.000
It's outdoors.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.984
That's what most of the
swimming events were back then.

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:14.650
It was outdoors.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.790
There were very few pools.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.150
There wasn't the
modern guidelines

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.180
that we have today
with its 50 meters

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.910
and you know, and
precisely measured.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.180
This is sort of sports just
beginning to get organized.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.120
And Duke, does indeed, set the
records in the 50 and the 100.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.930
What's interesting is that
when the Hawaiian officials

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.710
quite proudly send the marks
in to New York, the home

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.770
office of the AAU, the
records are rejected.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.930
And they give all sorts
of weak and lame excuses

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.800
for why the records
were turned down.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.380
But basically, it was
sort of its Hawaii.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.440
It's so far away.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.720
They have no oversight.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.740
They have no knowledge of Hawaii
and what these athletes can do.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.090
So they reject Duke's
record and records.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.570
And it's interesting to note
that while that was obviously

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.040
a setback and Duke was upset
about it, what it did was

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.130
it rallied the Hawaiian
community around Duke.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.940
Because they were as
well insulted by that.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.620
And they decided to prove
that Duke could actually

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.680
swim that fast, could beat
the best on the mainland.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.030
And he came from a
working-class family.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.240
By this time he had
dropped out of high school.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.090
He was making a living
as a beach boy, what

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.440
we would call a beach boy today,
taking tourists out, teaching

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.270
them how to swim and
maybe surf lessons

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.080
or in an outrigger canoe.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.660
And Hawaii rallied
around Duke and paid

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.220
for him to come to
the mainland in 1912

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.860
to try to qualify for
the US Olympic team that

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.300
was going to Sweden, to
Stockholm, to compete

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.620
at the 1912 Olympics.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.960
So here's Duke.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.500
You know, his first
presence on the mainland.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.280
And as you can see, those
are the competitive swimsuits

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.370
of the day.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.704
They were heavy, heavy cotton.

00:13:18.704 --> 00:13:20.120
If they were lucky
they were silk.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.000
But they were heavy cotton.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.700
Men had to wear, like, almost
like a codpiece-type thing.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.230
And if you think
that's restrictive,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.210
you should have seen what
the women had to wear.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.000
But they were very,
very elaborate contests.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.400
This is the end of the
Victorian prudish era.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.570
But Duke was an anomaly
at this time, in 1912.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.530
Few people had ever
been to Hawaii.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.900
Few people could ever find
it on a map, quite frankly.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.260
And here he is, a
dark-skinned Pacific Islander,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.000
coming to represent the
United States at the Olympics.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.880
And that was a
little bit different.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.400
Maybe there were some Native
Americans-- most prominently,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.610
Jim Thorpe on the team--
but it was pretty much

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.520
a white-only team
in the Olympics

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.280
at that time for America.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.900
And here's Duke, with the entire
US Olympic swim team for 1912.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.800
And if you think
about Duke's journey,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.080
he had to take a steamship
from Honolulu to the mainland,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.330
take railroads
across the country,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.240
and then take another ship
from New York to Stockholm

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.470
to compete.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.520
And at that time--
just as a side note--

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.270
you can see there's,
what, seven men?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.580
And the head of the amateur
AAU was James Sullivan.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.690
He was not a big proponent
of women in sports.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.760
And so this was
the first Olympics

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.110
that women swimmers
were competing.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.810
But James Sullivan refused
to allow the Americans

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.380
to field a women's team.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.100
So it was just the men.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.640
And Duke, quite
frankly, is great.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.040
You see him here in the middle.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.200
This is all outdoors.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.450
So you know, it's quite frigid
conditions in Stockholm,

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.980
though apparently the weather
was actually quite nice.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.260
So they got lucky.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.170
But Duke smashed records.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.580
He won the 100 in quite
controversial fashion.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.600
So there were a lot of
headlines about was he

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.972
going to make the finals?

00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:18.930
Did he make the finals?

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.290
Will he win the gold medal?

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.180
Well, he did.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.460
And then they won.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.650
They took the silver
medal in the relay.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.820
And just to point out, there
were just very, very few

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.830
swimming events back then.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.770
So we talk about Michael Phelps
winning eight Olympic medals

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.410
in the last Olympics.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.810
Well, I don't even think there
were eight swimming events

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.960
for the men just by themselves.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.100
There was no Butterfly.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.870
There was no Individual Medley.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.320
There was maybe one
Relay, that sort of thing.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.550
So we're talking the opportunity
was not very vast for him

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.850
as a swimmer.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.370
But he made the most of it.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.370
And here he is,
accepting his medal

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.680
from the King, King Gustaf.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.300
And like Jim Thorpe,
Duke Kahanamoku

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.870
returns to America
a star, a celebrity.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.160
Here he is marching,
parading in New York City,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.810
with the Olympic team.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.030
And by the way, that's
a camera that he's

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.270
holding in his left hand.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.840
That's those big, clunky
cameras back then.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.030
He's now famous.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.830
Anywhere he goes
for appearances,

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.580
for meets, its headline.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.010
They want to interview him.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.240
And this says, "Kanaka Swimmer
Has No Equal in the Water."

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.560
"Kanaka" refers to
Hawaiian native.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.540
It's a little controversial
term in and of itself.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:50.000
But I mean, there weren't
anybody like Duke.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.167
And so press and media
felt OK to just call him

00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:55.000
what they wanted to.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.920
And they would make
up interviews and just

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.365
publish it, frankly.

00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:00.760
But he's a celebrity.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.590
And people demand
his services to swim.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.859
They want to see him.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:11.310
This is his trip to
Australia, 1914-1915.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.170
You see that little
speck in the water?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.510
Black, dark speck?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.480
That's Duke surfing.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.270
And the people on
shore are just amazed.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.700
They think this is a
guy walking on water.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.940
There had maybe been not
even a handful of surfers

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.050
in Australia.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.390
This is the first celebrity.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.880
And so when he would
come newspapers

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.900
would write about him.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.810
He didn't come with
a board, by the way,

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.170
when he went to Australia.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.390
He went to swim.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.140
And then he decided-- he saw
the waves-- said, "Hey, I'm

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.850
going to surf."

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.460
He went to a lumber
yard and shaped a board

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.540
and carved it out.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.804
And it was, I think, some
pine wood in Australia.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:53.220
And then he would
leave it behind.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.400
And in a sense, he was sort
of the Johnny Appleseed

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.470
of surfing.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.670
He would leave a board.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.000
That would become the model.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.490
And people would, "Oh, yeah.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:08.530
Let's do that shape." and he was
very happy to leave that alone.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.090
And you can see, here
he is in the middle.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.764
This is the crowds
that he would draw.

00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:16.930
He went there in the winter.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:22.030
Of course, our winter,
Australia's summer.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.800
And so everybody just would
mob to come out to see him.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.320
And he toured.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.170
He would compete in San
Francisco, at the Sutro Baths.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.090
He would come down here
to Southern California.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.610
He started surfing in Corona Del
Mar, Long Beach, the South Bay.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.520
Those were the big, big
surf areas back then.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.780
And Corona Del Mar,
being the jewel.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.220
And we'll see a little
bit more of that later.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.230
But he's starting to establish
an international reputation.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.600
And he's starting
to make friends

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.670
in Southern California and
Los Angeles, especially people

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.550
at the Los Angeles
Athletic Club.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.420
And again, that will play
out later in his life.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.280
One of his trips to
Southern California,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.690
he was in Hollywood.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.220
He was put in a movie.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.270
And you can see the
gentleman on Duke's left

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.140
was Hobart Bosworth, a
famous producer/director

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.080
at the time, a buddy
of Jack London.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.210
And he brought Duke in and
made a little two reeler.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.720
These are all silent
movies, of course.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.070
And just to point out,
you can see Duke's body.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.770
I mean, that's a
modern-day body.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.720
And most of his opponents, quite
frankly, did not have that.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.350
This is again, he
wasn't natural.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.400
He trained.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.130
He was a competitor.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.650
And by the way, that movie
is lost, unfortunately,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.510
like a lot of the
silent movies of today.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.190
When he would go
to the mainland--

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.350
and this was shot in
Chicago-- he often

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:04.470
was backed by the
Hawaii promotion outfit.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.210
And Duke would be,
"Hey, play a ditty.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.110
Play a song."

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.910
He would do that.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.030
It would help promote Hawaii,
which the business interests

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.010
were very, very keen on.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.650
And Duke-- through his
sports, through surfing

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.940
and through swimming-- he was
helping to promote Hawaii.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.640
And again, this will be
part of a theme in his life,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.240
that he becomes so connected
to his homeland, to Hawaii.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.230
And he was, of course,
very proud of that.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.790
I should point out
in 1916, again,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.840
when we talk about oh, he
won five Olympic medals.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.480
That's a lot.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.220
But, you know, Michael Phelps
did that in one Olympics.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.620
But the Olympics of 1916
were cancelled, of course,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.820
for World War I. They were
supposed to be in Berlin.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.870
And so Duke, in the prime
of his athletic life,

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.760
was not able to defend
his crown in 1916.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.040
But he decides to stay
on and stay an amateur

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.362
and that's no easy
feat back then.

00:21:08.362 --> 00:21:09.820
Because there
weren't endorsements.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.610
You weren't allowed
to take an endorsement

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.150
if you were an amateur athlete.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.730
So Duke did make it
to the 1920 Olympics.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:22.420
This is him on the far
right, with his teammates,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.070
many of whom were Hawaiian.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.750
And Duke, again, just--
not shocks the world.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.490
By then he's the
defending champ--

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.450
but he's also 30
years old, which

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.570
is quite ancient for
swimmers, even today.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.030
And Duke defends his title
in the 100 and wins the gold,

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.590
wins the relay as well,
sort of adding to his fame.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:49.280
And having skipped 1916
Olympics from 1912 to 1920,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.750
it's a pretty incredible feat.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:56.050
And here you can see
this is the Relay team.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.770
The Olympics of 1920
were in Antwerp.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.780
It was sort of a
last-minute thing.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.960
The Pierre de Coubertin, the
head of the IOC at the time,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.510
wanted to get the Olympics get
back going after World War I.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.040
And so the Olympics
were in Antwerp.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.130
And frankly, they were a
war-torn country at that time

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.830
and weren't really prepared.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.800
And the conditions
were just abysmal,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.310
including the pool, absolutely
frigid temperatures.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.260
And you can see
them, the guys just

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.250
sort of huddling to stay warm.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.790
And as I said, Duke's
Relay team wins the gold.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.260
So he adds two gold medals.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.040
I do point out that the
competition wasn't that great

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.420
in 1920 because of the damage
of the war, unfortunately.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.710
Germany was not
allowed to compete.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.720
Russia was not allowed
to compete in 1920.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.110
And frankly, a lot of the
competitors from Australia,

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.660
the young men from
Australia, many

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.370
had died or been
wounded in the war.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.800
So the competition level
was a little less in 1920.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.630
But Duke was there.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.940
And he trained and won the gold.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.660
And just so you can
see what the start

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.836
line looks like in 1920,
outdoors, masses of people

00:23:17.836 --> 00:23:18.335
around.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.560
After the Olympics, Duke
returns briefly to Hawaii.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.470
But he comes to Southern
California for the first time

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.710
for an extended stay in 1922.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.450
And he's brought here by
a promoter specifically

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.587
to be a Hollywood star.

00:23:37.587 --> 00:23:39.420
And these are one of
the promotion pictures.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.090
I believe this is Venice Beach.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.610
And you know, Duke, of course,
shooting a few golf balls

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.640
while his promoter
handler has the surfboard

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.930
in the background.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.760
And the initial
plans fell through.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.190
And Duke was not a star.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.550
And as you'll see-- and I'll
get to this a little bit

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:04.670
later-- he did run across,
of course, Hollywood.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.700
The racism of
Hollywood at the time,

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:12.300
and certainly, no leading
man could be a non-white,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.730
to get the girl and so on.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.450
So Duke has a good time, though.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:24.620
He surfs in Southern
California as you can see.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.170
Up and down.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.480
That's I think, Corona
del Mar, Venice.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.880
That was on the cover of
"The Los Angeles Times"

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.220
Sunday magazine.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.700
And again, a little bit
risque in the sense of you

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.430
have a dark-skinned man
and the woman is actually

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.030
the wife of his coach.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.790
And Duke joins the Los
Angeles Athletic Club.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.312
And you can see their logo.

00:24:45.312 --> 00:24:46.770
That's one of the
Olympic swimmers.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.500
By now, James Sullivan has died.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.540
So women can now compete
for America in the Olympics.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.400
And they do quite well in
diving and in swimming.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.690
That's Mickey Riley,
another great diver.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.920
And Duke's wearing
a beard there.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.320
He gets, basically, to
be an extra in the films.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.870
And I'll show you some
other slides of that.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.230
But that logo on his
waist, or around his thigh

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.030
there, that's still the
mercury logo of the Los Angeles

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.990
Athletic Club.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.700
And that became the
basis of his life

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.900
both in terms of athletics
and swimming competition,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.570
but also social
life and so forth.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.550
A lot of Hollywood stars
were part of the Los Angeles

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.170
Athletic Club

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.630
And he stays in training.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.690
Because the Hollywood
thing didn't really

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.540
pan out in 1922, '23, he
decides to go for the Olympics

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.350
in 1924, which were in Paris.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.360
This is a beautiful
outdoor stadium.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.510
It was the first pool that was
50 meters for the Olympics,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.780
I believe, or at
least built that way.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.070
But now Duke is 34 years old.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.760
Again, now beyond ancient
for swimming, and especially

00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.810
sprints.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.900
And so there's some
major competition,

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.620
including his younger brother.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.660
Duke had about six,
seven siblings.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.400
This is Sam Kahanamoku.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.940
Smaller, but had
emerged in the early 20s

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.440
as the top sprinter in Hawaii.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.430
So Duke is competing
against his younger brother.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.990
And he's also
competing against a guy

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.910
who would become his arch
rival in this time span.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.970
And this is, of course,
Johnny Weissmuller.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:34.060
And the logo, it's
Illinois Athletic Club.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.150
They were out of Chicago.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.940
And that was a hotbed
of competitive swimming.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.750
And Johnny was, in some
ways, very similar to Duke.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.140
He was working class stock.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.470
He was a high school drop out.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.510
In some ways, they
were very similar.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.470
He was also an amazing swimmer.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.050
And he is 21, 22 years old here.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.540
Duke is 34.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.850
And they don't meet.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.450
The newspapers sort of
build up this rivalry.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:07.482
They don't meet until the
Olympic trials of 1924.

00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:09.190
And then they meet
again in the Olympics.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:16.010
And spoiler alert, we'll tell
you what happens on that.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.792
And so here is the
Olympic team for 1924,

00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:21.750
for the United States,
as you can see in there.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.130
This is the Hawaiian
contingent, as you can see.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.510
There's now women on the
team, and Duke and his younger

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.630
brother.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.760
And this is the finals.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.490
And Duke and Johnny head to
head and Johnny is on the right

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.190
there in the middle of
the frame of the photo.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.240
And Johnny wins the gold medal.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.900
Duke takes silver.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.760
But this is now the '20s,
we're talking the Roaring '20s.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.310
And whereas Duke was a
big star, a major star,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.020
Johnny turns out
to be a megastar.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.210
I mean, you've got
the '20s of Babe Ruth.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.840
You've got Jack Dempsey.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.700
You've got sports stars
becoming bigger than life.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.580
And Johnny takes advantage
of that, as we'll see.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.340
And Duke was
friends with Johnny.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.650
They were rivals of course, but
was friends, even afterwards,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.327
as we'll see, as well, later.

00:28:21.327 --> 00:28:22.910
But obviously it was
a disappointment.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.650
This was going to be
perhaps his swan song

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.330
for Duke at the Olympics.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.550
And only get second.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.490
And his younger brother,
Sam, got the bronze medal.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:38.030
So Duke retreated to Hollywood,
or Southern California.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.570
And he did pursue a career.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.370
He signed with Paramount.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.230
And here he is in "Lord Jim."

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.990
And he's helping to teach one
of the actresses how to swim.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.970
Here he is in "The
Pony Express,"

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.800
playing a Native American
Indian, of course.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.960
He was actually a
good horseback rider.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.210
This is "Hula," which
is one of the few

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.210
that were actually having
a Hawaiian theme in it.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.920
And the actress that
he's playing with

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.390
is Clara Bow, who
was known as the "It"

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.570
girl, was the big
star of Hollywood

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.350
back in the early '20s.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.870
But I think you can sort of
see a theme emerging, which

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.080
is to say, Duke was not a star.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.610
He was an extra.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:24.200
And he was playing these
character roles, what

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.060
we would call ethnic roles.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.300
And that was an
unfortunately the extent.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.830
And he appeared in a
couple dozen movies,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.540
but never got really
the big, big star.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.300
And most of these were silent.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.500
Some of these are lost today.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.880
We don't have access to them.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.660
But some of it, like "Hula,"
we have a full version of.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.970
Which it's a pretty amazing
little movie, actually.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.670
Here he is, playing
a Barbary pirate,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.970
getting strangled
by Wallace Beery.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.650
And there's the glamour shot.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:04.850
And again, as you can tell, he's
playing a tribesmen of sorts.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.450
And unfortunately
that was about as far

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.440
as he could go in Hollywood.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:18.010
And this is probably about 1925,
'26, '27, around that time.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.120
He still keeps surfing.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.490
He teaches some of the
Hollywood community how to surf.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.450
He's one of the first
surfers to surf in Malibu

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.560
and starts extending
surfing as surfing

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.580
becomes sort of beyond
Hawaii and coming

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.050
to Southern California.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.910
And this was probably
taken in Corona del Mar,

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:41.560
down in Orange County,
which was the primo surf

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.890
spot, as I mentioned.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:48.210
And you can see that board
is just whatever, 12 feet, 16

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.970
feet.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.140
And he would retreat here with
buddies from the Los Angeles

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.000
Athletic Club.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.760
And it was at Corona
del Mar in 1925

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.970
that Duke made national
headlines again.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.700
And when I was
researching this book

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.430
I kept running across references
of Duke rescuing people

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.250
swimming.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.390
And this was in Hawaii.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.820
This was on the mainland.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.630
And it was sort of part and
parcel of being a waterman.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.480
You would notice people
who didn't swim very well.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.034
And quite frankly,
in those days,

00:31:19.034 --> 00:31:20.950
they didn't have a lot
of swimming instruction

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.410
and fins to learn on as a kid.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:29.010
So there were many accidents
back in that day of drowning

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.150
and so forth.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.870
So I kept running across
this, Duke rescuing people,

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.060
would-be drowning victims.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.200
And it all came to fruition
in 1925 in Corona del Mar.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.110
And these are his buddies, a
couple buddies from the Los

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.740
Angeles Athletic Club.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.740
And what happened that day,
it was a fishing vessel.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.900
A recreational fishing vessel
went out with a bunch of guys

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.020
from Riverside, California.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.300
They were going to
fish for abalone.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.320
And they were trying to
get out of the harbor.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.630
And they got smashed
by a groundswell.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.700
And a couple just
rogue waves just

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.560
slammed into the
boat, The Thelma,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.950
and it capsized and overturned.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.290
And Duke, as you can see
with this surf board,

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.500
saw what was happening.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.790
They were just down to surf.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.800
He ran out into the
surf, paddled out,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.690
threw three guys-- drowning
victims-- on his surfboard.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.820
Paddled in, deposited them
on the beach to his buddies.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.220
Went out again, got three more.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.750
Paddled in, did
it one more time.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.310
And he was credited later--
overall-- with rescuing

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.450
eight people.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.610
And never got, really thank
you'd for it by the people

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.900
at that time, though he got
some medals from the Los Angeles

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.100
Athletic Club.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.160
But it was one of
those episodes, again,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.930
he made national headlines.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.640
But it was also important
because people realized

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.900
the importance of a surfboard.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.260
It wasn't just about recreation.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:32:59.760
You know?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.380
It was a life-saving
device, perhaps.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.460
It was something
beyond just, OK we're

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.120
going to have fun in the waves.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.270
So it established
that tradition.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:15.330
By now, Duke is late 30s.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.630
The Hollywood career,
not working out so well.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.180
He retreats to
Hawaii for a while

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.250
and tries to figure
out what's next.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.390
He had never really taken a job.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.980
He got some crappy jobs.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.550
He was, like, a janitor.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.270
People were
horrified to discover

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.450
he was mowing the lawn
of City Hall in Honolulu.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.770
And he's just trying to
figure out what is next.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.410
And frankly, Los Angeles called.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.240
And 1932 is Los
Angeles Olympics.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.460
And the Olympic
games of '32 in LA

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.077
were pretty much spearheaded by
the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

00:33:54.077 --> 00:33:55.910
So they basically called
Duke and said, hey,

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.000
do you want to give
it one more time?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.400
And he's now,
basically, 40 years old.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.300
But he loves LA.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.110
Olympic games of '32,
this is the first time

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:13.080
since the games of 1904 that
the Olympics are in what

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.460
they would call the new world.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.719
And 1904 games, nobody
even noticed them.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:19.678
So this was a big deal.

00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:20.760
So he said, you know what?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.000
I'm going to try for it.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.540
See what happens.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:30.420
And as you can see, the
games, this was the building.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.889
They built the Colosseum in
the '20s to bid for the games.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:39.239
And obviously the
reference today, of course,

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.600
LA looking for the 2024 bid.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.770
But they certainly had the
wherewithal to build it.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.889
And Curtis, by the way, that
headline is the Vice President.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.800
Herbert Hoover
decided not to show up

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.469
for the opening ceremonies.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.580
This is during, of
course, the Depression.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.980
And here's Duke.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.540
He's on the far left there,
with Johnny Weissmuller

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.840
in the middle.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.660
And the fellow next
to him is a guy

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.790
named Buster Crabbe,
who you guys may

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:13.230
know as a great swimmer and
also, of course, as an actor.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:18.360
But Duke is not able to
make the team in 1932.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.180
Other people have written
that he did make the team

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:26.720
and I think we try to
debunk that in the book,

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.430
as we try to debunk a few myths
that have arisen around Duke.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.490
And this is one of them.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.830
But he fails to make
the team, frankly.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.390
And the gentleman
who does succeed--

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.300
and he's finishing up
here-- is Buster Crabbe.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.090
And Buster is the American
male to win a gold medal.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.290
Actually, it's the
Japanese swimmers

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.780
are the dominant
swimmers in 1932, 1936.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.260
But Buster Crabbe,
by being in LA

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.890
and winning and
being who he is, he's

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.339
a great-looking guy
and very charismatic.

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:00.880
Of course, Buster
Crabbe, as we know,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.020
went on to a huge
Hollywood career.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.730
And of course, so did
Duke's earlier rival,

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.130
which was Johnny Weissmuller.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.170
And this comes out
right around the time

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.690
of the 1932 Olympic games.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.260
And of course, Johnny
Weissmuller as "Tarzan."

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.650
It was perfect for him.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.220
He could wear a loin cloth.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.660
He didn't have to say very
much except grunt a little bit

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.390
and play with the monkey.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.300
And it must have been
a little disappointing.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.470
Duke was a very taciturn guy.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.640
He didn't talk about his
emotions and disappointments.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.430
But this was probably
certainly one of them.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.980
And he pretty much retreated
to Hawaii after this.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.990
He left LA around 1930,
came back for the '32 games,

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.410
moved back to Hawaii.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:52.430
These are two of his
brothers, Sargent and Sam.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:57.980
And basically, he
travels quite a bit.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.520
But he spends most of the
rest of his life in Hawaii,

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.310
back in his homeland.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.860
And tries to figure
out what's next.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.080
What does a high
school dropout do?

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.810
And he is persuaded to run
for Sheriff of Honolulu.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:18.690
And it's sort of
patronage type job.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.400
But it's also an elected office.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.090
And he runs and wins
every other year.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.290
And that becomes his job.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.000
He follows from his
father who is the police

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.470
Sergeant in law enforcement.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.450
And he holds that job
from, basically, mid

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.410
to late '30s all the way
up to 1959 when, of course,

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.060
Hawaii becomes the 50th state.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.900
He also has a sideline,
which is to say-- you see him

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.000
in the back of the Outrigger,
Diamond Head in the distance--

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.330
you know, he's now as big a
celebrity as pretty much every

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.910
sports star.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:01.440
And so when important
people come to Hawaii

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.820
in the '30s-- and tourism is
now starting to really boom

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.790
in Hawaii, of course.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.770
Because transportation's
a little bit easier.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.877
People have some money after
the Depression-- and so the rich

00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:14.710
and the famous come.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:19.780
And they are often are steered
to Duke for entertainment,

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.280
to go out in an outrigger,
and to just hobnob with Duke

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.430
Kahanamoku.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.540
So of course, there's
Babe Ruth, who

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.180
was en route or coming
back from Japan to do

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.920
an exhibition in the '30s.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:42.050
And Amelia Earhart, of course,
before her plane crash.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.430
And if necessary, he would
indulge in a little Hula

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.710
if the spirit moved him.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:52.880
And he was a great,
great dancer, apparently.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.670
And one of the controversial
aspects of his life

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:00.230
that had really never been
brought out before certainly

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.960
about him outside
of the sports realm

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.570
was one of the famous people
who came to Hawaii in the '30s.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.710
And that's Doris
Duke, who, as you see,

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.750
is in the middle with
Duke and his brothers.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.870
And Doris Duke, for those
who don't know that name,

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.305
her family is Duke University.

00:39:19.305 --> 00:39:21.580
It was the tobacco fortune.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:27.090
And her parents died
when she was very young.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.320
She was the richest
little girl in the world.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.320
And she came to
Hawaii for a honeymoon

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.360
and loved Hawaii, loved
the Kahanamoku brothers.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.430
And that's Sam Kahanamoku
and Doris Duke.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.730
And again, she's
a married woman.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.230
And so there have
been reports of did

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.420
she have an affair with Sam?

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.240
Did she have an
affair with Duke?

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.000
She had a child who was born
who lived for a couple days

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.890
and then passed away.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.490
And nobody is sure
who the father was.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.410
And there's been rumors
that it was Duke or Sam.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.610
So that was a bit of a mystery.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:08.542
In this time, Duke
marries in 1940,

00:40:08.542 --> 00:40:11.680
to Nadine Alexander,
or Nah-dean Alexander,

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.000
as she would pronounce it.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.440
And she was a Haole
woman-- a white woman--

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.190
from the mainland.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.270
She was a ballroom
dancer/instructor.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.570
And by all accounts, quite
a bit of an age difference.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.910
By all accounts, very different,
but enjoyed a long marriage.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.930
And Duke was married to her
for the rest of his life.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.650
And so he's now settled.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.260
We're talking 1940.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.350
He's ensconced as the
Sheriff of Honolulu.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.730
He's married.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.160
And of course, all that gets
disrupted by Pearl Harbor

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.160
in 1941.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.290
Duke is part of
the law enforcement

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.040
but not a big part
of the war effort.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.060
But it does, of course, change
again, the direction of Hawaii

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.580
and where it's going.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.480
Duke remains--
during this time--

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.790
still sort of a celebrity.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.300
I mean, he comes to the
mainland to Santa Cruz to surf,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.520
to bring a team.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.340
This is Southern California.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.920
And this was taken by
a famous early surf

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.860
photographer, Doc Ball.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.020
And this is Duke in
Orange County, like, 1949.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.440
And it's interesting.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.870
Because he gets embraced
by the surf community.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.280
The Olympic committee's there.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.620
But the Olympics are
every four years.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.480
The surfing's going nuts.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.390
And surfing is really
starting to grow

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.690
in the post-war
America, and especially

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.830
on the mainland,
Southern California

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.590
starting to rival Hawaii as
the epicenter of surfing.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:46.590
And Duke is seen as sort of
the godfather of surfing.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.430
He's the connection
between ancient surf

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.210
riding and the modern era.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.530
And they're starting to
move away from wood boards.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:57.010
They're going to the
more modern boards.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.670
And Duke has a surf team.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.690
He gets backed by a promoter.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.970
And they have a Duke
Kahanamoku invitational.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.950
I'm skipping ahead a little bit.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.490
But this is North Shore.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.870
I mean, because now, even
though those boards are

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.090
pretty big by today's
standards, they

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.970
are a lot more maneuverable.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.210
They've got fins
and people have been

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.880
starting to surf the North Shore
starting from the late '50s.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.480
So that becomes the
epicenter of surfing

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.280
in Hawaii, the North Shore.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.750
And these are three
of those gentlemen

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:32.880
are still alive today.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.050
I interviewed all three
of them for the book.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.420
And they're all in the
surfing hall of fame.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.620
He opened up his club, the
Duke Kahanamoku's Club.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.350
His big act-- who he
helped make a huge star--

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.476
was, of course, Don Ho.

00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:53.394
So Don Ho broke big there.

00:42:53.394 --> 00:42:55.310
And of course, you know
the restaurants today,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.230
Duke's, like in Malibu,
and also in Hawaii,

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.399
and in Orange County, they're
not connected with that Duke

00:43:01.399 --> 00:43:01.940
Kahanamoku's.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.130
But it was that initial idea.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:08.280
And in a sense, Duke was
one of the first athletes

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.040
to be branded, what we
would call branded today.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.610
And it was about creating
surfboards and a club

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.320
and that sort of thing.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.200
He was still trotted
out when need be,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.750
when President John
F. Kennedy came.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.340
I tried really hard to
make a connection with Duke

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.750
and President Obama
because, of course,

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.050
President Obama was
born in '61 in Hawaii.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.480
And I tried.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.190
I'm not sure how
successful I was.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.970
But I'm hoping he
reads the book and lets

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:42.050
me know if there's any anecdotes
for the paperback edition.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.980
And he's honored.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.740
I mean, now he's an older man.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.190
He's in his late 70s.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.200
He's there at the Swimming Hall
of Fame, Johnny Weissmuller,

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.720
Buster Crabbe.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.090
But like I said, he's
really more connected

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.640
with the surf community.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.030
For various reasons, in
part by the promotion.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.410
And in part, because surfing
gets really super sexy

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.410
in the '60s.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.290
You've got Gidget.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:09.090
You've got the Beach Boys,
Dick Dale, that sort of thing.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:13.490
Duke's health starts
failing in the late '60s.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.980
He has some illnesses
and ailments.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.610
He's looking a
little bit old there.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.860
He dies in 1968, which
was the same year--

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.900
people have pointed out--
as "Hawaii Five-0"--

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.160
the original "Hawaii
Five-0"-- comes on the air.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.870
So there's your life span.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.080
You know, Queen Liliuokalani to
"Hawaii Five-0" and "Book 'em,

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.670
Danno!"

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:38.260
And his funeral was one of
the biggest beach boy funerals

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.590
on the beaches of Waikiki.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.630
And Nadine, his widow,
is in the white.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.220
And that's on the beach.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.520
And they take out his
ashes into the ocean

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.330
and sprinkle them, the
traditional beach boy funeral.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:58.310
So I'll wrap this up and
again, welcome your questions

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.120
afterwards.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.400
His legacy, of
course, is extensive.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.200
I mean, they rallied
to do a postage stamp.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.690
He's the godfather of
surfing, so much so

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.110
that in 1999, they called him
the surfer of the century.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:18.810
He hadn't surfed in 50 years.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.080
That's his legacy.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.910
He's the touchstone to the
ancient days of Hawaii,

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.360
to those traditions,
to the modern era.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.090
And of course, to today,
turning 125 this summer.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.430
And as you can see,
even Google just

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.610
said surfboard,
surfboard, surfboard.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:41.530
And as well it should.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.430
Because that's what we'll know.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:44.920
But I mentioned the branding.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.890
I think that was an
important element.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:51.650
And I do also want to point
out-- as I've talked about,

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:56.640
touched on during this talk--
his role as a racial pioneer.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.710
And I think that
was been ignored.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:03.550
People talk about Jesse Owens
and Joe Louis and Jack Johnson

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.850
and well and good
heroes and pioneers.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.650
And I think sometimes Duke
has been lost in that shuffle.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:14.750
And I hope this book
brings that out.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.594
So thank you for your attention.

00:46:16.594 --> 00:46:17.510
And thanks for coming.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.160
And I would love to
welcome your questions.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.100
AUDIENCE: So I've been to
the Outrigger Canoe Club.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.420
And there's a
plaque on the wall.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.800
And it says that
he was a member.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.660
So I guess maybe later
they made him a member?

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.540
DAVID DAVIS: Correct.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.290
Correct.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.330
They were shamed into it.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:37.620
But after his Olympic heroics,
and after he was supported

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.670
and his nickname was
the Ambassador of Aloha.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.510
And there's still a
big statue of Duke

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.840
on the beach in Waikiki.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.010
Once that happened, once
they, the business interests,

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:54.830
realized that he was an asset to
Hawaii and to promoting Hawaii,

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:55.720
yeah.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.380
They brought him into the fold.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.370
And it's controversial to
this day, a little bit.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.000
Because when his widow
passed away some years

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.490
after his death, the legacy
of his name and likeness

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:14.630
went to a nonprofit, but
controlled by the Outrigger.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.740
And a lot of Hawaiians
were upset about that.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.590
Because it was
usurping the name,

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.340
the Kahanamoku name,
under the Outrigger,

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.230
which had turned him away.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.474
But yes, he was a member
starting from the late teens,

00:47:28.474 --> 00:47:29.890
and then for the
rest of his life.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:33.745
And he made that one of
his one of his locales.

00:47:33.745 --> 00:47:34.620
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.670
DAVID DAVIS: Thank you, yeah.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.390
AUDIENCE: You alluded
to some controversy

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.252
about his first Olympics.

00:47:40.252 --> 00:47:41.890
Can you say something
else about that?

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.540
DAVID DAVIS: Sure.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:50.162
In 1912, in Stockholm--
so the 100 meters,

00:47:50.162 --> 00:47:55.190
I guess there were three
Americans competing

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.180
to make it to the finals.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.730
And they came out after
winning the quarter finals.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.230
And they were told
by their coaches,

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.410
oh, the semifinals
are the next day.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.860
So they all retreated
to the ship.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.390
That was the athletes'
village back then

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.990
for the American team.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.350
The athletes slept on the ship.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.320
They didn't realize, or they
got the wrong information.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.350
And the semi's were that night.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:23.090
And the three
Americans missed it.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.680
They missed the race.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.050
Technically, they should
have been disqualified.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:31.410
And there were several
countries, athletes

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.360
who said, hey, they're done.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.420
Apparently some of the
Australian contingent athletes

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.650
said, hey, that's unfair.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:39.760
This is 1912.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760
Hey, that's unfair.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.932
That's not good sportsmanship.

00:48:43.932 --> 00:48:47.150
You can't penalize them for
just missing a start time.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.470
So the swimming powers
that be met and came up

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:56.670
with a compromise, which was
they got another heat to race.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.130
And Duke was able to win
and qualify for the finals.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:04.030
And then in the finals, he wins.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.310
But this was over several days.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.090
And so when you read the
newspapers from back then,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.720
the headlines are
"Kahanamoku misses

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.970
race," or "Disqualified."

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.670
And so it took days before
they could figure this out

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:17.820
in Hawaii.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.360
And remember, back then
it's telegraph and so forth,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.900
communication wise.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.910
It's not quite the
Google aspect of things.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.950
So there was a lot
of controversy.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.570
And that gentleman
who spearheaded

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:36.380
the Australian contingent
saying, hey, let Duke race

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.310
was a guy named Cedric Healy.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.640
And Duke beat him.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.620
Cedric Healy got
the silver medal.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.350
So his good sportsmanship
maybe cost him a gold.

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.110
And unfortunately,
just on a postscript,

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:54.720
Cedric Healy was killed at
Gallipoli in 1915 or 1916.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.040
But yeah, that was
the controversy.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.490
