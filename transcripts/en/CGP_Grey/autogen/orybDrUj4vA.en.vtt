00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.283
 Hello network! 

00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.483
 You know that I like videos about voting. 

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:05.003
 Here are some that can help organizations 

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.562
 Optimize its election method 

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.718
 But normal people also need better election methods. 

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:10.960
 Suppose you and a group of people are deciding 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.252
 What should I eat for dinner? 

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:13.360
 And there are three options: 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.915
 Meat shed - all day meat 

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.219
 Vegetable Villa - I hope you like lettuce 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.878
 And the burger house - forever burger 

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:19.906
 (including meatless burgers?) 

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:21.384
 Just ask people to choose their favorite 

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:24.076
 Normally, three carnivores will be produced. 

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:25.355
 Now you can take advantage of the following 

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:27.131
 I have talked about better methods before. 

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.259
 But really, who wants to use 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.744
 Pen, paper and nerd 

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:31.316
 To solve one can 

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:33.507
 Questions that can be answered in less than 30 seconds? 

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.096
 So here is one of the fastest in a group 

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:36.299
 And no need for anything 

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.331
 Don't blink! Otherwise you will miss it! 

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:38.665
 If you want a meat shed, raise your hand! 

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:39.936
 If you want a hamburger house, please raise your hand! 

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.445
 If you want a restaurant, please raise your hand! 

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:42.018
 boom! 

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:42.599
 End of election 

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:43.887
 Hamburg House 

00:00:43.887 --> 00:00:45.557
 This time, everyone has a living 

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:47.553
 What is the difference? Give more than once 

00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:48.744
 Voting opportunity 

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:49.584
 If you are in a group and want to go quickly 

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.733
 Different choices to make a decision 

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.964
 Then you should do this 

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:53.854
 Stop talking is usually earth-shaking 

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.696
 such as 

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:56.710
 In the classroom 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.392
 Children! We are going to watch a movie today! 

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.996
 Because, I can't... 

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:01.834
 So start now 

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.004
 Terminator 2's raise hand 

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.117
 Spirited Away 

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.094
 Waley's hand raised 

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:05.944
 OK, it is the power 

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:07.910
 Lazy tips! If you are responsible for this election 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.976
 You don't have to pay attention 

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:10.130
 Those who want to vote more than once 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.257
 An aspiring dictator who subverts democracy 

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:13.575
 Cast more than once 

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:14.604
 Is the focus 

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:15.430
 So next time you are in a group of people 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.112
 I want to decide something 

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:17.543
 Don't just ask what they want most. 

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.324
 To ask all the OK 

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:20.448
 Is the best way to decide things quickly 

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:23.596
 And don't need pen, paper or nerd
