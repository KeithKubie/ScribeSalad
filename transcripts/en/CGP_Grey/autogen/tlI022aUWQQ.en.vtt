00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.569
 What is reddit? 

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.587
 For a large part of the internet, reddit is the gateway for everything 

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:05.910
 which is interesting in the world. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.090
 Reading Reddit.com is just like reading the newspaper, except that reddit 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.200
 - current - interactive 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.490
 - personalized - participating 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.769
 - and sometimes terribly absorbent 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 ... in short, * is good *. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.060
 How it works is that people submit links on reddit (blog posts, pictures or videos) 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.169
 and other people vote these links up or down. It is a simple concept but it makes reddit 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.739
 a list of the best things that people are now reading or watching on the Internet. 

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:31.338
 The name is a contraction of 'Read it' as in 'Read all', what, if you 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.728
 Spends a lot of time on the site, you say to everyone 

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:38.190
 that you want to show something. It's a nice curse. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.230
 Because there are no editors on reddit you never know what you will find but you 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.920
 can bet that it will be funny or interesting or outrageous because thousands of others 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.460
 have voted that it is worth seeing. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 Look at it this way: if Google is the place to look for things, 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.289
 then reddit is the place where you go to see what people have found. 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.082
 But reddit is not just one list of things: reddit is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.440
 a nice branch with parts, called subreddits. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.820
 If you only like politics or programming or funny pictures with inscriptions or sports or world news, 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.870
 there are subreddits with only that subject. And there will probably be a subreddit for you 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 city, country or region. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.330
 Do you like a TV show that ended years ago? There is a subreddit that people are still talking about 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.010
 as if it is just over. 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.100
 Tech geeks have their technology and flag geeks have their vexillology and - on the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.250
 small chance that what you are interested in does not yet exist, you only have to press a button 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.060
 and a new subreddit is born. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 Each subreddit works as the main page: an updating list of interesting things according to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390
 the people interested in those things. 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.880
 And when a subreddit becomes large, it can become terribly good at it: for example, AWW, 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.950
 a portion devoted to cuteness, a GLOBAL 24-HOUR BATTLE TO CUT THE MOST ADVERTISING PLATES 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.680
 EVER! 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.310
 If you give people with baby animal photos a place to compete with their baby animal photos 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.530
 you get the highest density of cuteness that human civilization has created so far. 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 But without editors who manage the site, how does the sorting process work? There is no 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.670
 time to dive into the code, but you can see it like this: 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.440
 Links that people submit are balloons that float up and down the list. When someone 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 voting up a link enters a little helium and voting down takes out a little helium. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.240
 Every time reddit puts weights on all balloons - giving newer links a chance 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 get to fight against those who have been around a bit longer. 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.081
 This method is bizarre good at sorting things, may it be international politics 

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.400
 or photos of computer setups. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 Of course, when a site includes all human endeavors, weird things can pop up: such as subreddits 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.980
 for only photos of birds ... with arms or only photos of Hitler ... with socks and then there are 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.970
 always the other kind of photos that people like to look at and sometimes collections 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 of terrible things that can no longer be seen unseen 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.480
 So yes, this has taken a bad turn. But remember that reddit can be weird not because 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.310
 reddit is weird because people are weird. And the great thing about reddit is that 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.480
 changes to you: when you participate in subreddits that you like and depart from that you don't like 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.410
 the main page will be yours: a summary of the best of all subreddits you follow 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.710
 and not the things you don't follow. 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.030
 So reddit is like life: it is what you make it. 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.819
 But links are only the top of the redditberg, because people can discuss the links and this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.030
 is where the true nature of reddit lies. 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.990
 Most forums on the internet are ugly, but reddit is not your grandma's bulletin board. 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.060
 Just as the balloon sorting method finds the best links, there is somewhat more difficult mathematics 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.260
 (and less understandable) that finds the most interesting comment in a discussion and it 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.780
 brings up. And reddit displays comments in such a way that it encourages discussions. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.080
 (Not like some * other * systems). 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.240
 This sorting and threading ensures that the discussion of a link always 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.030
 is more interesting than the link itself. 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.930
 For example, there are subreddits that * are * only discussions: such as the Change My View for debates 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.060
 or Ask A Scientist where experts answer questions. And there is 'IamA' where people say what they say 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.340
 are "I am a firefighter" or "I am an escort" or "I am a prison officer" and answer questions 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 in the comment. 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.040
 And because people are anonymous on reddit, discussions are always more interesting and open 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.670
 then when you are forced to use your real name. :: kuch :: YouTube &amp; Google+ Integration :: kuch :: 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.930
 Although, with anonymity, you see that not everyone's private thoughts revealed are beautiful. 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.959
 And sometimes it is unpleasant to see what a faceless group thinks about a subject. 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.470
 But luckily reddit has a way to deal with unhelpful comments. And despite 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.110
 it is clear to the people who behave badly that reddit can only exist because the majority 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.150
 even while they are anonymous, is good. 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.489
 However, this anonymity is not necessary, so you can also be actors, writers, presidents 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.840
 and find prime ministers on reddit who answer community questions. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.440
 And reddit is really a community with its own culture and history and that one always 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.420
 has a greater effect on the physical world with things like: meeting in real life and collecting money 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.579
 for charity and defending the internet and helping a family with their sick child 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.169
 and hold the world's largest lottery draw and send teachers the necessary materials. 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.189
 With her lightning-fast democracy and shockingly fast responses, you can sometimes save 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.490
 make you feel more like a resident of the internet than a resident of your own country. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.939
 But in the end it is difficult to understand reddit without just jumping in, commenting and 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.300
 to vote, what you really should do. And once you get the hang of it, you will 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 you wonder how you ever used the internet for this. 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:05:03.126

00:05:03.277 --> 00:05:06.920
 PS If you already use reddit and you like the site, consider buying reddit gold 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.949
 to support it. I was surprised to learn that while making this video it 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.370
 increasingly popular it is still not profitable. So if you, like me, reddit 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.219
 * used all day *, it is worth a few euros per month.
