00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:16.600
Today lots of girls play sports.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.863
But, for a long time,
girls were not encouraged

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:19.557
to kick,

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:20.225
throw,

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.809
run,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:21.517
jump,

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.103
shoot,

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:22.602
slide,

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.479
or hit like boys.

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:26.316
So, why did things change?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.777
And how much have they changed?

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.527
Are girls and boys treated equally

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.445
when it comes to sports?

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.550
To begin to answer these questions,

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:36.763
we have to look back.

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.467
In 1972, Congress passed
a law called Title IX,

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:42.204
which protected girls and women

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:43.873
from discrimination in schools,

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:44.458
colleges,

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.465
and universities.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.098
This included discrimination
in school-sponsored sports.

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:53.806
At that time, only 15%
of college athletes were women,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.917
and in high schools,

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:57.595
only 7% of athletes were girls.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.916
Female athletes didn't get
a lot of support either

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.379
and often had to provide
their own uniforms and equipment.

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:07.522
It was Title IX that forced
school administrators

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.732
to make sports more equal.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:12.485
But what does equal mean in sports?

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.938
The government developed rules

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:17.136
to measure equality
under two general categories:

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.116
participation

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.659
and treatment.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.708
In the early days of Title IX,

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:23.997
the number of girls
playing sports was so low

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:25.831
that it would have been very difficult

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:28.541
for schools to suddenly provide
exactly the same number

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.882
of opportunities for girls and boys.

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:33.005
Instead, the government wrote rules

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:36.088
that gave schools three options, or tests,

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:39.709
to demonstrate fairness
in opportunities for girls.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.052
The three tests are

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.343
proportionality,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.516
progress,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.102
and satisfied interests.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:49.959
A school can pick which test to follow.

00:01:49.983 --> 00:01:52.222
Proportionality means
that girls should receive

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.482
the same percentage
of athletic opportunities

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:57.441
as the percentage of girls
in the student body.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.340
So, if 51% of students are girls,

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.079
then girls should have approximately

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:05.287
51% of the opportunities to play sports.

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:07.608
The second test, progress,

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:09.732
requires schools to make up for the days

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.649
when girls had fewer opportunities

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.346
by adding new sports for girls
on a regular basis.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.014
The third test asks if girls interested

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.018
in athletics are satisfied.

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.133
Under this test, a school
must regularly ask

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:26.149
female students what sports
they are interested in

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:28.552
and also take into consideration
the popularity

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:29.957
of certain sports in the area

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:32.357
where the school is located.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:36.538
It must, then, add teams according
to the girls' interests.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.337
Another important part of Title IX

00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.373
is that it doesn't just look at how many

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:43.542
athletic opportunities
are available to each sex

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.878
but whether those opportunities
are of equal quality.

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.549
Specifically, Title IX requires equality

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.675
between boys and girls teams for things

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.180
like equipment and supplies,

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:54.096
publicity,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.168
the scheduling of games
and practice times,

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:58.378
and the quality and number of coaches.

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:00.603
Girls should also have equal access

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:01.862
to locker rooms,

00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:04.105
practice spaces,
and competitive facilities,

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.441
as well as medical services.

00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:09.275
So, if the best time to play
basketball is on Friday nights

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.123
because that's when
most parents and fans can come,

00:03:12.147 --> 00:03:14.531
then the girls and boys teams

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.917
should take turns playing on Friday night.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.549
If boys teams play
in a stadium with lights,

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:20.210
scoreboards,

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:21.420
and concession stands,

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:24.215
then girls teams must have
the same opportunity,

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.257
either by sharing those facilities

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:29.066
or getting their own of equal quality.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.390
But, as we all know,

00:03:30.414 --> 00:03:32.430
just because a law exists

00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:34.512
doesn't mean that everybody follows it.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:36.060
School officials are responsible

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:38.603
for making sure there
is fairness in sports,

00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:39.936
but you can help, too,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.275
by keeping an eye on your own school.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.724
Look around.

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:47.255
Are there a lot more boys
than girls who play sports?

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.364
Is the boys' soccer field
better than the girls'?

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:54.612
Are athletic trainers available
to all teams equally?

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:57.308
Does the baseball team get
new uniforms every year,

00:03:57.332 --> 00:04:00.654
while the softball team gets
them every three years?

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:03.471
If you think there might be
inequality in your schools,

00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:05.437
you can approach a school administrator,

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:06.149
a parent,

00:04:06.173 --> 00:04:07.750
or the Office of Civil Rights,

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:10.078
a government agency
that makes sure schools

00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:12.054
comply with Title IX

00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:14.400
because equality
is important for everyone,

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.281
both on the field and off.
