00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's try a diagram. As always, I represent the object as just a box.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing I'm going to try is M₁g downwards.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Note that M is 2 here and g is always 10, so this is going to equal 20N.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We say that he can pull with the force of 25N--that means the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
net upwards force would be 25 minus 20.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's call that FTotal. 25-20=5N, and now we're making progress.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We know that F=ma and the key and this is where you may have made a mistake

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is that this the force we used--the total force after all the balancing has worked itself out 5N.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And when I worked this out, I find the acceleration is 2.5 m/s².

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
All right! Let's do a more challenging one.
