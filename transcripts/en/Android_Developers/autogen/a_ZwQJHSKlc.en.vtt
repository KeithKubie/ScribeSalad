use the first application screen as a
 

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.979
use the first application screen as a
new pager so you'll be able to spike

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:33.989
new pager so you'll be able to spike
 

00:10:33.989 --> 00:10:36.949
new pager so you'll be able to spike
left and right but in that case I think

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959
left and right but in that case I think
 

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:41.629
left and right but in that case I think
I will leave the map tab completely out

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639
I will leave the map tab completely out
 

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.929
I will leave the map tab completely out
and put it somewhere else

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:43.939
and put it somewhere else
 

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:50.359
and put it somewhere else

specified at that point so I think

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720
specified at that point so I think
 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.809
specified at that point so I think
mainly to put the small search button in

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:05.819
mainly to put the small search button in
 

00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:09.939
mainly to put the small search button in
the action bar which will then call the

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:09.949
the action bar which will then call the
 

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:18.859
the action bar which will then call the
map screen from this screen I think we'd

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:18.869
map screen from this screen I think we'd
 

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:21.470
map screen from this screen I think we'd
encourage you to not switch the screen

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480

that and I think we mentioned this last
 

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.520
that and I think we mentioned this last
time but there's an open-source project

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:58.530
time but there's an open-source project
 

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.010

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520
machine learning exercise but with a
 

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.740
machine learning exercise but with a
video game is a lot easier you could

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:15.750
video game is a lot easier you could
 

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.990
video game is a lot easier you could

been mentioned a couple of times already
 

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.130
been mentioned a couple of times already
but I think that the solution which

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140
but I think that the solution which
 

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.140
but I think that the solution which
roman's describing actually fits in

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.150
roman's describing actually fits in
 

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.610
roman's describing actually fits in
really well with one of your key points

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620
really well with one of your key points
 

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.350
really well with one of your key points
which was the ability to plan your

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360
which was the ability to plan your
 

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.760
which was the ability to plan your
entire trip and so you sort of getting

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:10.770
entire trip and so you sort of getting
 

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.760
entire trip and so you sort of getting
away from that

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:11.770
away from that
 

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.530
away from that
I want to plan a flight I wanna book a

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:13.540
I want to plan a flight I wanna book a
 

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.270
I want to plan a flight I wanna book a
hotel and you're just saying I want to

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280
hotel and you're just saying I want to
 

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.650
hotel and you're just saying I want to
organize a trip and then there's a

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:16.660
organize a trip and then there's a
 

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.630
organize a trip and then there's a
logical workflow that sort of goes there

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640
logical workflow that sort of goes there
 

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.190
logical workflow that sort of goes there
so if you haven't done one of those

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200
so if you haven't done one of those
 

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.840
so if you haven't done one of those
elements you kind of prompted that hey

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:21.850
elements you kind of prompted that hey
 

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.970
elements you kind of prompted that hey
you booked a hotel but how you gonna get

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:23.980
you booked a hotel but how you gonna get
 

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.190
you booked a hotel but how you gonna get
there so you know being able to sort of

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200
there so you know being able to sort of
 

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.360
there so you know being able to sort of
flow it that way could be quite

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.370
flow it that way could be quite
 

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.770
flow it that way could be quite
interesting particularly if you can have

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:28.780
interesting particularly if you can have
 

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.810
interesting particularly if you can have
it enter from whichever vector people

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:30.820
it enter from whichever vector people
 

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.550
it enter from whichever vector people
want to you know want to start no and

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:32.560
want to you know want to start no and
 

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.080
want to you know want to start no and
then the these sort of navigation

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.090
then the these sort of navigation
 

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.490
then the these sort of navigation
doesn't feel like you go into something

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:35.500
doesn't feel like you go into something
 

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.170
doesn't feel like you go into something
and come all the way back out it's kind

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.180
and come all the way back out it's kind
 

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.150
and come all the way back out it's kind
of a circle yeah I think that could

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:39.160
of a circle yeah I think that could
 

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.640
of a circle yeah I think that could
really really work very well cool no

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:41.650
really really work very well cool no
 

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.590

whatever was in there and then what you

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:24.350
whatever was in there and then what you
 

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.050
whatever was in there and then what you
would just type pops down and a little

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.060
would just type pops down and a little

would just type pops down and a little
hint ER the nice thing about that is you

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.890
hint ER the nice thing about that is you
 

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.170
hint ER the nice thing about that is you
never have to backspace like 30

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:29.180
never have to backspace like 30
 

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.300

of extremely annoying right the downside

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:33.560
of extremely annoying right the downside
 

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.930
of extremely annoying right the downside
of that is I didn't have the case

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:34.940
of that is I didn't have the case
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.730
of that is I didn't have the case
handled for that done on the keyboard so

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:36.740
handled for that done on the keyboard so
 

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.560
handled for that done on the keyboard so
I was thinking you clicked on it again

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:38.570
I was thinking you clicked on it again
 

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.930
I was thinking you clicked on it again
but you gave it focus again amazing done

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:40.940
but you gave it focus again amazing done
 

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.230
but you gave it focus again amazing done
and so whatever you type was gone

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240
and so whatever you type was gone
 

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.060
and so whatever you type was gone
you know I I have to say I think that

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.070
you know I I have to say I think that
 

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.470
you know I I have to say I think that
you've got a really good point there but

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480
you've got a really good point there but
 

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.210
you've got a really good point there but
I feel like there's more to it than that

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.220
I feel like there's more to it than that
 

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.640
I feel like there's more to it than that
because a lot of times is I've seen

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:51.650
because a lot of times is I've seen
 

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.080
because a lot of times is I've seen
things that do behave the way that

you're describing um in fact chrome does

you're describing um in fact chrome does
this sometimes in it it really just

00:20:59.170 --> 00:20:59.180
this sometimes in it it really just
 

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.270
this sometimes in it it really just
chills me I feel like I'm typing a

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280
chills me I feel like I'm typing a
 

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.470
chills me I feel like I'm typing a
search and what I really want is

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480
search and what I really want is
 

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.810
search and what I really want is
something very similar to one that I've

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:04.820
something very similar to one that I've
 

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.880
something very similar to one that I've
already surged but not quite exactly the

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:06.890
already surged but not quite exactly the
 

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.700
already surged but not quite exactly the
same and so I want it to autocomplete

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:09.710
same and so I want it to autocomplete
 

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.230

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:24.830
our hotel search product was that you
 

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.380
our hotel search product was that you
you were always looking at the map you

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:26.390
you were always looking at the map you
 

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.480
you were always looking at the map you
never lost this anchor which you guys

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:28.490
never lost this anchor which you guys

from the map until you had picked a

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120
from the map until you had picked a
 

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.620
from the map until you had picked a
hotel the downside of that is there's

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:35.630
hotel the downside of that is there's
 

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.690
hotel the downside of that is there's
not really room to put a big list that

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:37.700
not really room to put a big list that
 

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.970
not really room to put a big list that
needs a bunch of screen space and so

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:39.980
needs a bunch of screen space and so
 

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.320
needs a bunch of screen space and so
really it was one of those things we

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:41.330
really it was one of those things we
 

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.480
really it was one of those things we
just kind of had to give up and what I

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:43.490
just kind of had to give up and what I
 

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.010
just kind of had to give up and what I

combined list of recent searches to the
 

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.130
combined list of recent searches to the
dashboard is suddenly you haven't given

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:48.140
dashboard is suddenly you haven't given
 

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.190
dashboard is suddenly you haven't given
up that recent search a list and and I

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200
up that recent search a list and and I
 

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.480
up that recent search a list and and I
think that can can make up for it in

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.490
think that can can make up for it in
 

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.030

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:28.570
ones before but it was designed a couple
 

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.580
ones before but it was designed a couple
of years back so the design was a

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:31.590
of years back so the design was a
 

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.149
of years back so the design was a
well it was okay at that time but now

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159
well it was okay at that time but now
 

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:38.240
well it was okay at that time but now
was outdated so we decided to have a new

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.250
was outdated so we decided to have a new
 

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.649
was outdated so we decided to have a new
revamped design that well so we did a

00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659
revamped design that well so we did a
 

00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.029
revamped design that well so we did a
new version of the way the application

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039
new version of the way the application
 

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.909
new version of the way the application
we decided to have a flat design with

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919
we decided to have a flat design with
 

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:49.430
we decided to have a flat design with
flat buttons we decided to have it same

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440
flat buttons we decided to have it same
 

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.000
flat buttons we decided to have it same
color palette that we have in the first

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.010
color palette that we have in the first
 

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.909
color palette that we have in the first
booking.com website so actually the

00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919
booking.com website so actually the
 

00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:58.370
booking.com website so actually the
cross scheme can change because we have

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.380
cross scheme can change because we have
 

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.560
cross scheme can change because we have
the same colors on the website so that

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:00.570
the same colors on the website so that
 

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.409
the same colors on the website so that
we decided web button the the the color

00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419
we decided web button the the the color
 

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:08.419
we decided web button the the the color
identity of products particularly for an

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:08.429
identity of products particularly for an
 

00:28:08.429 --> 00:28:10.039
identity of products particularly for an
app like this it's a reasonable chance

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:10.049
app like this it's a reasonable chance
 

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:11.630
app like this it's a reasonable chance
that you can have people migrating from

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640
that you can have people migrating from
 

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.880
that you can have people migrating from
the web to the phone and vice versa so

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:13.890
the web to the phone and vice versa so
 

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.830
the web to the phone and vice versa so
having that consistent branding I think

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840
having that consistent branding I think
 

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.639
having that consistent branding I think
makes a lot of sense yeah so well we

00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:19.649
makes a lot of sense yeah so well we
 

00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:22.490
makes a lot of sense yeah so well we
decided to have this application the new

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500
decided to have this application the new
 

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.220
decided to have this application the new
version and we as already said with a

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.230
version and we as already said with a
 

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.430
version and we as already said with a
redesign it from scratch the basic

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440
redesign it from scratch the basic
 

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.110
redesign it from scratch the basic
features of the application is that you

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120
features of the application is that you
 

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.340
features of the application is that you
can actually find 12 based on the

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:34.350
can actually find 12 based on the
 

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.830
can actually find 12 based on the
checking date number head of idols and

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840
checking date number head of idols and
 

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.860
checking date number head of idols and
the number of nights and you can search

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:39.870
the number of nights and you can search
 

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.180
the number of nights and you can search
for city and then you can go for and see

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.190
for city and then you can go for and see
 

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.490
for city and then you can go for and see
for the reviews the other information

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500
for the reviews the other information
 

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.340
for the reviews the other information
the Auto Gallery for the pictures of the

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.350
the Auto Gallery for the pictures of the
 

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.460
the Auto Gallery for the pictures of the
rooms and etcetera that's right that was

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:52.470
rooms and etcetera that's right that was
 

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.990
rooms and etcetera that's right that was
the thing which we highlighted is one of

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000
the thing which we highlighted is one of
 

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.610
the thing which we highlighted is one of
the real features of the app I think was

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620
the real features of the app I think was
 

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.060
the real features of the app I think was
the gallery with the the rich photos

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.070
the gallery with the the rich photos
 

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.389
the gallery with the the rich photos
looked really really nice yeah so and

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399
looked really really nice yeah so and
 

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:05.360
looked really really nice yeah so and
then you obviously have the ability to

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.370
then you obviously have the ability to
 

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.760
then you obviously have the ability to
book the hotel and actually it also have

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:07.770
book the hotel and actually it also have
 

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.130
book the hotel and actually it also have
the ability to bookmark one so if you

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140
the ability to bookmark one so if you
 

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.880
the ability to bookmark one so if you
decided to bookmark it and review it

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:13.890
decided to bookmark it and review it
 

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.440
decided to bookmark it and review it
later with your girlfriend

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:15.450
later with your girlfriend
 

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.100
later with your girlfriend
to see if she wants to go there and you

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.110
to see if she wants to go there and you
 

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.169
to see if she wants to go there and you
can book it out afterwards if you want

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179
can book it out afterwards if you want
 

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:24.250
can book it out afterwards if you want
so it's actually only for a hotel

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.260
so it's actually only for a hotel
 

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.080
so it's actually only for a hotel
application you it's not like Hipmunk

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.090
application you it's not like Hipmunk
 

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.560
application you it's not like Hipmunk
that does almost everything in your tip

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:30.570
that does almost everything in your tip
 

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.770
that does almost everything in your tip
very well if the

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:34.780
very well if the
 

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.470
very well if the
and that's it I mean we have a couple of

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480
and that's it I mean we have a couple of
 

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.600
and that's it I mean we have a couple of
things that I think it's interesting for

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.610
things that I think it's interesting for
 

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.870
things that I think it's interesting for
developers for example we have on the

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880
developers for example we have on the
 

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.430
developers for example we have on the
booking form which is the booking page

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440
booking form which is the booking page
 

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.440
booking form which is the booking page
where you enter your personal data like

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.450
where you enter your personal data like
 

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.380
where you enter your personal data like
first name credit card and address etc

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:49.390
first name credit card and address etc
 

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.960
first name credit card and address etc
in order to validate the booking process

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:51.970
in order to validate the booking process
 

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.990
in order to validate the booking process
you have a data validation procedure

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000
you have a data validation procedure
 

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.410
you have a data validation procedure
that helps helps the user understand

00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:58.420
that helps helps the user understand
 

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.150
that helps helps the user understand
where they failed to enter the data for

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:03.160
where they failed to enter the data for
 

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.890
where they failed to enter the data for
example if they enter a number in the

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:04.900
example if they enter a number in the
 

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.320
example if they enter a number in the
first name we are not saying you did it

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.330
first name we are not saying you did it
 

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.020
first name we are not saying you did it

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.030
wrong we are going to say near the first
 

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.810
wrong we are going to say near the first
name edit text we are going to say you

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:12.820
name edit text we are going to say you
 

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.150
name edit text we are going to say you
did it wrong because there are there are

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:15.160
did it wrong because there are there are
 

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.210
did it wrong because there are there are
numbers in there there should be only

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220
numbers in there there should be only
 

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.300
numbers in there there should be only
alphabetical characters and this is a

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:21.310
alphabetical characters and this is a
 

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.450
alphabetical characters and this is a
nice thing that we didn't see another

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:24.460
nice thing that we didn't see another
 

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.680
nice thing that we didn't see another
application and well this is a one of

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:28.690
application and well this is a one of
 

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.420
application and well this is a one of
the most particular thing that we

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:30.430
the most particular thing that we
 

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.970
the most particular thing that we
created then we use a lot of caches in

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:32.980
created then we use a lot of caches in
 

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.770
created then we use a lot of caches in
order to cache the thing that we don't

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:34.780
order to cache the thing that we don't
 

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.830
order to cache the thing that we don't
load for example images that you get on

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840
load for example images that you get on
 

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.830
load for example images that you get on
the list are not the only ones so if you

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840
the list are not the only ones so if you
 

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.680
the list are not the only ones so if you
search Venice for today and you go

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:43.690
search Venice for today and you go
 

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.990
search Venice for today and you go
tomorrow and you reopen the application

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000
tomorrow and you reopen the application
 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.580
tomorrow and you reopen the application
tomorrow you're going to have the cached

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:47.590
tomorrow you're going to have the cached
 

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.430
tomorrow you're going to have the cached
content that of the regional looking

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440
content that of the regional looking
 

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.190
content that of the regional looking
everything we are going to cache the

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200
everything we are going to cache the
 

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.430
everything we are going to cache the
offers the rooms the everything almost

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440
offers the rooms the everything almost
 

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.050
offers the rooms the everything almost
everything because we want it to have

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.060
everything because we want it to have
 

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.000
everything because we want it to have
the application to be smooth and fast

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.010
the application to be smooth and fast
 

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.460
the application to be smooth and fast
very so yeah that's I think that's a

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:02.470
very so yeah that's I think that's a
 

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.080
very so yeah that's I think that's a
really key thing particularly on mobile

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.090
really key thing particularly on mobile
 

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.420
really key thing particularly on mobile
which I think people who are used to

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:06.430
which I think people who are used to
 

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.580
which I think people who are used to
developing on the web especially don't

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:08.590
developing on the web especially don't
 

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.230
developing on the web especially don't
necessarily take as much advantage of

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240
necessarily take as much advantage of
 

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.300
necessarily take as much advantage of
because for them it's like well internet

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:12.310
because for them it's like well internet
 

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.430
because for them it's like well internet
connections will always be faster the

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440
connections will always be faster the
 

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.600
connections will always be faster the
whole thing's not going to work if

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:15.610
whole thing's not going to work if
 

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.400
whole thing's not going to work if
you're online so there's you know

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:17.410
you're online so there's you know
 

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.750
you're online so there's you know
there's not really the same opportunity

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.760
there's not really the same opportunity
 

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.340
there's not really the same opportunity
but for mobile doing that caching is

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:20.350
but for mobile doing that caching is
 

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.110
but for mobile doing that caching is
vital you know it's going to cut down on

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120
vital you know it's going to cut down on
 

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.550
vital you know it's going to cut down on
your mobile traffic it's gonna make the

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:23.560
your mobile traffic it's gonna make the
 

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.290
your mobile traffic it's gonna make the
whole app just feel faster and more

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:25.300
whole app just feel faster and more
 

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.730
whole app just feel faster and more
