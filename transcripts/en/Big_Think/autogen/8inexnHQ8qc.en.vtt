I think that for all of us who are

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139
I think that for all of us who are
 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.940
I think that for all of us who are
dreaming of hoping for and committed to

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950
dreaming of hoping for and committed to
 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.810
dreaming of hoping for and committed to
creating a system that is fairer more

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
creating a system that is fairer more
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.310
creating a system that is fairer more
sustainable less unequal we all ask

sustainable less unequal we all ask
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140
sustainable less unequal we all ask
ourselves the question of where do we

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
ourselves the question of where do we
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.450
ourselves the question of where do we
fit in what do we actually do what do I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
fit in what do we actually do what do I
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.839
fit in what do we actually do what do I
do this is what other people do and I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
do this is what other people do and I
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.810
do this is what other people do and I
think there's a lot that governments can

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
think there's a lot that governments can
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490
think there's a lot that governments can
do and should do and there's a lot that

not-for-profits can and should do what
I'm very interested in is what I know

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
I'm very interested in is what I know
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200
I'm very interested in is what I know
and what we know which is which is big

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
and what we know which is which is big
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.959
and what we know which is which is big
corporate life and what we know is that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
corporate life and what we know is that
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850
corporate life and what we know is that
big corporates are very powerful they

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
big corporates are very powerful they
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250
big corporates are very powerful they
control an enormous a number of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
control an enormous a number of
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799
control an enormous a number of
resources human and Planetary Resources

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
resources human and Planetary Resources
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319
resources human and Planetary Resources
and so the transformation of big

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
and so the transformation of big
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180
and so the transformation of big
companies is a really important part of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
companies is a really important part of
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180
companies is a really important part of
the puzzle it's not the only thing but

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
the puzzle it's not the only thing but
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.470
the puzzle it's not the only thing but
it's a really important part of the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
it's a really important part of the
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.639
it's a really important part of the
puzzle so I think that the more that big

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649
puzzle so I think that the more that big
 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.399
puzzle so I think that the more that big
companies take their responsibilities

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
companies take their responsibilities
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130
companies take their responsibilities
seriously to transform the better off

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
seriously to transform the better off
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.370
seriously to transform the better off
the entire puzzle is going to be I think

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
the entire puzzle is going to be I think
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.160
the entire puzzle is going to be I think
one of the the the questions that people

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
one of the the the questions that people
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.740
one of the the the questions that people
ask all the time is is what can I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
ask all the time is is what can I
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.920
ask all the time is is what can I
personally do and I think if you're an

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
personally do and I think if you're an
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.609
personally do and I think if you're an
individual you know one of the questions

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
individual you know one of the questions
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100
individual you know one of the questions
that you can ask yourself is if you're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
that you can ask yourself is if you're
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020
that you can ask yourself is if you're
buying something you can ask where did

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
buying something you can ask where did
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.179
buying something you can ask where did
this thing come from and where is it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
this thing come from and where is it
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.990
this thing come from and where is it
going to I think if you're a normal sort

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
going to I think if you're a normal sort
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840
going to I think if you're a normal sort
of smallish sized company one of the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
of smallish sized company one of the
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550
of smallish sized company one of the
questions that you can ask yourself is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
questions that you can ask yourself is
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200
questions that you can ask yourself is
where am i leaving money on the table

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
where am i leaving money on the table
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969
where am i leaving money on the table
because basically anything that is a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
because basically anything that is a
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.230
because basically anything that is a
linear process is probably not as

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240
linear process is probably not as
 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.700
linear process is probably not as
financially efficient as it could be if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
financially efficient as it could be if
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830
financially efficient as it could be if
it were a circular process but I think

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
it were a circular process but I think
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840
it were a circular process but I think
that the that the big question that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
that the that the big question that
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780
that the that the big question that
companies large companies like - known

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
companies large companies like - known
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.929
companies large companies like - known
and and other big multinationals can and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
and and other big multinationals can and
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.120
and and other big multinationals can and
should ask themselves is where can we

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
should ask themselves is where can we
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.350
should ask themselves is where can we
collaborate

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
collaborate
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959
collaborate
where can we pre compete because there's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
where can we pre compete because there's
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389
where can we pre compete because there's
a place for competition always will be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
a place for competition always will be
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.660
a place for competition always will be
that's why business as a as a mechanism

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
that's why business as a as a mechanism
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.360
that's why business as a as a mechanism
is powerful competition is an important

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
is powerful competition is an important
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.720
is powerful competition is an important
part of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
part of
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.759
part of
that but there is also a really

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769
that but there is also a really
 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.860
that but there is also a really
important time to collaborate and I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
important time to collaborate and I
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.530
important time to collaborate and I
think that the the the journey that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
think that the the the journey that
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.699
think that the the the journey that
we're on is kind of an exploration of

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
we're on is kind of an exploration of
 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.860
we're on is kind of an exploration of
when to collaborate and when to compete

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
when to collaborate and when to compete
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.199
when to collaborate and when to compete
and I think that this is going to be a

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209
and I think that this is going to be a
 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.420
and I think that this is going to be a
really sensitive and interesting

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
really sensitive and interesting
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.440
really sensitive and interesting
conversation

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
conversation
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.860
conversation
in the years ahead because collaboration

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
in the years ahead because collaboration
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.240
in the years ahead because collaboration
with governments NGOs and other big

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
with governments NGOs and other big
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.860
with governments NGOs and other big
multinationals is going to be really

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
multinationals is going to be really
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750
multinationals is going to be really
important in some areas and by the way

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
important in some areas and by the way
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.759
important in some areas and by the way
extremely helpful if we can get

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
extremely helpful if we can get
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.640
extremely helpful if we can get
legislation that you know evens up the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
legislation that you know evens up the
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.430
legislation that you know evens up the
playing field and then continuing to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
playing field and then continuing to
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380
playing field and then continuing to
compete in areas where we can

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
compete in areas where we can
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.500
compete in areas where we can
differentiate and innovate is a really

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
differentiate and innovate is a really
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.449
differentiate and innovate is a really
important part of why business is a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
important part of why business is a
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.119
important part of why business is a
powerful force and I think the

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129
powerful force and I think the
 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.949
powerful force and I think the
combination of those two things will

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
combination of those two things will
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.190
combination of those two things will
help business to be forceful good that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
help business to be forceful good that
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.580
help business to be forceful good that
we dream it to be one of the things that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590
we dream it to be one of the things that
 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.789
we dream it to be one of the things that
I think distinguishes b-corp

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799
I think distinguishes b-corp
 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.449
I think distinguishes b-corp
certification from many of the other

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
certification from many of the other
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.449
certification from many of the other
certifications is that it's holistic but

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459
certifications is that it's holistic but
 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.569
certifications is that it's holistic but
it also allows you to double down in

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579
it also allows you to double down in
 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.210
it also allows you to double down in
areas that you really want to be

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
areas that you really want to be
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.780
areas that you really want to be
exceptional in and just be okay in areas

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
exceptional in and just be okay in areas
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.229
exceptional in and just be okay in areas
that you that you you know you're not

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239
that you that you you know you're not
 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.349
that you that you you know you're not
choosing to double down on basically and

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359
choosing to double down on basically and
 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.839
choosing to double down on basically and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.159
be impact assessment and what's
interesting for me is that simply being

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169
interesting for me is that simply being
 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.550
interesting for me is that simply being
asked those questions causes you to ask

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
asked those questions causes you to ask
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.500
asked those questions causes you to ask
yourself what kind of company you are

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
yourself what kind of company you are
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.969
yourself what kind of company you are
and what kind of company you want to be

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979
and what kind of company you want to be
 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.339
and what kind of company you want to be
so I'll give you an example we didn't we

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349
so I'll give you an example we didn't we
 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.930
so I'll give you an example we didn't we
didn't even measure the living wage we

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
didn't even measure the living wage we
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.310
didn't even measure the living wage we
didn't even know what the living wage

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
didn't even know what the living wage
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.969
didn't even know what the living wage
was took us months to work out what that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979
was took us months to work out what that
 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.190
was took us months to work out what that
you know what what what our numbers were

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200
you know what what what our numbers were
 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.280
you know what what what our numbers were
we just didn't track them and so what

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290
we just didn't track them and so what
 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.580
we just didn't track them and so what
happens is a combination of I think

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590
happens is a combination of I think
 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.400
happens is a combination of I think
three things is interesting

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410
three things is interesting
 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.780
three things is interesting
accommodation of the questions that you

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790
accommodation of the questions that you
 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.900
accommodation of the questions that you
have to answer causes the leadership of

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910
have to answer causes the leadership of
 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.140
have to answer causes the leadership of
an organization to rethink the kind of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150
an organization to rethink the kind of
 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.690
an organization to rethink the kind of
company that it wants to be secondly

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700
company that it wants to be secondly
 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.570
company that it wants to be secondly

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580
there is a transparency to the whole
 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.340
there is a transparency to the whole
process that makes it very difficult to

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350
process that makes it very difficult to
 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.960
process that makes it very difficult to
pretend to be something that you're not

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970
pretend to be something that you're not
 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.470
pretend to be something that you're not

for you to hide and I think what's
 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.220

interesting about these kinds of metrics
 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.250
interesting about these kinds of metrics
is it's not necessarily an individual

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260
is it's not necessarily an individual
 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.500
is it's not necessarily an individual
metric it's a combination of metrics and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510
metric it's a combination of metrics and
 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.260
metric it's a combination of metrics and
it's a combination of ways that you deal

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270
it's a combination of ways that you deal
 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.210
it's a combination of ways that you deal
with your people and the planet really

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220
with your people and the planet really
 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.330
with your people and the planet really

good company and if you've got poor
 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.730
good company and if you've got poor
intent a lot of the metrics out there

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740
intent a lot of the metrics out there
 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.380
intent a lot of the metrics out there
you know you can kind of duck and dive

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390
you know you can kind of duck and dive
 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.360
you know you can kind of duck and dive
but because this is pretty holistic it's

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370
but because this is pretty holistic it's
 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.950
but because this is pretty holistic it's
very difficult to do that and because

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960
very difficult to do that and because
 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.110
very difficult to do that and because
it's transparent and I think the third

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120
it's transparent and I think the third
 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.630
it's transparent and I think the third
thing that's been very interesting for

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640
thing that's been very interesting for
 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.480
thing that's been very interesting for
us and I think it's true for pretty much

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490
us and I think it's true for pretty much
 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.360
us and I think it's true for pretty much
everybody on this journey is because

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370
everybody on this journey is because
 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.950
everybody on this journey is because

a way that they don't necessarily in a
 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.570
a way that they don't necessarily in a
traditional company so what I found very

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580
traditional company so what I found very
 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.840
traditional company so what I found very
interesting in Danone is how much

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850
interesting in Danone is how much
 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.600
interesting in Danone is how much
because we made the declaration to

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610
because we made the declaration to
 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.300
because we made the declaration to
become a B Corp it opens up the question

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310
become a B Corp it opens up the question
 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.880
become a B Corp it opens up the question
of what we're trying to be and it allows

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890
of what we're trying to be and it allows
 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.220

people to ask questions about the things

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230
people to ask questions about the things
 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.290
people to ask questions about the things
that are covered in that assessment that

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300
that are covered in that assessment that
 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.910
that are covered in that assessment that
I don't think that would be asked

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920
I don't think that would be asked
 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.400
I don't think that would be asked
otherwise so I think it's a it's a

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410
otherwise so I think it's a it's a
 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.640
otherwise so I think it's a it's a
pretty interesting sort of package of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650
pretty interesting sort of package of
 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.300
pretty interesting sort of package of
things that leads to generally a good

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
things that leads to generally a good
