Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you Robert? Nice to speak to you after all these years. Yes, it's been quite a few years. I should let you know the Jad Abumrad has just wandered in. Hello. Hi Jad, this is Adrian Knowi. Last name is N. O. E. N. I'm director of the National Museum of Health and medicine. So you know why we're calling you, right? Yes. Okay. So what's the spring it on the audience? Um, I don't remember how I happened to bump into you. I don't even know how this came up. I think you and I had, um, been coke presenters at a Ted conference with Amy. That's what it was probably a decade ago. We may have been talking about, um, important events in New York or civic architecture, but I, but I do remember perking up at the phrase grants too.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Trains too. So Robert said something to you about grant's tomb. Yes. And then you turn to and say it again. Now you may know who's buried in grant's tomb, but I know it's buried in grant's tumor.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Yeah. Yes. He turns it home at the museum. She works at, there is a tumor that had been excised from the throat of president grant in the 1880s actual tissue from grant's tumor. Yes, that's right. Yes. Here we are.

Speaker 3:          01:33          Crouch. I've been National Museum of Health and medicine [inaudible] it is kept behind several locked doors, so you guys don't have an inkling of what you're about to see if we go in there now, but it's a privileged area. This is Brian Spatola. He's the collections manager and he let us down a long hallway to some doors into what? Me Back. Oh, holy moly. Oh my God. There's like a, they're twin babies and in formaldehyde look, Greens heads torsos and majority of even gotten to the tumors. Right. So he let us out of that room and into another one in the, you're sitting on a table and waiting for us is this, is this, the thing about which we spoke it is was President Ulysses Simpson grant's tumor. Oh Wow. It was resting in a box. It looked as it happened

Speaker 1:          02:23          exactly like a cigar box. Oh. Which is a little ironic. This was the guy who never ever stopped having a cigar in his mouth. He never stopped having cigars. He smoked as many as 12 cigars a day. Wow. So it was probably the cigars that made the tumor February of 1885 tissue was removed, examined, and his physicians, um, concluded that he had a squamous cell carcinoma. Mm. And ultimately he was treated for pain and died in July of 85. That same year. Well, it's pretty fast. So that's what killed president grant then it was a tumor. Yes. I didn't know that. So you see the staining that they use to bring out the details in the cells is the darkness, the tumor, the darkness is the tumor. Wow. The very stuff that, even though president grant got through Vicksburg, and then even though he came east and they fight, tried to kill him here, they tried to kill him there.

Speaker 1:          03:26          They tried to go. Then he goes and becomes president. This is what actually killed him. This is what killed him. Yeah. Can I touch it? Um, no. We may not be able to touch the actual tumor of the president of the United States, but we can touch on this subject. We can grasp this subject. We can examine this subject coming up on radio lab for the next hour. It's totally tumor. Oh, come on. Don't call back because really what we're going to talk about are not just any tumors but famous tumors, immortal tumors, deviled tumor, contagious tumors and tumors that speak up. I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm about to be confused. The big one. And I'm Jad Abumrad this is Radiolab. Stay with us.

Speaker 4:          04:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          04:19          wow.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Alright. To get things to get things rolling. This first story is about something that we thought was not possible that we hoped was not possible. We learned it from, uh, I'll make it work from this Guy David Coleman. I'm a science journalist. He is, I think my favorite in my generation. I think he is the best writer that writes about science. I specialize in evolutionary biology and travel on assignment to far away places and interesting situations. All right, so first of all, where are you going to take us to? What part of the world? I'm going to take you to

Speaker 6:          04:54          Tasmania, which is the island state off the south coast of Australia. You know, you go to Australia and you think of rock and deserts and red dirt and heat, but you keep going south all the way off the south coast. Suddenly you have these rolling green countrysides, lots of wallabies. One was species of kangaroo that like on New England countryside with wallabies that the, exactly with small kangaroos hopping around.

Speaker 1:          05:24          But our story does not actually be king in Tasmania. Nope. It starts in Holland with a gentleman by the name of Christo Bosh. Is that bar as in B a r Bosh? Christo bars is a wonderfully independent spirited plumber, a plumber, plumber guy do to make a living on the photographing is for me a big hobby. We don't know just how great a plumber he is, but he's a very good wildlife photographer and he looks for interesting animals to shoot with the camera. I mean, so over the years, very often he puts down his range and he travels. Yeah. Well we don't have that many animals here in Holland. A little bit of road deer and sometimes a Fox. And in the early nineties he goes to take his latest photography sabbatical in Tasmania have gone to a Tasmania on boat. And where you there to take pictures of Wellby's or Kangaroos?

Speaker 1:          06:18          No, no, no, no. He was there this time to photograph devils. Tasmanian devils. Yeah. I quite liked the animals. What is, I mean, I know the cartoon, but what does a real Tasmanian Devil Alexi look like? Whether are about as big as a little pit bull, but look a little bit more like a bear cub. Huh? White Yolk on its chest. Big Set of formidable teeth. They'll eat almost anything. Anything, anything that could [inaudible] Kelp, maggots and fish, snakes, garbage cans, the occasional rubber boot, you name it. Anyway, when crystal gets to Tasmania, he drives up the coast. He finds dead animals on the road, you know, roadkill, roadkill from the road to use as bait. What sort of roadkill? Kangaroos? A little devil. Can eat a kangaroo. Oh yeah. When there are three, four, five together, ate a big kangaroo in an hour is gone. Wow. So he takes the dead kangaroo, drags it to clearing in the forest, sets up his photography equipment. Very close. And then what happens? Well you just wait

Speaker 5:          07:16          [inaudible] so he waits and as the night falls little black ships, we can creep under the, you can hear them sniffing on the refine the roadkill.

Speaker 7:          07:34          Ah.

Speaker 1:          07:35          And then I just started eating and fighting with each other.

Speaker 5:          07:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          07:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          07:46          this squad scary. If you don't know what you're eating as the crystal Danny at a safe distance English shadows takes, yeah. Over the years he's done this over and over and over, but he always sees lots of devil devil's in front of his lenses. Sometimes 20 devil's running around, devil's in his kitchen or come into your tent. Devil's everywhere. Let after a bunch of trips,

Speaker 1:          08:24          something happened. It was Easter 1996 he was in the park watching a dead kangaroo and waiting for the devils to show. But only thing I saw was one devil, just one. Hey Dadada, I'll try another spot at another spot. Tried it at two devils. They're not gone entirely, but they're scarce. And you notice something strange about one or two of the devils. It was something on the faces fasion on the backend, on their mouth and something that looked like a growth, a large, ugly growth. Well, maybe a, they've been bitten or fighting with each other and been on that, but it was really big, you know, and blood coming out. And this was the first alarm bell.

Speaker 1:          09:16          So crystal, you were the first to see it. And this was just the beginning, like a pie out of hell and dark death is sweeping Tasmania. Trouble reporters got the stone fronted, anything like this and began reporting that more and more Tasmanian devils had these lumps on their faces. They fill the ice sockets, they puff out the lips, they infect the gums. It's really sad and hideous and whatever they were, they turned out to beat lethal. To jump ahead a little bit, the effect that it's had in the population, in some cases, devil populations collapsed by 90% died off very quickly. Scientists looked at the disease and determined that it was some kind of tumor cancer, a cancerous tumor. And then the question was what's causing them? So what, what, what did they think? Well, the toxic chemical was guest number one, some poison or pesticide from the environment.

Speaker 1:          10:08          Yes, number two was a virus. So they tested in places where the doubles live looking for something toxic or some virus and they found nothing. And then along comes a woman named Anne Marie Pierce. She looked at some tumors close up, um, very close up from 11 different devils. So she's looking at the first tumor and she found that the chromosomes were sort of mangled, which isn't really that strange because that's what cancer is. It's like your genetic stuff gone screwy. Right? But then she looked at the tumor from the next devil and she found not just also mangled chromosomes, but chromosomes that were mangled in exactly the same way as they had been in the first devils. So now she looks at a third identical metaphor, identical, and then a fifth identical 11. Exactly the same pattern in each [inaudible] does that I, I feel the sensation of all, but I don't quite have these understanding attachment. Does that mean that that these tumors are all brothers? What that meant was that these tumors were all genetically identical. They were all the same tumor. How can they all be the same tumor? Well, they can't because, because that wouldn't mean that these Tasmanian devils caught the cancer and from some other Tasmanian Devil. Exactly. Wait, what do you mean exactly? You can't catch cancers. Epidemic of cancer in Tasmanian devils was a crazy impossible tumor that was jumping

Speaker 7:          11:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:45          that was leaping from one devil to another.

Speaker 7:          11:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:50          raping tumor. Yeah, a leaping tumor.

Speaker 3:          11:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:54          [inaudible] point in this tale where we really have to question everything that we thought. We knew.

Speaker 3:          11:59          No cancer.

Speaker 8:          12:02          Now most people think of cancer as like a situation in which one of your cells

Speaker 9:          12:09          starts replicating and it doesn't stop. It replicates uncontrollably until it destroys you.

Speaker 8:          12:25          Okay, so that's like the one cell theory, which is frankly how I thought cancer worked. Oh Peter, we have to go ahead. Just start. But then we spoke with this fellow. Yup. His name is Carlo Maley, cancer biologists at the Wistar Institute. And he told us if you really want to understand what's happening with the devils, you're going to toss out the ones cell theory. Cause cancer is not just not just a cell going haywire. No, it's actually many cells competing, competing for space, competing for resources and in the process driving each other haywire. Like if you were to somehow go into a tumor, he says what you would find is between a billion and a trillion cells in there

Speaker 3:          13:00          [inaudible] these are different cells, this huge clump of cells in there. They're all fighting out cause you know space is tight, food is scarce. And what will happen is in the middle of this mailing list, the cells are competing, each

Speaker 8:          13:16          individual cells trying to copy itself, copy, copy Gabby. And somewhere along the way you get eventually a copying error. And every so often says Carla, one of these mistakes we'll give the new cell a new talent. And in the case of cancer it usually starts [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          13:35          Just something pretty simple, like the ability to slurp up food, Fester nutrients like oxygen and glucose. Now with this advantage, that mutant and all of its progeny will take over that area of the tissue,

Speaker 10:         13:49          but

Speaker 3:          13:51          not for long because now you got all these beauties and they start until randomly again, you get another copy in state

Speaker 8:          14:02          and maybe this second copying mistake gives the cell the ability to divide faster, right? So there it is proliferating faster than its neighbors and it takes over growing and displacing the other cells. But yeah, it just keeps getting worse because now you've got these double mutants, they can eat fast, they can divide quickly, and they start to fight until you get a third mutation, then a fourth, and then you just keep ratcheting it up and eventually roughly five to 20 mutations, you end up with a cell that is so gnarled, so mutated, and so powerful that it can literally spit a kind of acid

Speaker 11:         14:40          [inaudible] matrix, metallo protease that allows it to rip through the membrane barriers. And this is when you're really in trouble because now the cell can roam and so the cells leave the primary tumor, they've got dissolved their way into a blood vessel. That's a mutation. Then they've got to survive in the blood and another mutation. Then they've got to stick somewhere else yet another. Then they've got it dissolved back to the RTL heading and another. Yeah. So it sounds like cancer is always evolving to be more cancerous. It totally, yes.

Speaker 5:          15:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         15:17          this also explains why we haven't been able to cure it. Why when a person takes chemotherapy drugs, the cancer will go away for awhile, but then it'll come back

Speaker 12:         15:28          stronger cause the cells have evolved a resistance to those drugs. When I first got into work on cancer, I was impressed at how malevolent the disease seems as if it's being designed to kill us. So here's my question. Um, this leaping tumor in the devils [inaudible], is this a case where the tumor is actually evolving into a new form like after, say the 50th mutation or whatever? Like now it doesn't just have the ability to travel in a body, but it can somehow leap out of a body through the air

Speaker 11:         16:00          and into another body. Sure.

Speaker 1:          16:05          You mean the one that's really scary? Yes, it is. It is pretty scary, but, but this is amazingly rare and according to Carlo demands some pretty special circumstances. Oh, would m a Tasmanian devil would some tumor get from one individual to another? What would what? How would that happen? Tasmanian devils. God blessing bite one another in the face a lot.

Speaker 13:         16:30          They're scrambling over carcasses. They're fighting and biting, swallowing, crunching. Yan

Speaker 1:          16:40          males also bite females

Speaker 13:         16:43          during the meeting period. He's

Speaker 1:          16:45          a little bit of a rough lover. So you have the male and the female biting each other in the face. So a devil with a tumor on its face. Let's say it's meeting with another devil and it bites that second devil in the face. What exactly happens at that point? Is it just rubbing its tumor? Okay. When you think of these big ugly tumors, think of Feta Cheese and when one devil bites another, there's a tendency for the tumor to crumble. And to shed tumor cells that then fall into the wounds on the second devil. But um, some of your, I don't understand. Um, why wouldn't the immune system of the devils kill those sales prevent those cells from taking root? Yeah. Cause that's what immune systems do. And the latest answer is that, well Tasmanian devils don't have as much genetic diversity as you would expect.

Speaker 1:          17:40          Whether that means David explained to us is that the Tasmanian devil population has gotten so inbred, they are so alike at a genetic level that their immune systems now confused. They don't know the difference between their own cells and invading cells coming in from other devils. Exactly. Which doesn't actually sound like the tumor is all that powerful. So I asked Carlo Maley, you got a mutation that this is really the story of a tumor evolving more adaptive or is it just the story of a tumor getting lucky them those, I think those are the same story. How do you mean? I mean evolution is all about dumb luck. The way you explained it. It's dumb luck that the tumor was on the outside of the face. It's dumb luck that they bite each other a lot. That a cell could come along that could shed and fall into a wound. It's all dumb luck. But that he says is what makes evolution happen. That's natural selection right there. And when you step back, sometimes the results are just

Speaker 6:          18:38          nuts. Yeah, just nuts. And this is the point where we need to talk about a transmissible tumor in, in dogs, canine transmissible venereal tumor. This is a tumor. He says it's evolved way beyond the one in the devils and way longer. How long has that been going on? Well that's been going on for somewhere between 220 500 years. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Between 220 500 years. Yeah. Yes. Unit. Yes. Over to millennia. Exactly. And if that's the case then it's the oldest continuous animals cell line in existence on planet earth. You might need to say that again cause that is just too strange. It is. It is. Even stranger, it says David Kwaman. When a tumor lives this long propagates itself this long, you can only really call it one thing. This tumor is essentially an animal parasite, not a species of parasite, but one individual parasite that may never die.

Speaker 5:          19:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          20:02          David Corbin is the other song of the Dodo and natural acts.

Speaker 14:         20:06          This is David Coleman calling from tropical Bozeman radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation National Science Foundation. Any lab is produced by W N Y C and distributed by NPR and this message.

Speaker 1:          20:25          Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. The topic is totally tumor. Of course. That's my line by the way. Oh No, no, it's okay. Yeah. We've been talking about tumors this hour, famous tumors and thus far they've been really bad. Terrible tumors, really bad, very horrible tumors, but because we are fair minded about everything, even tumors, let us consider the that sometimes tumors can be rich, beautiful and desirable. For example,

Speaker 15:         20:53          well, George Malley is an ordinary man who is about to become extraordinary name as many mammals as you can in 60 seconds. How about alphabet? Are Brock Bat Caribou Dauphine OHIP this what is going on? Or you're taking this 1996 movie. John Travolta plays a guy, gets a brain tumor and the tumor, the performance makes him into a genius [inaudible] into Portuguese language in 20 minutes. Not all of it phenomenon

Speaker 1:          21:23          the accent though to where it doesn't give accents, but it does. It does raise a feel question, which is like, is it possible for a tumor to create something good? So we paid a visit to a guy, a doctor named Orrin Devinsky.

Speaker 16:         21:41          I'm a neurologist at NYU mango and school of Medicine

Speaker 1:          21:45          and Dr Devinsky has had a lifelong interest in the beneficial effects of certain kinds of brain conditions. Right?

Speaker 16:         21:51          I mean I would just tell you, I think one of the most fascinating cases in neurology very quickly, and this one we were not prepared for. A gentleman was described who ever since he was a child would look at safety pins and have an orgasm at safety pins and safety pins. The more shiny and the more numerous, the safety pin, the stronger the sexual experience. And this happened from his pubescent period. He just safety [inaudible] pretty. He made this association when you looked at a safety pin, he had an orgasm. So he got to have been embarrassed by this. This is worse than being, yeah. So he would go into pride. He realized this is not something most people do. We never talked about it. And he did it in private and then he got married after the war. He was honorably discharged and got married and then started having less sex with his wife because the safety pin was, my safety pins were much more enjoyable. Sometimes you just had to think about a safety pin, not even hold it up.

Speaker 1:          22:46          So wait, what are we seriously making the case that this guy is getting a benefit from furiously pin obsession. But I think actually you could say that the experiences that this guy was having with those safety pins gave him a kind of pleasure that maybe is unavailable to the rest of us from an odd, odd source. But you know, pleasure is pleasure until says Devinsky. This fellow began to have seizures,

Speaker 16:         23:09          got admitted to a psychiatric hospital in London and Maudsley one of the big psychiatric units. They actually got an EEG. And to make a long story short, there was a benign tumor.

Speaker 1:          23:18          Oh right in the part that's called the temporal lobe, sort of in the middle of your head, right behind your eyes.

Speaker 16:         23:22          But they took it out. They took it, they took it out and they cured him of his wonderful experience. So he, uh, he never was able to, he could look at safety pins all day long, but he would never again enjoy them the way he had for his whole life. How did he feel about that? Um, I think it was a mixed blessing as you would imagine. [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         23:49          blue jeans on sneakers and this idea that from a tumor you can get something in the not so good, but also something good. This is an idea that has, well, there has been a, a novel written on this theme. The title of the book is lying awake by a friend of mine. My name is Mark Salzman. Mark is a writer who lives out in California and he thought, I'm going to imagine a nun or main characters, sister John of the cross. This is a woman who had joined a nunnery because she felt just lonely for a relationship with God.

Speaker 12:         24:23          Yes. It's just not enough for her to tell herself. Yes, God is there. What she longs for is a tangible sense of God's presence, a sense that she can really feel God's presence in her life. And um, she, she begins having what she thinks are migraine headaches that the regular doctor that the sisters see tells her that she seems to be having migraine headaches. They're coming more and more frequently. And there comes a point when one of these headaches changes dramatically and then everything is different. Everything is different. What's different? Well, what happens? Shall I read? Yeah, go ahead. You, you kind of have to imagine this scene taking place in an environment of profound silence.

Speaker 5:          25:09          Okay.

Speaker 12:         25:09          She's in the cloister. She and one other sister that working on a sewing project, they're sewing an altar cloth. One of the pins slipped out of her hand ringing like a miniature triangle is it bounced off the floor. She looked down to the floor and saw that it looked impossibly distant when she reached down for the pin. Her hand look strangest of all as if it belonged to someone else.

Speaker 5:          25:39          [inaudible].

Speaker 12:         25:39          The silence in the room came alive like the words left out of a poem.

Speaker 5:          25:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          25:50          something buried so deep inside her, but she'd forgotten it was there. Rose to the surface sister. Are you not feeling well? God was present and sister and his voice was present in her face. Nothing was changed yet everything was changed. God is here. She answered.

Speaker 12:         26:10          You were here all along. Well this is a field goal, isn't it? For someone seeking a spiritual connection. She has one. That's right. She f this is the moment she's been waiting for all her life, but there is a problem because when these things come from, sorry, just give me, she has a tumor. Let's just get the non surprise out of the way. The show is called totally tumor. A cost of all with famous tumors. Okay. Do we do client? Yes. She has a meningioma, a benign tumor, small about the size of a raisin in the temporal lobe area of her brain. Right in the same spot where the safety pin fellow had his tomb. So the problem for her is should I have the tumor removed? Give up the most satisfying and fulfilling experience of my whole life, or should I sacrifice my health in order to share with others the experiences that I'm having? So we thought, well, Orrin Devinsky, the doctor we spoke with first.

Speaker 17:         27:11          I think every case is unique, and individuals see patients like this. This is what he does for them. So we took the case to him. Now here's the question. If a person comes and says, I'm having what I want and you are suspicious that what she also is having is a disease, what do you do about the patient? If I knew

Speaker 16:         27:33          for sure that the tumor, let's say was benign and would never grow, and the only thing that person experienced was this religious feeling that they've found extremely enjoyable, I would say, let's do nothing but do serial scans to make sure nothing grows and that you're safe. But in the book, as it happens, the nun got a little worse. She had a few more

Speaker 12:         27:53          headaches, the more severe, and they took the tumor out, the seizure activity stops. These experiences stopped coming and she does feel afterwards a sense of [inaudible],

Speaker 9:          28:09          blah.

Speaker 12:         28:12          She feels as if she sort of tumbled out of a Himalayan mountain into a muddy village.

Speaker 9:          28:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         28:19          this is common apparently in patients after they've been treated. Right.

Speaker 17:         28:23          So my last question then is really about the, it seems to me the deepest question though, all in this case is that, um, if someone has a very important and meaningful experience and you have a sense, it may be a abnormality, a physical abnormality that is triggering them, do you regard them as delusional? Like there's just the possibility here that maybe these people are having an actual conversation. So yeah, there's no question there are just, you not even consider that. No, I mean, so science, I think

Speaker 16:         28:57          the question you asked and I think you're getting at is could it truly be that this is God's avenue to speak to us? Um, and people in the late 18 hundreds thought it was through the right hemisphere. And that's often where these cases occur in the right hemisphere. So it may be that. That's right. It's the more emotional hemisphere. And when things are in a perturbed state, you may be more receptive to experiencing spiritual things. And I think there probably is some physiologic basis that allows you to tune into a broader world and maybe some states of neurologic dysfunction allow you to harmonize or tune in or receive those messages so to speak. In which case then your tumor or your would

Speaker 1:          29:42          be the window where the conduit, right. I do feel like I need to place an asterix right here. We are talking about a tumor in the end. Well, but understand that every feeling, every thought you have comes from cells in your brain. Yeah. Any of those cells can produce a glorious experience than the experienced stands on its own and sometimes in very well documented cases. These are extraordinarily profound, desirable thing. They're often hard to put into words. Have you tried, I mean when, yeah, I mean people, you know Destro Yefsky is probably the most articulate person with epilepsy who's had a religious experience and who wrote down what he experienced. I don't have the quote in front of me, but it's, you know, this Felicity, this, this a feeling I get

Speaker 17:         30:31          for several moments. He was quoting his ashes. I would experience such joy as would be inconceivable in ordinary life. I would feel the most complete harmony in myself and in the whole world and this feeling was so strong and sweet.

Speaker 5:          30:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         30:47          that for a few seconds of such bliss, I would give

Speaker 5:          30:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         30:52          10 or more years of my life

Speaker 5:          30:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         30:55          even my whole life.

Speaker 5:          30:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         30:59          perhaps.

Speaker 5:          31:06          Hi.

Speaker 18:         31:07          Hi. This is Emily calling from rainy Vancouver, Washington. Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 8:          31:31          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and our topic today is totally two minutes. Yeah, yeah, totally. What you call it, what you want. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because the topic is tumors, famous tumors and our next and final tumor related tale is one.

Speaker 1:          31:47          We're wanting to do this particular tumor story for [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          31:51          forever or after like two years ago, I think. Oh, longer than that. Yeah. It's a story that comes from a friend of mine, Rebecca Skloot. You want me to talk, make noise. That's true. I think we can move me closer to him. She's a journalist and she has been wanting to tell this story even longer since she was in the womb. I mean, she's been researching the story for 10 years. Hello, hello, hello. And she just wrote a book called the immortal life of Henrietta lacks and in the story, okay, it's about a tumor that expands and never stops. Begins in 1950 a black woman in Baltimore is in her bathroom and she discovers pretty much all on her own. Did she has cancer? Um, it's all, it's a little bit of a mystery how she initially knew this, but she knew it was there.

Speaker 5:          32:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          32:35          I'm not, she called it. She had told to her for a while

Speaker 19:         32:40          that she thought there was something wrong with her, with her womb, and she climbed into her bathroom and she slid her fingers up inside of herself and found this lump

Speaker 17:         32:51          chapter one

Speaker 19:         32:53          first she went into her local doctor. I happened to be an attending at that time. The guy she eventually ended up seeing at Johns Hopkins University. Who is this fellow? Dr. Howard Jones. I'm 98. Next month I'll be 99 wow. So when she came in to see you, can you tell me anything about what she was like? Well, she was a uh, uh, you didn't remember anything? No, I really don't. But you remember her tumor, right? Well, absolutely. I never saw anything like it before or after

Speaker 5:          33:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         33:26          and this didn't look like a normal tumor. It was, it was deep purple and about as big as a quarter, sort of shiny, very soft. That was another thing. I bet it on examination, slightly raised when you touched it, you might think it was a red Jello. There was something very strange about the way it looks.

Speaker 5:          33:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         33:44          so doctors took a sample? Yeah. So they would cut off these little teeny tiny pieces and see Haley, small King Dang bite or two, they would take a piece, put it in a tube and one would go to the lab for diagnosis. And in this case since it was Hopkins, they would take an extra piece and give it to the man named George Guy

Speaker 8:          34:02          too. So George Guy was a researcher who worked at Hopkins. He had a deal with the clinic that anytime they got a patient with cervical cancer, they'd give him a tiny piece of the tumor. What he really wanted to do, his main mission, actually, not just his scientists everywhere, we're trying to do this. They want it to find a way to grow human cells outside of a human being in a dish, in a dish. George Guy had been trying to do this, working on this for decades. And why exactly. Um, it's sort of like, it's sort of like having a little tiny bit of a person in a, in a lab that's detached from them so that you can do whatever you want with them. You know, you can't bombard some person with a bunch of drugs and just wait to see how much they can tolerate before their cells all explode.

Speaker 8:          34:45          But you can do that in cell culture. So, oh, so this is like, this is like the basic thing you need to study human biology. You need cells in a dish. Yes. Problem was anytime they tried to grow human cells in a dish, my daughters, they would die. Yeah, they die. This is George Guy's former lab assistant. Can you just tell me your name? You know, my name is so and so. My name is Mary. I'll put my maiden name in there. Oh sure. Toy Cooper cheque. Mary lives just outside of Baltimore. About an hour from where she used to work with George guys. This is Dr. Guy. Just show me some pictures and he's sitting at, at a microscope we can have, he looks, he's a, he seems like a really big guy. Like a really tall guy. He was a big guy. At least six, five judging from the picture. Yeah, he was. And in every slide that she showed me, he had kind of a crazy smile on his face. Like he's got a, like he's having a good bear if a man,

Speaker 18:         35:38          that's what I always thought up.

Speaker 8:          35:39          Oh yeah. In any case. Mary says they were completely stumped at why the human cells always died, but they just did. Yeah. So on the day that George Guy Walked in, handed Mary a two with a little chunk of a nameless woman cervical cancer inside, I knew nothing about her. No one expected anything.

Speaker 18:         35:55          No. He was doing that. Well he probably, yeah, ever hopeful. But you know, I was eating lunch and I thought, oh the heck with it. You know, it's not going to grow. I'm going to finish the sandwich. And that's what I did

Speaker 8:          36:08          three. Then I went in and she gave the, sell some food, get my usual turn on all the machines and left, came back the next day they hadn't died. So she came back the next day and they were growing and then the next day still growing. They just kept

Speaker 3:          36:27          plugging along in the next through a lot. Rebecca says they doubled in size every 24 hours. Yeah, they just grew. All of a sudden, you know, I kept transferring them and making more tubes, transferring them, making more tubes to transferring. They weren't very reliable and stronger. They just kept plugging along and alone. Meanwhile, the woman had spawned all these cells die right? Officially she died of uremia, which is a like toxicity of the blood because she wasn't able to get rid of the toxic waste. That usually goes out in your urine log in the log in the wall, not herself,

Speaker 15:         37:02          and to tell us this story, is it privileged to introduce Dr. George Guy?

Speaker 3:          37:06          It wasn't long after the George Guy appeared on TV holding in his hand a little bottle.

Speaker 15:         37:11          Now let me show you a bottle, which we have rolling my fifth quantity of caster style. So did you want to look at the photos?

Speaker 3:          37:19          Yeah. You can't really get a sense of how aggressive this tumor was until you go to the Hopkins Archives and looked at George guys pictures and videos. Okay, this is Ken here. Halo Cell Film. Then it hits you.

Speaker 15:         37:31          They use her in large 10,000 times.

Speaker 3:          37:34          Oh my God. Swirling hurricanes of cells, just like thousands of them,

Speaker 15:         37:40          some small and some very large together. Kept transferring them and making more to them under the mic. It's like something is just explode. You're going to [inaudible] just keeps getting bigger and bigger and stronger. It's indestructable, it's indescribable. Nothing can stop me.

Speaker 8:          38:02          Why? Hers just sort of took off and grew and the other ones that they had tried before, it didn't is just a little bit of a mystery. Nobody really knows fore unless George Guy knew what he had. This new cell line was what they'd all been waiting for. So early on, right after this woman died, George Guy sent Mary back down to get more cancer cells from the [inaudible].

Speaker 18:         38:24          Oh, he sent me down to the morgue. Yeah. Really? Oh yeah. So I went down there and the coroner, I don't know who he was. Dr. Guy was there too and they were standing down at her feet sort of. Yeah. Meanwhile, she's like, she's flying out there. She's already open. I got some samples, coroner. We're taking them out and getting a, Timmy, what'd she look like? I couldn't look at her face. I couldn't look at her. The only thing I looked at were her toes and they had chip nail Polish on them. And that was really like, oh this is a real person. What was it about the nail Polish that hit you? Oh cause it was chipped cause you know that she hadn't been able to take care of her nails for a long time if they got chipped like that. And it's showed that she was proud of herself. Not everyone wears nail Polish on their toes. Yeah.

Speaker 20:         39:19          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          39:20          Over the next several months while this woman's body lay decomposing in the ground, George Guy and Mary produced hundreds of thousands of her cells or tumor cells and he named them the heela strain. Heela like Heela, h e l a [inaudible]. No one would actually know why he had named them that for about two decades. But what he did with these cells, you know, we'd be unusual nowadays, like if somebody now found a cell that was special, they'd run off to the patent office and then sell it to Merck for 1 billion bucks. But George Guy, hey, just pass them out freely. Didn't try and make any money off it. It was just

Speaker 18:         39:55          nice, nice new thing that could help science.

Speaker 8:          39:58          It's Mary says that George Guy began to send Hilo all over the world. Yup. And pretty soon she was in hundreds of labs. And you know, this was in the midst of the polio epidemic season when polio was at its worst. We're talking early fifties right? Yeah. So there's 1951 52 you know, schools are being closed, kids are being kept inside

Speaker 21:         40:16          today's cruel disease. Medical science still has no complete onset.

Speaker 8:          40:20          There was this enormous effort to develop a polio vaccine. Problem was in order to develop a vaccine, you had to have enough polio virus, you know enough quantity to be able to study it in the lab. And they had no way of making enough. So whether they do, well, one of the guys, that guy, one of the guys that guy had sent the cells to, this collaborator friend of guys discovered something kind of amazing, which was that polio loved the heela sell, put polio inside a Hilo cell healer would copy and in the process make more polio, which the Super Xerox sale, no matter what you want to do, they'll look, make a copy, make a copy and make it a copy. Yeah. So now they had a way of making polio that could just be a polio factory. And so the government made a factory at the Tuskegee Institute, a real one, literally a factory. So they had

Speaker 20:         41:06          these big, you know, stainless steel and have that sort of culture medium that were sort of rotated constantly autoclaves for sterilizing all equipment, five microscopes, crazy frankensteinish gizmos. They had this machine that was like an automatic settle dispenser and it had this sort of long mechanical arm in Squirt a certain amount of this cultural medium filled with Hilo cells into it to wow, this is like the beauty of industry right here. Yeah, it is absolutely. The cells that were produced at this factory. She says, we're used to test the polio vaccine back clean to prevent that, but rather disease. The test that they were doing in north, it was the largest field trial ever done at its peak. The tests [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          41:49          he lived production center was producing about 6 trillion cells a week. Wow. Um, which is kind of inconceivable, but that was actually only the beginning says Rebecca, because this factory led to an even bigger one that was for profit. Right. And that second factory was the first time any human biological material was commercialized. So this was the first biotech company? Yeah, basically. Okay. When they first started mass producing healer, uh, what sorts of things were done to these cells? What sorts of problems were investigated? Like anything you can imagine.

Speaker 20:         42:22          So they infected the Hilo cells with every kind of virus and hepatitis e Coyne and cephalitis virus, yellow fever, herpes, measles, mumps, rabies, whatever. Like you, just any, any backs. And this was just as, there's a revolution for scientists in certain chemotherapy drugs. He loves sales went up and some of the first space missions. Really? Yeah. So they were, Hilo went into space, into space. And every time I hear what I think you'd be like [inaudible] why? I mean just because the premise was to see what happens to human cells in zero gravity, you know, if we're going to be sending people up into space and what's gonna happen to them up there? No. So Hilo went up before any humans did. Um, and then she eventually went up his, she the cells. There was actually an interesting little slip up there. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 8:          43:11          Okay. So let's actually skip forward in the story to the point where that, that slip up, you just heard that pronoun confusion gets personal. No. Well it happens. Okay. It's a late sixties and a Hilo has it led to a revolution in science and now there are hundreds of cell lines, not just he live at hundreds and somewhere along the way, scientists discover that Hella is so aggressive that she's actually been contaminating and taking over all of these other cell lines where you just had she, but I get your point. Yeah. And she does it in the way it does it in the strangest way. Keela cells can, you know, they can float on dust particles [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         43:52          they can what? Um, they can float on dust particles. Yeah. So they can, you mean they can hop out of addition, just get on a particle and just float out the door, up the stairs, down the hall, and he'll sell into a lab rops into, into a dish or cell culture where there's other sales growing. And because he was cells, her sort of powerful cells, they takeover. So on the heels of this catastrophe, someone at Hopkins decides to make a test. Let's make a test that will allow us to genetically determine if a cell is heela or if

Speaker 8:          44:31          it isn't. And to make a long story short, this desire for a genetic test led scientists and journalists to ask a question, which amazingly, for 25 years had not been asked who was this woman? And that's when we found out her name Henrietta lacks.

Speaker 3:          44:55          This is the sound of Rebecca reading. Henry had his medical records for the first time. This is a 30 year old colored woman. She's sitting with Henrietta's, his youngest daughter, Deborah, second November. So this is again when she was pregnant with you and Brianna had five kids when she died at the age of 31 most have no memory of her because they were too young. And that's especially true of Debbie.

Speaker 22:         45:18          That was only 15 months old and I don't remember anything about my mother.

Speaker 8:          45:22          Yeah. So she, you know, she, she had been her entire life just sort of longing to know who her mother was. And did she like dancing? You know, I always wanted to know what she liked to do, what she went, where she liked to eat. Did she breastfeed Deborah? She was really sort of almost fixated on that idea. She wanted to know if she was breasted.

Speaker 22:         45:43          Oh, well, you know, I don't know what I would give up just to, just to have her here as hey, just to see her

Speaker 8:          45:52          the whole, Huh. So in 1973 when a scientist calls the lacks family and Deborah hears that little bits of the mother that she never knew are still alive and oh by the way, can we take a blood test from you and your family? Cause we're having some contamination problem. We need these genetic markers, blah, blah, blah. Well, as you could imagine,

Speaker 22:         46:11          took me by surprise. It really did.

Speaker 8:          46:14          It was really confusing.

Speaker 22:         46:15          I mean, how much is it, how much of ourselves is out there? You know,

Speaker 8:          46:18          eventually she went online, did some searches and found thousands and thousands of hits. Like for instance, on Heela clones. And Deborah had heard, you know, various journalists in the past had come to her and mentioned, you know, Dolly the clone sheep and sad, you know, your mom, they did this with your mom too. Meaning that's actually where the technology started. The first cells of our cloned were Hila cells. But that was just cloning a cell, not cloning an entire being. But that distinction is very complicated, particularly for somebody who doesn't know what a cell is. Yeah. Um, so Deborah, between what journalists had told her and googling Henrietta lacks and clone thought there were thousands of clones of her mother around. And really, you mean like a bunch of Henrietta's thousands walking the streets, walking around. And Rebecca says that one of Debra's biggest fears was bumping into one of these clones.

Speaker 8:          47:05          She said, you know, she would say, I would have to go talk to her and she wouldn't know that I was her daughter and, and, and I don't know that I could handle that. Wow. It sounds so fantastical. Like how could someone believe that? Are Copies of her mother walking around? But at one point 25 years after their mother died, someone called and said, Hey, part of her still alive. And you know, we've grown enough of her so that it could wrap around the earth several times. At that point, all bets are off. Yeah, right, exactly.

Speaker 19:         47:31          Not to mention that it's actually not that crazy because your DNA is in your cells. So if your cells are taken out of you and they still grow, well, isn't that still you alive? It's of you. But it's clearly not you and the then it's going on. [inaudible] it's a funny middle space, that's for sure. Yeah, so here's what happened is Rebecca went off in search of Henrietta lacks. Every so often Deborah would come along and sit with her as they interviewed, you know, anyone they could find friends, family, and eventually over many, many years, a picture does emerge of who this woman is. She was born in, in Roanoke, 1920 Virginia and I think she was the 10th of the 11 children, but apparently she was the one that stood out. Everybody talked about her as just being, you know, she was the cat.

Speaker 9:          48:26          Oh my goodness. I don't think I could top her.

Speaker 19:         48:29          This is Sadie Sturdivan Henrietta's cousin.

Speaker 9:          48:32          That's a beautiful girl. I was doing it for myself, but hit it was very pretty Grana. Oh Hey.

Speaker 19:         48:39          And this is Henrietta's sister Gladys

Speaker 9:          48:41          and completion.

Speaker 19:         48:43          Everyone that they spoke with zeroed in on the same few points. Like first she was really meticulous about her nails, always painted them red. It's very deep. Red And second Henrietta just had this, she was very strength, forthright, very sassy.

Speaker 8:          49:00          Like yourselves. Now, the unfortunate thing is that when it comes to her life, you know how she lived. There's not a ton of detail.

Speaker 20:         49:10          Totally. So this is when she crushed my hand with your cancer.

Speaker 8:          49:12          But in that hotel room, when the two of them, we're flipping through the medical records, they did start to get some detail about how she died. Things I want to take notes about. Was she in a lot of pain when she died? Yeah, I heard this was the hardest thing that she was eventually in an unbelievable amount,

Speaker 20:         49:31          Dean's complains of pain in the right lower quadrant,

Speaker 19:         49:34          wailing and crying and you know, moaning for the Lord to help her. And according to the records, doctors tried everything. Morphine, they injected a hundred percent alcohol straight into her spine.

Speaker 20:         49:44          I the pain spider, the alcohol injection last week. And she would have these fits of pain

Speaker 9:          49:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          49:52          to spasms where this waves of pain would hit her and she would rise up out of the bed and thrash around. So they strapped her to the bed and her sister will, along with one of her friends,

Speaker 19:         50:06          you know, one of them would tighten the straps and the other one would put a pillow in her mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue.

Speaker 22:         50:12          Yes, if I only just had the chair. So take care of her.

Speaker 8:          50:21          Now dealing with how her mother died was one thing, but the cells made it more complicated. Whatever apparent her mother was alive in these cells somehow. So if that's true, that left very big questions. And the first of them for Debra was, how can Henrietta rest in peace if part of her with part of her soul is being, you know, shot up to the moon and injected with all these chemicals in a radiated and bombarded,

Speaker 22:         50:44          painful. No one, you know, that had her shelves on the back of a donkey going to Turkey, you know, in the air planes just going all over the world. Uh, uh, I just don't know

Speaker 8:          51:00          if she worried about them. She worried that it hurts her mother. When you infect the cells with Ebola, does somehow her mother feel the pain that comes with Ebola and a scientist ever like sat down with her and yeah, me just explained to her like this is no, never, nothing cause it's spy. It just strikes me that it wouldn't be that hard to explain it. Like when you take cells out of a body, it's kind of like when you cut your fingernail off, it just doesn't, but your finger nail doesn't keep growing and living after you cut it off. It's a, it's really hard. There is no other example of some way that you can take something from someone's body and have it keep living and not have a person feel it and all these worries says Rebecca began to build in Deborah's mind and build and build.

Speaker 20:         51:47          There came at this point, wait, so we were at her cousin's house. This is her cousin Gary. She was broken out in hives and she was telling him all the stuff that she'd recently learned. You can almost hear it on the tape. She says to him,

Speaker 9:          52:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         52:00          she can't carry the burden of these cells anymore. She can't [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          52:04          okay. I don't want to cut.

Speaker 20:         52:08          And I had been sort of trying to talk her down and he was trying to talk her down

Speaker 9:          52:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         52:12          and then just out of nowhere, he just started singing

Speaker 23:         52:22          [inaudible] Yo,

Speaker 9:          52:25          no. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         52:30          Ooh.

Speaker 9:          52:34          [inaudible] no, those [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         52:38          and he started preaching thing that doctors came, that he held her head in his hands and we'd come to you,

Speaker 15:         52:46          not the offer and the finish of about Wifi. And we thank you for being awake. Mic. You make a path in the middle. You call the Milton's a skip lego rams and the Luma. We thank you today. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible] hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          53:17          Hey Man. Hey Man. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         53:27          and she just relaxed. I like it, man. I feel like, Huh?

Speaker 8:          53:36          She didn't realize it then, but that night Debra was on the verge of a stroke.

Speaker 20:         53:41          Want to walk up into the building? My Wall. Okay. Do you mean he said it's just up this hill.

Speaker 8:          53:46          One of the most striking moments of this story is when the two of them, yeah,

Speaker 20:         53:49          visit Hopkins, I feel, yeah, they'll lots of good and yeah.

Speaker 8:          53:53          Deborah meets her mother's cells for the first time.

Speaker 15:         53:56          I shouldn't have, I'll show you the bathroom and I can show you by itself. Okay.

Speaker 8:          54:01          Because the scientists had finally contacted. Sure. Christopher Lingara, the scientist who invited us into his lab to see the cells, he had projected them onto a screen.

Speaker 15:         54:09          Big confused. They look green here. Okay.

Speaker 8:          54:11          They're so neon green in this particular case, because of the way they were stained and projected. Um, so they're very ethereal looking. They're very [inaudible].

Speaker 19:         54:20          It's sort of there. The glow, you know, I mean, when you think about angels, right? You think of something glowing. Christoph turned on this screen and she just, I mean, Deborah just gasp. She just,

Speaker 20:         54:33          Oh, [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         54:37          what was I saying? About 200 times bigger than what they really are.

Speaker 8:          54:42          The swirling hurricane. Okay.

Speaker 15:         54:45          Did you say all that's my mother. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          54:57          Oh Christopher gave, he gave her a, a vial of the cells that she could hold in her hand and they came out of it out of freezer. So they, they're very cold and she sort of, you know, rubbed her hands together with the bile in her hands to sort of warm them up and sort of blew on them to keep them warm. Um, and then she just sort of whispered to the cells. It was, um, sort of incredible. She just raised them up to her lips and she said, you're famous, but nobody knows it.

Speaker 19:         56:03          Before we close, I want to thank Rebecca Skloot for giving us her raw tapes. Her book, the immortal life of Henrietta lacks is truly spellbinding everything that we just did, very, very condensed version of what's in that book. You can get more information@radiolab.org sign up for our podcast there, radio lab.org before we go, we just want to give a nod to our producer Layla. We want to give a waved to her because she's coming home. She's heading off. She's leaving us after four and a half years to go and be a writer at Grad school. She writes a pretty good radio piece, and you're gonna miss her for it. And also for her great awesomeness all around. So Lulu, we love you and good luck. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
