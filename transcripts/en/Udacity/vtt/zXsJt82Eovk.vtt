00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.114
We've seen how we can use the product rule to simplify a radical by splitting

00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:07.516
it up into the multiplication of two different radicals. We can also use this

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:11.440
product rule to multiply two radicals together, but note that we can only do

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.688
that when the radicals have the same root. In this case, they're both square

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:18.900
roots, so we can multiply them together. If we had two third roots or two

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.528
fourth roots, then we could also multiply them together. This number, which is

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:28.370
our index, just needs to match. So use our product rule here to simplify each

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.456
of these multiplication problems. And don't worry about simplifying in the end,

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:35.373
because you actually can't in these cases.
