moment to weaken the effort and I think
 

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:27.469
moment to weaken the effort and I think
that we have to really make it happen

00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:27.479
that we have to really make it happen
 

00:40:27.479 --> 00:40:31.069
that we have to really make it happen
for the 40 people wear for which the

00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079
for the 40 people wear for which the
 

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:35.989
for the 40 people wear for which the
promise was done and there was like a

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:35.999
promise was done and there was like a
 

00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:39.589
promise was done and there was like a
special like a contract that was signed

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599
special like a contract that was signed
 

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:43.819
special like a contract that was signed
with the MDGs you know in a way the

00:40:43.819 --> 00:40:43.829
with the MDGs you know in a way the
 

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:46.400
with the MDGs you know in a way the
international community said we will put

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:46.410
international community said we will put
 

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.299
international community said we will put
the resources if the country's put the

00:40:50.299 --> 00:40:50.309
the resources if the country's put the
 

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:56.539
the resources if the country's put the
will the program's these strategies the

00:40:56.539 --> 00:40:56.549
will the program's these strategies the
 

00:40:56.549 --> 00:41:00.170
will the program's these strategies the
good governance for the resources be

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180
good governance for the resources be
 

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.160
good governance for the resources be
used for the poor and they many of them

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:04.170
used for the poor and they many of them
 

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.910
used for the poor and they many of them
did it they they comply with that part

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920
did it they they comply with that part
 

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.789
did it they they comply with that part
of the contract so the first thing that

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:10.799
of the contract so the first thing that
 

00:41:10.799 --> 00:41:12.349
of the contract so the first thing that
we have to tell the international

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359
we have to tell the international
 

00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:14.840
we have to tell the international
community is that we cannot abandon them

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:14.850
community is that we cannot abandon them
 

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:18.230
community is that we cannot abandon them
now that they have done part of the deal

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240
now that they have done part of the deal
 

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.440
now that they have done part of the deal
and that the effort has to continue has

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:21.450
and that the effort has to continue has
 

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.820
and that the effort has to continue has
to continue from the site of the

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:22.830
to continue from the site of the
 

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.710
to continue from the site of the
countries and has to continue on the

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720
countries and has to continue on the
 

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.160
countries and has to continue on the
side of the international community so

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.170
side of the international community so
 

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.830
side of the international community so
this is like the the first thing I want

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:30.840
this is like the the first thing I want
 

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.160
this is like the the first thing I want
to leave the second is that we have to

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.170
to leave the second is that we have to
 

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:37.880
to leave the second is that we have to
recognize that the crisis did hit a the

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:37.890
recognize that the crisis did hit a the
 

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.370
recognize that the crisis did hit a the
poorest that were not responsible for

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380
poorest that were not responsible for
 

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.280
poorest that were not responsible for
the crisis in a major way so some of the

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:43.290
the crisis in a major way so some of the
 

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.490
the crisis in a major way so some of the
setbacks come from the crisis if my

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500
setbacks come from the crisis if my
 

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.890
setbacks come from the crisis if my
memory is is okay i think that they

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900
memory is is okay i think that they
 

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.310
memory is is okay i think that they
according to the World Bank 62 more 62

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320

you know so the same with the crisis in

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:01.950
you know so the same with the crisis in
 

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:05.410
you know so the same with the crisis in
food the same with the crisis in oil and

change in the environment and what
 

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.590
change in the environment and what
happens in the in the poor countries

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:14.600
happens in the in the poor countries

climate related events is that the short
 

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.480

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:29.490
term poverty doesn't go away you know
 

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:33.320

you you really in those crisis have the

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.330
you you really in those crisis have the
 

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.980
you you really in those crisis have the
problem of converting like short-term

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:36.990
problem of converting like short-term
 

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.370

temporary poverty into structural
 

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.490
temporary poverty into structural
poverty precisely because families have

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500
poverty precisely because families have
 

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.160
poverty precisely because families have
to take decisions during the crisis that

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.170
to take decisions during the crisis that
 

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.390
to take decisions during the crisis that
affect the whole life of the kids for

affect the whole life of the kids for
 

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.700
affect the whole life of the kids for
the rest of their lives if they go out

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:52.710
the rest of their lives if they go out
 

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.500
the rest of their lives if they go out
of school if there are undernourished

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:54.510
of school if there are undernourished
 

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.610

that will be sick there will be a

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:57.620
that will be sick there will be a
 

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.280
that will be sick there will be a
problem related to that that will live

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:01.290
problem related to that that will live
 

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:05.360
problem related to that that will live
with them forever so the problem with

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:05.370
with them forever so the problem with
 

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.850
with them forever so the problem with
the volatility of climate change or

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:07.860
the volatility of climate change or
 

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.690
the volatility of climate change or
climate related events or economic

crisis is precisely that maybe the the
rich will get out of the crisis and

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660
rich will get out of the crisis and
 

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.020
rich will get out of the crisis and
forget about it by the poor will leave

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:21.030
forget about it by the poor will leave
 

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.790
forget about it by the poor will leave
the consequences of the crisis forever

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800
the consequences of the crisis forever
 

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.520
the consequences of the crisis forever
so the problem of the volatility of

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:25.530
so the problem of the volatility of
 

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.980
so the problem of the volatility of
growth of economic

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:27.990

in environment related events is very

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880
in environment related events is very
 

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.590
in environment related events is very
severe for the world and so there has to

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:36.600
severe for the world and so there has to
 

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.320
severe for the world and so there has to
be an understanding of how to preclude

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.330
be an understanding of how to preclude
 

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.500
be an understanding of how to preclude
those events for them to be able to have

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:45.510
those events for them to be able to have
 

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:49.930
those events for them to be able to have
a more stable growth in development a

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:49.940
a more stable growth in development a
 

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.090
a more stable growth in development a
that the third point that I want to live

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:53.100
that the third point that I want to live

that the third point that I want to live
with you is the problem of inequality

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:55.320
with you is the problem of inequality
 

00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.020
with you is the problem of inequality
and it's something that we have called

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:00.030
and it's something that we have called
 

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.800
and it's something that we have called
the tyranny of averages and how to go

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:03.810
the tyranny of averages and how to go
 

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.980
the tyranny of averages and how to go
beyond the tyranny of average so you can

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:06.990
beyond the tyranny of average so you can
 

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.250
beyond the tyranny of average so you can
we can achieve the MDGs on average but

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260
we can achieve the MDGs on average but
 

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.380
we can achieve the MDGs on average but
it may be well be that the most

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:12.390
it may be well be that the most
 

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.470
it may be well be that the most
vulnerable and the poorest of the poor

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480
vulnerable and the poorest of the poor
 

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.020
vulnerable and the poorest of the poor
won't feel any improvement in their

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:18.030
won't feel any improvement in their
 

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.020
won't feel any improvement in their
lives because on average will be will be

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.030
lives because on average will be will be
 

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.830
lives because on average will be will be
ok with the MDGs but if you will look

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:24.840
ok with the MDGs but if you will look
 

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.650
ok with the MDGs but if you will look
and disaggregate what is happening

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660
and disaggregate what is happening
 

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.390
and disaggregate what is happening
really there is a lot of inequalities

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400
really there is a lot of inequalities
 

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.240
really there is a lot of inequalities
between countries and within countries

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:32.250
between countries and within countries
 

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.380
between countries and within countries
and regions so my third message is we

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:36.390
and regions so my third message is we
 

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.990
and regions so my third message is we
have to disaggregate the MDGs and we

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000
have to disaggregate the MDGs and we
 

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.820
have to disaggregate the MDGs and we
have to see very clearly what is

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:40.830
have to see very clearly what is
 

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.099
have to see very clearly what is
happening to the rural populations where

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:43.109
happening to the rural populations where
 

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:45.109
happening to the rural populations where
we cannot get to them what is happening

00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119
we cannot get to them what is happening
 

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.440
we cannot get to them what is happening
with ethnic groups but that are excluded

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:48.450
with ethnic groups but that are excluded
 

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.590
with ethnic groups but that are excluded
what is happening with women in all the

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:51.600
what is happening with women in all the
 

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.410
what is happening with women in all the
MDGs what is happening to the black

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420
MDGs what is happening to the black
 

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.180
MDGs what is happening to the black
populations where they are a minority

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:56.190
populations where they are a minority
 

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.510
populations where they are a minority
etc so the disaggregation of the MDGs is

00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520
etc so the disaggregation of the MDGs is
 

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:04.910
etc so the disaggregation of the MDGs is
a key point a for the future in my

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920
a key point a for the future in my
 

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.430
a key point a for the future in my
fourth point and thank you so much for

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440
fourth point and thank you so much for
 

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.920
fourth point and thank you so much for
referring for the eight points agenda is

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:09.930
referring for the eight points agenda is
 

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:15.440
referring for the eight points agenda is
that we have done this very important

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:15.450
that we have done this very important
 

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.680
that we have done this very important
study where we took 50 countries and

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:18.690
study where we took 50 countries and
 

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.870
study where we took 50 countries and
really looked in depth what has happened

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880
really looked in depth what has happened
 

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.470
really looked in depth what has happened
to the MDGs and the whole purpose of

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480
to the MDGs and the whole purpose of
 

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.340
to the MDGs and the whole purpose of
this exercise is to really see what

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:28.350
this exercise is to really see what
 

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.580
this exercise is to really see what
works what doesn't work in what are the

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:31.590
works what doesn't work in what are the
 

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.160
works what doesn't work in what are the
main bottlenecks and obstacles that we

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.170
main bottlenecks and obstacles that we
 

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.580
main bottlenecks and obstacles that we
need to look at to accelerate progress

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:36.590
need to look at to accelerate progress
 

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.730
need to look at to accelerate progress
towards 2015 for achieving the mdgs

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740
towards 2015 for achieving the mdgs
 

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.970
towards 2015 for achieving the mdgs
and the things that we that came from

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980
and the things that we that came from
 

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.359
and the things that we that came from
that a study is an eight-point agenda

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:47.369
that a study is an eight-point agenda
 

00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:52.340
that a study is an eight-point agenda
that was referred by my colleague and I

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:52.350
that was referred by my colleague and I
 

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.980
that was referred by my colleague and I
will divide the conclusions into two

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:54.990
will divide the conclusions into two
 

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.680
will divide the conclusions into two
groups to go to be very quick with you

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:57.690
groups to go to be very quick with you
 

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:02.510
groups to go to be very quick with you
the first group is the things that we

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520
the first group is the things that we
 

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.870
the first group is the things that we
know that we all know because we know a

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880
know that we all know because we know a
 

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.940
know that we all know because we know a
lot about development and what works and

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:07.950
lot about development and what works and
 

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:10.750
lot about development and what works and
what doesn't that is study emphasized

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760
what doesn't that is study emphasized
 

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.090
what doesn't that is study emphasized
because if we forget about that the MDGs

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:14.100
because if we forget about that the MDGs
 

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.160
because if we forget about that the MDGs
won't be achieved and the second group

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:16.170
won't be achieved and the second group
 

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.320
won't be achieved and the second group
is those that we have to reflect more

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:18.330
is those that we have to reflect more
 

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.170
is those that we have to reflect more
about them because they have not been

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180
about them because they have not been
 

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.010
about them because they have not been
included or we know less about how to go

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020
included or we know less about how to go
 

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.030
included or we know less about how to go
about those obstacles or there were a

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040
about those obstacles or there were a
 

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.970
about those obstacles or there were a
little bit upset from the agenda in the

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980
little bit upset from the agenda in the
 

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.740
little bit upset from the agenda in the
first group we have like for a

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:35.750
first group we have like for a
 

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:39.590
first group we have like for a
conclusions the first one is that a we

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:39.600
conclusions the first one is that a we
 

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.600
conclusions the first one is that a we
need to support control a development to

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:41.610
need to support control a development to
 

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.570
need to support control a development to
accelerate and sustained progress

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:43.580
accelerate and sustained progress
 

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.130
accelerate and sustained progress
development has to be led from within

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140
development has to be led from within
 

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.170
development has to be led from within
from the countries from the leadership

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180
from the countries from the leadership
 

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.630
from the countries from the leadership
from the government in partnership with

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640
from the government in partnership with
 

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.980
from the government in partnership with
the private sector with civil society

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:51.990
the private sector with civil society
 

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.730
the private sector with civil society
but it cannot be imposed from outside so

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740
but it cannot be imposed from outside so
 

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.609
but it cannot be imposed from outside so
the first thing to emphasize is the

00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619
the first thing to emphasize is the
 

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:00.730
the first thing to emphasize is the
importance of country led development

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:00.740
importance of country led development
 

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.760
importance of country led development
the second one that we all know also is

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:04.770
the second one that we all know also is
 

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:08.060
the second one that we all know also is
that the investment we made it we need

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.070
that the investment we made it we need
 

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.400
that the investment we made it we need
to target investments in health in

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:10.410
to target investments in health in
 

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.220
to target investments in health in
education in clean water and sanitation

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:13.230
education in clean water and sanitation
 

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:17.359
education in clean water and sanitation
and we know that so let me not expand

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:17.369
and we know that so let me not expand
 

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:23.270
and we know that so let me not expand
too much on it the third one is that we

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280
too much on it the third one is that we
 

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.880
too much on it the third one is that we
need to invest in women and girls and

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:25.890
need to invest in women and girls and
 

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.550
need to invest in women and girls and
that's what was also said in the

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560
that's what was also said in the
 

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.270
that's what was also said in the
introduction and that that's important

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280
introduction and that that's important
 

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.240
introduction and that that's important
for all the MDGs not only for mdg 3 that

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:35.250
for all the MDGs not only for mdg 3 that
 

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.520
for all the MDGs not only for mdg 3 that
is on women and girls but for all the

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:37.530
is on women and girls but for all the
 

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.980
is on women and girls but for all the
MDGs that's important I will refer to

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:39.990
MDGs that's important I will refer to
 

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.380
MDGs that's important I will refer to
that in the second group again in a deep

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:42.390
that in the second group again in a deep
 

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:45.500
that in the second group again in a deep
from a different angle so those three

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:45.510
from a different angle so those three
 

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:51.109
from a different angle so those three
things we know we know what works so it

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119
things we know we know what works so it
 

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:54.200
things we know we know what works so it
why are still the MDGs for example

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:54.210
why are still the MDGs for example
 

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:54.570
why are still the MDGs for example
relate

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:54.580
relate
 

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.900
relate
two women lagging behind if we know what

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:57.910
two women lagging behind if we know what
 

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.390
two women lagging behind if we know what
works we know that it's important for

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400
works we know that it's important for
 

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.420
works we know that it's important for
all of them so we need to look deeper

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:03.430
all of them so we need to look deeper
 

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.660
all of them so we need to look deeper
into really the obstacles that are an

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:06.670
into really the obstacles that are an
 

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:12.150
into really the obstacles that are an
impediment for achieving the mdgs and

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160
impediment for achieving the mdgs and
 

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.020
impediment for achieving the mdgs and
doing what should be done in these three

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.030
doing what should be done in these three
 

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.370
doing what should be done in these three
let me go to the second group that is

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:17.380
let me go to the second group that is
 

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.680
let me go to the second group that is
when I want to expand more and I think

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:19.690
when I want to expand more and I think
 

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.650
when I want to expand more and I think
that a it was referred to that a before

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:22.660
that a it was referred to that a before
 

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:28.190
that a it was referred to that a before
too the first one is how do we foster

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200
too the first one is how do we foster
 

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.160
too the first one is how do we foster
inclusive economic growth and let me

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:31.170
inclusive economic growth and let me
 

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.730
inclusive economic growth and let me
really emphasize inclusive because we

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:35.740
really emphasize inclusive because we
 

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.170
really emphasize inclusive because we
know how to foster growth with exclusion

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180
know how to foster growth with exclusion
 

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.600
know how to foster growth with exclusion
the problem is how to foster growth with

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:42.610
the problem is how to foster growth with
 

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.330
the problem is how to foster growth with
inclusion you know in many of the

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:45.340
inclusion you know in many of the
 

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.020
inclusion you know in many of the
countries of africa growth had happened

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:49.030
countries of africa growth had happened
 

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.900
countries of africa growth had happened
and very little has happened in terms of

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:51.910
and very little has happened in terms of
 

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:56.180
and very little has happened in terms of
fighting poverty so the real challenge

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:56.190
fighting poverty so the real challenge
 

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:01.860
fighting poverty so the real challenge
is to be able to foster inclusive growth

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:01.870
is to be able to foster inclusive growth
 

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:10.770
is to be able to foster inclusive growth
in one of the main aim problems with

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:10.780
in one of the main aim problems with
 

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.470
in one of the main aim problems with
inclusive growth is precisely the

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480
inclusive growth is precisely the
 

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.280
inclusive growth is precisely the
neglect of the agricultural sector and

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.290
neglect of the agricultural sector and
 

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.260
neglect of the agricultural sector and
so to recover the importance of

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:19.270
so to recover the importance of
 

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.410
so to recover the importance of
agriculture and small farming for

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:22.420
agriculture and small farming for
 

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.150
agriculture and small farming for
inclusive growth especially in Africa

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160
inclusive growth especially in Africa
 

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.250
inclusive growth especially in Africa
that you were talking about so

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:26.260
that you were talking about so
 

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.050
that you were talking about so
eloquently is a key point in the second

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:31.060
eloquently is a key point in the second
 

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.810
eloquently is a key point in the second
point is that it's not only important to

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:33.820
point is that it's not only important to
 

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.090
point is that it's not only important to
invest in women and girls the important

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:36.100
invest in women and girls the important
 

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.240
invest in women and girls the important
thing is to empower women and it's

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:39.250
thing is to empower women and it's
 

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.460
thing is to empower women and it's
different and let me leave this with you

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:41.470
different and let me leave this with you
 

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.450
different and let me leave this with you
two is different just to invest in women

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:45.460
two is different just to invest in women
 

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.720
two is different just to invest in women
and girls than to empower them to close

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:48.730
and girls than to empower them to close
 

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:53.060
and girls than to empower them to close
the gaps in education on in health is a

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:53.070
the gaps in education on in health is a
 

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:56.150
the gaps in education on in health is a
key point but to empower women

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160
key point but to empower women
 

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.250
key point but to empower women
economically and politically it's really

00:49:59.250 --> 00:49:59.260
economically and politically it's really
 

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.790
economically and politically it's really
the way to make it sustainable and

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800
the way to make it sustainable and
 

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.420
the way to make it sustainable and
that's a central point of inclusive

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:06.430
that's a central point of inclusive
 

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.100
that's a central point of inclusive
economic

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:08.110
economic
 

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.820
economic
growth so empowerment political and

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:11.830
growth so empowerment political and
 

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:15.090
growth so empowerment political and
economic empowerment of women is at the

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:15.100
economic empowerment of women is at the
 

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.700
economic empowerment of women is at the

in certain cultures we can create the
 

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:33.330
in certain cultures we can create the
opportunities but women need to be able

point that I want to make is the one

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:09.730
point that I want to make is the one
 

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.970
point that I want to make is the one
that has already been made that is the

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:11.980
that has already been made that is the
 

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.860
that has already been made that is the
missing missing mdg that is energy and

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:15.870
missing missing mdg that is energy and
 

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:19.470
missing missing mdg that is energy and
it's absolutely true that we have to

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480
it's absolutely true that we have to
 

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.820
it's absolutely true that we have to
distinguish between goals and means if

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:23.830
distinguish between goals and means if
 

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.770
distinguish between goals and means if
we will think that everything has to be

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:25.780
we will think that everything has to be
 

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.700
we will think that everything has to be
an mdg so you know we will end up with

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:29.710
an mdg so you know we will end up with
 

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:33.420
an mdg so you know we will end up with
an agenda of 1000 goals but the truth is

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:33.430
an agenda of 1000 goals but the truth is
 

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.370
an agenda of 1000 goals but the truth is
that we have to look also at the means

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:35.380
that we have to look also at the means
 

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.330
that we have to look also at the means
in energy is a key mean to achieve all

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:39.340
in energy is a key mean to achieve all
 

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.340
in energy is a key mean to achieve all
the MDGs let me just a say here that is

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:44.350
the MDGs let me just a say here that is
 

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:46.830
the MDGs let me just a say here that is
important to think not only on grid

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:46.840
important to think not only on grid
 

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.680
important to think not only on grid
energy but off-grid energy that is

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:49.690
energy but off-grid energy that is
 

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.010
energy but off-grid energy that is
precisely a key point on the for

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:53.020
precisely a key point on the for
 

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.450
precisely a key point on the for

agriculture and for rural development
 

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.180
agriculture and for rural development
and for local development so I know you

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:57.190
and for local development so I know you
 

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.820
and for local development so I know you
did that you made that point so

00:51:59.820 --> 00:51:59.830
did that you made that point so
 

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.700
did that you made that point so
eloquently that I want a continued on

if you look at maternal mortality

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:47.350
if you look at maternal mortality
 

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.550
if you look at maternal mortality
maternal mortality only from a health

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:50.560
maternal mortality only from a health
 

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.790
maternal mortality only from a health
perspective you may be losing many of

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:53.800
perspective you may be losing many of
 

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.440
perspective you may be losing many of
the issues that are really on the

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:55.450
the issues that are really on the
 

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.020
the issues that are really on the
obstacles that are really on the way for

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:58.030
obstacles that are really on the way for
 

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:00.780
obstacles that are really on the way for
achieving the decrease in maternal

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:00.790
achieving the decrease in maternal
 

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:02.730
achieving the decrease in maternal

same happens in education the same

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:05.050
same happens in education the same
 

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:07.890
same happens in education the same
happens with the other MDGs so the

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:07.900
happens with the other MDGs so the
 

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.290

thing to recognize as Rebecca is
 

00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:48.430
thing to recognize as Rebecca is
correctly emphasize is that the MDGs are

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440
correctly emphasize is that the MDGs are
 

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.309
correctly emphasize is that the MDGs are
achievable but it's also very important

00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:51.319
achievable but it's also very important
 

00:57:51.319 --> 00:57:53.819
achievable but it's also very important
to recognize that there are a number of

00:57:53.819 --> 00:57:53.829
to recognize that there are a number of
 

00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:57.190
to recognize that there are a number of
concerns about whether or not the MDGs

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200
concerns about whether or not the MDGs
 

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.539
concerns about whether or not the MDGs
should be the central mobilizing a theme

00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:01.549
should be the central mobilizing a theme
 

00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:04.150

around which we think about development
 

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.140
around which we think about development
and I'll come back to this question

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.150
and I'll come back to this question
 

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:10.960
and I'll come back to this question
later x please now if we look at the

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:10.970
later x please now if we look at the
 

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:14.589
later x please now if we look at the
MDGs as as Bob and can they have

00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599
MDGs as as Bob and can they have
 

00:58:14.599 --> 00:58:18.099

from about nineteen ninety to the middle

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:53.500
from about nineteen ninety to the middle
 

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.330
from about nineteen ninety to the middle
of the past decade now this of course is

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:56.340
of the past decade now this of course is
 

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.200
of the past decade now this of course is
undoubtedly a significant achievement

00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:58.210
undoubtedly a significant achievement
 

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:02.430

but if the poverty line is defined as

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440
but if the poverty line is defined as
 

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.940
but if the poverty line is defined as
what it takes to avoid being hungry we

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:05.950
what it takes to avoid being hungry we
 

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.430
what it takes to avoid being hungry we
obviously have a problem because one

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440
obviously have a problem because one
 

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.050

poor so something is wrong and this
 

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.320
poor so something is wrong and this
becomes a very important challenge form

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:19.330
becomes a very important challenge form
 

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:21.930

of measurement and how do we understand

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:21.940
of measurement and how do we understand
 

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.510
of measurement and how do we understand
poverty and how do we measure poverty

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520
poverty and how do we measure poverty
 

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.570
poverty and how do we measure poverty
and this is why for example a few years

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:27.580
and this is why for example a few years
 

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.300
and this is why for example a few years
ago you may remember books were written

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:30.310
ago you may remember books were written
 

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:32.070

about the bottom billion and suchlike
 

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.350
about the bottom billion and suchlike
and then suddenly when the new figures

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:34.360
and then suddenly when the new figures
 

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.240
and then suddenly when the new figures
came out two years ago we suddenly had a

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.250
came out two years ago we suddenly had a
 

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:39.840
came out two years ago we suddenly had a
figure jump from 1 billion to 1.4

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:39.850
figure jump from 1 billion to 1.4
 

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.030

about a bottom 1.4 billion and and you
 

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:50.010
about a bottom 1.4 billion and and you
know so you know anyway obviously there

privilege my question is about the

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:37.609
privilege my question is about the
 

01:30:37.609 --> 01:30:40.729
privilege my question is about the
emphasis on the global green economy it

01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739
emphasis on the global green economy it
 

01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:43.069
emphasis on the global green economy it
seems as though an emphasis on that as a

01:30:43.069 --> 01:30:43.079
seems as though an emphasis on that as a
 

01:30:43.079 --> 01:30:46.540
seems as though an emphasis on that as a
means of achieving the or a few of the

would be achieved by focusing on the
 

01:30:54.479 --> 01:30:59.229
would be achieved by focusing on the
green economy as wondering for example

01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239

for that to be able to happen so that
 

02:06:54.309 --> 02:06:56.279
for that to be able to happen so that
will be the first target to be able to

02:06:56.279 --> 02:06:56.289
will be the first target to be able to
 

02:06:56.289 --> 02:06:58.890

because of a climate event that have

02:07:45.509 --> 02:07:45.519
because of a climate event that have
 

02:07:45.519 --> 02:07:49.890
because of a climate event that have
affected many many a 20 million people

02:07:49.890 --> 02:07:49.900
affected many many a 20 million people
 

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:50.970
affected many many a 20 million people
and we have

02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:50.980
and we have
 

02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.430
and we have
the instruments there to be able to be

02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440
the instruments there to be able to be
 

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:57.210
the instruments there to be able to be
more helpful to try to preclude backlash

02:07:57.210 --> 02:07:57.220
more helpful to try to preclude backlash
 

02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:59.610
more helpful to try to preclude backlash
on the MDGs but it's different in the

02:07:59.610 --> 02:07:59.620
on the MDGs but it's different in the
 

02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:02.100
on the MDGs but it's different in the
countries where you have an open armed

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:02.110
countries where you have an open armed
 

02:08:02.110 --> 02:08:06.390
countries where you have an open armed
conflict where the main target should be

02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400
conflict where the main target should be
 

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.479
conflict where the main target should be
to achieve to achieve peace and

02:08:09.479 --> 02:08:09.489
to achieve to achieve peace and
 

02:08:09.489 --> 02:08:12.330
to achieve to achieve peace and
stability so these are two totally

02:08:12.330 --> 02:08:12.340
stability so these are two totally
 

02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.650
stability so these are two totally
different ways of way of intervening

02:08:15.650 --> 02:08:15.660
different ways of way of intervening
 

02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:18.930
different ways of way of intervening
depending on the specific situation let

02:08:18.930 --> 02:08:18.940
depending on the specific situation let
 

02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:22.830
depending on the specific situation let
me just take then the problem of people

02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840
me just take then the problem of people
 

02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.830
me just take then the problem of people
with disabilities and let me say that a

02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840
with disabilities and let me say that a
 

02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.780
with disabilities and let me say that a
great thing has happened with the

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:27.790

that has been a approved in many of the
Congress of the world the problem we

Congress of the world the problem we
 

02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:40.910
Congress of the world the problem we
have now is how you take the convention

02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920
have now is how you take the convention
 

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.040
have now is how you take the convention
into the legal frameworks and programs

02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:44.050
into the legal frameworks and programs
 

02:08:44.050 --> 02:08:46.440
into the legal frameworks and programs
of the country and we are precisely

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:46.450
of the country and we are precisely
 

02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:49.229
of the country and we are precisely
discussing to be able to put together a

02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239
discussing to be able to put together a
 

02:08:49.239 --> 02:08:51.750

multi-donor trust fund to be able to
finance within the countries not only

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:54.130
finance within the countries not only
 

02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:56.490
finance within the countries not only
the approval of the convention but the

02:08:56.490 --> 02:08:56.500
the approval of the convention but the
 

02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:58.500
the approval of the convention but the
coherence of the convention with the

02:08:58.500 --> 02:08:58.510
coherence of the convention with the
 

02:08:58.510 --> 02:09:00.450
coherence of the convention with the
framework of laws that don't consider

is how you mainstream the disability
problem in all the project and we are

02:09:17.250 --> 02:09:17.260
problem in all the project and we are
 

02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:19.560
problem in all the project and we are
precisely working in this second phase

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:19.570
precisely working in this second phase
 

02:09:19.570 --> 02:09:22.140
precisely working in this second phase
the first phase was a face of advocacy

02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:22.150
the first phase was a face of advocacy
 

02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:24.750
the first phase was a face of advocacy
of making the convention known and

02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760
of making the convention known and

approved by the country's now the
 

02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:31.740
approved by the country's now the
problem is how you make that framework

02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:31.750
problem is how you make that framework
 

02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:34.470
