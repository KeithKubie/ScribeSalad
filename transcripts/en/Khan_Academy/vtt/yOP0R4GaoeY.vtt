00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:01.802
- Hi, I'm Sal Khan.

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.201
Founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:05.109
We're a not for profit with a mission

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.331
of providing a free world-class education

00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:09.668
for anyone anywhere.

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:11.116
There are tens of millions of people

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.710
learning on Khan Academy

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.659
who wanna prove what they know,

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.564
who wanna show the world
they're just as capable

00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:19.102
as folks with more traditional diplomas.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.612
So we're gonna make a bridge

00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:22.934
between learning on Khan Academy

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.526
and real economic opportunity.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.848
To do that, we're gonna work with

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:30.807
employers and universities
all over the world

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:33.364
to identify the skills
that people need most

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:34.653
to be successful.

00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:36.735
Then we'll build the content and the tools

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.216
that allow anyone,
starting from any level,

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.029
to learn those skills.

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.419
To build the bridge between
the learning of the skills

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.722
and the opportunities
where you can apply them,

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:49.749
we're gonna create globally
recognized diplomas.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.287
We're confident we can do this,

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:53.104
because we already have
the reach and credibility

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:56.012
with over 100 million
learners all over the world,

00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:58.226
and we have partnerships in assessment,

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:01.242
in industry, and in higher education.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:03.828
Together, I believe that we can do this.

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:04.937
And when it happens,

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:07.551
it's going to bring hope and opportunity

00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:10.657
to people all over the world.

00:01:10.657 --> 00:01:12.005
- When you see Khan Academy,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.897
it gives you hope that there is

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:15.469
someone who can bring change,

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.586
and I'm hopeful that they
will be able to reach to

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.402
hundreds and thousands

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.731
or millions of children across the world,

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.624
and allow them and help
them to be empowered.

00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.124
I believe in that.
