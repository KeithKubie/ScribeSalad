KATE: But he is a lot of things.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.780
He's an author.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.450
He's a motivational speaker.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.580
He's a musician.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.352
And he actually founded
a nonprofit called--

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.560
is it "Re-rowt" Or 'Re-root"?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.890
SAULPAUL: "Rowt."

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.660
KATE: ReRoute.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.387
So he has a special performance
and talk for us today.

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:19.970
He's going to tell us a little
bit about his background, where

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.030
he came from.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.770
He's got a very
interesting story.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.130
And also, he's
going to jam for us.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.800
So get ready.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.420
Here we go.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.540
Thank you for coming.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
SAULPAUL: All right.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.945
Y'all ready to have some fun
for the next 15, 20 minutes?

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:38.732
[CHEERING]

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:39.704
All right.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:40.970
All right, that's what's up.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.890
So my name is SaulPaul,
S-A-U-L-P-A-U-L, Saul Paul.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.040
Not Sean Paul.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.840
That's a Jamaican dude.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.580
Not "South Park,"
that's a cartoon.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.290
Not Sao Paulo, but SaulPaul.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.770
Cool.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.742
And I'm a rapper.

00:00:56.742 --> 00:00:57.890
That's what I do.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.520
I also play this guitar.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.650
[STATIC]

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.685
Oh.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:04.882
I'm telling you.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:05.790
No bueno.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130
But I have to use it.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.328
I like handheld mikes.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.612
I know it's terrible, right?

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.520
All right.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
So I'm going to start
off with a song.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.337
I'm going to start
with with-- yeah,

00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:27.920
can I get your help
on this one, Kate?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.350
KATE: Sure.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.715
SAULPAUL: All right.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:29.215
Cool.

00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:31.090
So check this out.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.590
We're going to make
a song together.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.680
It'll be cool.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.240
So I need a couple volunteers.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.680
You don't have to come up,
and you don't have to dance.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.180
You just have to
give me a word, so

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.190
like-- you're the closest to me.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.596
I'm going to start with you.

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:46.201
Like any word.

AUDIENCE: Apple.

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.570
SAULPAUL: Apple.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.400
I love it.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860
The first thing that popped
into my head was fruit.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.400
What's the first thing
that popped into your head?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.592
KATE: Yeah, competitor.

00:01:54.592 --> 00:01:55.550
SAULPAUL: Yeah, I know.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.999
I was like, why'd
everybody laugh?

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.790
And I was like, oh,
that's why, that's why.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.260
OK, I get it, I get it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.395

because I like pink.

AUDIENCE: Wednesday.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.110
SAULPAUL: Wednesday.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.190
OK, wow.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.720
It's Google.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.844
I expected more creativity.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:11.645
All right, all right.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:12.650
This is so crazy.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.233
Every time I see you
all eating salad,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.670
I think you're
eating Froot Loops.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.004
I don't know why.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:18.920
Might be the cherries.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.184
I don't know what it is.

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:22.850
If it was me, I'd be
eating Froot Loops.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.480
OK, who else?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.974
How about you, ma'am?

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:27.446
All right.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.380
How about this?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.925
Somebody give me a
big word, like a word

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.360

can't even spell right

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.976

Thank you.

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.170
She did that with
swag, like, really?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.350
Like, really?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.910
OK.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.800
How about-- uh-oh.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.758
KATE: He said it wrong.

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:54.832
That's not my fault.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.040
SAULPAUL: How about you, sir?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.982

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.251
Let me see.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:05.750
Who else?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.343
Who wants to volunteer a word?

SAULPAUL: I know, right?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.432
No more lunch shows.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:15.795
You said, do I need a verb?

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.420

look uncomfortable,

I'm probably picking you next.

word, I need one--

like what's the biggest
word anybody could think of?

All right, so check it out.

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.220
This is kind of connected to
the story I'm going to tell you,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.719
all right?

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.100
I'm going to tell you a
story about how I graduated

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.452
from the prestigious University
of Texas at Austin with a 4.0.

00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:25.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.130
But it was after I was
locked up in the Texas State

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.780
Penitentiary, convicted
of four felonies.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.970
So that's why do what I do.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.150
I recognize I have
a unique story,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.520
and I believe I have
a special purpose.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.999
And I just have to do it,
and I do it through my music.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.540
And so I'll share
a story about that.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.998
But something I
figured out in life

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.860
is that you don't get to
pick your circumstances.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.860
It is what it is, right?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.250
So you just don't get to
pick your circumstances.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.710
Kind of like when you're
at work sometimes.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.840
You get a project that's
not fair, but they're like,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.673
here's the deadline.

00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:53.370
Make it happen.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.850
Just gotta do what you gotta do.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.145
It's like all throughout life.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.270
This is what I figured out.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.675
So with this song, I didn't
get to pick these words.

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.341
But I'm going to make
up a song, and I'm

00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:03.570
going to incorporate all
these words into my song.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.430
All right.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.507
So we're going to do
this together, right?

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:07.340
I did this one time.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.798
I did it on "America's
Got Talent."

00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:10.110
It was pretty cool.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.970
They invited me out.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.250
I did the deal.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.084
Mariah Carey's husband,
know who that is?

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:15.000
AUDIENCE: Nick Cannon.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.220
SAULPAUL: Nick Cannon,
all right, all right.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.510
Nick Cannon was
there, and he was

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.280
like-- but I don't
have Nick Cannon today.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.870
Today, I have the lovely Kate.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.370
All right.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.036
So when I was on
"America's Got Talent,"

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:24.690
I had these big poster
boards, and so I

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.065
would get a word
from the judges.

00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:27.340
I'd get a word from the crowd.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.090
And then they would write it,
and then I did what I did.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.470
So then we put it on the screen.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.885
We got it up there.

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:35.624
Two things I need you to do.

00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:37.040
We're going to
make up some music.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.100
Let me put this together.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.600
You can't have a
song without music.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.491
So the first thing I'm going
to do is create some music.

00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:47.091
Do we have any other
musicians in the building?

So now we need to put
together the hook.

You can go high with it.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.003
You can go low like
it's a silent auction.

00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:36.570
You can do two at the
same time, synchronize.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.807

They say that I'm loco.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.430
But check out my calendar.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.530
Homie, I'm global.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.740
I care less.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.070
They only T-Mobile.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.310
I'm trying to connect the
dots like AT&amp;T, I'm loco.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.100
That's what that is, loco,
yeah, that mean crazy.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.120
I'm going to get in 'cause
your boy is not lazy.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.060
I'm taking words.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.560
I take them.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.685
I flip them.

00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:39.280
I get them.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.970
I twist them.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.480
Say it, I'm not missing.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.742
This last word a long one,
how I'm going to fit in.

00:12:43.742 --> 00:12:44.950
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:48.520
Hey.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.570
But still, I had to do that.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.200
H-town, we're chunking deuces.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.746
That's where they bump screw at.

00:12:53.746 --> 00:12:54.710
I do that.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.590
Yeah, I'm going to throw this.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.990
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.120
[CHEERING]

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.500
Woo.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.338
Woo.

00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:07.210
Hold up.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.419
One more time, one more time.

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:09.084
I like the hook.

00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:10.410
Let's just do it one more time.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:10.910
Hey.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.885
If your mind right,
then you shine right--

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:13.610
AUDIENCE: Now.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.760
SAULPAUL: You tight right--

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.060
AUDIENCE: Now.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.230
SAULPAUL: You bright right--

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.510
AUDIENCE: Now.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.093
SAULPAUL: Hey.

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:23.026
If your mind right, it go down
right now, now, now, now, now.

00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:27.300
[CHEERING]

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.915
All right.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.431
So today, I didn't
really come to perform,

00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:34.430
even though I'm going to
do a couple more songs.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.763
Today, I just came to talk a
little bit, share my story.

00:13:36.763 --> 00:13:39.430
So we'll consider
that the ice-breaker.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.730
So now that the ice is broken,
I can tell you this story.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.350
I'll tell you all a
little bit about my story.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.230
But I also just want to
tell you about this movement

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.610
that I'm proud to be
a part of and part

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.870
to be like kindling the flame on
so that we can get it to burn,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.650
and ultimately it's
to change the world.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.080
I've always been a big dreamer.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.150
That's just what I was,
even though I grew up

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.070
in a bad environment.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.120
Like I already told
you, I'm from Houston.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.520
I grew up in the ghetto.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.180
My mom died when I
was three years old.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.645
My dad, he ran off and left.

00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.396
I've never met him in my life.

00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:13.770
But I had an
awesome grandmother.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.130
My grandmother, she adopted me.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.660
She took me.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.637
She raised me as her own.

00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:19.220
Everybody else called
her grandmother.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.440
They called her Big Mama.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.030
I just called her mama.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.920
She was awesome.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.110
The problem was, she was
old, and I was young.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.390
She was slow, and I was fast.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.476
She was soft-hearted,
and I was hard-headed.

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:32.850
So I grew up in
this environment.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.970
Like I said, one of
the worst ghettos.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.262
I make it look good, and I
think it's hard for people

00:14:36.262 --> 00:14:37.720
to really get it
because, you know,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.740
I look so good and what-not.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.840
But I really, really grew
up like in the bottom,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.407
in the trap.

00:14:44.407 --> 00:14:45.740
They made a movie about my life.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.960
It's called "Tower to Tower."

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.130
If you go to my website,
saulpaul.com, you can see it..

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.180
It's like reviewed I
don't know how many times.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.846
It's a big idea.

00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:53.380
It's cool.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.170
But it's my story.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.190
It goes more in depth.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.231
But again, I grew up on
the north side of Houston

00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.270
in the ghetto.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.700
My grandmother adopted me.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.540
She raised me.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.420
She did the best, but I
still made the worst choices.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.480
And it was interesting because
I was always in this paradox.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.120
Like, I'm in the ghetto, but
I'm in the AP courses in school.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.690
I'm in gifted and talented
classes and what-not, right?

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.700
And then so I was
always in two worlds.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.435
It helps me now because
I'm cross-cultural.

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:22.380
I have this cultural
competency because I

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.740
know how to deal with people
and deal with people there.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.060
But I was still feeling
it out when I was younger.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.410
So I would be in class, my
AP and my gifted and talented

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.970
courses when I was in school.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.050
But then when I would
get out of class,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.680
and I'd be around my
friends on the block.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.540
When I was around my
friends on the block,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.190
I just kept my life separate.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.040
One time they collided.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.160
My grandmother, even
thought I grew up poor,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.260
she always spoiled me.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.530
I would always have the
latest video games, the latest

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.031
sneakers.

00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:48.446
So my friends would come to
my house and play video games.

00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:50.020
When they come to
my crib one time,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.660
my grandmother was
so proud of me,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.849
she would put my report
card on the wall.

00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:56.140
So my friends come in the
house to play my video games,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.270
and then they would
see my report card.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.020
And then they would
say stuff like, aw.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.670
This fool's stupid.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.282
He made all A's, right?

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:06.490
That doesn't even make sense.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.620
Like, half of it
don't even compute.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.980
I don't understand.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.050
But it was like because
it was a culture clash.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.400
I was making good grades.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.060
That wasn't cool to them.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.970
So that's why I kept it hidden.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.477
But it was interesting because,
again, my culture, society

00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:20.560
was teaching me something.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.350
Because I'm in my-- when I was
16 years old, I got arrested.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.760
I got arrested in
my high school.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.345
I went to a big 5A high
school, 2,000, 2,500 students.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:31.970
I get arrested.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.620
I go to jail.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.710
I come back.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.000
When I come back, in
my ghetto, in my hood,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.415
like do y'all think people
made fun of me because I got

00:16:40.415 --> 00:16:42.257
arrested or they showed me love?

00:16:42.257 --> 00:16:43.271
AUDIENCE: Love.

00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:45.270
SAULPAUL: That's very
unique right there, right?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.770
And it's something that I can
look back in hindsight, 20/20,

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.200
and I see like this
contrast, like that's weird.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.770
Like I made good grades,
and people made fun of me.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.522
I got arrested, and I
was like the hood hero.

00:16:55.522 --> 00:16:57.230
And I was just a kid
like everybody else.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.800
I just wanted to be accepted.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.960
So instead of focusing
on making good grades,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.155
I focused on being bad.

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.481
I actually became the
best at being the worst.

00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:07.230
This is what life was
already teaching me.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.438
And it's interesting because
you might say, OK, well,

00:17:09.438 --> 00:17:11.230
I was 16 years old
when I got arrested.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.765
When I get arrested,
like example, maybe you

00:17:14.765 --> 00:17:16.140
can't relate, but
I bet you still

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.514
know the answer
to this question.

00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:20.190
Why do people sell drugs?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.970
To make money.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.630
It's that simple, right?

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.790
It doesn't matter
if you're like,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.290
well, I want to buy
my baby diapers,

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.832
or I just want to
get a new necklace.

00:17:25.832 --> 00:17:27.873
The goal is, they just
want to make money, right?

00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:28.890
So I figured this out.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.770
I was always an A to Z thinker.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.880
The problem was I wasn't worried
about the steps in between.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.480
So I'm like, well,
people sell drugs

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.950
because they want to make money.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.480
So if you asked, well, SaulPaul,
why did you get arrested?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.130
And it was because
I made money, right?

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.110
And I got arrested
by the FBI at that.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.460
16 years old, I get
arrested by the FBI.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.370
But it's because I
was making money.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.340
But you said, but
that's not illegal.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.282
I mean, it is if
you like make money.

00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:56.244
OK.

00:17:56.244 --> 00:17:57.687
All right.

00:17:57.687 --> 00:17:59.130
I can't speak on it too much.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.190
But yeah, I used to make money.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.450
But that's a federal offense.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.109
And that's why I got arrested.

00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:07.150
It's funny because again,
hindsight, I look back,

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.290
and it was like, man.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.873
I remember one time
somebody called me

00:18:09.873 --> 00:18:11.595
a criminal genius,
one of my mentors.

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:14.200
And he was like, man, you were
like, think different, dude.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.520
It's like-- I don't know.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.507
I just think how I think.

00:18:18.507 --> 00:18:20.590
But that's why I'm so
passionate about mentorship.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.340
I didn't really have
anybody to mentor me.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.597
There are no excuses.

00:18:23.597 --> 00:18:25.430
My grandmother showed
me unconditional love.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.513
People would always try
to communicate and tell me

00:18:27.513 --> 00:18:28.062
the best.

00:18:28.062 --> 00:18:30.020
But again, that's why
I'm passionate about what

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.800
I do, because I recognize
just because you tell somebody

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.800
the right thing, if you're
not speaking their language,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.949
it doesn't really matter.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.240
And so a lot of people were
telling me the right stuff,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.970
but they weren't
speaking my language.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.179
And that's cool, right?

00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:43.220
I travel internationally.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.510
I recognize sometimes, if
you're talking to somebody,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.572
and they don't
speak your language,

00:18:47.572 --> 00:18:49.656
then you just get a translator.

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:51.530
It's not even on you to
learn a new language.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.738
I can go to a new country
and not speak the language.

00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:54.750
I just get a translator.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.080
That's why I've created a
mentorship program, because I

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.870
know the translators, the
people that speak the language.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.370
Because my heart goes out to
these youths that were like me.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.120
But at this point, I
didn't have a mentor.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.310
I didn't have a translator.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.310
I wouldn't listen to anybody
that was telling me anything.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.010
I became the best
at being the worst.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.990
When I was 17 years old,
my grandmother passed away.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.067
Then I feel like it's
me against the world.

00:19:14.067 --> 00:19:15.400
I feel like it's only me, right?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.190
So my mom died.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.870
My dad left.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.020
I'm in the ghetto.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.840
The one person that
loved me passed away.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.160
My grandmother now-- it's
just like, it's just me.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.110
And so I'm going
against the grain.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.470
I still graduated high
school, top of my class,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.230
and got an academic scholarship.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.660
So I get an academic
scholarship.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.567
That was the first
time I came to UT.

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:35.400
And you've got to imagine
a little black boy

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.550
from the ghetto gets
an academic scholarship

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.190
and gets to go to UT.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.595
And it was like, I
felt like Scarface.

00:19:42.595 --> 00:19:44.480
It was like, king
of the world, baby.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.860
Then they did something stupid--
like super crazy stupid.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.360
They gave me all my scholarship
money in this one big check

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.790
and said, here, this is yours.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.720
I thought I was rich.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.275
Like, wow.

00:19:56.275 --> 00:19:57.150
I went and cashed it.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.800
I was waiting for somebody
to try to come arrest me,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.900
and they never did.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.810
And it was like, wow.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.510
And then I went shopping.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.880
And then like two months
later, I got bills in the mail

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.940
from the dormitory.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.810
Like, where's your rent?

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.910
Oh, that's what
that money was for.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.240
I didn't know.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.740
In addition, right--
and that's key.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.260
I talk about it now.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.007
But it really was like
a lack of life skills.

00:20:21.007 --> 00:20:22.590
I recognized I had
all this potential,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.920
but I didn't have a mentor.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.360
I didn't have life skills.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.340
So the program
that I've created,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.800
ReRoute, that's
what we deal with.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.412
We deal with youth
in general, not even

00:20:31.412 --> 00:20:32.620
the ones that have potential.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.220
Because the truth is,
everybody has potential.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.775
That's just the truth.

00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:38.150
Everybody has
potential, but they

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.160
have to figure out what it is,
where theirs is, how to tap it,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.180
and how to polish it.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.680
I didn't.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.350
I was just barreling ahead.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.390
Long story short, it
took three semesters--

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.631
I'm all the way to college.

00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:51.880
I made it all the way to UT
on an academic scholarship

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.790
and never studied in my life.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.470
Some of you probably
can relate to that

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.790
because we're all gifted.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.530
We're all gifted
in different areas.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.055
LeBron James, anybody know
what college he went to?

00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:05.310
He didn't go to college
because he's that gifted.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.530
But he polished a gift.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:06.790
You know what I mean?

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.331
He'd been playing
basketball like 12,

00:21:08.331 --> 00:21:11.070
13 years by the time he was 18.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.700
So it's like, you can be gifted.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.090
I'm sure many of you are gifted.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.520
That's why you get to work here.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.290
That's why you get to work
at a great organization.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.320
That's why people that are
great and do what they do-- I

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.445
know a lot of great people.

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.430
I get to meet the most
fascinating people.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.272
And it's so funny because I
realize that they're gifted.

00:21:25.272 --> 00:21:27.730
And they're gifted in their
area, and they do what they do,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.090
whether that's business, whether
that's finance, whether that's

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.240
sports, whether that's
art, whether that's music.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.560
But me, I didn't realize it.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.510
I just got all the
way to college,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.420
and I was like, why
should I study now?

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.232
I made it this far.

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:40.190
That didn't make sense.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.490
I guess they've got
to study, not me.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.040
But that didn't work.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.720
It took three semesters before
I flunked out of school.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.110
I lost my academic scholarship.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.710
I got put on
scholastic probation.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:57.160
I was a victim to myself,
really, a victim to pride.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.910
I was a victim to
like, well, everybody

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.280
knew me as being the dude who
always had the latest sneakers.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.460
I had the biggest necklaces.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.480
I had the nicest car.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.970
I did this and did that.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.310
And I was living irresponsibly.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.802
So now it was like, I have
to keep up this facade,

00:22:10.802 --> 00:22:12.760
but now I don't have any
more scholarship money

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.790
to spend on it.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.150
So I resorted to what I knew.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.960
So I went back to hustling.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.819
So I go back to
hustling, and I was

00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:20.360
doing all the stuff
that was I doing.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.500
I got convicted of
three more felonies.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.335
Add that to the
one I already had.

00:22:24.335 --> 00:22:26.460
That made four, and they
sent me to the Texas State

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.950
Penitentiary.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.010
So now I get kicked
out of UT, and I end up

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.980
at the Texas Department
of Corrections, TDC.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.044
TDCJ.

00:22:35.044 --> 00:22:36.460
So I'm sitting in
prison, and it's

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.796
crazy to just go
from the opulence

00:22:39.796 --> 00:22:41.170
that they had at
UT to just being

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.410
a number in prison, 758371.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.600
And they no longer
called me by my name.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.917
They just called me 758371.

00:22:48.917 --> 00:22:50.000
And I'm sitting in prison.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.080
And for me, that was
an eye-opening moment,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.496
because at that
moment, I realized

00:22:53.496 --> 00:22:56.870
that it wasn't my circumstances,
but it was my choices.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.350
It wasn't because I was black.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.010
It wasn't because I
grew up in the ghetto.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.760
It wasn't my mom
died and my dad left.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.991
It wasn't the system.

00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:05.240
You all ever heard of the Man?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.840
People say, like, it's the Man.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.960
Like apparently there's some
dude out there called the Man.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.502
And if I ever run
into him, I'm going

00:23:11.502 --> 00:23:13.400
to come up because
he owes me something.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.180
But that's not why
I was locked up.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.666
I was locked up because
I made bad choices.

00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:19.415
But that was empowering
because I realized

00:23:19.415 --> 00:23:22.240
if you make bad choices
and you get bad results,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.840
if you make better choices,
you get better results.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.830
So I'm going to pause.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.182
I'm going to do a song.

00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:28.760
I'll pause.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.759
I'll do a song, and then
I'll finish telling you

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:33.100
how the story goes, right?

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.590
But this is what I realized
when I was incarcerated.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:41.800
I realized that my mama, my
grandmother that raised me,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.140
she had a vision for my life.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.660
And that unconditional
love that she showed me,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.080
it laid a foundation for me.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.929
And really, she just
wanted me to be successful.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.470
I think that's why
she just showed me

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.210
that-- I understand
the power of love.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:04.285
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:07.300
So I recently debuted this
song in New York City,

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.410
just a few weeks ago
for Mother's Day.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.100
I did this event in partnership
with the UN Foundation

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.220
and Johnson &amp; Johnson
because they had this event.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.330
It was called Moms +SocialGood,
where they honored moms.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.740
I believe teachers and moms
are some of the most unsung

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.360
heroes in the world.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.025
They do the most, and
they get the least.

00:24:27.025 --> 00:24:28.270
But I wrote this song.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.320
Check it out.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:29.910
It goes--

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:35.843
[SINGING] Mama, mama, I'ma
be everything you saw in me.

00:24:35.843 --> 00:24:37.020
Yeah.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.450
True, you are gone.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.260
Don't get it confused,
this is not a sad song.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.690
I've been shining
oh so bright simply

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.180
'cause you raised me right.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.000
Yeah, and gave me so much game.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.040
I'ma man show the whole
world singing now.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.870
P-E-A-R-L-I-E, I call her Ms.
Collins, may she rest in peace.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.500
See, she be why I be me,.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.090
Momma raised a monster and
left the world with a beast.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:03.590
Hey.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.305
No mama, no daddy,
no bro, no sis.

00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:08.720
I grew up an only child,
man, just me and this chick.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.290
Some called her Big Mama,
some called her Miss.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.160
I call her the only reason
I could have all this.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.470
She gave me the game and
she laid the foundation.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.600
Now I done took that thing
and founded a nation.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.920
She told me never follow.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.925
Be a leader.

00:25:21.925 --> 00:25:25.200
She's why I know Christ,
why I'm a believer.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.575
People say SaulPaul,
what's your secret?

00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:31.270
I just laced you, let those
that have ears peep it, see it,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.560
could not be made no plainer.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.980
I put that on what I
love with no disclaimer.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.070
P-E-A-R-L-I-E. I call her Ms.
Collins, may she rest in peace.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.010
See, she be why I be me.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.720
Momma raised a monster,
left the world with a beast.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.210
Mama, mama, I'ma be
everything you saw in me.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.490
Yeah.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.880
True, you are gone.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.610
Don't get it confused,
this is not a sad song.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:01.020
I've been shining
oh so bright simply

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.240
'cause you raised me right.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.980
Yeah, and you gave
me so much game,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.970
I'ma man show the whole world,
singing that P-E-A-R-L-I-E,

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.740
I call her Ms. Collins,
may she rest in peace.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.620
See, she be why I be me.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.410
Momma raised a monster,
left the world with a beast.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.540
Hey, I grew a poet
and I ain't even

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.090
know it 'cause when we let
go, she didn't even show it.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.950
She kept me focused,
head in them textbooks.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.020
Now I'm living good.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.300
Look how them checks look.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.690
She taught me about love.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.270
She taught me about life.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.590
Showed me what was wrong and
taught me what was right.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.630
Then she let me live me
life, but I made mistakes.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.130
She still showed me love, so
I guess she taught me grace.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.125
She taught me about
faith and family,

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:46.540
and home should be your place
of peace even in a calamity.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.640
She told me straight, this world
is insanity, but once I make it

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.970
out the hood, oh,
what a man I'll be.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.090
Well, I made it, Mama.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.560
Wish you could see me now.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.295
I got the world watching 'cause
I'm straight gleaming now.

00:26:57.295 --> 00:26:58.300
I did good.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.750
It's 'cause she did better.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.565
This is not a song.

00:27:00.565 --> 00:27:02.410
It's a love letter.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.200
Mama, mama, I'ma be
everything you saw in me.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.190
Yeah.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.610
True, you are gone.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.370
Don't get it confused,
this is not a sad song.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.700
I've been shining
oh so bright simply

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.100
'cause you raised me right.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.530
Yeah, and you gave
me so much game,

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:26.870
I'm a man show the whole world,
singing that P-E-A-R-L-I-E,

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.430
I call her Ms. Collins,
may she rest in peace.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.250
See, she be why I be me.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.449
Momma raised a monster,
left the world with a beast.

00:27:35.449 --> 00:27:39.441
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:47.960
All right.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.900
So the way that the
story ends, right,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.550
so I can move on to another
song in a second, what ended up

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.400
happening was, I was in prison.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.950
And I realized,
again, like I said,

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.010
it was my choices,
not my circumstance.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.900
That empowered me.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.010
When I was in prison,
I started dreaming big,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.800
and that's what changed the
game to like this moment now.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.220
Because like I said in the song,
right, that's not a sad song.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.140
Like my grandmother,
she laid a foundation,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.630
she put a lot into me.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.550
She lived her life as
a sacrifice for me.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.950
And because of that, I'm
doing pretty good right now.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.400
I ended up-- I
had four felonies.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.390
I had 10 years that I was in
the Texas State Penitentiary.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:26.290
In Texas, when you get 10
years, you know how long you do?

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.150
10 years.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.680
I was there for like two.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.420
I was a modern-day miracle.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.310
I get out of prison.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.630
I'm on parole.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.200
I get out of the Texas State
Penitentiary on parole,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.480
and I get re-admitted to the
prestigious University of Texas

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.611
at Austin.

00:28:39.611 --> 00:28:41.860
Not only would I get back
into the University of Texas

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.930
at Austin, this time around
I'm not taking it for granted,

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.474
because I'm actually
doing my work.

00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:48.640
That's why I ended up doing
better when I graduated.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.630
But deeper still, I
figured out something.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.230
And I figured out that I was
born on purpose with a purpose.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.770
And I quit taking life light.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.277
I quit taking it for granted.

00:28:59.277 --> 00:29:00.360
And it was like, OK, cool.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.235
So what's my purpose?

00:29:01.235 --> 00:29:03.225
And I realized, I
want to touch people.

00:29:03.225 --> 00:29:04.749
And I want to do
it through media.

00:29:04.749 --> 00:29:06.040
I want to do it through movies.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.350
I want to do it through
mobile gaming apps.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.910
I want to do it through music.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.901
I want to do it through
live presentations.

00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:13.400
I want to put together creative
productions and touch people

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.800
and inspire people.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.660
That's what I decided
I wanted to do.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.090
And at this point, you all
probably don't know it.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.180
Some of you all might.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.450
I don't know how old you are.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.505
But there's this network.

00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:23.850
It's called MTV.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.190
Back in the day, they
used to show music videos.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.872
Not anymore.

00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:31.330
But they used to
show music videos.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.288
So I used to just watch
all these music videos.

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:36.680
And it was like, man, I just
want to make music videos.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.670
But was like, you can't
go to college for that.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.003
Little did I know, I was
talking to my academic advisor,

00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:43.580
and he was like, man, a music
video's just like a mini-movie.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.030
You should get into
the film school.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.720
And I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.386
He was like, yeah,
the film school's one

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.644
of the best in the country.

00:29:50.644 --> 00:29:52.310
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.580
And I set my sight on that.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.660
And I got accepted
to the film school

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.390
at UT, one of the
best in the country.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.350
Long story short, I graduated
from the film school

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.890
with a 4.0.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.420
So I go from four
felonies to a 4.0.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.920
And at this point,
when I graduated,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.680
my first project was
called "Tower to Tower."

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.980
Because I was at the UT tower.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.689
I remember it was May 17.

00:30:11.689 --> 00:30:12.730
I'm sitting at the tower.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.930
I got on my cap and gown.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.170
I got a few relatives, a few
family members, a few people

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:17.795
from the block.

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:18.836
You know what I'm saying?

00:30:18.836 --> 00:30:21.310
It was amazing to see the
love and feel the support.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.540
They all came from Houston.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.554
They're in a big crowd.

00:30:23.554 --> 00:30:24.470
They're sitting there.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.670
I got on the cap and gown.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.279
And I'm sitting there, and
they're doing the speech.

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:31.820
I'm waiting for them to call my
name and all that good stuff.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.730
And I'm sitting there, and it's
like, I don't know, 5:00, 6:00,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.134
and we're at the tower.

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:37.050
And the sun's setting.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.770
And I'm sitting at the tower,
and I'm looking at the tower,

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:40.510
and it clicks.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.630
Like, wow, I went
from tower to tower.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.165
Because you know,
in prison, they

00:30:44.165 --> 00:30:45.770
have the watch
guard tower, right?

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.844
That's like where the
dude has the rifle,

00:30:47.844 --> 00:30:50.260
and they're waiting for somebody
to run so they can shoot.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.910
Because I used to be sitting
in my penitentiary cell looking

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.260
through the Plexiglas
window past the barbed wire,

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.590
and I would see that tower.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.430
And I would dream
about when I get out.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.120
And here I was at UT
about to graduate,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.620
moments from graduation,
and I see the UT tower.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.430
And it was like, wow.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.490
I went from tower to tower.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.880
And see that right there, that
was kind of like when-- that's

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.720
when they create-- even
in the song, I say,

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.250
"Momma raised a monster and
left the world with a beast."

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.360
That's when I realized,
oh, I got a problem.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.270
Like, wow, it's OK to dream.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.040
A lot of people don't dream.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.940
I'm going to assume you
are dreamers because Google

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.480
is like this
awesome company that

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.360
does great things
and profound things.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.280
And I run a company myself.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.400
And so I recognize
that there's a culture.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.730
And we created a
culture in my company.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.970
And so I'm going to assume that
there's an awesome culture here

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.750
as well.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.040
And I know that many times,
though, the culture-- culture

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.550
in life, like in general,
doesn't promote dreaming.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.300
It doesn't promote
dreaming big, thinking big,

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.770
having a huge vision.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.180
At that point, though,
that's when something clicks.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.891
Because it was like, wow,
I was in the penitentiary.

00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:02.640
And I dreamed about
going back to college.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.460
When I told people
who were in prison,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.810
like, dude, this for the birds.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:06.365
You know what I'm saying?

00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:07.800
I'm never coming back here.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.450
They literally laughed at
me like that was crazy.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.455
That's a whole different speech
for a different audience.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.360
This is Google.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.797
I have a lot of respect for
you, you know what I'm saying?

00:32:23.797 --> 00:32:25.380
But it's crazy because
just yesterday,

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.145
I was at an elementary school.

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:31.870
The crowd was a lot more crunk.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.620
And it was bigger.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.570
But no, it's all good.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.480
I like you still.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.340
But when I'm at an elementary
school or a high school,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.240
like when I told you
I was in New York,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:40.980
I was at this other event.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.854
Or I'm going to stay--
I'm in a penitentiary.

00:32:42.854 --> 00:32:44.650
I'm in a juvenile
detention center one day.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.300
I'm in a penitentiary the next.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.300
Because I don't see people
as these demographics

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.150
and different types.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.620
They're just people.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.310
And I know because
it was me, right?

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.067
So I can be here,
and I'm a person.

00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:55.525
But I was also in
the penitentiary.

00:32:55.525 --> 00:32:56.983
And when I was in
the penitentiary,

00:32:56.983 --> 00:32:58.520
I was the same person.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.070
I was just living
out my choices.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.120
But when I'm talking
to somebody in prison,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.440
it's crazy because I'm
trying to get them to dream.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.582
Because when I was in
prison, I told people,

00:33:07.582 --> 00:33:09.790
I'm going to get out, and
I'm going to go to college,

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.375
and I'm going to graduate, and
they straight-up laughed at me.

00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:14.650
They would literally call
people over, like, hey, hey,

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.220
come over here and
check this out.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.135
Say, tell him what you told us.

00:33:18.135 --> 00:33:19.340
Like, literally.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.420
It was crazy.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.797
Like, bro, I'm never
coming back to prison.

00:33:22.797 --> 00:33:24.380
And they were like,
that's crazy, man.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.890
How are you going to say
what you're going to do?

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.393
I remember them
clearly saying that.

00:33:28.393 --> 00:33:30.540
And that hurt me, not
that they didn't believe,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.430
but where their mind was.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.472
Like, wow, you're
such a victim of life

00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:36.930
that you really
don't feel like you

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.554
have control of what
your life will be.

00:33:38.554 --> 00:33:40.420
They're like, you can't
say whether or not

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.920
you're going to
come back to prison.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.790
You can't say what
you're going to do.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.150
But you can say what
you're going to do.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.340
You can dream.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.410
You can speak it.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.870
And then you can put in
the work to make it happen.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.410
And I love it because
I keep doing it.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.420
But that's not a
prison mentality.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.550
Sadly, that's a human mentality.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.670
There's so many people
that feel trapped, right?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.590
People go to prison,
people feeling trapped.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:09.165
And so me, my goal is to unleash
people, to release people,

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:11.040
to maybe touch something
inside and say, man,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.250
if it was me-- because
it's not about just me.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.041
It's like, cool, so
I'll tell you my story,

00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:17.176
but this is-- I'm a case study.

00:34:17.176 --> 00:34:20.630
I'm just a walking, talking
case study, like, look at me.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.280
I had no help, no
resources, no support,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.199
but it's not because look at me.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.434
It's more like, I mean,
if I did it, why not you?

00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:28.850
I remember during
Christmas break,

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.510
or even summer break, everybody
else would get excited,

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.687
like, man, we get to go
home, we get to go do this.

00:34:33.687 --> 00:34:35.186
And I'm like, I
don't know where I'm

00:34:35.186 --> 00:34:37.429
going to stay because
the dorm closes,

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.699
and they don't open up
for like three weeks,

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.380
and I don't have
a home to go to.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.989
But anyway, so where I'm at now.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.929
When I graduated, I started
working at a television

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.420
station, an ABC
affiliate here in Austin.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.810
Or in Austin, Texas.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.500
And so I started working
at that television station.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.620
I worked there for a year.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.602
It was cool.

00:34:58.602 --> 00:35:00.310
But that's when I
started dreaming, like,

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:01.770
man, I want to create a company.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.920
I want to build a company.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.320
I want to make music.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.590
I want to make movies.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.740
I want to make video games.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.080
I want to make a difference.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.140
And so I worked there for a
year, and then I resigned.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.740
Then I started my company,
ReRoute Productions.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.300
At the same time, I started
the nonprofit ReRoute.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.710
And it's interesting
because when

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.840
you work with wires,
anything technical,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.205
like you reroute the wires.

00:35:25.205 --> 00:35:27.220
Like it might not be
working, so you reroute it.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.586
That's where it came from.

00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:30.710
But at the same time, when
it came to the outreach,

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.497
it was more about
like rerouting lives.

00:35:33.497 --> 00:35:35.080
Because there were
so many people that

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.413
have felt like there were so
many people that were lost,

00:35:37.413 --> 00:35:39.700
and it was like-- it goes
back to what I talked about

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.910
in the beginning, just
having the right translators.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.600
I realize, cool,
I'm a translator.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.516
But there are so many.

00:35:45.516 --> 00:35:48.110
So what I do is I work with--
I do a lot of consulting now

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:52.790
for large brands and
companies and people that

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.230
have corporate responsibility
divisions and arms,

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.492
and they want to reach people,
and I help them do it better.

00:35:58.492 --> 00:35:59.595
I'm that translator.

00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:01.595
And I bring in other
people that are translators

00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:04.100
and help them create systems
and organizations that

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.600
create the most.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.970
We did this very, very
cool event during South

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:08.560
by Southwest.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.851
I'm sure you all are probably
familiar with the Spotify

00:36:10.851 --> 00:36:12.390
House.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.600
Green House, Sixth Street,
South By, it's the place to be.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.560
For the first year, they did
this outreach to the community.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.070
And so I was a part of
that, and it was awesome.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.700
It was great.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.610
And we got to impact
some students that

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.460
were there in Austin
for the event.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.665
That's just one example.

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:33.460
I'm going to do another song.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.560
I'm going to do another song.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.830
I have this new project
that's called Dream in 3D.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.180
This is the song
from that project.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.887
It's called "Rise."

00:36:44.887 --> 00:36:46.720
This is what I want to
inspire people to do.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.415
Let's see.

00:36:52.003 --> 00:36:56.035
And so I have a book.

00:36:56.035 --> 00:36:56.830
I have a book.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.735
The book is called
"Dream in 3D."

00:36:58.735 --> 00:37:00.810
I have a mobile gaming app.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:06.156
The mobile gaming app is called
"SaulPaul-- Dream in 3D."

00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:09.120
And it's cool because you can
play it on your Google device.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.201
Anybody ever play "Temple Run"?

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:17.701
Yeah?

00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:19.270
It's like an endless runner?

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.070
All right.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.590
So the mobile gaming app is
kind of like "Temple Run,"

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.656
except it's in the hood.

00:37:25.656 --> 00:37:28.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.770
So if you're into these
songs, and you're like, oh,

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:35.125
that music's sweet, you can go
download it, Google Play store

00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:35.833
and other places.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.917
I don't even know why that
was funny, but it's funny.

00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:45.250
People always say, you're funny.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.340
I'm like, I'm not trying
to be, so you must just

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.410
be laughing at me.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.040
All right.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.750
But-- and I have this book.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:58.600
So this is the lyrics to the
song that I'm about to sing.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.240
But the book is actually
like the annotated lyrics.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.170
So it's pretty cool.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.286
You should go check it out,
tell somebody about it.

00:38:05.286 --> 00:38:05.990
All right.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.962
Here goes the song.

00:38:06.962 --> 00:38:07.712
Just check it out.

00:38:07.712 --> 00:38:09.070
Like this.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:14.430
[SINGING] Rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.490
Now is the time for
you to shine, yeah.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:24.990
Say rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:30.200
Now is the time for
you to shine, yeah.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.040
[RAPPING] Rise to the
moment, rise to the occasion.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.640
Open your eyes, recognize there
is greatness within your reach.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.660
You should seize it,
you should take it.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.490
Can you see it?

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.280
Can you take destiny?

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.679
Hard work and a plan, now
that's a recipe for success

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:46.470
that'll launch you
where them blessings be.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.140
The road to riches, though,
that's where them tests be.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.800
But I ain't tripping, you
knowing how us Texans be.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.340
A lot of pride, plus a lot
of confidence, and my job

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.200
is to see what is not obvious,
as a pioneer, an entrepreneur.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.640
So I'm gonna work it out 'til
it's smoother than velour.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.900
For sure, I'ma gonna make
it to that finish line.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.460
I got my second wind,
and now it's finish time.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.030
It's like spinach
time, and I am Popeye.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.710
Stop short?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.560
No, not I.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.770
[SINGING] Rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:22.680
Now is the time for
you to shine, yeah.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.230
Say rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.786
Now is the time for
you to shine, yeah.

00:39:32.786 --> 00:39:33.810
[RAPPING] Hey.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:35.110
You got nothing to lose.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.610
What'll make you deadly, play
like you got nothing to prove.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.930
Don't be fronting for fools.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:39.600
Stay focused.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.840
You got something to do.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.890
Snatch the top slot.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.530
What's the use in number two?

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.980
Hold your own like Neo
when they come for you.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.720
You choose to rule or
chopped like lumber do.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.250
The comfort of slumber keep
the dumb ones under the roof.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.110
Those scared of thunder die as
they hide but hunger for food.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.430
You was birthed on this Earth
with a purpose and call.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.670
Does it blow your mind to find
it's more than simply serving

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.210
the Lord?

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.580
Every day that you wake,
you're involved in a war.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.310
Recall when you swore it'd
never get as worse as before?

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.900
Better take what's yours,
or they'll take what yours.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.560
From this day forward, be great,
change your fate for sure.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.100
Let the hate elevate the
rate at which you score.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.430
Time is ticking much quicker.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:14.980
You can't wait no more.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:20.050
[SINGING] Rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.620
Now is the time for
you to shine, yeah.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:30.440
I said, rise, rise,
and open your eyes.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.516
Now is the time for you to
shine, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:36.516 --> 00:40:40.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:46.860
So yeah.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:52.379
Just a little bit
about my organization.

00:40:52.379 --> 00:40:53.670
This summer is very, very cool.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.914
I just partnered with
the UN Foundation,

00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:58.330
and we're about to go on-- I'm
going on a big summer tour.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.777
I'll be playing some major
festivals like the Orange

00:41:01.777 --> 00:41:04.110
County Fair, you know what
I'm saying, in Orange County.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.080
I'll play the world's
largest music festival

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.030
in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, Summerfest.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:15.040
And then I'll play like
Safeway Barbecue Battle in DC,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.020
as well as Music
Fest in Philadelphia,

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.090
this other festival
in Minnesota,

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.250
the Sunshine Festival, as
well as the Cutting Edge Music

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.560
Festival in New Orleans.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.610
So I'll get to be in front
of over a million people

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.497
this summer.

00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:30.330
It's not even just like
a normal little set.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.950
But I get to go even
be an ambassador

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.310
for the city of Austin.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.770
I was just named an ambassador
for the city of Austin.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.270
Actually on June 12
in Austin, they're

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.870
naming June 12 SaulPaul Day.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.090
So I've been to City Hall.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.776
That's like a huge contrast
right there, right?

00:41:47.776 --> 00:41:50.510
I'm trying to figure out--
I get to make one rule.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.301
I don't know what it
is, but it'll probably

00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:54.960
be related to barbecue.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.120
I'm working on it.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.055
So very many, many cool
things are happening.

00:41:59.055 --> 00:42:01.430
But I've been plotting, and
I've been thinking, like man,

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.320
how can I use this
platform of being able--

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.080
like all these platforms
to be able to leverage

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.140
it to create some
type of change?

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.870
And my goal really
is in the next year

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.830
to touch 10 million people.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.070
Like I get to see a
million just this summer.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:19.820
But it's also to incorporate
social media into that.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.250
And just because
there's power in story.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.517
There's power in story.

00:42:23.517 --> 00:42:25.350
Like I tell my story,
and it touches people.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.470
But I'm not foolish.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.840
It's not just my story.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.620
I've been inspired by people.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.019
I remember when I was in
prison, and I would read books

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:33.810
about people that I
still have yet to meet.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.310
I would just read
their book, and it

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.266
was like-- it
changed my worldview.

00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:38.140
It made me different.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.674
I'll see a tweet,
and it'll change.

00:42:40.674 --> 00:42:43.215
I'll be in a Google Hangout,
and somebody will say something,

00:42:43.215 --> 00:42:46.990
and it's like, wow, I'm going
to steal that and tweet that.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.110
And it's powerful
what we can do.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.450
And so you should
follow up with me,

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.720
get with me at saulpaul.com.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.125
That's my headquarters.

00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:56.709
If you go to saulpaul.com,
you can find everything

00:42:56.709 --> 00:42:58.500
that I've mentioned,
like the mobile gaming

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.217
app, the book, the
music, tour calendar.

00:43:02.217 --> 00:43:04.050
No matter what it is,
you can find it there.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.150
And I would love to
connect because I

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.260
know that you have
greatness inside of you,

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.570
and if nothing
else, you might be

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.957
able to help mentor some of
the youth that I'm exposed to.

00:43:13.957 --> 00:43:15.040
Because it's pretty crazy.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.107
I feel like the Pied Piper.

00:43:17.107 --> 00:43:18.690
I go do what I do,
and then these kids

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:19.720
are like, man, that's what's up.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.660
And then they go to the
website, and they're there.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.770
And it's this online community.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.610
But my goal is to connect
them with other people

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.984
because I can't
do it all myself.

00:43:25.984 --> 00:43:27.100
I can't do it alone.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.270
I don't desire to.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:29.880
I get to meet the
coolest people that

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.550
do the greatest
and coolest things,

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.870
and they're like-- then
they'll have an opportunity

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.996
to pour into somebody else.

00:43:34.996 --> 00:43:36.620
So of you're looking
for an opportunity

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.030
to pour into somebody else,
please get in contact with me

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.250
because I can hook you up.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:44.622
I have not enough mentors
and too many kids.

00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:45.580
And it's not even deep.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.371
It's not even time.

00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:47.670
It can be online.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.280
You can just connect with them.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:49.780
It's cool.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.613
We have this whole chat
room and everything.

00:43:51.613 --> 00:43:53.799
And you can just,
like, wise words.

00:43:53.799 --> 00:43:55.340
Because me-- because
I know it works.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.173
That's why I made it
all the way to college.

00:43:57.173 --> 00:43:58.880
I never had life
skills or any insight

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.760
that anybody could give me.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.711
And that's why I made
those poor choices.

00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:05.210
I recognize what I'm special
at is because I didn't give up,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.180
I didn't quit, I
didn't beat myself up.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.160
Instead, I was able
to turn it around.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.100
But I want to help
some other people.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.100
I want to help some
young people before they

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.900
make those mistakes.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.400
So I may or may not
do another song,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.314
but I hate one-sided
conversations,

00:44:19.314 --> 00:44:20.230
so you all talk to me.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.620
Does anybody have
anything to share, say?

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.375
Questions, karaoke?

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:32.290
Yes, ma'am.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.220
NICOLE: Can you follow
up with me briefly?

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.203
SAULPAUL: Yes.

00:44:35.203 --> 00:44:38.771
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll
speak to you after.

00:44:38.771 --> 00:44:41.790
KATE: Nicole runs our
GoogleServe events here,

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.107
and I think she's got some
good stuff in store for you.

00:44:44.107 --> 00:44:45.940
NICOLE: Yeah, we could
definitely partner up

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.060
with you guys and
donate our skills.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.780
And I'm sure we can get a
couple mentors out of here.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.254
So yeah, I'll talk to you after.

00:44:52.254 --> 00:44:52.795
SAULPAUL: OK.

00:44:52.795 --> 00:44:54.340
That'd be awesome.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.891
Yeah, that's very, very cool.

00:44:57.891 --> 00:44:58.390
It's funny.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.249
Your video technicians, I had a
different conversation on that.

00:45:01.249 --> 00:45:03.040
I don't want it to live
forever on the web.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.320
I'll give you a contrast.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.412
I had a meeting at
Nike earlier this year.

00:45:08.412 --> 00:45:09.370
It was very, very cool.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.110
There's an awesome guy there
that supports the vision,

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.404
and we're working on some
very, very cool stuff.

00:45:14.404 --> 00:45:15.320
And it's crazy, right?

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.120
Because I was in
Beaverton, Oregon, at Nike.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.510
But when I was young, I used to
do some very, very bad things

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.120
just to get Nikes.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.385
So this contrast blows my mind.

00:45:26.385 --> 00:45:27.870
I'm like, wow.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.390
And I just see that contrast.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:36.651
Or I use Johnson &amp; Johnson, like
baby oil, so that I'm not ashy.

00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:38.400
But now I'm working
with Johnson &amp; Johnson

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.230
and been able to
do some cool stuff.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.470
So my goal is like
kids will ask me

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.029
like-- because I
rap, they're like,

00:45:44.029 --> 00:45:46.320
what other famous-- like who
do you know that's famous?

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.235
I'm like, me.

00:45:48.235 --> 00:45:50.360
And then they're like, who
do you collaborate with?

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.830
And I tell them the
artists and what-not.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.610
But I'm more concerned
with collaborating

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.873
with brands and companies
because I remember

00:45:56.873 --> 00:45:58.802
that same reason why I
made counterfeit money.

00:45:58.802 --> 00:46:00.260
I'm trying to figure
out how to get

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.540
the biggest bang for the effort.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.023
And I realize like to partner
with cool people like you

00:46:06.023 --> 00:46:08.130
all, and they've
already vetted you out.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.790
You all are the
best of the best.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.280
So yeah, we'd love that help.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.562
Yes, ma'am, in the back.

00:46:12.562 --> 00:46:13.645
AUDIENCE: How [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:16.299 --> 00:46:16.840
SAULPAUL: Oh.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.330
Hold up one second.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.555
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:46:19.555 --> 00:46:20.430
SAULPAUL: No worries.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.880
I'm going to have
to edit this, man.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.160
AUDIENCE: How did you--

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.410
SAULPAUL: I'll be halfway
looking crazy all on Google,

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.260
dude.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.420
Because it's going to
be the first thing that

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.150
pops up anytime they
Google me, right?

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.520
And it's going to be like this.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.000
So you've got to edit it down.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.500
AUDIENCE: How did
you learn to play?

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.374
Were you self-taught?

00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:35.490
And when did you learn to play?

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.910
SAULPAUL: That's
a great question.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.770
I'm self-taught.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.935
I had a teacher.

00:46:41.935 --> 00:46:45.100
I'm a certified
personal trainer.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.560
And when I used to train--
I don't train anymore.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.770
People can't afford me.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:53.322
But when I used to
train, I was on campus,

00:46:53.322 --> 00:46:55.530
and I remember putting this
sign up, and it was like,

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.020
I just discovered this
crazy concept called barter.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.625
And I was like, will barter.

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:02.000
That's like when
you trade stuff.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.625
I'm like, yeah.

00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:04.556
I'll be your
personal trainer, you

00:47:04.556 --> 00:47:05.930
teach me to play
guitar or piano.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.850
Luckily, somebody answered
it that played guitar,

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.590
and they went and
bought this guitar.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.927
Like, we went to the guitar
store, bought this guitar.

00:47:13.927 --> 00:47:15.760
At that point, I didn't
have the discipline.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.460
Again, hindsight is 20/20.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.510
Because I'd only show up.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.180
And so I can't give
them any credit

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.590
for teaching me because
I didn't do my part.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.809
But later, it clicked,
and I fell in love

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:25.850
with playing this guitar.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:27.590
And it's interesting
because it made me--

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.419
I created my own lane.

00:47:29.419 --> 00:47:30.960
It wasn't on purpose
to be different.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.000
It was just like,
I like rapping,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.720
but now I play the guitar.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.940
I want to do both.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.060
And so I put them
together and now do

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.720
this acoustic hip-hop thing.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.760
And so it's pretty awesome.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.070
And then I personalize it, put
that percussion style into it.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:45.830
Do you play?

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.350
Do want to play?

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.040
AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:48.670
SAULPAUL: Oh.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.920
SAULPAUL: Yeah.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.439
Anybody else?

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.480
AUDIENCE: Your story is
very inspiring, so I just

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.790
want to know, what is your
biggest and proudest moment?

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.542
And I have another question.

00:48:02.542 --> 00:48:05.083
If you can tell us more about
your collaboration with Johnson

00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:05.719
&amp; Johnson.

00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:07.510
Because I've seen some
of their commercials

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.270
that they made for the
mothers, and I think

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.210
those are some of
the most touching

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.270
stories in commercials.

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.010
So I would be interested
to know more about that.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.660
SAULPAUL: Great question.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.900
My greatest accomplishment
I wouldn't know.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.810
The answer for that
one is recently,

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.190
I built a mentorship program.

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.790
Yeah.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.790
That's the biggest deal.

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.134
Because another thing-- and
you can't get credit for it.

00:48:31.134 --> 00:48:32.800
And I tell the artists,
like people only

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.900
know artists-- there's
like this huge void.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.780
Like you're either quote
unquote an "aspiring artist,"

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.770
"starving artist"--
that's crazy to me--

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:45.190
or you're platinum or 10 times
platinum, and you're rich,

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.730
right?

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.979
And it's like nobody knows
the artists in between.

00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:50.520
So the fact that I can make a
living, like this is what I do,

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.007
this is my job, that's amazing.

00:48:54.007 --> 00:48:56.090
So that might be like the
greatest accomplishment,

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.524
literally to be
like, this is work.

00:48:58.524 --> 00:49:00.440
If you see me at work,
I do nothing different.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.050
This is work.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.144
That's amazing to me.

00:49:03.144 --> 00:49:05.060
Because there's this big
void in between them,

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.520
like I just want
to make a living.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.680
I don't want to be
a starving artist.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.751
But I just want to make
a living as a musician.

00:49:11.751 --> 00:49:13.250
I get to do that
and write the songs

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.666
that I want to write and touch
the people I want to touch.

00:49:15.666 --> 00:49:18.580
But in the process, I
discovered I have this platform.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.820
I see so many people.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.675
And so I went on a tour,
and I came back to Austin.

00:49:22.675 --> 00:49:24.520
And when I came back
to Austin, people

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.690
were like-- I partnered
with a nonprofit,

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.590
and I built a
mentorship program.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.870
I was able to use my
platform to recruit people.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.010
Because artists are
starving, but they're

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.190
probably more famous
than most people.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.867
They get platforms to be
in front of more people.

00:49:39.867 --> 00:49:42.200
And so I just came up with
this plan to say, like, well,

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.957
what if I used my
platform to recruit?

00:49:44.957 --> 00:49:46.790
And I ended up building
a mentorship program

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.500
for adjudicated youth, youth
that were incarcerated already,

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.580
15 years old, 14 years, 17 years
old, and find mentors for them.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.330
And these kids are a
little bit different.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.704
So you can't just--
you don't get

00:49:57.704 --> 00:50:00.830
to mentor them and go
fishing on the weekend.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.390
You mentor them, and
you go fishing for them

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.200
on the weekend.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.140
But I found the coolest
people, and the relationships

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.560
are still long-lasting.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.366
So building that
mentorship program,

00:50:13.366 --> 00:50:15.490
I'd probably say that's my
greatest accomplishment.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.430
That's really what opened my
eyes to consulting as well,

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.050
like helping brands
and companies

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.530
with their corporate
responsibility,

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:28.120
because I personally recruited
more mentors into multimillion

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.242
dollar non-profits that
had the same assignment.

00:50:31.242 --> 00:50:33.325
And it's just because my
techniques were different

00:50:33.325 --> 00:50:34.970
and the platform was different.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.560
And so that's probably my
greatest accomplishment.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.261
What was the other question?

00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:41.520
AUDIENCE: Collaboration
with Johnson&amp;Johnson.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.645
SAULPAUL: The collaboration
with Johnson &amp; Johnson.

00:50:43.645 --> 00:50:47.230
Oh, I can't speak
on it too much.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.730
We could talk
outside or whatever.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.880
But, again, they're
videotaping me.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.705
And I still have
hood tendencies,

00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:55.700
so I don't like
cameras and cops.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:01.020
So I'll tell you on the side.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.340
Other question?

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.287
No, ma'am, go ahead.

00:51:04.287 --> 00:51:05.870
AUDIENCE: So you
work with tech, and I

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.719
know that you're working with
folks who are still in TDCJ,

00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:10.010
and you have that intersection.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.850
I don't know what it's like now,
but you know how it used to be.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.490
Folks would go away, and
then they'd come out.

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:15.215
And when you're doing
reentry, technology

00:51:15.215 --> 00:51:16.259
is so far beyond you.

00:51:16.259 --> 00:51:17.300
SAULPAUL: Oh my goodness.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.380
I did not know what WWW was.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
so much-- and it

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.625
affects so much antirecidivism
and that kind of stuff.

00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:25.500
Do you all work with--
is it still like that?

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.200
And do you all work
with working with folks

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.030
with reentry and kind of
catching them up on tech stuff?

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:32.770
SAULPAUL: That is
a great question.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.970
And you just spawned
something with that question.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:40.704
Yeah, that's still an issue.

00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:41.620
That's still an issue.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.990
The questions she's asking is
like, when you go to jail--

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.550
and it was crazy,
because technology

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.520
is moving like even faster now.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.429
Like 10 years ago, it was crazy.

00:51:52.429 --> 00:51:54.220
I remember when I went
to jail and got out,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.590
it was just like what
are these things that

00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.925
come on commercials
at the bottom?

00:51:59.925 --> 00:52:02.930
It was web addresses, right?

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.150
And how do you send an email?

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:05.941
How do you do this,
and how do you do that?

00:52:05.941 --> 00:52:09.530
And so you just
made a great point.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.862
It does affect recidivism
because when you come out,

00:52:12.862 --> 00:52:14.320
it's kind of like
being illiterate,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.840
except you're
computer illiterate.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.170
And then that makes you just do
less, and then the less you do,

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.810
the further you fall behind.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.750
And then that kind
of feeds back into,

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.125
well, I'll just
go back to what I

00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:27.390
know because I can't
even be on par.

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:29.370
So you just spawned
an idea, though.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:32.400
But yeah, that'd be a great
use of some tech-savvy people

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.640
to update some people and update
even young people and adults as

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.690
well because it's probably even
worse for the adults, yeah.

00:52:46.086 --> 00:52:49.780
AUDIENCE: With your
mentorship program,

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.500
what all cities have
you guys touched?

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.870
SAULPAUL: Great question.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:00.190
Austin, Atlanta, Philadelphia,
Newark, New Jersey,

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:05.790
New York City, Washington,
DC, Los Angeles.

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:07.572
I might be forgetting
one or two, but--

00:53:07.572 --> 00:53:08.405
AUDIENCE: St. Louis?

00:53:08.405 --> 00:53:09.863
SAULPAUL: --those
are the key ones.

00:53:09.863 --> 00:53:11.700
Not St. Louis.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.450
Not St. Louis yet.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.440
I have a connection there.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.898
They're waiting
for me to come out,

00:53:14.898 --> 00:53:16.150
but I haven't been there yet.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:19.210
But I've done some stuff with
NSBE, National Society of Black

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:22.692
Engineers, and they're waiting
for us to create something.

00:53:22.692 --> 00:53:23.650
Are you from St. Louis?

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.066
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm from the area.

00:53:25.066 --> 00:53:27.500
Yeah, St. Louis
definitely needs you.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.740
SAULPAUL: Yeah, we should talk.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.560
It's easy.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.230
It's like, when I made
that song in the beginning,

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.800
like no matter what the words
are, I'm able to take a song

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.360
and make it.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.910
I suck at basketball.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:45.830
But I can sing a song,
and I can impact a life.

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.070
So I feel like there's
no bottleneck when

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.930
it comes to that, especially
since we have a great system.

00:53:54.675 --> 00:53:55.800
AUDIENCE: A quick question.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.720
What are you reading right now?

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.180
SAULPAUL: "SaulPaul:
Dream in 3D."

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.232
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:02.232 --> 00:54:04.440
Real talk, like, what are
you listening to right now?

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.230
Like, I listen to me.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.040
That's a great question.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.206
What am I reading right now?

00:54:10.034 --> 00:54:12.312
What's the last book?

00:54:12.312 --> 00:54:13.700
Do you know?

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.240
I forget the name of it.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.309
I bought three books in the
last-- I just came off tour.

00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:21.100
I've been on tour for
the last three weeks.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.220
And I did not get to
read while I was in tour,

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.742
even though I was in
a lot of airports.

00:54:25.742 --> 00:54:27.575
Because when I like to
read, I like to read.

00:54:27.575 --> 00:54:30.175
I don't like to read
a page and put it up.

00:54:30.175 --> 00:54:32.880
I forget, but mainly I
read business books now.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.210
That's a great question.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.226
A great book that I read is
"The Celestine Prophecy."

00:54:37.226 --> 00:54:38.350
You ever heard of that one?

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:39.830
Anybody read that book?

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.350
That's a very cool book.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:42.760
"Celestine Prophecy."

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.860
And I read the Bible a lot.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.360
That's probably
what I read the most

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.430
outside of any other books.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.290
But yeah, I read a
lot of business books.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.030
And it's cool.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:54.700
And not music business
books, because-- that's

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.490
a whole other conversation.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.240
Yeah, business is business.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.270
So yeah, my goal is even--
I didn't elaborate on it,

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:05.840
but my goal to touch a million
people in the next year-- 10

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.610
million people, rather-- is
because like in the music

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.080
industry, they
quantify everything

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.080
by sales, like
sales and downloads.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.360
That's cool, but
I'm trying to-- I'm

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:21.970
grading mine by how many lives
I touch and how to be scalable.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:23.970
That's why we can go
to St. Louis like that.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.786
Other questions?

00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:28.627
Yes, ma'am.

00:55:28.627 --> 00:55:29.884
AUDIENCE: Why not Houston?

00:55:29.884 --> 00:55:31.050
SAULPAUL: I forgot that one.

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:31.942
Yeah, Houston.

00:55:31.942 --> 00:55:33.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.180
SAULPAUL: See?

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.890
It's kind of like
when you're balling.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.920
When you're balling, it's
funny because it's a big deal

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.460
that I remember SaulPaul Day.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.660
I done like I don't
know how many shows,

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.630
and then I get offstage,
and my team-- shoutout

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.260
to Team ReRoute in the
building-- they'll be like,

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.260
you didn't mention this.

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.170
And I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:51.670
I forgot Houston, yeah.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.990
Yeah, we're actually doing some
very cool things in Houston.

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:59.400
I was in Houston two days ago,
and we're building a program,

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.280
building up.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.710
Our most extensive mentorship
program yet is in Houston.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:05.617
And that's starting
this next school yeah.

00:56:05.617 --> 00:56:06.450
Yeah, I forgot that.

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.154
That's crazy.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:16.190
And that's it.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:17.510
That's it for time as well.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:19.610
I don't want to-- yeah.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:20.838
KATE: Thank you--

00:56:20.838 --> 00:56:22.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.300
KATE: --oh so, so much, man.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.120
That was awesome.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.900
Thank you so much.
