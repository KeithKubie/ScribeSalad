Well, the transfer isn't happening on the UI thread, but

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.750
that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's good that it's

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.900
not happening on the UI thread. So that's not a problem

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.910
either. Data transfers are an integral part of most modern smartphone

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.200
apps, so that's not a problem. The real problem is that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.080
the transfer is happening on a thread whose lifetime is tied

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.800
explicitly to a UI component, in this case an activity. So

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.330
if the activity is terminated by something like a screen rotation,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.080
the transfer will also be terminated.
