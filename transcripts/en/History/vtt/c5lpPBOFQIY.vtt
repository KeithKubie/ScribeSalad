00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.210
- To be honest, I don't know how
to respond.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.380
Come on, man.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.120
You work with this guy?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.880
- How you doing, gentleman?
- Hey.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.290
Oh, pretty good.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.500
MAN: I have a bronze
statue I'd like to sell.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.960
RICK: Do you know much about it?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.380
I don't know what to
tell you about that.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.710
RICK: This is a
statue called Pegasus.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.380
And this is Perseus.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.250
Perseus was the mythological
figure that killed Medusa.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.170
So what can you tell
me about this thing?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
MAN: It was made in 1888 by the
French sculpture mile Picault.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.040
If this is a
genuine Picault, we're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920
talking thousands of dollars.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.750
His sculptures are
highly collectible.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.580
The patina looks right.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.880
What doesn't look
right is there's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.420
some [inaudible] right here.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330
And that crack right there
is from when they cast it.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.080
It didn't happen later.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.920
To be honest, I don't
know how to respond.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.380
RICK: You see this?
JIM: Yeah.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.710
RICK: It says Made
in the USA below it.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.380
This was not made in 1888.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.170
What you've seen
and what you can prove

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.920
is two different stories.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.580
I don't care what you say.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.420
I don't care what you tell me.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.710
But I know you're
full of [bleep]..

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460
You know-- it's
all right, Antoine.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.040
I got it.
I got it.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.290
Um, that's just what I see.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.210
We really appreciate
you bringing it in.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.040
But it's not for us.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.540
That's all I can tell you.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.250
[music playing]

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.290
COREY: Earlier today,
I met with a guy

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.040
who wanted to sell me a pistol.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.790
I've never really
seen one of these,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460
so I had to call my buddy Sean
to come down and check it out.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.210
So this is yours?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.290
And what do you know about it?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.250
Well, I got it at a gun show.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.120
And the seller had bought
it from an estate sale.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.620
And it'd been in the
family for generations.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.710
And I was fortunate
enough to get it.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.790
What do you think it's worth?

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.620
If it's authentic
to the period,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.170
anywhere between
1,500 and 2,500.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.670
Unfortunately, just
right off the bat,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.080
I know that this is,
unfortunately, a reproduction.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.290
Um, OK.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.000
So-- so how can you tell?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The markings were punched in
as opposed to hand engraved.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.670
You would have certain markings
on the barrel that were proof

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.830
marks from the Tower of London.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.420
There's just nothing about
this gun that is of the period.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.670
It's value would be
about $75 to $100.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.500
You know, I paid
800 bucks for this.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.960
I'm sorry.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.250
You got burned.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.830
Yeah, so OK, maybe
the thing is a fake.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.790
I-- [bleep].

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.830
My wife was pissed
when I bought this gun.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.210
Now she's really gonna kill me.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.540
[bleep]

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.790
COREY: This guy
brought in the nicest

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.460
looking Gibson I've ever seen.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.540
And it's serial number
one of a high-end series.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.790
You said you wanted 50, man.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.710
I mean, I got to
make money on it.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.710
Yeah, I can understand that.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.540
COREY: Would you go 40?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.880
I really don't want to come
off of that asking price.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.040
COREY: 43.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.170
48?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.670
COREY: 45.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.620
MAN: You got to remember
this is serial number one.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.380
I'm hesitant even to drop to 48.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.000
I-- I really don't want
to move from my price.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.330
[music playing]
- All right.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.290
Deal.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.040
[music playing]

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.170
Chum, you want to
go write him up?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.120
All right.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.750
I just need your ID.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.540
Kind of having some
second thoughts, man.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.000
CHUMLEE: Hey, Corey.
Come here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.920
This guy's having
second thoughts.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.880
COREY: Counting the money, man.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.040
I don't think I
can sell it, man.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
COREY: You sure?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
I don't think so.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.750
COREY: Have you seen
the new $100 bills?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.830
They're beautiful.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.250
COREY: Have ever
seen 100 of 'em.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.330
MAN: Looks great, but,
man, this is my baby.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.040
COREY: You want 50 for it?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.420
I just don't--

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.830
Hey, that's what you
came in here wanting.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.500
I know, man.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.420
I just don't think
I can part with it.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.920
COREY: Well, man,
I can't force you.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.250
But if you change your mind,
I'll be here, all right?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.380
All right.
I'm sorry, man.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.750
Take care.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.460
CHUMLEE: Dude, I'll
have some of that money.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.040
MAN: I got a Pez collection
I'm looking to unload today.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.790
CHUMLEE: Got any candy?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.040
MAN: No.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.290
These have no candy
in them at all.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.040
These are all from
the 1960s, 1970s.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.460
What good are candy
dispensers without candy?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.290
Come on, man.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.460
You work with this guy?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.250
These are very,
very collectible.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.460
And it's a great hobby.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.960
I know it might look
childish to you.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.620
But there's definitely
money into it.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.080
I have Casper the Friendly
Ghost in the original box

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.620
from the 1960s.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.580
This particular Pez here
goes for, like, $300 to $400.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.790
I have the Mickey Mouse
in the original box.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.420
It's a die-cut.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.420
One of my coolest pieces I
like is the original Batman.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.460
Very tough to find.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.750
What do you want for 'em?

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.210
MAN: I'd like to
grab 2,500 for 'em.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.960
Gonna have to grab
it somewhere else.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.830
I'm gonna offer you
a grand, my friend,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.120
just because I
got to resell 'em.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.830
You could put
these on the internet

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.170
individually and definitely
make your money back on these.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.170
Well, man, I'm not looking
to break even at all.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.580
MAN: I understand that.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.830
But these three pieces
alone are a G-note.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.330
- $1,000 is what I can do.
- Fine.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.330
COREY: All right, buddy.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.080
Let me get out of here, man.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.460
I can't believe one of them
guys offered me $1,000 for them

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.790
50 pieces of Pez.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.580
That's an insult to
the Pez community.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.580
I can't believe it.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.620
That's why they're chooches.
