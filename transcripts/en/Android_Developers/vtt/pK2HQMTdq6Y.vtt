TIMOTHY JORDAN: Our
cars guess where

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.440
we're going, while our
phones keep us connected.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.160
The android auto development
course from Udacity,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.192
built in collaboration
with Google,

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:12.900
will show you how
making your android app

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.170
available in the car is as
easy as extending your existing

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.970
coat.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.280
The course focuses on plain
audio and handling messages

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.890
so that your users can stay
connected with their hands

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.190
on the wheel and
eyes on the road.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.910
Take a road trip with us to
learn how to expose content,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.540
control playback, and customize
the UI for playing audio.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.720
As well as how to show
notifications, playback

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.920
messages, and reply by voice.
