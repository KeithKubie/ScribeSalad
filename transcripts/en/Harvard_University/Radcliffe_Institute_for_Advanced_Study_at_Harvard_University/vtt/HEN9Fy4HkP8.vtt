00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.982
[FANFARE PLAYS]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.355
- Good morning, I am Liz Cohen.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.250
I'm dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.680
and I am delighted to welcome
you to Radcliffe Day 2018.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.630
Radcliffe Day is always exciting
and a highlight of the year.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.590
But it is especially
so for me this year.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.110
I will be stepping
down at the end of June

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.300
to return to the
History Department

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.690
after seven wonderful years
as dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.264
Institute.

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:39.805
Recognizing--

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.725
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:01.410
OK.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.350
Thank you very much.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.080
Recognizing inspiring leaders
with a Radcliffe medal

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
has been one of the very
best parts of my job.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.341
Today we honor a remarkable
public servant, Hillary Rodham

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:16.840
Clinton.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.828
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.440
And I am pleased to have
such a fantastic crowd

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.660
joining me to do that.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.040
There are nearly 2,000 of us
here today in two tents, one

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.260
in Radcliffe Yard, the
other across the street

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.380
in Greenleaf Yard, making this
our largest Radcliffe Day ever.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.780
Many others are
watching online, and I'd

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
like to extend a
special welcome to them.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.230
This afternoon
starting at 12:30,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.500
we will celebrate Secretary
Clinton's achievements

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.410
and award her the
Radcliffe Medal.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.400
Former Secretary of State
and 2001 Radcliffe medalist

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.090
Madeleine Albright will
offer a personal tribute.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.300
And Secretary Clinton will
then engage in conversation

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.660
with our own Maura Healey,
a graduate of the Harvard

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.830
Radcliffe Class of 1992.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.080
And for those of you not from
Massachusetts, our attorney

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.090
general.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.870
But first it is our
tradition to kick off

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
Radcliffe Day with a panel
discussion on a topic close

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.520
to our honoree's head and heart.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.890
This morning's
theme in recognition

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.370
of Hillary Clinton's service
as US Secretary of State

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.400
from 2009 to 2013 is
America's role in the world.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.340
What has it been, what is it
now, and what should it be?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.300
We titled our panel Toward
a New Global Architecture

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.260
to recall major policy
speeches that Secretary Clinton

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.910
delivered in 2009 and
2010 at the Council

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.920
on Foreign Relations.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.850
In those speeches, Clinton
enumerated important challenges

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.210
that face the United
States, including conflicts

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.150
in the Middle East,
violent extremism,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.320
nuclear proliferation,
climate change, and disease.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.710
And she called for a
new global architecture

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.440
that would enable
solutions to those issues

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.670
through collective action on
a global scale with the United

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.450
States taking a bold
leadership role.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
These challenges demanded
an architecture in which,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.500
and I quote her, "States
have clear incentives

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.250
to cooperate and live up
to their responsibilities

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.870
as well as strong disincentives
to sit on the sidelines

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.290
or sow discord and
division," end quote.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.300
In constructing this
new architecture,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.880
Clinton argued,
"the United States

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.130
can, must, and will lead in
this new century," end quote.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.620
Resharpening its
tools to undertake

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.800
what she called a smart
power approach that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.860
transcends simplistic
distinctions

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.380
between hard and soft power.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.100
Instead, the US should
implement a nimble statecraft

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.120
that strategically combines
goals like economic development

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.670
with, in her words, "good
old-fashioned diplomacy."

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.840
The challenges Secretary
Clinton grappled

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.090
with almost 10 years ago
are still very much with us.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.500
And many of them feel
only more urgent today.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.630
All of them require
global solutions

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.980
in a world that is more
interconnected than ever

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.210
before.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.640
As a result of our
interdependence,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.570
even challenges that once
seem solidly domestic

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.380
have become increasingly
global in nature.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.630
Diseases don't respect
national borders.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.480
We have seen this in the cases
of H1N1, SARS, MIRS, Zika,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.010
and the 2013 to
2016 Ebola epidemic.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.310
Climate change has been a
global issue since we first

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.240
started talking about it.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.470
We know that we share
a single atmosphere,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.530
but global cooperation
to reduce emissions

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.200
continues to prove challenging.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.230
The threat posed by
non-state violent extremist

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.520
groups such as ISIS, Boko
Haram, the Taliban, al-Qaeda,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.320
and al-shabaab similarly
transcends political frontiers

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.140
and demands global cooperation.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.080
So, too, does the
massive displacement

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.250
of millions of people who
are refugees from conflicts

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.280
in Syria, South Sudan, Somalia,
Afghanistan, and elsewhere.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.420
In the face of these and many
other new and still evolving

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.140
global challenges, it
is imperative to return

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.000
to Secretary Clinton's question
and probe the current state

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.550
of the global
architecture and the role

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.060
the United States is
playing in it hopefully

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.550
as a force for
peaceful stability,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.210
for moral leadership, and
human including women's rights,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.520
for greater
worldwide prosperity,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.390
and for solving
formidable world problems.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.940
In seeking solutions
moreover, we

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.290
must also avoid a growing
danger that Madeleine Albright

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.790
recently warned about, the
rising tide of authoritarianism

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.680
around the world from Russia to
the Philippines to Venezuela.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.380
As Albright wrote
last month, we may

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.920
be encouraged that most
people in most countries

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.770
still want to live
freely and in peace,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.290
but there is no
ignoring the storm

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.540
clouds that have gathered.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.160
And she continued, "If one were
to draft a script chronicling

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.400
fascism's resurrection,
the abdication

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.130
of America's moral
leadership would

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.480
make a credible first
scene," end quote.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.630
Recently, it seems
that the United States

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.440
is lurching from one
crisis to another

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.460
whether it's the war in
Syria, the nuclear standoffs

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.890
with North Korea
and Iran, or the US

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.770
exit from international
agreements like the Paris

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.550
Climate Change Accord
and trade alliances.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.560
The president has called for an
America First foreign policy,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.920
but it bears asking what America
first means in today's world.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.790
Over a century since Woodrow
Wilson used the slogan

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.800
in his 1916 re-election
campaign to assuage fears

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.300
of US involvement in World
War I and so many decades

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.430
since the America
First committee

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.980
promoted its opposition to the
US's entry into World War II.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.920
In today's environment
of global challenges,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.940
massive international
trade, population mobility,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.660
technological transfer,
and high-tech threats,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.170
can United States
really go it alone?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.950
And if and when it does,
what does America First

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.740
convey to the rest of the
world, friends and foes alike.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.970
Our panel this morning provides
an exceptional opportunity

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.659
to step back and begin
to piece together

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.289
the current state of the global
architecture and the role

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.980
that the United States
is assuming within it.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.690
What do recent American actions
and reactions add up to?

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.640
Where are we headed?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.760
What kind of
expertise is needed?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.050
And how should we as
individuals and as a country

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.860
think about America's
role and responsibilities

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.910
in this seemingly ever
more precarious world?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.310
We could have no better guide
to this important discussion

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.930
than Nicholas Burns, who is the
Roy and Barbara Goodman Family

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.090
Professor of the
practice of diplomacy

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.780
and international relations
at the Harvard Kennedy School

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.200
where he also leads the
future of diplomacy project

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.580
and the project on Europe and
the Transatlantic relationship.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.420
Nicks Burns is director of
the Aspen Strategy Group,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.460
and he sits on too many boards
and advisory groups to name.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.310
But before joining
the Kennedy School,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.650
Burns was a member of the US
Foreign Service for 27 years,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.760
including as US
ambassador to Greece,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:50.180
US ambassador to NATO, and from
2005 to 2008 as undersecretary

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.750
of state for Political Affairs
where he led negotiations

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.270
on the US India civil
nuclear agreement,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.630
Iran's nuclear
program, and much more.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.710
I am enormously grateful to Nick
for taking on this assignment

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.270
today and for all the help he
has given me over the past year

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.000
as we plan together for today.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.040
He will introduce our
panelists and then he

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.980
will engage them in
discussion, so please join me

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.290
in warmly welcoming
Nicholas Burns.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:29.906 --> 00:10:31.110
- Liz, thank you.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.900
Good morning, everybody
on this beautiful morning

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.460
in Radcliffe Yard.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.160
We have a lot of people to
thank for this tremendous day.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.330
But there is one woman who
has led this Institute,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.336
and she's walking
right in front of me.

00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:47.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.850
She has led it with strength
and dynamism and passion

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.410
and an unfailing belief that
reason and empirical thought

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.545
and the pursuit of knowledge
represent the highest values

00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:09.980
of Radcliffe Institute and
of Harvard University .

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.860
She has expanded
Radcliffe's public programs.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.670
She has added new
professorships.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.210
If you take a look around
this glorious Radcliffe Yard,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.630
she's brought art
and art installations

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.070
into the heart of the yard.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.840
And she's embraced our president
Drew Faust vision of one

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.100
Harvard may it ever be so.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.470
I think after seven
extraordinary years,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.151
she deserves another
rousing round of applause.

00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:40.073
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.580
It is a privilege for
all of us to be here

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.170
with the most extraordinary,
most accomplished public

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.790
servant that we have had in this
country in a long, long time,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.660
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:19.500
As an attorney from another
law school, as a civic leader,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.810
as an advocate for
children for the poor

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.730
and for women, as First Lady,
as United States senator,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.460
as our secretary
of state, she has

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.930
served with exemplary
determination and intelligence

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.750
and resilience and courage.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.120
And as we begin our
discussion today

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.710
of a very complex subject--

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.100
what is America's relationship
to the rest of the world, what

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.090
is America trying to
achieve in that world--

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.740
we will have Secretary
Clinton's prodigious record

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.530
of accomplishment
to help guide us.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.910
From her first national speech
on a stage 10 miles west

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:03.780
of here at Wellesley
College in 1969

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.680
to her pathbreaking
exhortation in Beijing

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.400
at a seminal conference in
1995 that human rights are

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.807
women's rights and women's
rights are human rights--

00:13:15.807 --> 00:13:18.729
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.170
To her untiring support for
the United States military

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.140
when she was a senator
from the state of New York

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.020
to her four a
challenging consequential

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.900
and often, I'm sure,
exhausting years

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.540
as our 67th secretary
of state, she

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.670
has given with every ounce
of persistence and hope

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.660
and determination, she
showed us how America can

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.920
be great on the world stage.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.940
And I think she may
exemplify better than just

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.260
about anybody I know Theodore
Roosevelt's belief that it's

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.070
not the critic who counts,
that the credit belongs,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.030
in this case, to the woman
who is in the arena, who

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.250
is in the public square, who
is in the middle of the action,

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.710
and, in Roosevelt's words, who
knows the great enthusiasms,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.440
the great devotions, who spends
herself in a worthy cause

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.490
so, as TR said so memorably,
her place shall never

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.530
be with those cold and timid
souls who know neither victory

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.180
nor defeat.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.840
She has been in the
arena for all of us

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.290
for the United States for
her entire adult life.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.170
As secretary of state, she
steered America's response

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.480
to the Arab revolutions.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.730
She stood up to the Chinese in
2010 on the South China Sea.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.260
She stood up to a
truculent Vladimir Putin

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.840
in Eastern Europe.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.400
She ended--

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.270
And read her memoirs and
you'll get the detail on that.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.700
She ended a bitter
and bloody rocket war

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.400
between Israel and Hezbollah.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.620
And she managed
nuclear arms reductions

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.630
to make this a safer world.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.530
She also-- and Anne-Marie will
talk about this I'm sure today

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.780
because Anne-Marie
was a big part of it--

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.330
she pioneered an important
conceptual change

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.435
about how we should
think about diplomacy.

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:21.790
It was her insight that
American diplomacy,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.850
American development,
and American defense

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.860
must all be linked in one
cohesive national strategy.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.020
And in contrast to the
absolutely deplorable lack

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.580
of support for our diplomats
over the last year,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.790
she inspired our diplomats
to represent the United

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.280
States, our young
women, our young men,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.210
all around the world.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.080
So this panel's meeting
at an important moment

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.500
where America's greatness
on the global stage

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.640
is being challenged as never
before, what has made America

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.150
an exceptional nation,
the indispensable nation

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.090
as President Clinton and
Secretary Albright used

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.400
to remind us, what has made us
the undisputed global nation,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.530
a great nation since the Second
World War to 9/11 and the years

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.850
since?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.940
We had to be an
outward looking people.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.340
We had to understand
that we had to be

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.680
part of the global
comments, engage

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.690
with the rest of the
world, not digging

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.000
a moat around the
country and pulling up

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.570
the drawbridge bridges but
actually being in the world

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.580
as a leader.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.430
Our closest friends
and our allies

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.030
lament the fact that we are
very far from that vision now.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.160
And it's important to remember
a little bit of history.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.130
After World War II,
every president--

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.520
until President Trump--
every president, Republican

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.120
and Democrat, believed that
our power and purpose was based

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.000
on enduring foundations,
our alliances

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.180
like NATO, free
trade, a willingness

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.950
to keep America's doors open
to immigration and refugees,

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.230
a willingness to lead in
the defense of human rights

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.349
and of democracy and
of democratic ideals

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.359
when they're
challenged as Madeleine

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:16.240
has written about
in her new book.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.150
But the cruel reality is this.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.770
We are now retreating
in all of those areas.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:29.650
Our government has abandoned the
Paris Climate Change Accords,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.490
abandoned three major
trade agreements,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:40.180
abandoned the Iran nuclear deal,
abandoned our historic position

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.320
on Jerusalem, and may now
be abandoning the pursuit

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.680
of diplomacy in North Korea.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.190
We're no longer leading in
the tradition of Marshall

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.150
and Acheson, of Dulles and
Herter, of James A. Baker,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.610
of Madeleine Albright, of Colin
Powell, of Condoleezza Rice,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.030
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.840
Winston Churchill visited
Harvard and Radcliffe

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.490
in September 1943, and he
addressed the students here

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.100
at this university.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.160
And it was an epochal
time in a terrible war.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.950
It was just after the Allied
victories at Stalingrad and El

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.070
Alamein just after
the commencement

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.140
of the Italian campaign.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.470
The US was taking the
metaphorical baton

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.810
of leadership from Britain as
the world's strongest power.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.790
And at that critical
moment when so much rested

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.030
on our shoulders,
here's what Churchill

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.350
said to the students of
Harvard and Radcliffe.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:50.750
He said, "The price of
greatness is responsibility."

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.660
The price of greatness
responsibility.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.770
To be truly great in our
time, the United States

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.130
needs to lead with
strategic purpose,

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.870
with respect for other
countries and other peoples,

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.720
with dignity, with
dedication to help

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.350
advance justice and democracy
and peace in the world.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.890
And we have strayed so
far from that mission

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.200
under Donald Trump's chaotic,
weak, and fearful leadership

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.260
of our country.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.210
But in her life and
work, Hillary Clinton

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.390
has been all about
responsibility.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.700
We're fortunate to
have the example

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.750
of that responsible leadership
today to help guide us

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.890
and to renew America's
greatness as we move forward.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.870
Such an honor to be here.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.170
And we have four very
distinguished panelists.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.400
Starting at the far end
of the table on my left,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.500
Anne-Marie Slaughter,
former Director of Policy

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.850
Planning at the State Department
for Secretary Clinton,

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.480
a graduate of Harvard Law
School, now president and CEO

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.300
of the New America Foundation.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.770
Meghan O'Sullivan, former
Deputy National Security Adviser

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.120
to President George W. Bush
for Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.360
How's that for a
tough challenge.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.090
Now the Jeane Kirkpatrick
Professor of the Practice

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.670
of international
affairs and my colleague

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.070
at the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.540
David Ignatius,
Washington Post columnist,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.190
foreign policy thought
leader, spy novelist--

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.130
read The Quantum
Spy, his latest--

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.760
a graduate of Harvard College.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.270
And Michele Flournoy,
former undersecretary

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.440
of defense for policy, a
graduate of Harvard College

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.880
back in a reunion year,
now managing director

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.689
of west exec advisors.

00:20:53.689 --> 00:20:54.855
Let's get to our discussion.

00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:55.980
Thank you.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.280
So, Anne-Marie,
we'll lead with you.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.190
We'll have a discussion here
for the next hour or so.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.940
We're going to arrange widely.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.030
We also have a lot of
questions from you.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.370
Liz and her staff
solicited your questions.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.580
I have them here.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.400
I will inject those questions,
Liz, at the right moment.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.060
I thought it was right
to lead with Anne-Marie.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.300
In her position as state
working for Secretary Clinton,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.060
she had to look out
over the whole world

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.220
and think about our
broad national strategy.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.720
I just suggested,
Anne-Marie, that we are--

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.240
that we've fallen
from grace, that we

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.360
don't have a strategic purpose,
that we're not leading,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.000
that we've abandoned
allies and trade

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.700
and immigration and refugees.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.900
Agree?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.795
Disagree?

00:21:47.795 --> 00:21:49.575
[LAUGHS]

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:51.939
- Well, when I was a
law professor here,

00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:53.980
that would have been known
as a leading question.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.980
- Yes.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.340
- But let me just
begin by saying

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.150
how honored I am to be here.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.320
And I have to say when I walked
in with that trumpet fanfare,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.990
I thought I was at
the royal wedding.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.630
But the hats aren't
quite as good.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.330
I also am here as an
example of a glass ceiling

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.360
that Secretary Clinton broke.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.810
I was the first woman Director
of Policy Planning, which

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.855
is the big think job in
the State Department,

00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:22.270
and it was founded when
George Marshall asked

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.310
George Kennan to
take it on, which

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.740
is the legacy none of us
have ever lived up to.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.460
But Secretary Clinton
very deliberately

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.020
wanted to prove to the world--

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.240
I hope she did, I'm not
going to claim that-- but she

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.520
wanted to prove that a
woman could hold that job,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.010
and that's why I'm
sitting here today.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.030
I would go anywhere.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.480
So, Nick, to answer
your question,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.280
we are not leading in the world.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.610
But I want to frame my
answer in the context

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.880
of a message the American
people have been sending us

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.490
and we in this room and
this great university

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.040
and all the great
universities I've been part of

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.220
and Washington
are not listening.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.340
Ever since the end
of the Cold War,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.430
the candidate that
said I don't want

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.860
to continue being
the global hegemon

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.760
and spending our money
that way has won.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.440
In 1992, President
George HW Bush,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.920
the hero of ending the
Cold War, the most literate

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.730
foreign policy president we
had had in a very long time,

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.350
lost to this governor
from the south

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.770
who didn't really talk
about foreign policy a lot

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.520
in his election.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.460
He said, "It's the
economy, stupid."

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.180
And I as a governor
of Arkansas know

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.700
what to do for this country.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.890
In 2000, his vice president,
another southerner,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.890
who was an extraordinary
global diplomat--

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.490
he had led the work with Russia.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.190
He had been all over
the world, and he

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.430
ran against another southern
governor, who basically

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.800
said I don't know
much about the world,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.280
but we need a kinder,
gentler nation.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.500
Guess who won?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.970
In 2004, similar pattern.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.320
2008, John McCain ran.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.210
I am not of John McCain's party,
but I have enormous respect

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.380
for John McCain.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.760
John McCain has stood up for
the best of our traditions.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.660
He stood up against--

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.498
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.340
I will never forget
in the aughts

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.860
when I was here
teaching at the time--

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.920
when suddenly people were
actually talking about torture

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.840
was OK for our country.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.210
It was necessary, and
we're hearing that again.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.670
And John McCain led
that fight, and he

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.060
had been obviously a
participant in the great--

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.130
in great global
events of our time.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.640
But against Barack Obama,
he was the globalist,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.750
and there was a
senator from Illinois

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.930
who talked about bringing
this country together,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.750
who rejected the Iraq war.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.520
Guess who won.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.790
And I don't think I have to
tell you the story of 2016,

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:23.770
but it is the most horrific
example of somebody saying

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.610
it's--

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.690
I don't want this role in
the world and somebody else

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.990
saying we must have
this role in the world,

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.400
and we're not winning.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.370
So I just want to say
a couple of things

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.310
about how it is
time to stopped--

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.390
to stop rejecting
that message or trying

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:48.680
to instruct those who send it on
how they really are misguided.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.600
It's time to listen
to that message.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.790
And in many ways
they're telling us

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.340
something Secretary
Clinton taught me

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.590
because one of the things I
had the privilege of doing

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.560
was working with her on her
first big development speech.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.170
And she said to us--

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.890
she tasked a group of us
to think about what should

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.200
American development policy be.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.860
And she said it
cannot be charity.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.380
I need to tell the
person in Detroit

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.060
why I am spending American
taxpayers' dollars

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.370
in Africa and not in Detroit.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.930
And I must have an account that
makes sense to that person.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:34.610
We need to think about how
we can lead in the world

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.850
and in a different way.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.260
And we-- to start, we have to
recognize that right now, we

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.400
are less the global hegemon
than the global hypocrite.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.300
We are preaching values of
democracy and universal values

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.400
we are not practicing at home.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.610
We are preaching prosperity and
our country is falling apart.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:55.750
I live on Amtrak.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.190
I know of what I speak.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:04.060
But second, we need to make
foreign policy and diplomacy

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.550
the work of many,
many more people

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.000
than those of us on this
panel and in this university

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.320
and in Washington.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.620
LA appointed the
first deputy mayor

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.830
for International
Affairs that person--

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.750
I'm proud to say
she's a woman-- is

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:26.000
former ambassador in the Obama
administration Nina Hachigian,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.240
she's in Los Angeles
doing foreign affairs.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.790
Chicago has 28 sister
city relationships.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.120
If you ever walk from
O'Hare to the Hilton, which

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.070
I've done many,
many, many times,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.170
it's a Hall of United Nations.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.010
28 nations flags
hang in that walkway.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.730
Cities across the country
are playing as important role

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.330
in fighting terrorism
in climate change.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.850
President Trump pulled
out, but the cities

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.730
of the United States, led by
Mayor Bloomberg, stood up.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.770
And we are going to
meet our commitments

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.310
through those city's efforts
and the efforts of universities,

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.320
businesses, nonprofit leaders,
faith leaders, all of us.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.660
So what I would say to come
back to Nick's questions--

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.940
just a slight digression--

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.720
we have to first of
all listen to Americans

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.220
who are saying when we were
under mortal threat in the Cold

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.990
War fighting the Soviet
Union nuclear weapon

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.970
to nuclear weapon--

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.700
and let us hope that day
doesn't come fully again.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.320
We're back to
fighting Russia but

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.180
in a different configuration.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.970
In those days, we
would bear any price--

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.100
pay any price and
bear any burden,

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.360
but today we need to pay more
attention to what is happening

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.070
in the United States.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.300
So we need to learn how to
lead because I deeply believe--

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.330
to paraphrase
Secretary Albright--

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.510
we are an indispensable nation.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.520
We are not the only
one, but we are

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.410
a nation that needs to
be at the global table.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.460
And when we are, the
world is a better place.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.960
But to get there, we have
to listen to Americans.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.110
We have to learn how to
lead in a different way

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:15.030
and to not only have the great
diplomats like Nick Burns

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.600
but to have all those people who
are not in the Foreign Service

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.570
but who are representing
America in the world

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.810
be a part of who we are and
what we do in the world.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:26.310
Thank you.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:38.490
- Meghan, another way
to ask this question--

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.150
I wanted you to speak to this
as well as you are a Republican.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.730
There's been a consensus
since the late 40s

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.820
among Republicans and Democrats
in foreign and defense policy

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.800
the way we haven't had
in domestic policy.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.020
It's all those things
that Anne-Marie and I

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.350
have talked about that Madeline
has written in her new book.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.300
What's happened to
that consensus, and--

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.090
can I just-- and to your party?

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.430
And is your party
divided on that?

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.070
- Great.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.240
Thanks for the softball.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.760
[LAUGHS]

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.750
Good morning, everyone.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.670
And like others,
I'd like to begin

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.370
by saying what an honor
it is to be here today

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.410
for such a great
day for Radcliffe

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.900
and for such a
wonderful occasion

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.790
to honor Secretary Clinton.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.440
Unlike many others
on this stage,

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.130
I have not had the opportunity
to work for Secretary Clinton,

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.790
but I have benefited from
her career as a citizen most

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.640
importantly and all the good
that she's done but also

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.820
as a woman because she has
fought many fights that I

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.830
will not have to fight
because she did that.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.167
So I want to thank you.

00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:40.089
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.570
And I hope that I can
answer your question, Nick,

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.880
and inject a little
bit of optimism

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.090
simply because there is the
risk that we're going to depress

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.430
ourselves on this topic.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.030
To state what
others have stated--

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.180
but I think it's very
important to note--

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.260
is that over the last 70 years,
the world has really prospered.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.490
This has been a period of
unprecedented prosperity

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.620
and peace on large
account because

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.960
of the web of
institutions and norms

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.560
that have underpinned a lot of
what has gone on in the world,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.680
and the US has just been
the most critical actor,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.060
not only in constructing that
web of institutions and norms

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.590
but in defending it.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.170
And I think any
president at this moment

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.040
would have a challenge with this
order, with rejuvenating it,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.300
with bringing it
up to the moment.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.210
The world is very different
than it was 70 years ago,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.970
and I think any
president would have

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.020
the challenge of modernizing
this international order as we

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.260
call it and dealing
with new challenges

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.550
to that order be it China, be
it global disease, whatever

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.930
the case may be.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.390
Unfortunately, we're not
having that conversation, which

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.580
would be much wonkier
but much more welcome

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.370
and that would be how to reform
this international order.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.810
We're having a
conversation about

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.730
are we still invested in it.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.540
And as others have
suggested, we really--

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.100
despite Anne-Marie's laying out
the electoral map over the last

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.210
couple of decades--

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.910
we have the first
president in office

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.220
who has questioned
openly whether it

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.320
is in America's
interest to continue

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.930
to be the defender of this
particular role in the world.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.210
So others maybe
didn't campaign on it,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.110
but once that person came
into the Oval Office,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.240
the imperative of American
leadership, I think,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.290
has always been clear.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.230
So we are at a unique
moment with a president who

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.350
does question whether
this as good for America.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.750
And this is concerning
because it takes leadership,

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.620
particularly in a moment where
there are lots of anxieties

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.060
about globalization.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.730
It takes leadership not
only from the Oval Office

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.340
but I would say most
importantly from the Oval Office

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.370
to build and
maintain a consensus

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.100
within our own country about
the importance of America

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.870
playing this role
and to make sure

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.100
that consensus is not based
just on people on the stage

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.740
or people in this tent
but that it is one that

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.010
embraces elites and non-elites.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.250
It embraces, as Anne-Maria
said, all parts of our country.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.750
To get to your
question specifically

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.480
about the Republican
Party, and here's

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.960
where I'm injecting
optimism, I would

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.360
say it is still
important to distinguish

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.780
between the president
and the Republican Party.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.510
Many Republicans-- and I would
consider myself one of them--

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.170
don't really see
him as a Republican.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.660
And he has departed
from very traditional

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.330
core Republican
values and policies

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.610
in very, very fundamental ways.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.470
Now I think this is
a little disguised

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.740
by the tax cuts because you have
seen the Republican leadership

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.010
and really rallied behind
the president in this regard.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.080
But if we look at the menu
of policies and attitudes

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.360
and orientations,
I still think there

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.780
is a pretty significant
gap between the president

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.190
and the bulk of
the party when it

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.316
comes to international affairs.

00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:01.690
I could go through
the long list,

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.189
but in the interest
of time I won't.

00:34:03.189 --> 00:34:05.990
I'll simply say, take
trade for instance.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.270
The president's been
very vocal about trade.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.810
This is one of the things
that has been very consistent,

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.949
one of the few things that
has been very consistent

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:15.090
in his policy agenda.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.290
He is not someone who extols
the value of free trade.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.949
He openly embraced protectionism
in his inaugural speech.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.130
But I think there's still
a very strong support

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.260
for free trade
among Republicans,

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.760
among American business.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.120
And I would say, if
you look at polls,

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.150
most Americans still are
more in favor of free trade

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.750
than they are against it.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.630
And so I think there is
still a lot to work with.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.420
And that's true for
alliances as well.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.517
Americans like alliances,
Democrat, Republican.

00:34:47.517 --> 00:34:49.100
And just because the
president doesn't

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.980
seem to value them as much
as many of us would like

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.659
doesn't mean that we no longer
have a national foundation

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:57.930
for these things.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.100
So again I won't go through the
whole list of areas in which I

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.100
think we still have
a strong foundation

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.500
and a strong national
interest, but I

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.220
do think we are at a moment of
a crisis of leadership, which

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.100
is why it's such a
wonderful day to honor

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.360
some national
leadership in this tent.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.510
- Meghan, thank you.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.700
Just to support
something that Meghan

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.640
said about Republican
leadership in Congress,

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.990
it was Ed Royce, Bob
Corker, Lindsey Graham,

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.740
who stood up to President
Trump on funding

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.200
for the State Department, for
instance, over the last year.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.790
Republicans restored
the funding,

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:40.450
so I think there is this
dynamic on the Hill.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.630
A lot of questions here
from the audience, Michele,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.075
about our challenges
with Vladimir Putin.

00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:48.190
And you've been a
leading defense official

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.680
for our country for a long time.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.450
He invaded Georgia in 2008.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.870
He invaded, occupied, and
annexed Crimea in 2014.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.600
8,000 Russian troops
in eastern Ukraine

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.920
pressuring the Baltic states.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.010
Are we back to containment?

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.330
We're rebuilding American
armored presence in Eastern

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.060
Europe, and what would
you advise President Trump

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.980
to do about Putin,
Eastern Europe,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.435
the defense of democracy?

00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:13.240
- Well, let me just
say it's a pleasure

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.530
to be back at Radcliffe where
I have many fond memories.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.750
I was saying particularly rowing
for under Radcliffe colors

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:21.966
on the Charles River.

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:24.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:30.190
And such an honor to be a part
of a panel honoring Secretary

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.820
Clinton.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.090
I had the great good
fortune of being trapped

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.120
in a windowless room with
her for many, many hours,

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.390
The Situation Room, and
just such a privilege

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:44.770
to watch such an extraordinary
public servant guide

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:49.660
US foreign policy to be smart
and strategic and in the best

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.900
interests of America
and Americans,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.170
so thank you for being here
and thank you for letting

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.130
me to be part of this.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.560
So Vladimir Putin and Russia.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.980
I think it's important
to understand

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.800
where Putin is coming from.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.840
Putin represents a deep
sense of grievance in Russia,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.210
that Russia since the
end of the Cold War

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.390
has lost its
geopolitical position,

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:19.210
has presided over a
declining economy,

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.060
has had a failed
experiment in democracy,

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.710
has really become a
middling power as opposed

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.580
to a great power.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.530
And so Putin is
determined to reassert

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:37.360
Russia as a great power using
just about any means necessary.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.680
He is determined to recreate
a sphere of influence

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.840
around Russia's borders.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.600
And most importantly
for us, he is also

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.620
determined to undermine
democracy as a model,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.690
be it in Central
and Eastern Europe

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.330
or here in the United
States, because the biggest

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.920
threat to Vladimir Putin is the
potential for true democracy

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.340
to re-emerge in Russia.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.130
Despite the relative
economic weakness

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.490
of Russia compared to its
European counterparts,

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:13.780
Putin has actually played
a limited hand very well.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.500
He is reverted to
the KGB playbook

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.950
and used a whole range
of asymmetric means

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.340
to try to advance Russian
interests and influence--

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.230
intelligence operations,
propaganda, disinformation,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.320
cyber attacks, little
green men, meaning

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.360
paid Russian proxies,
and so forth.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.550
And we've seen this in
Crimea, in Ukraine, previously

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.150
in Georgia.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.890
We've seen it in
the meddling that

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.180
preceded the meddling
in our elections

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.830
the meddling in Eastern and
Central European elections

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.160
and so forth.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.570
So I think-- to
answer your question--

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.830
I think unfortunately despite
some very serious work

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.250
at resetting the relationship
with by investing in areas

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.500
where we had common
interests like arms

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.500
control, nonproliferation,
counter-terrorism, climate

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.100
change, and so many
others, Putin has really

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.380
taken a very sharp turn.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.770
And now Russia is
presenting real challenges

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.550
to the United States, if not in
some cases, an actual threat.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.870
So what do we do.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.560
I think the most important
step we need to take

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:28.250
is to reestablish a very
clear policy of deterrence.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.030
We need to clarify
where the lines are

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.450
with Putin with regard
to us and with regard

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.370
to our European allies.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:41.620
First and foremost, we
have to deter meddling

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.020
in the next round
of elections being--

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.710
this fall in 2018 where there's
already evidence of preparation

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.250
of that and certainly in 2020.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.240
One of the challenges of
President Trump's denial

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.960
of this issue is for
his own personal reasons

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.910
and his own concerns about
the legitimacy of his election

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.740
is that the United
States does not

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.580
have a strategy for preventing
this from happening again.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.260
This is the biggest threat
to our democracy that exists.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.330
We cannot go through an election
where Russian meddling actually

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.046
calls into question the
results of the vote tallies.

00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:24.670
Although they didn't
do that last time,

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.440
we know that they surveyed at
least 30 to 35 of our state

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.500
electoral systems to know how
to do it if they needed to.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.620
We need to prevent that.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.680
It means investing
in the resilience

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.260
of our electoral systems at
the state and local level.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.820
Fortunately,
Congress has finally

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.500
allocated some funds
for that, but we

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.380
need to really engage the
best of the private sector

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.690
to help state and local
electoral officials improve

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.100
the strength of their system.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.040
But we also need to clearly
communicate to Putin

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.130
that there will be no
kidding costs if he

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.330
crosses that line again.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.560
We also need to clarify
deterrents in Europe.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.580
It is completely unfathomable
and unacceptable that a United

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.910
States president would go
to his first NATO summit

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.120
and refuse to re-articulate
America's security

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.610
commitment to NATO.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.710
This is the alliance
that invoked

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.930
Article V for the first
time in our history

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:27.820
because we were under
attack on 9/11 by al-Qaeda.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.670
How is it possible that an
American president would

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.450
hesitate to make a commitment
to the most important set

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.150
of allies we have in the
world and a huge source

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.160
of strategic advantage
for the United States.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.070
So we need to clarify
in word and in deed

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.730
that we are there to
support deterrence

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.570
and reassurance in Europe.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.540
We also need to
make sure that we

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.410
continue to support democracy
programs and resilience

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.100
programs.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.760
There's real threat to democracy
in Central and Eastern Europe.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.240
We need to do better at
countering Russian propaganda

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.250
and information operations
in Europe and here.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.800
And lastly, we need to invest
to ensure that we maintain

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.530
the military edge
that we will need

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.860
in certain critical areas like
cyber and electronic warfare

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.610
and precision strike to again
underwrite deterrence and make

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.230
sure that Vladimir Putin does
not miscalculate and think

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:29.050
that he can cross the border
into Europe or cross a border

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.800
and threaten us militarily.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.840
So let me stop there.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.960
- Michele, a quick
follow up before we--

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:40.292 --> 00:42:43.990
Before we talk about the
Middle East and North Korea,

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.850
two perilous subjects.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.660
Last week, really one of the
only bipartisan committees

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.790
these days in Congress,
the Senate Select Committee

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.040
on Intelligence,
led by a Republican,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.160
Richard Burr of North Carolina,
and a Democrat, the vice chair,

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.880
Mark Warner of Virginia, issued
a report after more than a year

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.320
of study and
hearings saying they

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.020
had no doubt the Russians
interfered in the elections,

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.130
no doubt they interfered on
behalf of candidate Trump.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.440
Are we ready for 2018?

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.380
You talked about--
are we ready for 2020?

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.430
Is it up to the
attorney generals

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.460
have our states to try to
fashion these defense policies?

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.560
Are we going to get
leadership from Washington?

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.310
- We are not ready,
particularly for 2018.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.940
I think that there will
be some candidates who

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.450
take the steps necessary to
make sure their own cyber

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.870
security is up to speed,
but my biggest worry

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.810
is again our electoral
infrastructure

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.970
is operated at the
state and local level it

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:45.200
is as diverse and differentiate
as you could possibly imagine.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.990
There's been no
leadership on the part

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.370
of the federal government.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.030
Until now, there's been very
little money available to help.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.430
I've been part of an
effort to mobilize the tech

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.010
community to-- on
a pro bono basis

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.240
to go out and offer
advice, services, counsel,

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.590
help to any candidate,
any state election

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.609
official, any local election
official who wants to build

00:44:09.609 --> 00:44:10.900
the resilience of their system.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.390
The most important
thing we need to do

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.660
is to have an audit trail
no matter what happens.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.250
Whether we go back
to a paper audit

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.951
trail or an encrypted
electronic audit trail,

00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:27.130
we must ensure that when we
have an election in 2020,

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.630
we actually know with
confidence who won.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.050
And we need to also
communicate to Vladimir Putin

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.900
that we will be coming after
the things that he care-- he

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.150
and his oligarchs
care about most

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.220
if he crosses that line again.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.360
- Thank you very much.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.354
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:48.524 --> 00:44:50.440
So now we're going to
take on the Middle East.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.420
At Harvard, we have
courses where we

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.190
do this over 3 and 1/2 months.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.580
We're going to do this
and ask Meg and David, who

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.254
both know a lot after decades of
experience in the Middle East.

00:45:01.254 --> 00:45:03.170
And here's the question
I pose to both of you.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.003
I think, Meghan, are
going to take the lead,

00:45:05.003 --> 00:45:07.360
and David will speak second.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.080
We've just come out of a
very bloody war in Iraq.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.690
We're back in the fight against
the Islamic State, which

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.190
is ending.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.540
We're in Syria.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.230
Iran's a regional troublemaker.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.770
We're out of the
Iran nuclear deal.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.590
The question is, is there
an overarching strategy

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.440
that our government should have
to deal with this because we've

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.359
been the most important
outside power since the 1970s

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:31.150
in the Middle East?

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.999
I keep asking you the most
challenging questions,

00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:35.290
but I know you can answer them.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.896
- Well, there's plenty
to go around I think.

00:45:38.896 --> 00:45:40.524
Let me say there--

00:45:40.524 --> 00:45:42.940
it's interesting-- your question
is interesting because it

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.890
implies really two things.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:49.510
One, does the US still have an
interest in being in the Middle

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.740
East in the way that it has
been for the previous decades,

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.450
and, two, are we
capable of devising

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:58.000
a strategy that meets
the enormous challenges

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.110
of that part of the world.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.900
So let me take him both quickly
and turn first this question

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.290
of is it really in the US
interest for us to be there.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.420
And I get this question a lot.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.400
I'm sure many of you do.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.320
And I understand that
people are hoping

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.890
you'll say no, it's no longer
in our interest to be there.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.370
One, there's the
fatigue that has

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.760
gone on as a result of
the engagements in Iraq

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.380
and elsewhere.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.510
But also there's this
new idea that we're

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.760
more self-sufficient in
energy, and therefore we

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.320
don't need to be
in the Middle East

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.090
because we don't
need their energy.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.030
And that is a big change
in the relationship.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:34.000
And I hate to throw cold
water on these ideas,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.330
but, in fact, it still is
very much in the US interests

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.700
to be engaged in the
Middle East and to be

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.060
invested in a better outcome
for that part of the world.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.350
There are energy reasons
why that still is true

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.950
regardless of how much
oil the US produces,

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.450
which I could go into, but I'll
save that for another time.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.380
But there's also a broad
range of non-energy interests

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.330
that are going to keep us there.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.290
And there's also a need to throw
cold water on a related idea,

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.270
and that is maybe
the Middle East

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.390
would be better off without
American engagement.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.720
We certainly have
demonstrated that we

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.930
are capable of making many
serious mistakes in that part

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.300
of the world, and wouldn't
that region be better

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.370
without the United States.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.810
I can say pretty definitively
when we look at Syria today,

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:27.100
despite the great advice of
Secretary Clinton and others,

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.550
that is with the Middle East
looks like without a lot of US

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.310
engagement.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.014
It is not obviously
a better place

00:47:34.014 --> 00:47:36.430
either from the perspective
of people living in the Middle

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.210
East or for US interests.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.320
You think about
how destabilizing

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.830
that conflict has been to our
European allies, the risks

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.870
that it has posed to
the United States.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.570
So I very squarely
put myself in the camp

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.300
of people who believe it is
still very much in America's

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.710
interests regardless of how
difficult it is to stay engaged

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.100
in that part of the world.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.310
The question about
strategy is harder.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.670
And I know David will go into
this in even greater detail.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.300
But let me just
say, of course, this

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.500
is a very, very heterogeneous
part of the world

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.150
despite maybe some
of the stereotypes.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.940
It's a very varied
part of the world.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.000
So we're not going to
have one strategy that

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.770
actually addresses
all of the challenges

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.540
in that part of the world.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.810
But we do need two things,
which are currently

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.080
in very short supply, if we are
going to be better positioned

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.230
to respond to the challenges
in that part of the world

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.430
and to meet them.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.830
And those two things
are first, I would say,

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.540
is a much greater appreciation
for how interconnected

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.800
the challenges are there.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.160
So they're not the same,
but they're very related.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.990
So take, for
example, the decision

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.210
to withdraw from the
Iran nuclear deal.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.810
Now, this decision,
whatever you think of it,

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.590
it makes our challenges in
other parts of the region,

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.060
not just in Iran but in
other parts of the region,

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.500
much, much harder because
Iran is all over the region.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.090
So if we give a reason for Iran
to oppose American interests,

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.210
not just on this narrow
but very significant

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.850
question of Iran's
nuclear ambitions,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.480
this gives Iran the
incentive to challenge us

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.730
more in Iraq, in Syria, in
Yemen, vis a vis Saudi Arabia.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:26.200
Really this creates more
obstacles to success.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.030
So again, we need a
greater appreciation

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.580
for how these things
are all interrelated,

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.730
and that the assessments that
happen in this windowless room

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.500
really need to reflect that.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.430
And secondly in a category of
potentially unpopular things

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.511
I will say today, I think
Americans need to get over--

00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:45.010
and I know this is
impossible, which

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.042
is why I'm not a politician--

00:49:47.042 --> 00:49:50.830
their aversion to-- call
it whatever we want--

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.860
but helping other countries
build institutions.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.910
What has happened in the Middle
East in the last 10 years

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.670
is really the collapse
of the Arab state.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.940
And to the extent that
there is such a thing

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.710
as a solution for that
part of the world,

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:11.110
it will be the rebuilding
of states in the Arab world.

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.750
Now, this is not to say
America should be rebuilding

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.680
these states, but America
has a real interest

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.226
and these states are rebuilt
in a way that reflects

00:50:21.226 --> 00:50:22.600
the interest both
of their people

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.460
and of stability in the region.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.840
And America has know how and
resources and a diplomatic heft

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.490
that's very important in the
rebuilding of these countries.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.380
So again the aversion
to getting involved

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.645
in things that are difficult,
that require resources,

00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:40.990
and that take a long
time, we will have

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.830
to tackle that head on if we are
going to be able to help a very

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.320
critical part of the world
have a better future,

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.095
which is essential to
our own future as well.

00:50:50.095 --> 00:50:51.626
- Thank you, Meghan.

00:50:51.626 --> 00:50:54.422
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:57.610
Meghan has written
a great new book

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.160
called A Windfall, which
looks at transformations

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.970
in the energy
industry worldwide,

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.310
which we highly recommend.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.950
- I was going to complain that
you gave David's spy novel--

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:06.670
- I'm just trying to be--

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:08.128
I'm trying to be
fair and balanced.

00:51:08.128 --> 00:51:10.480
Fair and balanced.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.947
David, it's so great
to have you here.

00:51:12.947 --> 00:51:15.530
I think all of us recognize your
deep experience in the Middle

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.030
East.

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:18.730
You were a foreign correspondent
there several decades ago.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.550
You go back.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:20.710
You've been in Syria.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.100
You've been tracking this
unbelievable human tragedy

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.250
of the 12 million homeless,
the fractured state.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.000
How do you make sense of this.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.001
If you were to advise President
Trump, what should he be doing?

00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:36.720
- Thank you, Nick, and the first
thing to say is that Syria--

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.230
but so much of the Middle East--

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.670
it's a tragedy.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.350
We watch it.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.100
We feel a sense of horror for
what's happened to people.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.950
We struggle to think of
how we can affect that,

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.090
reduce the human cost, and we
have failed again and again.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.950
And it's painful
and poignant so,

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.290
that's the first starting point.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:00.760
In covering Secretary Clinton
when she was Secretary of State

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.810
and her Middle East views,
I was struck by two things

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.180
that I want to mention.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:12.220
First, I think she was always
ready to use American power

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.430
to try to maintain the
conditions of security

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.250
and stability that
that region needs.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.460
She understood that however
tired the United States

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.770
might be of its
involvement there,

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.960
the consequence
of our withdrawal

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.990
would be only
greater loss of life.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.240
And that's what we've seen.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:36.070
She also, as I remember,
was cautious about what

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.970
she wanted us to do.

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:42.910
She-- when the
Arab Spring swept,

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:47.110
the Arab world moved
from Tunisia and Egypt.

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:50.910
Secretary Clinton was within
the Obama administration

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:54.290
a voice for let's be careful.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:57.520
Let's see if we can get an
orderly transition in Egypt

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.760
away from Hosni Mubarak,
then the president,

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.090
maybe let's take yes
for an answer when

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:08.710
he said on February 1, 2011,
that he was prepared to resign.

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:12.670
As I read that record, I
think Secretary Clinton

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:14.230
and her caution--

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.930
let's not go over
the waterfall here,

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:20.280
let's not throw this
up for revolution--

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.490
I think it looks very sensible.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:27.460
A second thing that
sticks in my mind

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.830
is Secretary Clinton's
views about Syria

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:33.820
as this great tragedy
began to roll forward

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.520
as this country
began to come apart.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.480
In 2012 as a columnist, I
was struggling to figure out

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.460
what do I think about this?

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.710
What's the right
thing to recommend?

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:46.600
I honestly didn't know.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.400
So I did what journalists do.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.100
I decided to do the
reporting, and I

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.180
snuck across the
Turkish border, was

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:58.390
smuggled by the Free Syrian
Army, as it was called,

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.190
and traveled to Aleppo.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:03.890
It was the craziest thing I've
ever done as a journalist.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:07.540
My wife still hasn't
really forgiven me for it.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.900
But when I got out,
it was obvious to me

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.840
that the policies--
it was not then known

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.030
that Secretary Clinton
was advocating them

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:21.160
in secret in the situation
room-- but those policies

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.820
were correct.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.850
What I wrote and what
she was arguing inside

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.820
was first Bashar al-assad
will never govern all of Syria

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:28.320
again.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.720
It's not going to happen.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.510
He's gone to war
with his own people.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.910
Second, the Free Syrian
Army, these peoples

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:37.180
trying to create a
new country need help.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.460
They're a mess and they
need the kind of help

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.580
that the US military
special forces can provide.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.880
And three if we don't
do that, the extremists

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.450
who I already saw all over
Aleppo in northern Syria

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.980
will only get stronger.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.940
And, of course, that was before
there was anything called ISIS.

00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:00.310
And ISIS came and we were then
plunged into a much darker war,

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.620
but I think Secretary
Clinton got that right.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.270
She argued it in
the administration.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.660
I will believe
till my last breath

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.700
that this awful story
might have been different

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.620
if her advice had been followed.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.690
Let me conclude just by offering
a brief snapshot of where

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.660
we are now in a
part of this policy.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.170
Syria as a whole is in
catastrophic state failure.

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:27.010
But in the east of Syria--
east of the Euphrates

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:31.810
where our special forces have
delivered almost completely

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:34.180
on their commitment
to destroy ISIS,

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:38.530
you do see conditions
of stability.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:42.700
The United States found a
way to deploy military power

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.140
with very few people.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.500
It's basically been 2000
special forces in Syria,

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.220
motivated allies who want to
do the fighting themselves,

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:56.140
a small footprint an
extraordinary success.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.890
East of the Euphrates, I've
traveled there three times

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:03.220
in the last two years, you see
people fleeing toward America

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.910
and its allies for security.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:11.500
I'll close with just a deeply
disturbing image of what

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.820
we have done probably
without an alternative,

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.900
but we don't want to do again.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.020
Traveling through Raqqa,
which was the capital

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.530
of the Islamic State, you see--

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.740
I was there two months ago--
you see a level of destruction

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.370
I have never seen
covering wars, conflicts

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:31.750
for more than 30 years.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.390
It looks like the
pictures we remember

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.540
of the battle of Berlin at
the end of World War II.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.860
It's a nightmare.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.650
It tells you two things.

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:45.190
If you really mess with the
United States to the point

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.430
that we say we're going
to make a commitment

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.720
to degrade and destroy
your movement, we mean it.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.170
And we have the ability
to bring to bear

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.510
a level of military
power that people just

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.070
have to take seriously.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:03.610
And second, we don't
want to do that again.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.930
And what I've come to think is
once a determined adversary is

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.770
in an urban area like
Raqqa, like these cities,

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:16.000
there really is no good
humane way to get them out.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.424
So we have to with our
allies prevent that

00:57:18.424 --> 00:57:19.840
from happening in
the first place,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.590
but I think on these
questions, Secretary Clinton

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.010
came as close to getting
it right as anybody

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.928
I know at the top of government.

00:57:28.928 --> 00:57:31.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:33.768 --> 00:57:37.670
- Nick, if you'll just allow
me to make a very quick two

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.300
finger about this, I think
your point about Raqqa

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.760
and the devastation not only in
Syria but also in northern Iraq

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.220
is just incredible.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.449
And your point
saying that America

00:57:49.449 --> 00:57:50.990
has made the point
to the world if we

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.840
say we're going to destroy your
movement, this is what happens,

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.610
I think an even
stronger point would

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:59.960
be to be able to point to
those parts of the world

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:05.240
and say but we can help you
rebuild because that is where I

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.956
think the future of this
conflict in Syria and in Iraq

00:58:09.956 --> 00:58:10.580
is going to go.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.700
If those places are not
rebuilt in some fashion,

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.526
then we're going to
see this movie again.

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:18.650
Again, that doesn't mean
America going in and doing

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:20.810
all of the rebuilding
but marshaling

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:24.242
a lot of the diplomatic effort,
the economic resources I think

00:58:24.242 --> 00:58:25.700
is going to be
absolutely critical.

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.390
- Anne-Marie.

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:30.080
- Just quickly, I
want again to tie

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.140
this back to domestic politics.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.610
And again my thesis
is it is so important

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:36.680
to have these conversations,
but if we're not

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.110
thinking about domestic
policy politics,

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.630
we will continue having
these conversations

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:44.967
where we are lamenting
what is happening

00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:46.925
and we're not connected
to the American people.

00:58:46.925 --> 00:58:50.360
So just on Meghan's point
about state building,

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.290
and it goes to David's
point equally about the kind

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:58.490
of destruction and what
Secretary Clinton I think saw

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.370
was that we must focus
on the people as well

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:05.420
as the chessboard of politics.

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.640
But to Meghan's point
about who wants us out

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.180
of state building, who wants
us out of the Middle East,

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.610
it's not just the
people you might expect.

00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:16.770
It is at least in
my organization,

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:21.170
which is 46% under 30
and extremely diverse,

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.740
it is the young people of color,
who in part inherit a sort

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.490
of post-colonial view that
America in these places has

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.490
done nothing but
bad but who also--

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:33.800
they look at the
Middle East and they

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:38.720
see an analogy between American
power oppressing people there

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.240
and American power
oppressing people here.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.790
And so to really build the
kind of consensus we want--

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.810
and I totally agree with you--

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.660
we have to change the
way we talk about it

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.860
and think about it.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.670
We need to explain why
actually in the first place

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.640
we are just enabling
the people of the region

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.070
to rebuild their own countries.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.680
We are not rebuilding anything.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.860
And you said this.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.330
But we have to do
it in a way that

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.720
brings us very, very different
group of Americans along.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.187
- Thank you very much.

01:00:10.187 --> 01:00:13.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.750
Thank you.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:20.280
We could go on for days, months,
years on the Middle East.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.846
I want to ask a
question on North Korea,

01:00:22.846 --> 01:00:24.720
then we're going to
leave you with some hope.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.178
I'm going to ask
the panel what are

01:00:26.178 --> 01:00:29.820
you strategically hopeful about
because we don't want to have--

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.120
depress this entire audience.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.700
David, until yesterday
morning at 10:00 AM--

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.310
and I've been an opponent
of Donald Trump--

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:44.220
I thought he's done
OK on North Korea.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.450
He turned away from war towards
diplomacy, the big summit

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:53.340
June 12, coins minted,
but seriously he

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.660
was going to meet him.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.510
Mike Pompeo twice to
Pyongyang first ever

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.270
meetings of an American diplomat
with Kim Jong Un, first ever

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.080
meetings.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.670
I thought good for Donald Trump.

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:04.260
We should support him in this.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.820
Then it was this letter,
the most unique breakup

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.320
letter of all time--

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.950
diplomatic breakup
letter-- and are we in?

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:14.520
Are we out?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.100
Is this just part
of the diplomacy?

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.100
Is this a tactical move?

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.980
Are we going back
to the use of force?

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.745
Where are we on North Korea?

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:24.090
- The extraordinary
truth is we don't know.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:33.000
Covering foreign policy these
last 18 months, whatever it is,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.220
I sometimes liken to vertigo.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.380
You just literally--
it's like falling

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.320
through space, something
I never remember feeling

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.990
covering Secretary Clinton.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.660
The breakup letter
was a classic,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:51.090
I mean a classic of
passive aggressive wounded

01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:53.910
you said such hurtful
things about me.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.170
I just can't see you anymore.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:02:00.540
But maybe we could
get together again.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.640
It's-- just try
reading it as a letter,

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.355
like letters that people send.

01:02:08.355 --> 01:02:13.260
I think as I stand back and
look at this, the message

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.850
that I take is that it
probably isn't a bad thing

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.910
that this summit is postponed.

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.880
I hope it's not gone
forever and that we're not

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.280
back to fire and fury.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.450
But I think we were heading
toward a summit that in a sense

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.060
that was burdened
by over-expectation.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.660
The president wanted a
favorable outcome too much

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.570
but had planned
for it too little.

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:41.910
The two sides
couldn't really begin

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.910
to write the communique
because on the question

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:48.510
of denuclearization, they
had fundamentally different

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.350
definitions of what that meant.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.690
And so I think it's not a
terrible thing that people

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:56.260
take a little more time.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.320
I know with great
interest that after

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:04.230
this amazing coy flattering,
threatening letter

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:07.410
from Donald Trump that the North
Koreans responded this morning

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:12.000
their time with a very
measured highroads statement

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.530
praising Donald Trump, talking
about the Trump process.

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.590
It's been incredibly
important to work with him.

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:24.240
They've really got the
counter-messaging down.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.250
So who can say
where this is going.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.960
But I think a little
more time is appropriate.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.610
I hope the lesson
for this president

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:40.020
is that while there are values
to the disruptive style what

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:46.350
he adopts, suddenly
rearranging chairs,

01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:49.590
does create space sometimes,
and we need to be honest.

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.840
We can see some of
that with North Korea.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.000
But the disruptive
approach carried

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.660
to this extreme
where literally you

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.850
don't know from one news cycle
to the next which way are we're

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:02.350
going.

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.900
Are we go for the Libyan model?

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.710
Are we against it?

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.080
Are we for it
again, it literally

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.300
has been like that
over the last week.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300
But in the end, that's
counterproductive.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.460
One thing again--

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.940
I come back to
Secretary Clinton--

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.940
I watched with great
interest the way

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.680
she sometimes used secret
diplomacy in particular

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.720
in setting the--

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.216
setting sail on our
initiative with Iran

01:04:29.216 --> 01:04:30.840
that led to the Iran
nuclear agreement.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.440
But she sent her most
private emissaries to Oman

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.336
to begin meetings.

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:36.210
Nobody knew about it.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:40.080
As a journalist, I'm supposed
to say that's a terrible thing.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.130
And I always want more
information than less,

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:47.610
but I do think Secretary Clinton
understood that sometimes doing

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.910
it carefully-- doing it
quietly, not disruptively,

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:54.330
is the way to get the results
that the country wants.

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:57.290
So I hope we're back on
that track with North Korea.

01:04:57.290 --> 01:05:01.680
I must say I'm impressed by
Secretary Pompeo's management

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.200
of the quiet side of this.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.070
He obviously has the
president's confidence.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.120
If you were going to
make a positive bet,

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.250
you'd say that Pompeo
will think strategically

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:16.160
and will end up a little more
time back in this conversation.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.630
- And that's a relatively
hopeful thing to say.

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.925
Michele, do you share that,
and when the president

01:05:20.925 --> 01:05:22.800
turned towards diplomacy,
I think a lot of us

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.840
breathed a sigh of relief
because the military options

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.890
you were undersecretary
of defense for policy.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.870
Someday you may be
Secretary of Defense,

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.140
just to put you on the spot.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.100
What-- are there
degree of any good--

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.280
- We can only hope.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.720
- We all hope this.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.130
We all hope this.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:40.410
Are there any good
military options?

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.720
If we had to go there and
none of us want to go there?

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.920
- Yep.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.030
Short answer is no.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.090
But I'll expand.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.670
I agree that I think
this opportunity, which

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:53.460
was an important
opportunity for diplomacy,

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.210
fell apart because the
administration was not

01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:01.230
serious in its preparation,
really taking the time

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.720
to have-- bring in
experts to understand

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.360
what do we think Kim Jong Un is
really trying to achieve here?

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.180
What do we think we're
trying to achieve?

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.980
What are our objectives?

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.031
What are we willing to give?

01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:14.280
What are they willing to give?

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.920
What are we willing
to hold in reserve?

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.660
How do you sequence
these things?

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.590
The lack of serious
diplomatic preparation

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:24.390
that has been needed in every--

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:26.670
historically in
every single time

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:29.740
where we've had a
breakthrough and success,

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.260
it just wasn't done.

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.640
So I hope that Mike Pompeo
now has the assignment

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.640
to get that going, but
he will have a challenge.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.070
We don't have an ambassador.

01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:40.560
We don't have the right
State Department jobs

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.330
filled to give him much help.

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.420
And you certainly can't
expect this kind of leadership

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.490
to come from John Bolton.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.220
So I hope--

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:54.960
I think the best
case is that they

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.960
focus on some serious
planning and preparation.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.910
They exert some
message discipline

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:02.370
so they don't have random
officials saying random things

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:05.490
that the North Koreans
have to react to

01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:09.860
and that they get back on a more
serious attempt at diplomacy.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.610
And this brings me to
answer to a question

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:16.770
because the alternative is
that if diplomacy truly fails,

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:19.170
this administration
has talked about using

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:20.790
the military option.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:23.910
And I want to just be
very clear about what

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.830
that would look like.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:31.350
The first thing is we
know that North Korea has

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.040
dozens of nuclear weapons.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.970
We know they are distributed
at hidden and underground

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.080
facilities.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.230
We know they have hundreds
and hundreds of missiles that

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:44.370
can hit regional allies or
now intercontinental-- hit

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.120
United States.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.430
Those are also hidden.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.780
Many are mobile.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:54.870
There is no military strike
that can denuclearize North

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.630
Korea as a military operation.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:59.250
You may get some of it.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.390
You won't get all of it.

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.450
The second thing,
Kim Jong Un's not

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:06.530
going to sit there and take
a large military strike when

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:09.390
it would have to be large
to try to get most of this.

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:10.830
He is going to respond.

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:12.220
How is he likely to respond?

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.420
He has tens of thousands of
rock-- short-range rockets

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.770
and artillery shells that can
be fired in seconds on their way

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:22.950
to Seoul, the city
with a population of 25

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:27.210
million civilians, including
a lot of Americans.

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:29.160
This-- any kind
of military strike

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.490
would almost certainly
quickly escalate

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:36.450
into an actual conflict.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:40.740
If we actually saw war in
Korea, this is not Iraq.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.240
This is not Afghanistan.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.180
Part of my job was
as undersecretary

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.870
was helping the secretary
provide civilian oversight

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:49.800
of war planning.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.790
We went through the Korea
plans dozens of times.

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:59.790
This is a very intensive,
bloody, long war

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:02.220
that the American people
are not prepared for,

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.600
and we should never
undertake without exhausting

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.449
every possibility including
diplomacy, containment,

01:09:11.449 --> 01:09:12.990
and all of the tools
that have worked

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:16.380
for us throughout the Cold War.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.770
Lastly, there's a real
risk of nuclear use.

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:24.300
Kim Jong Un has these
weapons as his survival card.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.590
If we truly in a position
to threaten his regime,

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.510
I can't imagine
a situation where

01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:32.939
he wouldn't try to use these.

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.189
And then we're in the world
of a nuclear conflict.

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:39.750
So we all have to hope
and pray that we get back

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.080
on the diplomatic track and that
this time the administration

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.930
learned some lessons from
its recent experience

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:48.920
and gets much more
serious about pursuing it.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.610
- Thank you, Michele

01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:53.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:02.580
So after Putin, the Middle
East, Syria, Iraq, Kim Jong Un,

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.180
we need a little uplifting.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:08.010
So, Liz, we have
11 minutes left,

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:09.740
and I want to do
two lightning rounds

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.480
where I pose two questions,
brief answers from the four

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:12.980
panelists.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.050
The first one is are we living
in the age of pessimism,

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:21.360
social media, the dueling
cable TV channels, all

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.400
the pessimism about America.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.477
I'd framed it this way--
my wife Libby is here.

01:10:25.477 --> 01:10:27.810
A couple of years ago, she
came to one of my talks here.

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:30.200
She made a huge
mistake of doing that.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.920
And it was about all
of these problems.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.567
And on the way home
here in Cambridge,

01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:35.400
I said how'd that go,
and there was a pause.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.620
And she said you're
depressing everybody.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.190
And she said what are
you hopeful about?

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:43.440
Where are the big trend lines?

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.740
And that was a really good
observation and question,

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:52.050
so this semester I asked my
class of 75 students from 22

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:54.330
countries don't tell
me what you wish for

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:58.740
but analytically where are the
big positive global trends--

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:01.320
economic,
technological, political

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.330
that we can all
try to push forward

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:05.046
on as a human community.

01:11:05.046 --> 01:11:07.170
So maybe I'll just go in
reverse order, Anne-Marie,

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:08.800
and start with you.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.896
What are you hopeful about?

01:11:10.896 --> 01:11:14.310
- I'm hugely hopeful
because we're

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.850
living in an age of renewal.

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:18.540
So two things.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.000
One, everyone here who
has anybody in their life

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.060
who is graduating, go buy
a book called Our Towns--

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:29.730
A 100,000-Mile Journey into the
Heart of America by Jim and Deb

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:32.460
Fallows, and I want to
emphasize it's Radcliffe Day.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.730
Jim Fallows, we know him.

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:34.230
He's great.

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.063
He's a Harvard grad.

01:11:35.063 --> 01:11:39.720
And Deb Fallows, his wife who's
a linguistics PhD from Harvard,

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.590
they spent five years flying
around this country going

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:46.950
to large towns, small cities.

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.670
Columbus, Ohio to Sioux
Falls to Eastport, Maine,

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:52.650
across this country.

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.410
And they tell you
what I have also seen,

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:59.040
that at the national level
I've never been as depressed.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.660
But as-- at the local level,
at the level where people know

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.140
each other and know that we're
broken and know that we have

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.790
to fix it, as--

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:11.550
they say and they
document people

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:15.060
are coming together and
working together and solving

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.660
problems who would never work
together at the national level.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:22.950
So go and think about
it but go buy it.

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.990
And then here's the larger part.

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:27.810
Renewal is the American way.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.710
If you just look back to
the end of the 19th century,

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:34.110
go back and read
your Upton Sinclair.

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:36.360
Go back and look at
the Gini coefficient

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.360
for the late 19th
century, the inequality--

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.570
the unbelievable inequality
for the historians present.

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:46.560
We-- the-- it was
machine politics.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.460
It was close to violence,
and who renewed us?

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.340
It was the folks from
the heartland out.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.830
It was the progressives
and the populace

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.890
and people from across
the country, Republicans

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.950
and Democrats or more
importantly right and left,

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:04.290
who said we are America.

01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.240
We have these values.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.040
We fall short, so far
short, but when we do,

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.880
we remind ourselves of who
we are and what we stand for,

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.530
and we pick ourselves back up.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:20.113
And we renew this country,
and it is happening now.

01:13:20.113 --> 01:13:23.071
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:28.494 --> 01:13:32.680
- Like Anne-Marie I refuse to
live in an age of pessimism,

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.660
so just quickly two things.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.960
One, obvious this week,
anyone who's here in Cambridge

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.360
is just watching our
students graduate.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.520
You cannot help
but be optimistic.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.590
Yesterday I-- with Nick,
we lined the corridor

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.580
where our graduates marched
in before the ceremony,

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.930
and no matter how
many times I do it

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:56.530
I will never fail to be
moved by their faces,

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.860
by the enthusiasm that they all
have for going out and making

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.260
the world a different place.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:07.460
So if you're ever feeling down,
just pop on a video of that.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.520
Second, more in
the policy side, I

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.600
would say I'm optimistic about
the age of energy abundance.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.980
So if we were
meeting 10 years ago,

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.590
we could have got
into a conversation

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.380
about potential
nodes of conflict,

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.950
and we might have focused
on energy scarcity

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:25.300
as being one of those nodes.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.210
Because 10 years ago, the
global energy landscape

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:31.630
looked completely different
from what it looks like today.

01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:34.030
Today we really are
living in a world

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:37.600
where people are worried
about energy rightly

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.950
from a perspective
of climate change

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:42.830
and other potential
environmental issues

01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:45.220
but much less
worried about energy

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.600
from the perspective of
being a source of conflict.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.140
So I have a former colleague
who in 2006 said he could not

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.080
imagine any future
scenario that did not

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.690
involve conflict between
the United States and China

01:14:58.690 --> 01:14:59.860
over energy.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.580
Nobody will make that
statement today because China

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.930
and the US are not
competing for energy.

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:08.620
In fact, China is
exporting energy to--

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.610
no, the US is exporting energy
to China, pretty remarkable.

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.890
And there are a number
of other examples

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:18.160
I could give you how this
new energy landscape actually

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.550
provides some opportunities
for more peaceful engagement,

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:25.870
be it from undermining one of
Russia's real potent foreign

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:30.670
policy tools to actually
potentially creating reasons

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.700
for new relationships
such as between Israelis

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.750
and their Arab neighbors because
Israel has huge new natural gas

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:42.070
finds, a resource that its
neighbors really need and want.

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.470
So that's one good
reason to be optimistic--

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.670
two good reasons.

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:46.590
- David.

01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:49.510
- I'll also offer
two quick reasons.

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:52.390
I'm optimistic because we
still live in a country

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.300
where citizens get to decide
what kind of government

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.230
they want.

01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:59.170
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:07.870
I'm not happy about the choices
that people sometimes make,

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:12.490
but-- and I want people to
fight to preserve their ability

01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:15.700
to choose despite
outside interference

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.000
and apprise that citizenship.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.720
But we still are
special in that respect.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.440
Second, and this
sounds so corny,

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.930
but I'm optimistic
every time I walk

01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:27.580
into the newsroom
of the Washington

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.265
Post and any other
major news organization.

01:16:30.265 --> 01:16:33.235
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.540
Sometimes in my
business you wonder

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.830
what's the point of it all?

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.580
Do we really make a difference?

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.350
I don't think anybody
in the Washington Post,

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:48.622
the New York Times, any
of these organizations

01:16:48.622 --> 01:16:50.580
thinks that today we know
we make a difference,

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.010
and we're really trying
hard to tell the truth.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:54.121
- Here here.

01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:57.007
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:58.931 --> 01:17:02.300
- I, too, refuse to
be too pessimistic.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.700
So a couple of
things give me hope

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.810
even though they've
come out of very tragic,

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:10.220
upsetting circumstances.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.260
The one first is
the mobilization

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:15.126
of women in this country
in the #MeToo movement

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:22.630
and the example to finally end
behavior that should have been

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:26.230
seen as completely unacceptable
decades ago but to--

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:29.410
and to hold people accountable
and to change norms

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:31.980
and behaviors and expectations.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.680
It just gives me a great hope,
and it's actually inspiring.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.870
I'm on the board
of CARE and NGO,

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:40.750
and it's actually inspiring
now a global #MeToo

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:42.580
movement, which
is just incredible

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.780
for women around the world.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.210
Second is young people.

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.730
Look at how the
students of Parkland

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:53.080
and all over this
country have stood up

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.970
and said this has to stop.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.240
This gun violence has
to stop, and we're not

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.640
going to stop until it changes.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.060
And lastly look at how
many women and how many

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.880
young people are like
first responders running

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.630
toward the flames.

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:11.344
They are going to go run for
office and change the system.

01:18:11.344 --> 01:18:14.236
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:20.502 --> 01:18:24.016
- So my 75 students said
poverty alleviation,

01:18:24.016 --> 01:18:25.890
the greatest in the
history of the world last

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:28.980
30 years, global health,
the eradication of polio

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:33.300
in two to three years,
malaria in 20 to 25.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.570
They hope for technology, too.

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:38.610
They see the double edge on
AI, on quantum computing,

01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:41.490
on gene editing, but they
see that's a hopeful tool.

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:45.480
And lastly-- and this was
really high on the class poll--

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.540
leadership opportunities
for women, 75 students

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.500
from 22 countries.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:56.240
So, Liz, can we do a lightning
round of 30 seconds each

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.330
because the last question,
Madame Secretary, is about you?

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:02.070
And it's about you.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:05.880
You don't have to
say anything now.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.840
To all of you in
30 seconds, what

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.880
do you most admire
about Secretary Clinton?

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.940
- Yes, Anne-Marie.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.510
- I've got books
on that subject.

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:24.360
What I admire about
Secretary Clinton

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.380
is that she has an
extraordinarily expansive

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.760
vision of how America
should be in the world.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.471
I thought-- I'll
make a confession--

01:19:32.471 --> 01:19:34.720
that I was going to teach
her more than she taught me.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.210
I'd done-- been doing
foreign policy for 30 years,

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.390
and she was
relatively new to it.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:42.000
She taught me to
think about a world

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.940
not only in terms of
states and diplomacy

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.920
and coercion and defense,
all the things you've heard,

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.170
but also a world in which we
equally focus on the people

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:56.040
and on poverty and education
and health and resource security

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.770
and food security and
anti-corruption, what

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:02.190
makes a difference to people
how they live every day.

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:06.750
Our security in this world
and our morality in this world

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:11.190
lies in that just as much
as classic diplomacy.

01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:13.110
Secretary Clinton
taught me that,

01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:16.018
and it is a lesson that will
guide the rest of my life.

01:20:16.018 --> 01:20:18.886
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:20.798 --> 01:20:23.180
- OK.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.080
Two points in 30 seconds.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.610
So first is an idea
and one is a policy.

01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:32.090
What I admire most is
the big idea behind I

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:35.630
think everything that we've
seen Secretary Clinton do,

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:37.790
especially on the
world stage, and that

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:40.130
is that the objective
of US foreign policy

01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:43.550
is to make the world
a better place.

01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:46.880
Reading back over speeches
she's made, in 2013,

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.800
she said to the Council
on Foreign Relations

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.090
we, the United States, are the
force for progress, prosperity,

01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:57.137
and peace, unabashedly
embracing that role of the US

01:20:57.137 --> 01:20:58.970
and the responsibility
that comes with that.

01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:01.880
So I have-- I admired that
and I admire that today

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.680
more than ever.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.310
On policy I would say one
country that surprisingly we

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:09.140
didn't talk about is China.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.294
And this is a very--

01:21:10.294 --> 01:21:11.960
this is the would say
the most important

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.970
bilateral relationship
that the US has,

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.040
maybe the most or certainly
the most important

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.230
bilateral relationship in
the world and obviously very,

01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:20.410
very complex.

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:23.030
And I feel like
Secretary Clinton,

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:26.060
she really understood
the importance of that

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.850
and the challenge that
China posed both in terms

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.190
of its power and its ambitions.

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:35.090
But I also felt like her
approach towards China

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:38.716
recognized that it is essential
we find an accommodation--

01:21:38.716 --> 01:21:40.340
accommodation is a
wrong word I guess--

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:43.970
essential that we find
a way to work with China

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:46.154
and that it is possible
for us to do this.

01:21:46.154 --> 01:21:47.570
We have sufficient
common interest

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.130
that we can find a way.

01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:53.030
And that I think is so critical
to the US success in the world

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:55.460
and really to global
success going forward.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.650
And that is something
which is easier said

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:03.590
than actually implemented,
and I give her a lot of credit

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:05.094
for advancing those ideas.

01:22:05.094 --> 01:22:07.986
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:10.396 --> 01:22:13.700
- I'm a journalist, so I
don't want to get too gee

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.230
whiz an answer here.

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.220
So I'll just say two things.

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.310
In covering Secretary
Clinton for a long time,

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:26.950
I think she consistently
gets the big things right,

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:27.690
and that matters.

01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:28.970
She's strategic.

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:33.320
And the second thing
is that she's tough.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:40.310
There is a reason why Vladimir
Putin was so determined

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:42.756
that she not be our president.

01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:45.732
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:55.652 --> 01:22:59.280
- I have a long list, so I'm
going to try to be quick.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.450
Number one, Hillary Clinton
is an amazing role model

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:07.020
not only for women
but for any American

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.490
who wants to serve
their country.

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:12.270
Her leadership, her
toughness, her resilience,

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:15.871
this woman cannot be stopped
from serving her country.

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:18.757
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:18.757 --> 01:23:22.070
And second, her
strategic focus, as you

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:25.700
said, whether it was having
the foresight to realize

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.220
that the most consequential
region for the United

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.980
States for America in terms of
our prosperity and our security

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.570
long term was going
to be Asia and we

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:35.570
needed to start moving more
of our strategic bandwidth

01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:38.230
towards Asia, whether
it was the insight

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:42.410
of the power of empowering
women for every dimension

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:45.470
of foreign policy
and development

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:47.760
for us and for around the world.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.090
And the last thing
I'll say is I've never

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.880
seen anyone more
fully understand

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.810
how to integrate the different
instruments of American power,

01:23:56.810 --> 01:24:01.660
the military, sanctions,
economics, trade in service

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:04.760
of diplomacy to
achieve strategic ends,

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:10.010
it was like a master class
in the use of American power

01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:11.060
and influence.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.790
And we all had a great
deal to learn from her,

01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:16.859
so thank you for your
example and your service.

01:24:16.859 --> 01:24:19.757
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:22.172 --> 01:24:25.810
- And, Madam Secretary, I
admire your faith and diplomacy.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:27.670
We need that leadership.

01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:31.870
I admire your courage in
Teddy Roosevelt's arena.

01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:34.450
And I admire your resilience
and faith in our country.

01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.562
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

01:24:36.562 --> 01:24:39.508
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.070
- And I want to add
my thanks to Nick

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:51.220
and the panelists for a truly
fascinating conversation.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.270
[APPLAUSE]
