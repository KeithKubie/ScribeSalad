00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.310
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: We are
delighted to start this new series.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.580
We're starting a series called Poet
2 Poet, Poeta a Poeta, and we --

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.870
our idea is to have a poet, a poet
who's alive, to honor one of the --

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.830
a great poet of the
Hispanic language.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.180
We are starting this great
series here today with Consuelo,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.990
who's going to be doing a
homage to César Vallejo.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.410
I want to take an opportunity
to also tell you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.970
about the Hispanic Reading Room
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.780
The Hispanic Reading Room
is a primary access point

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.300
for research related to the
Caribbean, Latin America, Spain,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.750
and Portugal and is
open to everyone.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.270
Whoever has a reader's card
can use our Reading Room

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.840
so everyone is welcome.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.200
If anyone wants to find out
more about our programs,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.170
please visit our website, which
is www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.920
And now to today's event.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.910
We're going to have Consuelo, who's
going to do a homage to, as I said,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.970
Peruvian poet César Vallejo,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.190
one of our most beloved
poets of Latin America.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.780
And then Consuelo's going to
read from Vallejo together

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.800
with Maureen Contreni, who is
going to read the poems in English,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.660
and then Consuelo is
going to move --

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.160
she's going to then read some of
her work and Contreni is going

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.690
to read the English translations.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.640 position:56%
About our feature speakers, Consuelo
Hernández was born in Colombia

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.860
and has lived in Venezuela, Peru,
Puerto Rico, and the United States.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.680
She has published four
collections of poems,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.560
among them Voces de la
soledad, Solo de violín,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.990
poemario para músicos y
pintores, Manual de peregrina,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.250
and the bilingual collection
Poemas de escombros y cenizas,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.150
and in English that one is titled
Poems from Debris and Ashes,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.900
and the book that we're here to --

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.870
to celebrate, and the one
that she'll be reading

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.220
from today, Mi reino sin orillas.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.210
Consuelo's poetry has been
included in numerous anthologies.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.870
She has received many, many
honors, including distinction

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.030
from the international poetry
contest of Ciudad Melilla in Spain

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.170
and the Letras de Oro contest
at the University of Miami.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.860 position:56%
She is also -- in 2011, she received
the Antonio Machado Poetry Award

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.570
in Madrid, Spain, and
the Mid-Atlantic Council

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.170
of Latin American Studies,
among many other honors.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.650
And Consuelo is also Associate
Professor at the World Languages

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.620
and Cultures Department at American
University here in Washington.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.600
As I said, she will be
accompanied by Maureen Contreni,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.740
who has translated some of
Consuelo's poetry, and Maureen --

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.470
Maureen graduated also
from American University.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.430
That's where she met Consuelo.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.930
And she's an attorney, and she has
traveled extensively throughout

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.980
Latin America, so I'm assuming
that's why you love translating

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.680
Latin American poetry.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.770
One last announcement.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.300
We will be selling -- Consuelo
is selling her book at the book

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.050
and maybe she'll be glad to
sign some copies at the end.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.950
So the books are located
there in the back.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.590
With no further adieu, please join
me in welcoming Consuelo Hernández.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.390
Thank you.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.790
[ Applause ]

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.890
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: Thank you,
Catalina, for that presentation.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:18.620
Good afternoon and thank you for
making the trip up here today

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.120
in this beautiful raining day.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.700
It feels so good to see
many familiar faces,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.630
friends, and colleagues.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.650
Thank you.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.610
I want to give my special thanks to
Catalina Gómez and Dr. [inaudible],

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.260
who from the Hispanic
Division of the Library

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.750
of Congress invited me
for this special event.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.980 position:56%
I am also very grateful with Maureen
Contreni, my dear translator.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.770
She -- she has translated
for my books.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.120
This is the first time we
are sharing one reading.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.200
She is a busy attorney, a
wonderful mother of two,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.070
and a very exceptional friend.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.970 position:56%
I met Maureen at American University
I think around 20 years ago

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.090
and when she was in
my freshmen class.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.870
It was one star already completely
[inaudible] in Portuguese, Spanish,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.530 position:56%
and English, and I don't know if she
has learned another language, but --

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.930
and I was astonished
by her translation.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.760
So until now, though she doesn't
dedicate only to translate,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.250
she translated my book, and thank
you for that and for being here.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.320
I also would like to dedicate this,
this poetry reading, to my Peruvian

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.180
and Colombian brothers and
sisters that are facing the most,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.980
the worst catastrophe,
natural catastrophe,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.400
that they have suffered
in the last decades.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.550
And Trujillo, the city
where Vallejo spent most

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.810
of his more important
intellectual and formational years,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.570
is one of the cities more affected.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.360
So we have that day in mind today.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.500
It is a great pleasure for
me and a big honor to be

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.110
in this city celebrating the
greatest, the most wonderful,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.810
and the most beloved poet or Latin
American during the 20th century.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.840
César Vallejo is the poet --

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.580
is the poet really from
the avant-garde times.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:05.730
He was a poet that before Breton
published the Surrealist Manifesto

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.660
he was already surrealist
[inaudible] he lives only 46 years,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:23.500
from 1892 to 1918, but
those years were enough

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.410
to write an immortal --
immortal book of poetry.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:37.410
At the beginning of the year, I was
contacted by Catalina and asked me

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.630
to give the name of one poet that
has been influencing my world

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.650
or somebody that I really like

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.820
and honestly I couldn't
give her only one name.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.670
There are many poets that I
have read and many that I enjoy,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.200
so I sent a list of
six names and let her

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.110
to choose whoever she consider more
appropriate to start the series.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:12.230
And some days later, I
received a letter, an email,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.620
telling me that the selected
poem was César Vallejo

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:24.180
and I was just thrilled and in some
way I thought what a coincidence

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.420
because Vallejo is one of those
very few poets that when I read

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.350
for the first time
he moved me to tears.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.870
And I think that everybody
who reads Vallejo can cry

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.020
when you read those poems.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.540
So I -- I start to think what
do I have in common with Vallejo

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.750
and I really don't know how
much of Vallejo's in my poetry.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.060
I'm going to leave this
word for the critics,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.510
but I try to find some comparalisms
[phonetic] between his life

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.170
and my life and the motivation
he has to write poetry

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.220
and my own motivations and I --

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.830
I'm going just to mention some
because I think it is useful

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.350
to illustrate who was this Vallejo.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:19.120
One thing in common is
that we're born on March 16

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.030
and March 16 is his
date when he's born

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:28.170
and March 16 is my
official birthday.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.780
Another thing is our
provincial origins.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:39.290
He was born in Santiago de
Chuco in Peru highlands,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:46.640
in a provincial town, in an
environment very religious.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.950
His parents were both mestizo
and they were son and daughter

00:09:53.950 --> 00:10:05.080
from priests in Peru so they
have that religious formation

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.280
since the very beginning.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.220
So I thought that that was
interesting because I'm also

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.550
from a little town in Colombia,
from the Andean mountains,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:27.560
one hour from Medellín, El Peñón,
and I lived there for 10 years.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.600 position:56%
Vallejo moved from Santiago de Chuco
to Trujillo and to Lima in order

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.630
to study and I moved
when I was 10 to --

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.690
with my family to Medellín
also to get education

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.860
and go to the university.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.340
By the way, here is
one of my professors

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.520
from the University of Antioquia.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.400
I was really surprised because he
was my professor I think 50 years

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.570
ago, around that, and she's also a
translator, Patricia [Inaudible].

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:15.660
And then Vallejo, after those years
in Trujillo and in Lima started

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.520
in an agrarian intellectual
development, he decided to go

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.750
to France, and from France
he travelled to the Institute

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.220
of [Inaudible], especially
to Russia.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.260
He went four times because
of his political convictions.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.100
And then he went also
to Spain to collaborate

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.600
with the republican courts.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.380
In my case, I moved to
Venezuela more by spiritual

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.810
and idealistic convictions,
too, and [inaudible] political

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:59.300
and then I went to Peru, to
Puerto Rico, and finally I came

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.670
to the United States
where I did my Ph.D.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:12.510
and I definitely stayed
here already 30 years.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:19.070
So, but the -- our similarities
in our lives doesn't end here.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:26.680
We -- I think what delineates his
poetry is also common to my poetry.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:35.230
He has -- he's chosen his
poetry on profound necessity

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:42.170
and absolutely freedom and at the
same the possibility to find it.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.250
His nostalgia also for his lost
paradise of the [inaudible],

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.980
the memories of his family,
especially his mother

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.310
and his brother, his
suffering for the loss --

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.190
losses that he had during his life.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:09.570
He lost his brother in 1915, his
mother in 1918, then his father.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.570
He was also in jail for 112 days.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:19.600
So he has a very difficult life
and that shows in his poetry, too.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.460
And he has an existential
anguish and a kind of sense

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.520
of feeling an orphan in this
world, lonely, in solitude,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:40.520
and besides that he had the
conscience for political

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:46.930
and social justice, and
that put him into trouble

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.530
because of his political
convictions.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.730
He was expelled from France
and he had to live in Spain

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.410
for certain times and
he went back to Spain.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:04.200
But anyway, in his poetry there are
also the eternal themes of poetry,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.290
death, love, life, and
in a way this is --

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:14.570
this is also present in my poetry,
so I think that the selection

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:20.110
of César Vallejo was a very
just for our reading today.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:26.010
But we are not here to hear
another scholarly presentation.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.770
This is something that you can read

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:36.030
in many critic studies
about his poetry.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.710
There are also many biographies
and some of them exceptional,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.400
like the one written by
Juan Espejo Asturrizaga.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:52.500
So we are going to go into
his poetry and I am going

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.100
to try and put into context.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:05.070
Any time I read a poem, I am
going to put it into context

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:11.710
and Maureen is going to
read the translation.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.600
He wrote several books of poetry,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.160
but when he died he
only had published two

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.500
and both self-published.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:27.620
I want to emphasize that
they were self-published

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:34.200
because many times we devaluate
self-publications and one gigantic

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.780
like this published Los
heraldos negros [inaudible]

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:45.230
that doesn't have any translation
because it's a word, a neologismo,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.480
it's a word invented
by him [inaudible].

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.240
He published by himself
with his own money

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.210
in Lima before going to France.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:04.180 position:56%
And since he went to Europe he
didn't publish any other poetic book

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.750
and all the rest of his work
was unpublished until he died.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.490
His widow was the one that
published the other books.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.270
So this is his complete
work on poetry and half

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.400
of this was unpublished
when he died.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.710
So we're going to start the reading

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:30.000
with one poem entitled
Los heraldos negros.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.760 position:56%
Esta poema de Los heraldos negro
abre este libro y habla de el choque

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:47.530
tremendo que tuvo César Vallejo
cuando recibió un telegrama de su

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.640
hermano que decía sobre
la muerte de su madre.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.940
Entonces --

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:04.280
Es un poema muy fuerte y muy bello.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.190
Los heraldos negros.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:11.830
Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.760
Yo no sé.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.970
Golpes como del odio de
Dios, como si -- si --

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.590
Lo siento.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.510
Necesito [inaudible].

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:57.460
[ Background speaking ]

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.640
Volvamos a empezar.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.940
Los heraldos negros.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.220
Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.320
Yo no sé.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.860
Golpes como del odio de
Dios, como si ante ellos,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:21.170
la resaca de todo lo sufrido
se empozara en el alma.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.470
Yo no sé.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.100
Son pocos, pero son.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:33.820
Abren zanjas oscuras en el rostro
más fiero y en el lomo más fuerte.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.650
Serán tal vez los potros
de bárbaros attilas,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.960
o los heraldos negros
que nos manda la Muerte.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.130
Son las caídas hondas
de los cristos del alma,

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:51.320
de alguna fe adorable
que el Destino blasfema.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:57.750
Esos golpes sangrientos son las
crepitaciones de algún pan que en

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.050
la puerta del horno se nos quema.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.790
Y el hombre.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.940
Pobre. Pobre.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.780
Vuelve los ojos, como cuando por
sobre el hombro nos llama una

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:17.930
palmada, vuelve los ojos locos,
y todo lo vivido se empoza,

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:22.110
como un charco de culpa,
en la mirada.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.730
Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.030
Yo no sé.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:37.150
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Thank you
very much for having me here.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.020
The black heralds.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.920
There are blows in
life, so powerful.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.420
I don't know.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:50.040
Blows like God's hatred
as if before them.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.310
the undertow of everything
suffered or to well up in the soul.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.000
I don't know.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.280
They're few, but they exist.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.920
They open dark furrows in
the most ferocious face

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.510
and the most powerful loins.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.330
Perhaps they're wooden
horses of barbaric attilas

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.490
or black messengers
that Death sent to us.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:19.030
They're profound lapses
of the soul's christs,

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.340
of some adorable faith
that Destiny blasphemes.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.140
Those bloodthirsty blows
are crackling of some bread

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.300
that in the oven's
door burns up on us.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.790
And man. Poor, poor man.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:42.920
He turns his eyes as when a slap
on the shoulder calls us by name.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.080
He turns his crazed eye and
everything he's lived wells

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.180 position:56%
up like a pool of guilt in his gaze.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.530
There are blows in
life, so powerful.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:01.750
I don't know.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.140
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: Yeah.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.440
Los pasos lejanos.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:16.850
In this poem, Vallejo is already
far from Santiago de Chuco

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.950
and he's missing his family.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:28.160
So the central figures here are
his father and his peaceful mother.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.110
Mi madre duerme -- perdón.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.410
Mi padre duerme.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:41.600
Su semblante augusto
figura un apacible corazón,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.110
está ahora tan dulce.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:49.080
Si hay algo en él
de amargo, seré yo.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:57.030
Hay soledad en el hogar, se reza,
y no hay noticias de los hijos hoy.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:02.660
Mi padre se despierta,
ausculta la huida a Egipto,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.680
el restañate adiós.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.510
Está ahora tan cerca, si hay
algo en él de lejos, seré yo.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:16.790
Y mi madre pasea allá
en los huertos,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.690
saboreando un sabor ya sin sabor.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:28.570
Está ahora tan suave, tan
ala, tan salida, tan amor.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:34.340
Hay soledad en el hogar sin bulla,
sin noticias, sin verde, sin niñez.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.980
Y si hay algo quebrado en esta
tarde, y que baja y que cruje,

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.560
son dos viejos caminos
blancos, curvos.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:52.920
Por ellos va mi corazón a pie.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.540
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
Distant footsteps.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.290
My father sleeps.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.550
His august expression
suggests a tranquil heart.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.610
Now he's so sweet.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.710
If there's anything bitter
in him, it must be me.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.740
There's loneliness at home.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.320
He prays. And there's no
news of the children today.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:21.370 position:56%
My father wakes up, listening inside
himself for the flight into Egypt,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.000
the goodbye that stops
the flow of blood.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.210
Now he's so close.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.920
If there's anything distant
in him, it must be me.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.210
Out there, my mother
passes through the orchards,

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.920
already savoring the
savor without savor.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:46.010
Now she's so soft, so much
wing, so gone, so much love.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.430
There's loneliness at
home with no noisy brood,

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.000
no news, no green, no childhood.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.600
And this afternoon, if there's
anything broken that stoops over

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.430
and creaks, it's two
old white, curvy roads.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.970
Down them my heart travels on foot.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.620
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández:
A mi hermano Miguel.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.500
Miguel was the closest
brother to César.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:30.430
César is the 11th of the 11
children of this big family

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.110
and Miguel -- Miguel was
the one before the last one,

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.700
so they were very close.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.860
And he died in 1915.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.730
So this poem is A mi
hermano Miguel, In memoriam.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.730
Hermano, hoy estoy en
el poyo de la casa.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.350 position:56%
Donde nos haces una falta sin fondo.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.890
Me acuerdo que jugábamos esta hora,

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:04.640
y que mama nos acariciaba:
Pero, hijos.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.680
Ahora yo me escondo, como antes,
todas estas oraciones vespertinas,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.650
y espero que tú no des conmigo.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.570
Por la sala, el zaguán,
los corredores.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:24.820
Después, te ocultas
tú, y yo no doy contigo.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.990
Me acuerdo que nos hacíamos
llorar, hermano, en aquel juego.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.540
Miguel, tú te escondiste una
noche de agosto, al alborear, pero,

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.960
en vez de ocultarte
riendo, estabas triste.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.160
Y tu gemelo corazón de esas
tardes extintas se ha aburrido de

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.460
no encontrarte.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.380
Y ya cae sombra en el alma.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.140
Oye, hermano, no tardes en salir.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:06.130
¿Bueno? Puede inquietarse mamá.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.970
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
To my brother Miguel.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.370
Brother, I am sitting on
the bench at our house,

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.080
where your absence
is a bottomless pit.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.600
I remember that this is
the time we used to play

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.420
and that Mama would
pat us and say, "Boys!

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:31.260
Boys!" Now I'm hiding as I used to
from all those even-tied prayers

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.980
and hoping you don't
stumble upon me.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.200
Through the sala, the
entry hall, the corridors.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.550
Later you go hide and
I don't find you.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:48.150
I remember that we made each other
cry, brother, playing that game.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:53.780
Miguel, you hid one night in August
near dawn, but instead of laughing

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.470
as you hid, you were
sad and your twin heart

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.550
from those bygone afternoons
is weary from not finding you.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.690
and now a shadow is
falling over my soul.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.280
Listen, brother, don't
wait too long to come out.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.500
Alright? You might upset Mama.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:20.560
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: Ahora vamos
a leer dos poemas from Trilce.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:28.150
Trilce es el [inaudible], el
libro mas importante de la

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.610
vanguardia latinoamericana.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:41.080
Vallejo, sin escuelas, sin --
sin manifiestos, sin seguidores,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.670
aquejado como la figura mas
epígono de la vanguardia.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:50.340
A diferencia de otros poetas que
sí tuvieron escuela o sí tuvieron

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:55.350
manifiestos y formaron seguidores.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.670
Como dije antes Trilce
es una palabra inventada.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:05.230
Algunos malinterpretado que es la
combinación de triste y dulce pero

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.690
en realidad el en una entrevista
dijo que no significada nada,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.730
que estaba buscando un titulo
bueno para poner a su --

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:19.250 position:56%
a su libro y que [inaudible] jugando
con [inaudible] trilce y decidió

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:25.370
que es el titulo mas
apropiado para su libro.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:31.280
El libro tiene 77 poemas y
ninguno tiene titulo que nos

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.850
puedan orientar.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.570
Es sobre contenido.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.410
Asi que vamos a leer el poema No.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:47.910
18. Este poema se refiere a sus
dias en la cárcel y añoranza que

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.010
[inaudible] ante de la madre como
la posible solución al abandono que

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.310
esta sufriendo.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:29:00.050
I said all of this in Spanish.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.480
I'm going to make a summary.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.370
Trilce is one of the most
important books of poetry in --

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.780
for the avant-garde, the
movement, in Latin America.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.810
And this poem that I am going

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.270
to read now talks about
his time in jail.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:23.090
He was arrested thoroughly
and totally unjusted --

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:28.500
unjustified, and he wrote
this poem when he was in jail.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.420
And the day he was liberated,
he read this poem to his friends

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.610
and Juan Espejo says that when
he was reading this poem he was

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.910
in tears.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.520
Oh, las cuatro paredes de la celda.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.840
Ah, las cuatro paredes
albicantes que sin remedio dan al

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.760
mismo número.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.580
Criadero de nervios mala brecha,

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.780
por sus cuatro rincones
cómo arranca las diarias

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.970
aherrojadas extremidades.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:10.170
Amorosa llavera de innumerables
llaves, si estuvieras aquí,

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.360
si vieras hasta qué hora
son las cuatro estas paredes.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.540
Contra ellas seríamos contigo,
los dos, más dos que nunca.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:25.460
Y ni lloraras, di, ¡Libertadora!

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.720
Ah, las cuatro paredes de la celda.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.820
De ellas me duelen entretanto,

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:37.290
más las dos largas que tienen esta
noche algo de madres que ya muertas

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:45.210
llevan por bromurados declives,
a un niño de la mano cada una.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:51.000
Y sólo yo me voy quedando, con la
diestra, que hace por ambas manos,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.580
en alto, en busca de terciario
brazo que ha de pupilar,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:04.420
entre mi dónde y cuándo, esta
mayoría inválida de hombre.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.040
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
This is Poem No.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.640
18. Oh, the four walls of the cell.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:20.170
Ah, the four whitening walls that
helplessly face the same number.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.680
Place where the nerves
are born the worst way,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.820
through its four corners
how it drags

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.880
around the shackled daily limbs.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.400
Tender keeper of innumerable
keys, if you were here,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.240
if you could see just how late
these walls are still four.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:45.010
Against them we'd be with you,
the two of us, more two than ever,

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.310
and you wouldn't even cry.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.910
Speak up, liberator.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.900
Ah, the walls, the cell.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:58.540
Meanwhile, I hurt most from the
two long ones that tonight look

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:04.050
like mothers already dead,
who each lead a child by hand

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:07.540
down shear cliffs of bromine.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.460 position:56%
And here I'm still alone with my
right hand, which does for both held

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.410
up high, in search of tertiary arm
which has to tutor between my where

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:26.890
and my when this invalid
majority of man.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:32.030
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández:
Now we'll read the Poem No.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:36.960
28. This is an absolute beauty.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.140
When I read this poem
for the first time,

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.940
this is one of the
poems that made me cry.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.450
I was far from my home, too.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.070
I was in Venezuela.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:53.320
And it's -- it captures
in an exceptional way,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.130
with so much intensity,
the nostalgia for his home

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.050
and also with every day worse.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.750
I will read it.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:14.370
He almorzado solo ahora, y no
he tenido madre, ni súplica,

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.570
ni sírvete, ni agua, ni padre que,

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.680
en el facundo ofertorio
de los choclos,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:28.520 position:56%
pregunte para su tardanza de imagen,
por los broches mayores del sonido.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.840
Cómo iba yo a almorzar.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.930
Cómo me iba a servir de tales
platos distantes esas cosas,

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.140
cuando habráse quebrado
el propio hogar,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.620
cuando no asoma ni
madre a los labios.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.770
Cómo iba yo a almorzar nonada.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:51.660
A la mesa de un buen amigo he
almorzado con su padre recién

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:58.710
llegado del mundo, con sus canas
tías que hablan en tordillo retinte

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.650
de porcelana, bisbiseando por
todos sus viudos alvéolos,

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.120
y con cubiertos francos
de alegres tiroriros,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.260
porque estánse en su casa.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.560
Así, ¡qué gracia!

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:20.010
Y me han dolido los cuchillos
de esta mesa en todo el paladar.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.300
El yantar de estas mesas así,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.680
en que se prueba amor ajeno
en vez del propio amor,

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.900
torna tierra el brocado
que no brinda la madre,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:38.550
que hace golpe la dura
deglución, el dulce, hiel,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.430
aceite funéreo, el café.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.380
Cuando ya se ha quebrado
el propio hogar,

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.130
y el sírvete materno
no sale de la tumba,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.970
la cocina a oscuras,
la miseria de amor.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.990
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Now
I have eaten lunch alone

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:06.480
and have had no mother or entreaty
or help yourself, or water,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.060
or father, who in his fluent
offertory of boiled corn,

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.970
asks about his delay of image and
for the larger clasps of sound.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.520
How was I going to eat, how was I
going to serve myself those things

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.290
from such distant plates, when our
very hearth will have been broken,

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.570
when not even a glimpse
of mother touches my lips.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.680
How was I going to eat a bite.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.670
I have had lunch at the
table of a good friend,

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.130
with his father recently
arrived from the world,

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.780
with his white-haired aunts
chattering in the dappled chinking

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:49.270
of china, buzzing about
all the ovulate widowers

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.430
and generous place settings
of joyous tootlings,

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.650
because they are in the house.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.530
Ah, how pleasant, and the knives

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:02.250
of this table have hurt
every bit of my pallet.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.050
Thus the victuals of these tables,
which demonstrate altruistic rather

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:13.300
than selfish love, turn to dirt the
mouthful not offered by the mother,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:20.200
make difficult deglutition a
blow, the sweet bile, coffee,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:25.310
funereal oil, when your own
heart has already been broken

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:30.190
and the maternal help yourself does
not leave the tomb, the kitchen,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:37.320
in darkness, the misery of love.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.160
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: From
Poemas Humanos, that was the book

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:47.280
that was published posthumously,
we will read Piedra blanca --

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.130
Piedra negra sobre una piedra
blanca, and it's a premonition

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.880
of his own death, though
he didn't die on Thursday

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.400
and in a fall as the poem says.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.510
He died on a rainy
Holy Friday in spring,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.450
15 April, the month of poetry.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.550
Piedra negra sobre
una piedra blanca.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:19.040
Me moriré en París con aguacero,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.700
un día del cual tengo
ya el recuerdo.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.560
Me moriré en París y no me corro,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.270
tal vez un jueves,
como es hoy de otoño.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:34.670
Jueves será, porque hoy,
jueves, que proso estos versos,

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:40.610
los húmeros me he puesto a la mala
y, jamás como hoy, me he vuelto,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.710
con todo mi camino, a verme solo.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.770
César Vallejo ha muerto, le pegaban
todos sin que él les haga nada,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:54.280
le daban duro con un palo y
duro también con una soga,

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.810
son testigos los días jueves y
los jueves -- los huesos húmeros,

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:04.650
la soledad, la lluvia, los caminos.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:11.340
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Black
stone on a white stone.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.870
I will die in Paris with hard
dirty rain on a day I now remember.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.450
I will die in Paris,
and I don't run.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.480
Maybe a Thursday, like
today, in autumn.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.480
Thursday, because today,
Thursday, when I prose these lines,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:35.270
I have forced my humeri
on unwillingly and never

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:40.880
like today have I again, with
all my road, seen myself alone.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.900
César Vallejo is dead.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.500
They beat him everyone, without
him doing anything to them.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.780
They hit him hard with a stick
and hard likewise with a rope.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.210
Witnesses are the Thursdays

00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:00.860
and humerus bones the
loneliness, the rain, the roads.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.960
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: Now
it's going to be very difficult

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:13.320 position:56%
to read my own work in front of
this amazing beauty, but I was going

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.270
to read some of my
poems from my new book.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:24.430
Before, I want to thank all the
people that made possible this book

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.890 position:56%
because the cover was made by
Phyllis Portella [assumed spelling],

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.170
one painter that lives in New York.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.910
The back cover is a comment
by Iris Guzman, the translator

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:40.840
of so many Latin American
writers and Hispanic writers.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.210
The pictures were taken by
Daniel Adino [assumed spelling].

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:54.600
I also want to thank my husband
for his support always and for --

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.320
because he was instrumental
in deciding what title

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.880
to give to the book, too.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.640
And of course to Maureen,
that translated the book.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:10.690
So I'm going to read
like five minutes, eight,

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.240
so we have time to
discuss the reading.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.540
Recomienzo.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.260
Recomienzo.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:26.410
Reinicio este constante desplazarme
atravieso montañas desiertos y

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:32.840
llanuras ni míos ni tuyos los
dominios de la imaginación.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:39.550
Ríos, volcanes, lavas y cenizas
un incendio interior me devora.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:44.320
Las sombras cabargan en la nueva
aurora peregrino por las cuatro

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:50.120
estaciones derrumbo murallas
confundida entre la turba entre el

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.940
huracán y las aves.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.950
Busco la antorcha.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:59.560
La palabra que dé en el blanco
el aroma de la hierba silvestre la

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:06.280
patria de nostalgias y viborea en
mi cuerpo una violenta sensación

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.580
de amor.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.880
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Again.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:15.640
It begins again, this
relentless journey over deserts

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:22.190
and plains neither mine nor yours
but dominions of imagination.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:29.770
By lamplight I grope my way across
rivers, volcanoes, lava, and ash.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.650
A fire devours me from within.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.530
I return from the night
on the wings of sunrise,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.090 position:56%
a pilgrim crossing the four seasons.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:42.440
I demolish the ancient
walls of cities,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.840
confused in the teeming crowds
between the hurricane and the birds

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.560
in search of a sliver of
light from a single word.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.050
Let the smell of wild grass,
the mother of nostalgia,

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:02.120
strike at the heart of the
target and twist inside me

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.170
with the violence of love.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.210
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: I have
to say that this book was written

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:14.480
after I had experience of
suffer cancer and in front

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:23.600
of one experience so hard, an
obstacle that's big to overcome,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:32.910
I come to value as never
life and also to find support

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:39.200
in the highest inner self
or in whatever you believe

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.110
that can help you in those moments.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.020
And I wrote this poem
too in those times.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.000
Tu nombre.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.480
Digo tu nombre y todos se ilumina.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.990
Pienso en tu nombre y
estoy lista para el viaje.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:00.030
Sueno tu nombre y me
despierto de una pesadilla.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:04.300
Escribo tu nombre y
aparece la palabra amor.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.490
Te llamo y brota agua en
el desierto de mi pena.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:17.580
Grito tu nombre y fecundas
de fulgor el universo.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:23.530
Me lleno de tu nombre y hay
esperanza limpia en mis caminos.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:31.660
Me abrazas, me besas y estoy viva.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.000
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Your name.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.820
I say your name and
everything lights up.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.120
I think about your name and
I am ready for a voyage.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:47.800
I dream your name and I
awake from a nightmare.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.260
I write your name and
the word love appears.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.620
I call to you and water sprouts
from the desert of my sorrow.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.750 position:56%
I shout your name and you impregnate
the universe with radiance.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:06.160
I fill myself with your name and
there is clean hope in my pathway.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:13.000
You hold me, you kiss
me, and I am alive.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.740
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: This
other poem is also something

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:22.360
that I felt a necessity to
write when I was sick and it's

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.310
to encourage people
to live even though

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:30.340
if they are very depressed
or with a hard pain.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.710
I have had in my life friends
that have commit suicide,

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:41.250
students that come to my
office with this immense pain,

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.370
and at those moments
you realize that --

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.520 position:56%
the moments when you are really sick

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.140
and you realize how
much is important life

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:58.890
and how much you value
life as the biggest present

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.620
that we have in this world.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:06.060
So I wrote this poem to -- to
encourage people to value life

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:11.400
and to forget those
ideas to commit suicide.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.340
Poema para suicidas.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:20.770 position:56%
Atrapa la llama que alumbra tus
orillas y posterga el descenso hacia

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:26.790
el abismo aunque sientas que no hay
dolor más grande que el dolor de

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:31.340
estar vivo ni mayor pesadumbre
que la vida consciente.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:37.670
Un veneno no sacia la
sed de firmamentos.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:44.190 position:56%
No prives de la brisa a tus pulmones
archiva navajas y cuchillos no

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.520
visualices tu sangre a borbotones.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.870
Enciende las luminarias de tu alma.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:56.220 position:56%
Olvida las balas que marcaron
golondrinas con muertes imaginares y

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.360
con el placer que bailas cumbia
o vallenato manda a la muerte a

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.930
pudrirse en las letrinas.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.800
Antes de que emprendas tu regreso,

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:14.690
descubre del cóndor su saber y
serena sin vértigo, sin asco,

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:23.220
ante la carroña de los precipicios,
aprende a navegar en las alturas.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.210
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
For the suicidal.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:35.460 position:56%
Trap the flame that illuminates your
shores and hold back the dissent

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.190
into the abyss even though you
feel there is no pain greater

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:45.710
than the pain of being alive nor
grief heavier than conscious life.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:49.260
Poison does not quench
thirst for the heavens.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.960
Do not deprive your
lungs of the breeze.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.980
File away the razors and knives.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.790 position:56%
Do not visualize your blood gushing.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.710
Light the lamps of your soul.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:05.670
Forget the bullets that branded
the swallows with imaginary deaths.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.210
And with the pleasure with which
you danced the cumbia or vallenato,

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.670
send Death to rot in the latrine.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:18.910
Before you set out on your
return, find the condor's wisdom

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:24.820
and serenely, without vertigo or
disgust, faced with the carrion

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:33.740
of the precipices, learn to
navigate in the highlands.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.890
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández:
Casa de la infancia.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:42.200
Hoy volvé a rodar la lluvia entre
las tejas y salgo del cementerio

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.100
mi abuelita.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.020
Se sentó como siempre
en alumbra de la cocina,

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.710
con la mirada fijen
y ciertos a resuntas,

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:58.030
y yo a tristezas por el cristo
fue que cantaba entre las ramas.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.540
Mi corazón se durmió
bajo las dalias.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.140
Mi ser senté rojo en todo
ese tiempo con las sales

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.420
aurora luminosa.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:14.090
Siempre tengo que volverá la casa
de la infancia [inaudible] fugar en

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:21.760
ese país [inaudible] por esos
caminos que no tienen piedad de

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.500
las viajeras.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: Childhood home.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.750
Today the rain slipped
between the tiles

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.900
and my grandmother hopped
out of the cemetery.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.550
She sat as usual on the
threshold of the kitchen

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:42.000
with her gaze set on
uncertain horizons.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.490
And it rained sorrows for the great
cicadae sitting among the branches.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.400
My heart fell asleep
beneath the dahlias.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.260
My being was interred along
with that time, with the birds

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.300
from some other luminous aurora.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.290
I always have to return
to my childhood home,

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:06.060
to flounder in that deserted
country, on those destroyed paths

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.240
that have no compassion
for travelers.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.810
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández: And
now I'm going to read one poem

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:17.030
that I think is more
actual than ever.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.320
It's La inmigrante
and it's devoted to --

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:25.960
dedicated to all the
immigrant women.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:34.180 position:56%
Mujer que caminas noche y día con
tu llave inmemorial das nacimiento a

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:42.080
la palabra veraz atraviesas el
río y nadie te reconoce, te mojas,

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.350
sudas, pierdes tus zapatos.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.510
Otra jornada abrumada de cansancio,

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.270
no puedes verbalizar tus
injurias pero eres sabia aunque te

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.890
encuentren infraganti.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.570
Te interrogan.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.870
¿Quién eres?

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.660
¿De dónde vienes?

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:04.350
¿Qué buscas en esta tierra que ya
tiene dueños y fronteras y murallas

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:08.230
y hermanos que saben
de la muerte lenta?

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:16.020 position:56%
Al espacio de tu linaje vuelves como
sombra que releo en tu luminosa faz

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:23.130
el fuego no termina escapas,
caes, te levantas, te sacudes,

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:28.800
hablas en tu lengua de tortilla
muerdes tus palabras de café y no

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.080
te dejas derrotar por la nostalgia.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:39.660 position:56%
Tu canto se ahoga, se alejan las
salidas eres inmigrante tu identidad

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.630
se ha reducido para siempre.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:49.070 position:56%
No entiendes de visas ni de planetas
fragmentados aprendes a decir

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:52.070
"good morning" pero
a nadie le interesa

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:57.730 position:56%
"how you are" ni que estés habitada
por un hijo sepultado en el desierto

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:03.990
por el sueño de un empleo de
un refugio para dormir en paz.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:09.470
Yo también soy la ruptura de la
costura aquí adentro no se disipa

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:19.730
la niebla, y me sucede que
miro en tu espejo y me veo.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.580
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
Immigrant woman.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.510
Woman that walks night and day
with your memor -- in memorial key.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.660
You give rise to the true word.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:34.460
You cross the river and
no one acknowledges you.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.650
You get wet, you sweat,
you lose your shoes.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.520
Another day's journey
burdened with exhaustion.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.590
You cannot verbalize your
injuries, but you are wise even

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:49.980
if they catch you red-handed.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.340
They interrogate you.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.640
Who are you?

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.100
Where are you from?

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:58.130 position:56%
What do you want from this land that
already has owners, and borders,

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:02.940
and walls, and brothers
who know about slow death.

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.830
To the place of your lineage
you return like a shadow

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:09.710
that I reread in your
luminous visage.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.170
The fire does not end.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:14.370
You escape, you fall, you get up.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.200
You shake yourself off.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.220
You speak in your tortilla
tongue coffee words.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.260
Do not let nostalgia defeat you.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.890
Your song drowns.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.500
The exits get farther away.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.150
You are in immigrant.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:35.410
Your identity has been
reduced forever.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:40.590
You neither understand about
visas nor fragmented planets.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:46.000 position:56%
You learn to say good morning, but
no one is interested in how you are,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.640
or that you are inhabited by a
son buried in the desert by hope

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.730
of getting a job, of a
refuge to sleep in peace.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.440
I too am the rupture and the scene.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.430
Here inside the fog does not
dissipate and so it happens

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:11.350
that I look at your reflection
in the mirror and I see myself.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:16.000
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández:
Volver a la niñez.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.230
Volver a la niñez, se dice
fácil, al delantal de flores,

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:26.180
al mate rile-rile-ró, al tuntún
del diablo con el tridente al

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.430
hombro, al ángel con
el bastón dorado,

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:33.270
a las madrugadas de
cuatro de la mañana,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:37.110
a visitar los templos
con devoción forzada.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.360
Volver a los juegos de pelota,

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.450
a escalar los montes de los
Andes con frío avaricioso,

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:48.500
cruzar el puente sobre el
ruido infernal de la quebrada,

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.710 position:56%
con un miedo que muerde las agallas.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:56.920
En verdad poco hay de
memorable en todo esto,

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.270
tal vez mi soledad entre la hierba,

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:03.030
el diálogo inconcluso
con los pájaros,

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:07.660 position:56%
y mi permanente envidia de sus alas.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:12.130
Mas para qué toda esta
perorata de nostalgias,

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:18.360 position:56%
si al final sé que soy igual que
el Amazonas o el Potomac que siempre

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.460
van y nunca pueden volver
a su punto de partida.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.630
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni:
Back to childhood.

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:35.270
Back to childhood, it's easily
said, to the flowery apron,

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:40.120
to mate rile-rile-ró, to the
beat of the devil with a pitchfork

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.820
on his shoulder, to the
angel with the golden staff,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.730
to the early starts
at 4 in the morning,

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:49.930
visiting temples with
forced devotion.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:54.270
Back to ball games, to
climbing the Andes mountains

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:59.330
in the grasping cold, to crossing
the bridge over the inferno noise

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.000
of the gorge, with fear
gnawing at our insides.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.390
Honestly, little of
this is memorable.

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:12.640
Perhaps just my loneliness in the
grass, my inconclusive dialogue

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:18.080
with the birds, and my
permanent envy of their wings.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.850
But why all this nostalgic
sing-songing

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.990
if in the end I know I'm just
like the Amazon o r the Potomac

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:31.370
that always flow and never
return to their starting point.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.240
&gt;&gt; Consuelo Hernández:
And I'm going to conclude

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.260
with this poem for my parents.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.600
I am also an orphan already
and this is already sad poem,

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.070
but I want to read it here.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.370
Te fuiste.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:51.780
Te fuiste a mitad de
la cosecha de verano,

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.420
entraste a casa del silencio.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.260
Todas las palabras recogiste.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:04.390
No dejaste con la mirada húmeda y
el corazón luchando contra pelo.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:10.490
Que triste aquella noche contigo
hasta alba sin oírte pronunciar

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.500
una palabra.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:18.980 position:56%
Te miraba y desde la eternidad de mi
sonreías con tus ojos cerrados de

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:24.170
ternura y tu andar
detenido por siempre.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:27.740
Repetí tu nombre hasta
el cansancio.

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:34.360 position:56%
Los momentos que pasamos conversando
y te vivirte como estatua en mi

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.620
misma me habitadas.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:44.530
Hoy en el reino del insomnios estás
aquí suavizando mi dolor con tu

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:49.520
pecho generoso y tus
últimas palabras:

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.970
Hija mía que Dios me la bendiga.

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.400
&gt;&gt; Maureen Contreni: You went away.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.360
You went away in the middle
of the summer harvest.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.600
You entered the house of silence.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.400
You gathered up all your words.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.610
With a damp look, you left us

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:13.870
with our hearts struggling
against the tide.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.570
Such an unhappy night
with you until dawn,

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.640
not hearing you utter one word.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.430
I looked at you and you smiled
back at me from eternity.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:26.580
With your closed eyes
and tenderness,

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.940
your movement stopped forever.

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.400
I repeated your name to exhaustion,
the times we spent talking.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.500
I saw you rise up like
a statue inside me.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.520
You inhabited me.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:46.110
Today in the kingdom of insomnia
you are here softening my pain,

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:50.510
with your generous chest,
and your last words:

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:55.510
God bless you, my daughter.

00:57:55.510 --> 00:58:05.790
[ Applause ]

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:07.210
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez:
That was just beautiful.
