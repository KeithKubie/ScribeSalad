Hi, everybody, and welcome to the first lesson

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.970
of the Software Engineering Course. In this introductory lesson

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.820
I will first provide an overview of the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.100
whole course and then try to answer two important

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.630
questions about software engineering, which are, what is

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.310
software engineering and why do we need it? And

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370
to spice up the content a bit I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.480
will also interview several experts in the software engineering

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.080
field from both academia and industry and ask them these

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.410
very questions. So without any further ado, let's begin the lesson.
