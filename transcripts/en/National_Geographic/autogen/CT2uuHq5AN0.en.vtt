with a cooling tower and together they
 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.940
with a cooling tower and together they
generate power for about two million

ready to take out the old rotor this is
 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.810
ready to take out the old rotor this is
going to be tricky because one end of

going to be tricky because one end of
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.490
going to be tricky because one end of

we got a plan time to rock and roll

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820
we got a plan time to rock and roll
 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.510

there's also a really tight fit so we're

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520
there's also a really tight fit so we're
 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.190
there's also a really tight fit so we're
gonna have to lift really slowly in the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200
gonna have to lift really slowly in the
 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.380
gonna have to lift really slowly in the
first couple feet to get it picked out

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390
first couple feet to get it picked out
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.640

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.050
finally it's level that's close enough

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060
finally it's level that's close enough
 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.699
finally it's level that's close enough
to pick it out

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709
to pick it out
 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.949
to pick it out
and they wrap it up to trap in any

it's a beautiful piece of steel now this
 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.430
it's a beautiful piece of steel now this
is pretty significant engineering feat I

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440
is pretty significant engineering feat I

mean they're trying to locate this thing

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820
mean they're trying to locate this thing
 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.689

within three dimensions it's easy to get

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699
within three dimensions it's easy to get
 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.570
within three dimensions it's easy to get
it off kilter and scar the sides and if

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580
it off kilter and scar the sides and if
 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.310
it off kilter and scar the sides and if
they scar it it's got to come out

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320
they scar it it's got to come out
 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.279
they scar it it's got to come out
there's no option for failure here

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289
there's no option for failure here

yeah it's a high-tension moment yeah

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759
yeah it's a high-tension moment yeah
 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.439
yeah it's a high-tension moment yeah
because this is if something drastic is

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449
because this is if something drastic is
 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.040
because this is if something drastic is
wrong

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050

now's the time it's gonna show itself so

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600
now's the time it's gonna show itself so
 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.990
now's the time it's gonna show itself so
they'll go to the hardware store for

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000
they'll go to the hardware store for
 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.620
they'll go to the hardware store for
another one of these

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630
 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.230
nice the turbine rotor is finally in

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
nice the turbine rotor is finally in
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.460
nice the turbine rotor is finally in
position it's almost time to put on the

last two pieces they discovered that the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790
last two pieces they discovered that the
 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.730
last two pieces they discovered that the
new inner casing was just a little too

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740
new inner casing was just a little too
 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.310
new inner casing was just a little too
big to fit inside the outer casing so it

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320
big to fit inside the outer casing so it
 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:04.149
big to fit inside the outer casing so it
has to be pared down by just a bit

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159
 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.369
it's soon ready to go on to the Roda a

the watch works now we just put the back

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139
the watch works now we just put the back
 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.449
the watch works now we just put the back
on and then we'll be able to start it up

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:43.459
on and then we'll be able to start it up
