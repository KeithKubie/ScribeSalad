00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.677
- [Instructor] In which picture is the cow

00:00:02.677 --> 00:00:07.215
beside the little chicken
here, the little chick?

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.092
Choose one answer.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.592
So which one do you think it is?

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:14.207
Well, over here, they
aren't beside each other.

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:15.630
Over here, they are.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.246
So I would pick choice B.

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.329
Let's do another example.

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:24.437
Which elephant is behind the bricks?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.306
Think about it.

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:29.556
Which one is behind the bricks, A or B?

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:34.104
Well, in choice A, the elephant
is in front of the bricks.

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:35.820
It's in choice B that the elephant

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.775
it looks like it's
hiding behind the bricks

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:39.323
just sneaking around.

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:41.895
Alright, I'm gonna go with choice B.

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.062
Let's do one more example.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:49.954
Which shape is below this
green rectangle over here?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.535
So if I look over here,
this is our green rectangle

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.660
and which one is below it?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.429
Well, we see this red triangle.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.596
So this is below the green
triangle and we are done.
