00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.930
Epic Trailers of Disappointing Movies

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.120
We all know that movie trailers have one purpose:
to sell us on the idea of paying to see a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.930
movie! And since all�s fair in war and advertising,
movie trailers put their best, most exciting

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.700
foot forward, no matter how much remixing
is done to make them look amazing.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.570
In the case of the films on this list, their
trailers were much more interesting, entertaining,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:43.630
and in some cases moving than the actual full-length
film.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.630
Watchmen

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.680
Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons� acclaimed graphic
novel Watchmen had been through so many failed

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
movie attempts that for a long time it was
deemed �unfilmable.� When the full-length

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.680
trailer was released for the Zac Snyder adaptation
in 2009, fans went wild over how the visuals

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.350
looked like they were lifted right out of
the comic book, while the haunting soundtrack

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.680
perfectly captured the dark and bleak tone
of the Watchmen story.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.600
�.Unfortunately, when Watchmen finally hit
theaters it was nearly 3 hours long; with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600
some questionable performances, a jarring
�80s pop-song soundtrack; and a controversial

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.840
change to the ending. Comic book fans learned
the hard way that having source material translated

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.410
directly to the screen does not always result
in a great comic book movie.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.410
Cloverfield

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.759
A good mystery often draws people into the
theater, and producer J.J. Abrams, writer

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.920
Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves used
a veil of mystery and a hint of epic peril

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.940
to sell their 2008 found-footage monster movie,
Cloverfield.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.060
It may be fair to look back and see this trailer
as a cheap ploy that played off post-9/11

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.150
fears (or copied another film on this list),
but it worked; Cloverfield lured a lot of

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.010
people into the drive-through to see the monster
show. Too bad the movie itself was also a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.190
painful lesson about why the found-footage
movie format may not be the best trend Hollywood

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.990
ever came up with.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.340
Terminator Salvation

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.309
Terminator Salvation was scrutinized from
the moment it went into production, and the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.909
stories that surround it are still talked
about today (that Christian Bale on-set rant

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:39.000
anyone?) But somehow, out of that storm of
scrutiny, doubt, and uncertainty, emerged

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.239
�what is arguably one of the best blockbuster
movie trailers ever cut together.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.950
From the darkly beautiful music to the gritty
futuristic world, thrilling action and intriguing

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.889
sci-fi concepts, this trailer did everything
right in selling a new vision of the Terminator

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.580
franchise. When Terminator Salvation finally
hit theatres, it quickly became clear that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.279
the studio had loaded all of the best moments
from the movie into the trailer. The full-length

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.319
film was pretty forgettable - and ironically,
the trailer, for all its epicness, spoils

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:18.450
what is arguably the best twist in the movie.
So much hype, for so little payoff.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.249
Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.799
One of the biggest movie events of a generation
happened when George Lucas announced that

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.879
he would end the 20th century with the release
of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.069
in 1999. All the world was buzzing for the
prequel story of how Anakin Skywalker fell

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.180
to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader, and
when the first trailer arrived, it seemed

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.819
as though Lucas would deliver the magic all
over again.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.900
The first trailer teased us with heroes, a
fearsome villain, epic lightsaber duels, space

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.549
battles, and an air of ominous mystery hanging
over it all. Everything we could want from

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.379
a new Star Wars adventure.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.799
By now, debate over the Star Wars prequels
has gone on so long that it�s pointless

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.849
to try and sway opinions one way or the other.
However, one thing I think everyone can agree

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:17.199
on: The Phantom Menace trailer in no way prepares
you for the abomination that is Jar Jar Binks.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:24.020
Tron: Legacy

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.699
The 1982 film Tron looks incredibly dated
now - and its ideas about technology may seem

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.590
even more dated - but at the time of its release,
Tron�s visual effects pushed the boundaries

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.910
of film technology closer to what we see today.
Twenty-something years later, we got our first

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.560
look at Tron: Legacy, and at first it seemed
like the wait had been worth it.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.419
We had Jeff Bridges back as both his character
from the original - and as a younger, villainous

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.639
program version of himself and like so many
other entries on this list, the musical score

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.121
just elevated the footage to a whole new level.
For all the hype built by the trailers, the

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:03.770
actual film would turn out to be somewhat
mundane, undercooked, and filled with clear

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.960
signs of director Joseph Kosinski�s inexperience.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960
Pearl Harbor

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.610
Before Michael Bay ever put his hands on the
Transformers franchise, he attempted to tell

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.840
the story of one of the most tragic and heroic
days in American history, with a cast of stars

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.219
like Cuba Gooding Jr., Ben Affleck and Kate
Beckinsale helping to bring history to life,

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.810
and when the Pearl Harbor teaser trailer hit,
audiences were instantly moved by what they

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.810
saw. �

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.469
Based on the trailer, people thought Pearl
Harbor would be some kind of awards -worthy

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.939
war drama; instead, they got over 3 hours
of Michael Bay�s signature combination of

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.169
overblown effects work and under developed
story. In the end, this was a failed ode to

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.719
an important piece of US history.

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:49.719
Godzilla

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.940
You could never prove it in court, but Cloverfield�s
successful teaser trailer seems all-too-similar

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.500
to what the 1998 Godzilla trailer did: A normal
everyday event in NYC suddenly turns into

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.460
a disaster-level event with the emergence
of a large - but mostly unseen - monster.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.300
Then again, it�s a trick that worked twice,
so why cry foul?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.990
Ronald Emmerich�s version of Godzilla stunk
so bad that the Japanese creators of the character

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.600
had his version of the monster officially
reprinted under a different name, �Zilla.�

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.830
If that doesn�t say how bad this movie was,
nothing will. Nonetheless, that teaser was

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.949
so good that to this day, we still can�t
walk by a NYC pier on a rainy day without

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:38.340
looking at the water, wondering� �

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.340
Sucker Punch

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.689
It�s not a coincidence that Zack Snyder
appears on this list more than once - it seems

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.819
that telling cinematic stories in the span
of a trailer works out much better for him

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.770
than sustaining a full-length movie.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.840
The trailer for 2011�s Sucker Punch had
two impeccable song choices, not to mention

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.919
a whole lot of visual flare and gorgeous actresses
kicking ass. In the end though, Snyder never

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.539
really pulled his ideas for the film together
well enough, and the result was a messy (and

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.830
even controversial) reception.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.830
Iron Man 3

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.349
Fresh of the crazy success of 2012�s The
Avengers, the trailer for Marvel�s Iron

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:23.100
Man 3 looked great. War Machine (now called
Iron Patriot) was back, the superhero action

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.539
looked better than ever, there were Iron Man
suits galore, �and iconic Iron Man nemesis

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:33.349
The Mandarin was being played by Oscar-winner
Ben Kingsley. Many expected this to be the

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.039
Dark Knight of Iron Man films.

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:39.909
But when the movie came out, the joke was
on fans. Tony Stark was onscreen more than

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:45.090
Iron Man; Kingsley�s Mandarin was literally
a joke character; and that gallery of Iron

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.879
Man suits never really got their due. Even
if you were in the camp that enjoyed it, Iron

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:56.809
Man 3 just did not live up to the dark, brooding
superhero action flick the trailer sold.

00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:04.960
That�s it for our list, but we�re sure
