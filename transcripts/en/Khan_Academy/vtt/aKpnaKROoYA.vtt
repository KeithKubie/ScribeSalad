00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Narrator] We've talked about the idea

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.740
of average total cost in
several videos so far,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.510
where it was the sum of
your average variable cost

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.960
and your average fixed cost.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.780
But when we're talking about
fixed costs, by definition,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.370
that means we're talking
about things in the short run.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.840
Remember, the short run is
defined as the amount of time

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.140
over which at least one
of your inputs is fixed.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410
But if we talk about longer term,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.440
so let's say you're running a factory,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.370
and, in the short run,
the short run would be

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.310
how long it takes to build another factory

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.350
or how long it takes to close
down or sell another factory.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.300
But in the long run,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
you can always add more
factories or shut down factories.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.380
So in the long run,
everything is variable.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.690
So what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.310
is think about how the average total cost

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.160
that we've studied in previous videos,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.570
which were actually short-run
average total costs,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.490
how those relate to the
long-run average total cost.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.920
So let's imagine that we are trying

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.400
to open up a food truck business.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.050
And let's say that each food truck,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.460
so each food truck, and let's
say we're going to sell tacos,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.450
so these are taco food trucks.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.980
And so each food truck can optimally,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.393
optimally, I'll just write it like that,

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.670
serve 100 tacos

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.840
per day.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.870
And we haven't started our business yet,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.790
but we have to decide how
many food trucks to buy.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.550
And we do some market research,
and we feel pretty confident

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.510
that we are going to be able
to sell 200 tacos per day.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.660
So we're going to target,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.550
target 200 tacos,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.090
tacos per day.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.470
Now, in this world,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.020
what you would want to do
is optimize your fixed cost

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.720
to minimize your average total cost

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.680
for 200 tacos per day.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800
Remember, your fixed cost
is essentially going to be,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.090
let's say it's just your food truck,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.320
and then you're going
to have a variable cost.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130
It might be the staff
that's making the tacos.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.540
It might be the supplies for
the tacos, things like that.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.290
And so you might have an
average total cost curve

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.610
that looks like this.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.603
So let me make some axes here.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.120
So this is going to be
quantity of tacos per day,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.210
quantity

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.990
of tacos.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.810
This is going to be per day.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.570
And then in the vertical axis,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.990
this is going to be cost per taco,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.740
cost per taco.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.450
And let's say since you're
optimizing for 200 tacos today,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.730
you want to minimize your cost
per taco, 200 tacos per day,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.310
that happens with two food trucks.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.170
So if we're at 200 tacos per day,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.270
let me put it right over
there, 200 tacos per day,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.100
we get to a cost per taco,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.380
average total cost per taco.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.830
Let's say that is 50 cents.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.210
So that is 50 cents right over there.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.400
But the actual number of sales,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.090
the actual number of
tacos that you might have

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.770
to produce in a given
day, might vary from that,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.010
and that will actually help construct your

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.660
average total cost curve.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.660
And so your average total cost curve

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.970
might look something like this.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.840
It might look,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.350
might look something like this.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.390
We've seen curves like this in the past,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.370
and we would have call this
our average total cost.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.510
But now because we're differentiating

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.040
between our short run and long run,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.060
let's make this very clear.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.400
This is our short-run average total cost,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.590
and this is a situation where we have two

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.660
of our food trucks per day,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.360
two food trucks.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.510
Now, what if instead of 200 tacos per day,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.350
it ends up that we only have
to produce 100 tacos per day

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.220
because that's how many
people are demanding?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.880
So let's say this is 100 right over here.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.900
Well, if we keep the number
of trucks we have constant,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.200
so we don't change our fixed cost,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.650
well, then our cost per
taco is going to be higher.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.810
Let's say that this right over here is,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.970
let's say this is 70 cents,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.940
70 cents

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.640
per taco.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.440
And then there's the other scenario.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.980
Let's say that our tacos
sell better than expected.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.700
Let's say that we need to somehow
produce 300 tacos per day.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.520
Well, if we can't change our fixed cost,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.090
which is, by definition,
what the short run is,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.400
well, then we might be
at, say, this point.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280
It looks like it would be about,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.840
let's just call that 80 cents,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840
80 cents

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.060
per taco as our short-run
average total cost.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.420
Now, in either of these
situations, let's say that

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.260
we have the more pessimistic
scenario actually happens,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.150
that there's only demand
for 100 tacos per day.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.870
Well, in that world, the
rational thing would be,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.290
hey, let's sell one of those trucks.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.250
We're only at 50% utilization
at 100 tacos per day.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.280
Let's sell one of those trucks

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.720
to lower our average total cost.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.260
And so in the long run, you
can adjust your fixed cost,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.610
so with one truck, with a
curve that looks like this.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.270
So at 100,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.960
at 100 tacos per day,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.320
our costs are 60 cents

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.193
per taco.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.910
And the curve might look something like,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.970
something like this.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.330
So if things were to get
even worse than that,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.410
our cost would go up.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.430
And if for some reason the
market were to actually go back

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.120
to what we expected or even beyond,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.820
then our cost would go even higher.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.720
So this cost curve, which
is based on one truck,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.460
so let me call this our
short-run average total cost,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.970
and this is for one truck,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.110
this would be suboptimal if
we actually do have 200 sold,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.740
200 units being produced a day

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.930
or 300 units produced per day.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.990
But it is optimal for 100 units per day.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.880
Now, things could go the other way.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.500
Well, you might start
with those two trucks

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.930
that are optimal for 200 units
per day, 200 tacos per day.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.040
But you're in the world

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.400
where people want to
buy 300 tacos per day,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.150
and 300 tacos with two
trucks is not optimal.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.810
So in the long run, you
order another truck,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.920
and maybe it takes a couple
of months for it to show up

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.340
and be outfitted and whatever.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.220
But once you get that third truck,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.190
now you can optimally
serve 300 tacos per day.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.470
And so you might be in this situation.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.620
So at,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.270
if you get another truck,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.930
you could have another short-run
average total cost curve

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.450
that looks something like
this right over here.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.310
So this is our short-run
average total cost curve,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.620
and so this is when we have three trucks.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.540
And remember, the short run is

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.630
when at least one of your inputs is fixed.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.470
And in this one, for the simplified model,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.600
we're assuming that input is the truck,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.210
that everything else
is a variable expense.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.630
Now, when you look at this,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.500
it helps us think about a
long-run average total cost.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.820
What would that be?

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.330
Well, in the long run,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.580
we can change the number
of trucks we have.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.720
And if we can, in the long run,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.640
we can change the number
of trucks we have,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.420
we would always be picking
the optimal number of trucks

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.280
for the quantity we're producing.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.670
So in the long run, we would
want to be at that point.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.200
So if there's only 100 that
we need to produce a day,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.660
we would only use one truck.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.200
If there's 200 produced a day,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.180
we would use two trucks
and be at that point.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.470
If we need to produce 300,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.890
we would have three trucks
and be on that point.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.400
And so your long-run
average total cost curve

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.010
would be connecting these dots,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.910
and so it would look something,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.380
it would look something like this.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.880
And some of you might be thinking, well,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.760
but this situation right over here is

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.410
where you have 1 1/2 trucks.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.660
What's the deal with that?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.610
But in the long run,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.850
you might be able to
get a custom truck size

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.434
that is 1 1/2 times as
big as your typical truck

00:08:02.434 --> 00:08:05.370
or 2 1/2 times as big
as your typical truck.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.710
But the big takeaway here is

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.280
that your long-run
average total cost curve

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.640
you can view as the envelope
of all of the minimum points

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.360
of all of your various short-run
average total cost curve.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.110
Because at any given,
for any given quantity,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.170
you want to optimize your fixed cost,

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.610
which puts you at the minimum point

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.533
of one of these short-run
average total cost curves.
