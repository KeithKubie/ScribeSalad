00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.745
(soft whooshing)

00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:04.412
(light beeping)

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:09.438
(lighthearted rhythmic music)

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:32.750
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.148
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:37.127
of International Studies.

00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:39.706
Our guest today is Dr. Harold Smith.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.008
Dr. Smith holds the
appointment of distinguished

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.527
resident scholar with the
Institute of Governmental Studies

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.749
at the University of
California at Berkeley,

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.210
where he focuses on the
impact of technology

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.671
on foreign and defense policy.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.025
He received his PhD from the Massachusetts

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:59.192
Institute of Technology,
served as Professor of

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.266
Nuclear Engineering at the
University of California

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.128
Berkeley, and served as
Assistant Secretary of Defense

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:07.287
in the Clinton Administration.

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.805
He serves as an Advisor
to prime contractors,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.406
(mumbles) tanks, and
national laboratories.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.688
Dr. Smith is a fellow of the
American Physical Society

00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:20.366
and a Commander in the
legion of honor of France.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:24.200
He has trice received the
highest honor granted by

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.322
the Department of
Defense for Civil Service

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:30.326
the distinguished Public Service Award.

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.446
Harold, welcome to our program.

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:33.903
- A pleasure to be here, Harry.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:36.963
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.547
- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:42.130
born in a very small
city to the Southeast.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:47.083
Moved early in my high
school years to Bellevue,

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.243
Pennsylvania, first suburb out the Ohio,

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:54.993
a very solid middle class suburb,

00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:00.042
and we were very solid
middle class family,

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:02.457
which I should add right now

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:05.153
was a strong republican (mumbles).

00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:08.119
- And what got you interested
in science and math?

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.954
- I think genetically it was always there,

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.121
but the key event that
sparked a love of mathematics

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:21.021
that I have to this day
was the father of the girl

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.470
I was dating.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.972
He happened to be one of
the finest high school

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:32.354
mathematics teachers in
the city of Pittsburgh.

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:36.231
And I would take his very
lovely daughter, Mary Lou,

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.398
to the movies.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.146
We did things like that then.

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:41.473
(man laughing)

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.370
And Mr. Horner was waiting
for me when we came home.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.127
All of that was quite
normal in those days.

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:51.729
And Mr. Horner knew that
I did well in mathematics

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.621
and had a few questions for me and

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:58.683
we would start to talk,
and talk, and talk.

00:02:58.683 --> 00:03:01.860
And finally, Mary Lou went to bed and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.582
Mr. Horner and I continued
talking about mathematicians,

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:07.464
mathematics, I was fascinated.

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.862
- So, he wasn't interested
in your intentions as much

00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:12.567
mentoring you in mathematics.
(man laughing)

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.163
- That's exactly right,

00:03:14.163 --> 00:03:16.305
but my parents didn't see it that way.

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.583
When I would arrive home
from a movie night at 1:00

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:22.654
in the morning, there was
a lot of explaining to do.

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:25.036
- So then, where did you
do your undergraduate work

00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:26.363
and your PhD?

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:29.030
- MIT, MIT, MIT, all my degrees.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.242
- And what did you major
in as an undergraduate?

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:34.919
- As an undergraduate I was going to be

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.377
a captain of industry,
so I started in business,

00:03:38.377 --> 00:03:41.621
I had a Stone National Scholarship,

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:46.336
a very generous scholarship,
otherwise I would've

00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:49.308
never gone to a place
as prestigious as MIT.

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:52.332
I soon learned that
mathematics was more important

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.891
than accounting and
shifted to the extent that

00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:59.719
time and curriculum was allow
to mechanical engineering

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.362
(mumbles) physics option.

00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:05.529
- And then in graduate school,
what was your work there?

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.357
- The Tonic Energy Commission,
now the Department of Energy,

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:14.524
had just initiated nuclear
energy technology fellowships.

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:19.567
I was fortunate to get
one and that supported

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:21.831
the three years that I
needed to get the PhD

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:24.129
in nuclear engineering.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.864
- And what were your
interests beyond physics,

00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:31.281
as you were doing your dissertation work?

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:34.684
- In preparing for my doctoral exam,

00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:39.585
everyone needs a break
and, of course, I did, too.

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:42.918
So, I read War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.765
And I did pass the doctoral exam,

00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:52.205
but I became fascinated
with Russian literature.

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:55.450
And about the same time, the
Boston Symphony Orchestra

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.617
provided very inexpensive
tickets to their open rehearsals

00:05:00.547 --> 00:05:03.205
and I began to go to those and

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:05.527
a lot of Russian music was played.

00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:09.849
So, I developed a love of
Russian culture, history,

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.281
literature, and then when
I came to Cal, of course,

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.998
I met Nicholas Riasanovsky.

00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:21.205
And as far as I'm concerned,
had written the definitive

00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:24.704
history of Russia, and I read his history,

00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:28.097
then I had the great
pleasure of meeting Nicky.

00:05:28.097 --> 00:05:29.101
(men laughing)

00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:32.713
- And so, in a way, you
were preparing for a future

00:05:32.713 --> 00:05:36.055
that you didn't know yet would happen,

00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:38.897
I'm talking now about
the Russian part of your

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:40.256
self education.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.100
- You're absolutely right,
it was all serendipity.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.214
- And then, what was your dissertation on,

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:48.190
and what was important
in that dissertation

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.746
that added another piece to this puzzle?

00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:53.422
- Well, that's a very
good question because

00:05:53.422 --> 00:05:57.386
the jargon of the day if one
wants to describe something

00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:01.624
as difficult, you say, well,
it isn't rocket science,

00:06:01.624 --> 00:06:06.102
implying of course that
rocket science is difficult.

00:06:06.102 --> 00:06:09.467
And in my case, the title of my thesis was

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:12.584
The Dynamics in Control
of Nuclear Rocket Engines.

00:06:12.584 --> 00:06:14.481
So, I am not only a rocket scientist,

00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.142
I am a nuclear rocket scientist.

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:20.725
But those fields, to
jump ahead as you did,

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:26.623
were extremely important and
valued by the Russian elite,

00:06:26.623 --> 00:06:28.422
certainly the intelligence.

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:31.920
So, in a same sense as
you said previously,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.474
it was a running start into
what the Russians like.

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:40.895
- And your work with the
Russians will become very

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:45.513
important shortly, but you
also were making use of

00:06:45.513 --> 00:06:49.052
the insights of a Russian mathematician

00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:50.195
in the work that you were doing.

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:54.154
- Yes, when I came to Cal,
I continued work in dynamics

00:06:54.154 --> 00:06:58.209
in control of interesting nuclear systems.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.376
And I, one of the papers
that I'm most pleased with

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.981
is based on the theorems of Pontryagin,

00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:11.176
a blind Russian
mathematician, early 1900's.

00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:15.343
And his theorems allowed
me to solve a problem that,

00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:20.942
modestly, even Farmian Vignor
couldn't solve, analytically.

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.686
They solved it with
very clever engineering

00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:28.880
and that worked, but in this case,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.627
I optimized the situation
and I could not have done it

00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:34.938
without Pontryagin's theorems.

00:07:34.938 --> 00:07:38.164
- So, after getting your
degree, you come to Cal

00:07:38.164 --> 00:07:40.677
and you are a Professor in

00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:42.099
the Nuclear Engineering Department.

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.099
- Right.

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:46.819
- So, how do we understand
the movement from

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:50.569
Berkeley to Washington,
because after serving

00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:55.879
at Cal for almost a
decade, you decided to move

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.212
to a new career.

00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:02.216
- Not quite, I took a
sabbatical after six years

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:06.514
on the faculty, and was
fortunate enough to win

00:08:06.514 --> 00:08:11.118
a White House fellowship,
which of course took me

00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:12.558
to Washington for a year.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.658
Johnson was President.

00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:18.271
I asked to be assigned to Robert McNamara,

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:21.461
each fellow was assigned
to a different department.

00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:24.198
So, I had the pleasure of working with,

00:08:24.198 --> 00:08:28.058
or at least reporting
to, Secretary McNamara.

00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:31.060
That was an eye opening experience and

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.338
showed to me there's a
real place, a real need,

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:38.421
for people in academia to participate

00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:42.902
in the real world of Washington DC.

00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:47.282
- And to work for McNamara
and with his whiz kids

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:50.480
must have really been exciting.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.566
- To say the least, and very rewarding.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:58.161
Those friendships, Johnny
Foster being one of them,

00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:01.580
the former director of Livermore,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.998
and then the Director of Events
Research and Engineering,

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:06.703
really took me under his wing

00:09:06.703 --> 00:09:11.042
and gave me some wonderfully
interesting assignments.

00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:14.142
- And so, you wound up
staying in Washington

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.309
and going into consulting.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:21.082
- I did come back to Cal, but shortly,

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:25.249
shortly thereafter, I actually
retired from the faculty

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.422
and pursued high level
management consulting

00:09:32.422 --> 00:09:35.511
in the aerospace industry,
as well as some start ups

00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:38.538
that (mumbles) worked out very well.

00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:41.917
- And I always like to ask my guests what

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:45.534
they see as the skills and temperament

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:47.951
involved in the work they do.

00:09:49.034 --> 00:09:53.117
So, you are both a scientist,
you're something of

00:09:54.507 --> 00:09:58.174
a mathematician, and
then you wound up doing

00:10:00.824 --> 00:10:04.991
consulting work and working
on policy in Washington.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.689
So, what's the answer there?

00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:11.367
What did you learn in the
process of these different

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:14.743
vocations and what skills in retrospect

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:16.979
do you see as really important?

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:18.488
- It's a good question, Harry.

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:22.655
I think what I learned the
most (mumbles) as a Professor

00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:27.686
teaching mostly graduate students was that

00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:31.718
once you'd listen, these graduate students

00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:33.543
are very intelligent people.

00:10:33.543 --> 00:10:38.280
And their questions and
their comments are worth it.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.486
Furthermore, you don't bluff
with graduate students,

00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:44.169
just tell it as it is.

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:46.149
If you know it, explain it.

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:48.167
If you don't know it,
say you don't know it

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:50.342
and go back and get the answer.

00:10:50.342 --> 00:10:54.160
That really works in the world
of high level consulting.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.545
These CEO's or Vice Presidents,

00:10:57.545 --> 00:11:01.960
they wanna talk and
they want your reaction.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.201
They don't need my
solution to their problems,

00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:07.004
they need a sounding board,

00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:09.442
a way to think through their problems.

00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:12.641
So, what I learned
teaching in graduate school

00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:16.040
was an enormous help, I found,
in the world of consulting.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.978
- But what about creativity
in that kind of work

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:23.061
and policy circles, or in consulting?

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:27.715
In other words, is it the
interplay of listening

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:30.256
and thinking, getting reactions?

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.673
What help you come up with new solutions?

00:11:35.501 --> 00:11:36.917
- Another good question, Harry.

00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:41.000
What's going on, of course,
a consultant comes in

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.511
from the outside, doesn't
know the airplane industry,

00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:51.874
or any other industry all that well,

00:11:51.874 --> 00:11:56.128
certainly not compared to the
people that he's advising,

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:59.968
but that means I bring in a
new way of looking at things

00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:03.425
so that I could be creative
in the sense of asking

00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:07.527
some very stupid questions,
but also some questions

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:10.424
that they hadn't thought
of because they live

00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:12.700
in their world and I live in mine,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.541
and two came together,
quite often, very nicely.

00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:21.320
- So, as you're in Washington
now, the Cold War is still

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.114
going on, you were
something of a cold warrior.

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:27.687
And I don't mean that
in a pejorative sense,

00:12:27.687 --> 00:12:31.375
but in the sense that
you were focused a lot on

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:34.458
American security, on defense issues,

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:40.413
and you actually were chairman
of a scientific committee

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:44.388
to examine the vulnerability
of nuclear weapons.

00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:47.805
Tell us about nuclear weapons themselves.

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:51.503
Tell us about that role.

00:12:51.503 --> 00:12:56.366
- The Defense Science Board
had a number of task forces,

00:12:56.366 --> 00:12:58.146
but one of the most important was

00:12:58.146 --> 00:13:02.121
the Vulnerability Task
Force, just as you said.

00:13:02.121 --> 00:13:05.086
That was an assembly of about a dozen top

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:09.570
level physicists, all of us
had the right clearances.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.129
And we would investigate
ways that the Russians

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:18.296
might be trying to eliminate
our strategic advantage.

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:24.191
We even went so far as to
invent ways for the Russians

00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:26.524
to put us at a disadvantage.

00:13:27.863 --> 00:13:32.042
And we reported to then
Deputy Secretary Packard,

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:33.946
he was in the Nixon administration.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:37.044
And some of the ideas that we explored,

00:13:37.044 --> 00:13:40.602
some of the ideas that came
to us through intelligence

00:13:40.602 --> 00:13:42.703
were not all that comforting.

00:13:42.703 --> 00:13:46.283
So, over the decade that
I chaired this committee,

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:50.283
I became a real cold
warrior, I certainly didn't

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:54.384
trust the Russians, and I had ample

00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:56.381
reason to not trust them.

00:13:56.381 --> 00:14:00.465
So, in that sense, I was a
free (mumbles) cold warrior.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:04.249
- And to what extent in the
consulting job in this work

00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:08.082
does the mindset of a
scientist really enhance

00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:13.796
your ability to do these tests?

00:14:14.931 --> 00:14:16.333
- That's a...

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.749
I'll stop complimenting you, Harry.

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:18.753
(men laughing)

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:20.454
But it is a good questions.

00:14:20.454 --> 00:14:24.111
Science is a very linear way of thinking.

00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:25.278
A, B, C, D, E.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.490
No distractions, so
that we would focus on a

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.157
particular problem and solve it,

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.024
or at least know the ramifications.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:43.623
We didn't have to factor in
all of the political aspects

00:14:43.623 --> 00:14:47.370
of how would he react to
that or she react to this.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.831
It was strictly scientific
thinking and then,

00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.998
of course, good expression afterwards.

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:00.386
- Time passes and you wind up joining

00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:02.805
the Clinton administration.

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.446
How did you come to work
for the Defense Department

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:09.279
under President Clinton,
then Secretary Perry?

00:15:12.096 --> 00:15:13.456
- In the course of this consulting,

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:17.347
and certainly with the
Vulnerability Task Force,

00:15:17.347 --> 00:15:18.764
I met Bill Perry.

00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:24.084
Dr. Perry was the Under
Secretary for Acquisition

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:31.285
in the Carter administration,
and when that administration

00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:35.452
came to an end, Dr. Perry
began building his team,

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.829
waiting for the next
democratic presidency.

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:43.231
He had to wait quite a while.

00:15:43.231 --> 00:15:47.757
But I was a member of that
team, I didn't know it,

00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:50.248
but Bill was recruiting
people to work with him

00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:54.210
if and when a democratic became President.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.614
- So, a sort of shadow government.

00:15:55.614 --> 00:15:57.571
- A shadow government,
very good way to put it,

00:15:57.571 --> 00:16:00.990
and very good people, John
Deutch, Paul Kaminski,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.706
Ash Carter, they were
all, without knowing it,

00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:08.789
we were all on the team,
which meant that when we

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:12.691
initiated our efforts in
the Clinton administration,

00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:14.152
we were on the ground running.

00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:16.273
We knew each other and trusted each other,

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:19.566
we knew our spheres of
intelligence, accuracy.

00:16:19.566 --> 00:16:21.311
It was a good start.

00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:24.728
- And so, when you took an appointment in

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:29.650
the Clinton administration,
what was your official title?

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.924
You were an Assistant Secretary for?

00:16:32.924 --> 00:16:35.124
- Defense for Nuclear, Chemical,

00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:39.291
and Biological Defense Systems,
weapons of mass destruction.

00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:44.760
It was a wonderful portfolio
and included responsibility

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:50.025
for the safety and security
of the nuclear stockpile,

00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:54.305
except for those weapons in
control of the commanders.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.309
Destruction of our own chemical weapons

00:16:57.309 --> 00:17:00.611
through the (mumbles) Program,
which I hope we discuss,

00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:04.430
the Russian chemical
weapons, making sure we were

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.847
ready for biological warfare if it came.

00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:09.769
And as time went on, Dr.
Perry asked me to take

00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:14.267
on things like counter
proliferation because

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:18.434
of the possible spread of
nuclear weapons, et cetera.

00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:21.887
As one of my deputy's put it,

00:17:21.887 --> 00:17:24.691
it was a very eclectic portfolio.

00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:27.441
- So, time passes and comes 1989,

00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:33.560
and we lose our adversary,
the Soviet Union collapses.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.613
As a cold warrior, who we
will talk about the job

00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:46.889
you took on in a minute, that
you had to show flexibility,

00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:50.806
you had to change your
thinking about the world

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.789
because the paradigm had
collapsed, the bipolar world

00:17:56.789 --> 00:18:00.122
was no longer what defined the structure

00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:05.727
of the international system.

00:18:05.727 --> 00:18:08.328
How did you adjust mentally?

00:18:08.328 --> 00:18:11.507
Before we talk about the
project you undertook.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.474
- Well, first of all,
it wasn't an adjustment,

00:18:13.474 --> 00:18:15.648
it was 180 degree turn.

00:18:15.648 --> 00:18:19.932
That's where the deep reading
and Russian culture came

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.015
to the floor.

00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:26.568
Granted, I didn't like what
the Russian's could do to

00:18:26.568 --> 00:18:29.826
us during the Cold War,
but I also was well aware

00:18:29.826 --> 00:18:32.493
of their history and literature.

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:36.713
I certainly knew how
many (mumbles) divisions

00:18:36.713 --> 00:18:40.664
they held down on the Eastern
front during World War II.

00:18:40.664 --> 00:18:43.997
I had little difficulty pulling that 180

00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:49.092
and deciding that it
was my job to help this

00:18:50.188 --> 00:18:53.105
highly cultured community, country,

00:18:54.923 --> 00:18:57.086
find a new way in the world.

00:18:57.086 --> 00:18:59.985
They had a lot more problems than I had.

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:03.364
But you're absolutely
right, I reversed direction.

00:19:03.364 --> 00:19:07.822
- And, you know, there was
a debate in the country

00:19:07.822 --> 00:19:11.905
and some would argue one
of the factions swarming

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.659
around Washington at this time would say

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:19.964
kick them when they're down,

00:19:19.964 --> 00:19:23.547
boast about winning
the Cold War and so on,

00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:29.577
so, what, in your background, do you think

00:19:29.577 --> 00:19:33.660
what we've discussed thus
far, made you flexible?

00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:39.384
Was it, as you just said,
just the steep learning

00:19:40.584 --> 00:19:43.917
about what Russia was without communism?

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:50.269
- Both aspects, the cold
warrior and the uncold warrior,

00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:53.729
came into play.

00:19:55.477 --> 00:19:59.302
I've all ready covered the high
regard for Russian culture.

00:19:59.302 --> 00:20:02.564
But I also was well aware that they still

00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:06.837
had their nuclear weapons,
they had their missiles,

00:20:06.837 --> 00:20:11.004
and anarchy, chaos in the
former Soviet Union, in Russia,

00:20:12.592 --> 00:20:14.895
and could devastate the world.

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:18.478
So, I was strongly
motivated to do whatever

00:20:20.713 --> 00:20:24.296
could be done to bring
stability to Russia,

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:28.864
help them in anyway we
could to make sure that they

00:20:28.864 --> 00:20:32.890
could control the formidable
weapons that they had created.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.807
- So, at this time in the Congress,

00:20:36.947 --> 00:20:41.114
generates a bipartisan
notion about what can be done

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:47.368
in the context of a
collapsing Soviet Union

00:20:47.368 --> 00:20:49.900
with nuclear weapons and so on.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.067
And one of the Perry colleagues
or associates, Ash Carter,

00:20:55.867 --> 00:21:00.034
who was at Harvard and then
in Washington, had an idea.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.207
And what was that idea?

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:09.273
- Professor Carter decided
that it was in America's

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:15.186
best interest to use our
money and our know how

00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:19.006
to cooperatively, and I
underline cooperatively,

00:21:19.006 --> 00:21:22.506
help the Russians dismantle their arsenal,

00:21:23.343 --> 00:21:26.689
which they and we no longer needed.

00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:30.272
Ash Carter was very
effective in convincing

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:36.461
Senator Nunn, democrat,
Chairman of the Senate

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:40.938
Arm Services Committee, and
Richard Lugar, republican,

00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:44.600
Chairman of the Ranking
Minority of the Foreign

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.600
Relations Committee, to
put together a bill that

00:21:51.247 --> 00:21:55.414
would allow US dollars to
be used with the approval

00:21:58.168 --> 00:22:02.335
of the Russian government,
to stabilize their arsenal

00:22:05.086 --> 00:22:09.111
in this new era when we
were certainly not enemies,

00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:13.612
maybe not friend yet, but
certainly, we needed to cooperate.

00:22:13.612 --> 00:22:17.474
- So, you're talking about
a very different Washington.

00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:18.474
- Yes, indeed.
(men laughing)

00:22:18.474 --> 00:22:22.641
- You've used the word idea,
and this is a good idea,

00:22:24.053 --> 00:22:26.903
let's do something about it.

00:22:26.903 --> 00:22:30.269
And we're talking bipartisanship,
but it's not just two

00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:34.631
senators, they're able to
work it through the Congress.

00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.744
- Absolutely.

00:22:35.744 --> 00:22:39.206
- And get it signed by the President.

00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:42.845
- That's right, and of course,
they were the equivalence

00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:44.704
to Nunn and Lugar in the House

00:22:44.704 --> 00:22:46.630
that had to do the same thing.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.371
- And this legislation was
signed by President Bush?

00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:52.250
- Yes, President HW--

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.831
- HW Bush, right, right.

00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:54.829
- Yes.

00:22:54.829 --> 00:22:57.551
That was in, that was, well,

00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.507
it was late in the Bush administration.

00:22:59.507 --> 00:23:03.612
- And so, what was the
name of the baby that

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:07.362
was delivered by this
very different Congress

00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:11.641
and Washington world at that time?

00:23:13.591 --> 00:23:16.151
- The Cooperative Threat
Reduction Program.

00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:18.711
Also, Ash's idea, and of course,

00:23:18.711 --> 00:23:21.352
we quickly used the acronym CTR,

00:23:21.352 --> 00:23:24.510
Cooperative Threat Reduction.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.260
- And again, the idea
was to act responsibly,

00:23:30.832 --> 00:23:34.582
to help the Soviet Union
deal with a problem,

00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:39.232
and interestingly enough,
to do this was both

00:23:39.232 --> 00:23:42.148
in America's national
interest for reasons that

00:23:42.148 --> 00:23:45.571
you just described, but it
was also in the interest

00:23:45.571 --> 00:23:48.306
of international security,

00:23:48.306 --> 00:23:50.303
in addition to the Russian interest.

00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:54.032
- That's exactly right, I
couldn't put it better, Harry.

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:57.615
- And so, in a way this
is a world in which

00:24:00.427 --> 00:24:04.427
US Foreign and Defense
Policy still is motivated

00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:09.059
in the way that it was
motivated with the Martial Plan,

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:12.180
do something good for
the world that's in our

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.923
national interest, and it
will bring world security.

00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:20.090
- We often modestly refer to
it as our little martial plan,

00:24:23.025 --> 00:24:25.743
and in a very real
sense, as you point out,

00:24:25.743 --> 00:24:27.648
that's exactly what it was.

00:24:27.648 --> 00:24:31.706
- So, when the Clinton
administration came in,

00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:35.873
it was given the agenda of
implementing this project.

00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:43.854
And there are a lot of
key actors here that we

00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:46.602
need to really emphasize.

00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:51.039
The most important,
probably, being now Secretary

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.289
of Defense Perry, actually.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:58.260
And what were his talents
that he brought to

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.417
this endeavor that made it happen,

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:07.239
beyond picking you to run the program?

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.558
(men laughing)

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:10.857
- Well, he picked the right people,

00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:13.241
we've all ready covered that.

00:25:13.241 --> 00:25:16.991
Secretary Perry had to
take on some extremely

00:25:20.457 --> 00:25:23.658
difficult bureaucratic tasks.

00:25:23.658 --> 00:25:28.597
In the Bush administration,
then Secretary Cheney.

00:25:28.597 --> 00:25:30.297
- HW Bush, yes.

00:25:30.297 --> 00:25:34.464
- HW Bush, didn't spend any
of the money, for good reason.

00:25:36.906 --> 00:25:41.000
Nunn and Lugar were only
able to appropriate money,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.374
they weren't able to...

00:25:43.374 --> 00:25:46.703
Pardon, they were only able
to authorize expenditures,

00:25:46.703 --> 00:25:48.503
they weren't able to appropriate,

00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:50.555
which is consistent
with the committees that

00:25:50.555 --> 00:25:52.633
they chaired, or were on.

00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:55.883
So, the Pentagon could spend the money,

00:25:56.851 --> 00:26:01.370
but they had to find it
somewhere else in the Pentagon.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.113
Those are bureaucratic,
that's a bureaucratic problem

00:26:05.113 --> 00:26:07.151
at the first order, and Mr. Cheney,

00:26:07.151 --> 00:26:10.611
late in the administration,
decided to not take

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.876
that one on, and I have to assume that

00:26:13.876 --> 00:26:15.274
President Bush agreed with it.

00:26:15.274 --> 00:26:17.853
Bill Perry was cut from a different cloth,

00:26:17.853 --> 00:26:21.217
and it was the beginning
of a new administration.

00:26:21.217 --> 00:26:25.272
Bill took on those
battles, found the money,

00:26:25.272 --> 00:26:30.117
and therefore, then in
essence, could put it in my

00:26:30.117 --> 00:26:33.261
portfolio to carry out the program.

00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:35.441
- And he had to take this money
from some of the services?

00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:38.618
- That's right, who have their
own connections to the hill,

00:26:38.618 --> 00:26:40.882
to the White House, to the press.

00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:45.049
One of Bill's many talents
is his soft spoken ways.

00:26:47.013 --> 00:26:50.650
So, by any standard, these
are grandiose battles

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.770
within the Pentagon, but yet,
the public, I don't think,

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.869
heard about it, I don't
think the Chiefs went

00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:00.587
to the White House.

00:27:00.587 --> 00:27:04.886
There was a lot of trust
between Secretary Perry

00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:06.970
and the Pentagon's bureaucracy.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.263
- And he, in terms of command and control,

00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:14.926
if we can use those terms,
he saw the importance

00:27:14.926 --> 00:27:17.759
of centralizing this effort where?

00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.381
- Very good question.

00:27:20.381 --> 00:27:25.328
Ordinarily, programs like this
that involve foreign affairs,

00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:30.146
budgetary considerations,
certainly the military,

00:27:30.146 --> 00:27:34.099
those problems are
traditionally managed by

00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:37.266
the National Security
Council because it brings

00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:41.324
together the various forces of government.

00:27:41.324 --> 00:27:44.963
But that's not the way you
run a fast moving program,

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:49.130
so Bill effectively took the
management away from the NSC

00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:57.000
and put it right in the
Pentagon, so that Ash Carter,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.862
who by that time was the
Assistant Secretary of Defense

00:27:59.862 --> 00:28:04.029
for Policy, Ash wrote the
policy of what should be done.

00:28:05.624 --> 00:28:09.565
Bill approved it, it was my
job to implement that policy,

00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:11.783
all within the Pentagon.

00:28:11.783 --> 00:28:16.559
It was a masterful job of
bureaucratic management.

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:20.906
- And were you all
prepped to do this because

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:25.085
of the work of the shadow
government that we had talked.

00:28:25.085 --> 00:28:28.243
I mean, was this, in
addition to Ash's idea,

00:28:28.243 --> 00:28:32.076
was this something that
was part of an agenda,

00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:37.132
or did it only happen once
you had the strings of power?

00:28:41.053 --> 00:28:45.633
- I think we were prepared
to take on the task,

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:49.137
but I don't think we had
thought through the task.

00:28:49.137 --> 00:28:51.296
So, we were really starting from scratch.

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:52.796
It was hard going.

00:28:53.697 --> 00:28:57.364
- So, you had to assemble
and deploy a team.

00:29:00.756 --> 00:29:04.923
And this is a team that draw
on the best expertise of

00:29:09.728 --> 00:29:13.766
the American government,
especially the Pentagon

00:29:13.766 --> 00:29:17.599
and other security related
agencies and so on.

00:29:19.121 --> 00:29:23.577
So, how did you define
the problem, basically?

00:29:23.577 --> 00:29:27.155
I mean, this is a big thing
to be thrown on your desk

00:29:27.155 --> 00:29:31.012
and you have an eight billion
dollar budget to work with.

00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:33.525
- Well, eight billion over 10 years.

00:29:33.525 --> 00:29:34.523
- [Harry] Over 10 years, right.

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:37.066
- But I had well over half a billion--

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.041
- [Harry] In the beginning, yeah.

00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:40.583
- That had to be allocated adequately.

00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:43.503
Well, one of the agency's
that reported to me

00:29:43.503 --> 00:29:46.740
was then called The
Defense Nuclear Agency,

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.725
it's now called The Defense
Threat Reduction Agency.

00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:54.725
But I had to turn to them
to negotiate contracts

00:29:55.941 --> 00:29:59.524
with entities, whether
American or Russian,

00:30:00.844 --> 00:30:05.011
to carry out the tasks the
policy said we should carry out,

00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:10.362
dismantling missiles,
moving warheads, et cetera.

00:30:10.362 --> 00:30:14.112
I went to that agency
and explained that this

00:30:17.751 --> 00:30:20.651
was not dealing with American industry,

00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:25.452
they were going to be
dealing with Russian industry

00:30:25.452 --> 00:30:27.389
and (mumbles) bureaucracies.

00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:31.556
And remember, Russia had
essentially a command economy,

00:30:32.724 --> 00:30:34.249
not a market economy.

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:37.882
So, there was never a great
need in the Russian sphere

00:30:37.882 --> 00:30:41.715
to know what things cost,
price didn't matter.

00:30:44.881 --> 00:30:46.422
Production was what counted.

00:30:46.422 --> 00:30:50.005
So, the program managers,
who are ordinary,

00:30:54.199 --> 00:30:55.993
well, not ordinary, extraordinary,

00:30:55.993 --> 00:30:59.974
but they are bureaucrats,
they are government servants.

00:30:59.974 --> 00:31:04.358
They had to master how you
negotiate with something

00:31:04.358 --> 00:31:07.937
you have all the money and
they have all the products

00:31:07.937 --> 00:31:10.079
that are going to be operated on.

00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:14.058
And they want to get as much
of your money as possible,

00:31:14.058 --> 00:31:18.115
and we wanna dismantle as many
of their weapons as we could.

00:31:18.115 --> 00:31:21.150
That's an all together different
way of writing contracts

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.202
than ordinary--

00:31:23.202 --> 00:31:27.707
- So, when I've heard you
talk about this before,

00:31:27.707 --> 00:31:29.957
at a recent lecture at RGS,

00:31:30.943 --> 00:31:32.725
really it's about building a team.

00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:36.142
And let me walk you briefly
through the elements,

00:31:36.142 --> 00:31:39.608
because there were individuals
who really mattered.

00:31:39.608 --> 00:31:43.775
So, from intelligence you got
a general, a major general,

00:31:45.514 --> 00:31:49.681
who basically really knew the
Soviets as well as you did

00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:53.882
in the security field.

00:31:53.882 --> 00:31:58.384
- Yes, there are a lot
of unsung heroes here.

00:31:58.384 --> 00:32:01.201
One of them, some of them, of course,

00:32:01.201 --> 00:32:04.341
are the bureaucrats that
negotiated the contracts.

00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:07.000
Another group are the prime contractors

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.538
of the United States,
Bechtel was a good example.

00:32:10.538 --> 00:32:14.875
Experienced in major
projects all over the world,

00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:17.476
plenty of language expertise, et cetera,

00:32:17.476 --> 00:32:21.643
they had to report to me on
how the money was being spent,

00:32:25.014 --> 00:32:29.034
and yet, they had to hire
Russian subcontractors

00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:33.201
in a society that was unfortunately
renowned for corruption.

00:32:34.372 --> 00:32:38.539
And to their credit, the
prime contractors that we used

00:32:39.438 --> 00:32:43.853
never lost a penny and in
practically every case,

00:32:43.853 --> 00:32:48.476
did a very fine job, whether
you measure it by production,

00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:52.075
or in this case dismantlement,
accidents, et cetera.

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:56.334
So, the prime contractors
(mumbles) really deserve

00:32:56.334 --> 00:32:59.467
a heavy round of applause here.

00:32:59.467 --> 00:33:02.911
- And this was at a time,
this is ancient history,

00:33:02.911 --> 00:33:07.045
because this was at a time
when the American government

00:33:07.045 --> 00:33:10.045
could do things in a non corrupt way

00:33:11.068 --> 00:33:13.962
and get the project done.

00:33:13.962 --> 00:33:16.922
That's just an editorial
point there I'm making.

00:33:16.922 --> 00:33:18.263
- But it's accurate.
(men laughing)

00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:22.280
- Yeah, it's accurate, and in
retrospect, very impressive

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.594
because apparently that
hasn't been our experience

00:33:25.594 --> 00:33:28.152
in the recent wars that we've fought.

00:33:28.152 --> 00:33:30.130
But talk about some of these individuals.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.133
- I will.

00:33:31.133 --> 00:33:34.991
- So, Major General Lajoie
was really important,

00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:37.050
and he came from the CIA.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.717
- Well, Roland Lajoie
is the key to success.

00:33:42.285 --> 00:33:45.919
I mean, granted Ash ran policy,
I implemented the program,

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:50.216
but it was Lajoie who was
responsible for the day

00:33:50.216 --> 00:33:51.657
to day running of the program,

00:33:51.657 --> 00:33:55.036
and he did an absolutely magnificent job.

00:33:55.036 --> 00:33:57.286
He's an army officer, ROTC.

00:33:59.924 --> 00:34:04.091
He was fluent in Russian, so
fluent that, in my presence,

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.782
he could banter with the Russians.

00:34:08.782 --> 00:34:12.865
So, he had a good sense
of what they were saying.

00:34:13.827 --> 00:34:16.866
When I first met General Lajoie,

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:20.994
he was the top man in the CIA,
Central Intelligence Agency,

00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:24.757
for advising the director on matters,

00:34:24.757 --> 00:34:28.840
Russian or Soviet then,
and the Russians knew it.

00:34:30.062 --> 00:34:34.249
But Roland was retiring about
the time I came into office,

00:34:34.249 --> 00:34:36.786
and noted that he was retiring.

00:34:36.786 --> 00:34:40.102
And I turned the Pentagon upside down

00:34:40.102 --> 00:34:43.624
to make sure we hired him, and we did.

00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:45.743
He is the man who deserves, I think,

00:34:45.743 --> 00:34:48.810
most of the credit for the
success of the program.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.977
- But your interpreter was
also important, Nahanov?

00:34:54.749 --> 00:34:56.273
- [Harold] Irene Nahanov.

00:34:56.273 --> 00:35:00.249
- And she was important
because she served as both

00:35:00.249 --> 00:35:04.416
a PR person, but also a
person who could work Russian

00:35:05.308 --> 00:35:09.475
culture and enhance your
standing vis-a-vis the Russians

00:35:11.607 --> 00:35:15.774
because of your Russian side
agenda throughout your career

00:35:19.127 --> 00:35:22.986
of learning about Russia, it's
history and it's literature.

00:35:22.986 --> 00:35:24.848
- Very well put.

00:35:24.848 --> 00:35:28.643
She was the publicist,
and in side conversations

00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:32.454
where I wasn't present, she
made sure that they knew

00:35:32.454 --> 00:35:35.454
that I had read War and Peace twice,

00:35:36.508 --> 00:35:40.874
I'd used Pontryagin's
theorems, was well read

00:35:40.874 --> 00:35:45.041
on Russian music, I
appreciated deeply the Russian

00:35:45.942 --> 00:35:48.309
role in World War II.

00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:52.476
She just absolutely enhanced
my reputation as a person

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.532
the Russian's could trust.

00:35:55.532 --> 00:35:59.285
At the same time, she
proved to them that she was

00:35:59.285 --> 00:36:03.318
trustworthy, and anecdotally,
the way to demonstrate

00:36:03.318 --> 00:36:06.758
that is that she had
telephone numbers for every

00:36:06.758 --> 00:36:10.807
Russian official for
whom we were dealing that

00:36:10.807 --> 00:36:14.419
she could use and get them at
any time of the day or night,

00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:15.663
and we did.

00:36:15.663 --> 00:36:18.335
And I should add that
this idea of their trust

00:36:18.335 --> 00:36:22.335
of Irene Nahanov also
pertains to Roland Lajoie.

00:36:25.573 --> 00:36:28.690
Even though he had spent
his life, his career,

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.693
in intelligence, the Russians
came to trust him very much.

00:36:32.693 --> 00:36:34.452
- And also important
on the Russian side was

00:36:34.452 --> 00:36:37.413
your counterpart, General Maslin.

00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:38.593
- [Harold] Yes.

00:36:38.593 --> 00:36:42.711
- Who essentially had
a similar kind of role

00:36:42.711 --> 00:36:46.794
being in charge of the
non active nuclear weapons

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.561
that the Soviet Union controlled.

00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:54.400
- That's right, before I
take on that question, Harry,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.817
one more point about Nahanov.

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:02.969
In addition to be a
publicist, fine interpretor

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.910
quite often, the Russians
would have her interpret

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.115
both sides of the conversation.

00:37:08.115 --> 00:37:11.949
But where she showed
her skills as a diplomat

00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:15.116
was when the negotiations got intense.

00:37:16.196 --> 00:37:18.134
And they frequently did.

00:37:18.134 --> 00:37:21.377
She would, at some
point, interrupt and say,

00:37:21.377 --> 00:37:25.127
"Dr. Smith, tell the
Russians about Natalia."

00:37:26.714 --> 00:37:30.453
I said, "Good idea, Irene, please do."

00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:32.397
Since I couldn't tell the story.

00:37:32.397 --> 00:37:36.351
And she would tell the
story of our first child,

00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:40.146
who was born shortly after
I read War and Peace,

00:37:40.146 --> 00:37:42.923
and we christened her
Natalia for the heroine

00:37:42.923 --> 00:37:44.862
of War and Peace.

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:49.029
Well, when a talented woman
tells this endearing story,

00:37:49.892 --> 00:37:53.892
tensions relaxed, faces
were no longer stressed,

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:58.161
negotiations proceeded.

00:37:58.161 --> 00:38:01.280
And she did this time and time again,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.539
in just the right way,
just the right time,

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:07.289
she was a great negotiating tool.

00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:12.145
But now, I should return
to General Maslin.

00:38:12.145 --> 00:38:16.164
Maslin's portfolio was the (mumbles),

00:38:16.164 --> 00:38:18.438
and that's a Russian acronym.

00:38:18.438 --> 00:38:20.678
But essentially he had
the same responsibilities

00:38:20.678 --> 00:38:24.612
to his government as I
had to mine in the world

00:38:24.612 --> 00:38:26.255
of nuclear weapons.

00:38:26.255 --> 00:38:28.557
I had other responsibilities.

00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:32.724
But every weapon that was not
in the care of a commander

00:38:33.575 --> 00:38:36.992
that is on alert, was his responsibility.

00:38:37.976 --> 00:38:42.143
And Maslin had to, therefore,
move all the technical

00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:46.840
nuclear warheads after the fall,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.883
after the collapse of the Soviet Union,

00:38:49.883 --> 00:38:52.205
he had to move those
weapons back to Russia,

00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:55.018
which he did as fast as possible,

00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:58.177
and without any American assistance.

00:38:58.177 --> 00:39:01.891
But that left, of course,
all the strategic weapons,

00:39:01.891 --> 00:39:05.014
the weapons that could
reach the United States,

00:39:05.014 --> 00:39:08.597
sill there in Ukraine,
Belarus, Kazakhstan.

00:39:09.734 --> 00:39:14.062
He was responsible to
work with the Americans,

00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:18.489
to get those weapons back,
dismantle the missiles,

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.916
defuel the engines that had been built,

00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:25.721
make sure the weapons
got to storage sights

00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.800
where they could be secure.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.500
That was his responsibility.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.422
- And both interestingly
here, a great deal of trust

00:39:34.422 --> 00:39:37.355
was built between you and him.

00:39:37.355 --> 00:39:40.272
And some of that trust was built by

00:39:41.198 --> 00:39:45.365
the extent to which each
side sensed the importance

00:39:49.581 --> 00:39:53.748
of culture to the Russian
nation, to rural culture,

00:39:56.082 --> 00:40:00.837
and so on, so he was a man
who appreciated world art.

00:40:00.837 --> 00:40:05.039
You were a man who
appreciated Russian culture

00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:09.432
and Russian literature, there
were exchanges in which,

00:40:09.432 --> 00:40:13.015
on his side, he took
you to the battlefield

00:40:14.613 --> 00:40:19.111
in War and Peace, and to
museums, and to ballet.

00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:23.650
On your side, working with
our former Chancellor Hammond,

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.309
who is now head of the
Smithsonian Institute.

00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:31.142
You arranged for him to
tour American cultural

00:40:32.108 --> 00:40:35.806
centers and so on, and so
that was very important

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:38.639
to cementing the security aspects.

00:40:40.976 --> 00:40:45.462
- It certainly was, Harry,
and you put it very well.

00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:46.946
Just one anecdote perhaps?

00:40:46.946 --> 00:40:48.926
- [Harry] Yes.

00:40:48.926 --> 00:40:52.365
- Maslin treated me to
the tour of Borodino,

00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:54.115
and it was well done.

00:40:57.199 --> 00:41:00.917
I wanted to make sure I
could respond in kind,

00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:05.084
and so I called Theresa Hammond,
Chancellor Hammond's wife,

00:41:05.977 --> 00:41:09.627
and asked Theresa if
she'd like to do her bit

00:41:09.627 --> 00:41:11.652
for national security.

00:41:11.652 --> 00:41:15.691
She was quite effective
in managing aspects

00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:20.264
of the National Gallery,
and I noted for her that

00:41:20.264 --> 00:41:23.606
General Maslin, that
grew up in St. Petersburg

00:41:23.606 --> 00:41:26.584
and spent many, many
hours in the Hermitage,

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:30.167
was well read in the
French impressionists.

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:34.426
And Theresa said, why, of course.

00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:39.168
So, one evening we
assembled, Nahanov, myself,

00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:43.732
General Maslin, and Phillip Coningsby,

00:41:43.732 --> 00:41:47.941
the curator for the Smithsonian,
for the National Gallery

00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:51.659
on French impressionists,
and he was a strange man.

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:55.826
It was late at night and
you could hear our footsteps

00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:59.379
echoing in this empty gallery.

00:41:59.379 --> 00:42:03.546
And Coningsby was very
careful, he began his lecture

00:42:04.678 --> 00:42:09.055
to General Maslin, who was
dressed in full military regalia,

00:42:09.055 --> 00:42:10.478
at my insistence.

00:42:10.478 --> 00:42:12.416
- And what Maslin's question?

00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:16.811
- Well, Coningsby said,
"General, the French impressions

00:42:16.811 --> 00:42:20.536
"were French, and they were painting

00:42:20.536 --> 00:42:22.786
"in the late 19th century."

00:42:24.593 --> 00:42:26.553
Maslin, of course, knew all that,

00:42:26.553 --> 00:42:29.976
which Coningsby wasn't
going to make a mistake.

00:42:29.976 --> 00:42:32.274
Maslin asked a very sensible question.

00:42:32.274 --> 00:42:35.836
And Coningsby quickly figured out that he

00:42:35.836 --> 00:42:37.815
had to ratchet up the...

00:42:37.815 --> 00:42:40.579
And so, he did, he point
out some rather subtle

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:42.775
things about the French impressionists.

00:42:42.775 --> 00:42:47.179
Maslin said, I understand,
but he had another question.

00:42:47.179 --> 00:42:50.550
And very shortly, the
conversation was beyond me,

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.796
that it was too aficionados
of French impressionism

00:42:54.796 --> 00:42:58.968
discussing it, and it
went very, very well.

00:42:58.968 --> 00:43:02.885
It ended when General
Maslin had a question for

00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:07.576
Mr. Coningsby, Dr. Coningsby, he said,

00:43:10.427 --> 00:43:11.961
"Phillip," being his first name,

00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:16.508
"I don't see any Signac's
here in the gallery."

00:43:16.508 --> 00:43:20.021
And Coningsby was crushed
because there are none,

00:43:20.021 --> 00:43:21.897
or there were none.

00:43:21.897 --> 00:43:25.483
He said, "Alas General,
we have none such."

00:43:25.483 --> 00:43:28.816
Maslin smiled knowingly, a little sadly,

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.120
and said, "We do."

00:43:33.784 --> 00:43:38.199
- So, in the end, the program
accomplished an awful lot,

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:41.540
and let me just list some of the things--

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.253
- By the way, Harry, I
should add, General Lajoie's

00:43:44.253 --> 00:43:47.251
opinion wasn't, that exchange of culture,

00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:49.455
particularly in the night
of the National Gallery,

00:43:49.455 --> 00:43:51.074
was a turning point.

00:43:51.074 --> 00:43:54.755
From that point on, Maslin
trusted the Americans,

00:43:54.755 --> 00:43:57.194
and of course, we trusted him.

00:43:57.194 --> 00:43:58.492
I just wanted to make sure that was--

00:43:58.492 --> 00:44:03.073
- And so, and in the end, you
accomplished an awful lot.

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:05.788
Let me just go over, you
removed all the strategic

00:44:05.788 --> 00:44:09.955
warheads and vehicles from
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.

00:44:11.592 --> 00:44:15.129
You enabled Russia to meet
the conditions of start one,

00:44:15.129 --> 00:44:18.409
signed by Gorachev and Bush in 1991.

00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:22.089
And you set the stage for
further start treaty talks,

00:44:22.089 --> 00:44:26.488
and the most important
for you, you built 24

00:44:26.488 --> 00:44:30.085
secure storage sites and
trained the personnel who

00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:34.327
manned them, and there
has been none worthy...

00:44:34.327 --> 00:44:37.764
There had been no security
sites before your program.

00:44:37.764 --> 00:44:41.823
So, in essence, you
achieved an awful lot that

00:44:41.823 --> 00:44:44.740
made our world, today, more secure.

00:44:46.004 --> 00:44:48.629
- I think so, and one of
the reasons I'm most pleased

00:44:48.629 --> 00:44:51.837
that you bring up these security sites is

00:44:51.837 --> 00:44:55.237
that there's a lot of photos
looking into empty silos,

00:44:55.237 --> 00:44:59.205
or blowing up silos, or
dismantling rocket engines,

00:44:59.205 --> 00:45:00.455
real photo ops.

00:45:01.748 --> 00:45:06.708
I doubt that the press has
ever shown the 24, I think,

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:09.112
security sites that we built.

00:45:09.112 --> 00:45:13.279
And that was absolutely key
in a world where nuclear

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:16.792
terrorism was on the rise.

00:45:18.565 --> 00:45:22.732
The Russian weapons had to be
(mumbles) put in secure sites,

00:45:24.746 --> 00:45:28.327
they had them all over the place.

00:45:28.327 --> 00:45:29.993
They were padlocked, so to speak,

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:34.039
but we installed multi-fencing,
security cameras,

00:45:34.039 --> 00:45:38.039
personnel reliability
programs to make sure that

00:45:38.947 --> 00:45:42.764
the guards weren't on drugs or alcohol.

00:45:42.764 --> 00:45:46.424
All the things necessary
to keep those weapons,

00:45:46.424 --> 00:45:49.429
which we had laboriously,
we, the Russians and

00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:51.388
(mumbles), brought together,

00:45:51.388 --> 00:45:53.466
made sure they stayed there.

00:45:53.466 --> 00:45:57.222
The theft of one, two,
or three nuclear weapons

00:45:57.222 --> 00:46:00.889
in the hands of extremists
would have caused

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.169
enormous damage in this world.

00:46:07.169 --> 00:46:09.314
- We're living in a very
different world today.

00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:12.870
Looking back on this
extraordinary achievement,

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.747
what do you see as the
lessons learned that

00:46:16.747 --> 00:46:20.080
you could pass onto the next generation?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.481
- Excellent question.

00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:27.564
The first thing, of course,
is what I, by chance,

00:46:28.865 --> 00:46:32.547
was able to do myself,
that is know the culture,

00:46:32.547 --> 00:46:34.714
know how they're thinking.

00:46:36.512 --> 00:46:39.772
If you can learn a language,
so much the better.

00:46:39.772 --> 00:46:43.293
Russian is a tall order
but you've got to know

00:46:43.293 --> 00:46:47.460
the feelings of the people
with whom you're dealing.

00:46:49.328 --> 00:46:53.795
More to that point, we
learned how to put ourselves

00:46:53.795 --> 00:46:56.233
in the Russian shoes.

00:46:56.233 --> 00:47:00.031
So that we knew when
we were offending them,

00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:02.448
and avoided those situations.

00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:06.909
That was probably the number one,

00:47:06.909 --> 00:47:10.701
that's probably the
number one characteristic.

00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:14.752
You might say it all
started here at Cal when

00:47:14.752 --> 00:47:18.721
I learned how to listen
what graduate students said,

00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:22.198
and I learned, later,
how to listen what CEO's

00:47:22.198 --> 00:47:24.423
and Vice President's had to say.

00:47:24.423 --> 00:47:27.460
So, it's a sense of, it's antenna,

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.127
reading how the other guy feels.

00:47:31.122 --> 00:47:34.736
That was, I'd say, the
major reason that so much

00:47:34.736 --> 00:47:36.920
trust built up between us.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.087
- And it's important to
emphasize that all of these

00:47:42.857 --> 00:47:46.607
cultural aspects, history
and art, and so on,

00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:54.734
scientific exchanges, which
are apparent in the work

00:47:54.734 --> 00:47:58.401
that you did citing a
Russian mathematician.

00:48:00.798 --> 00:48:03.881
They bring out the mutual respect and

00:48:06.788 --> 00:48:09.811
sense of dignity of the other that makes

00:48:09.811 --> 00:48:12.876
the cooperation possible, is that fair?

00:48:12.876 --> 00:48:16.126
- Not only fair but well put, eloquent.

00:48:17.123 --> 00:48:21.290
- And in the end, what's
gone wrong, do you think,

00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:25.675
in today's world?

00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:28.842
There are obviously different leaders.

00:48:29.687 --> 00:48:33.854
Russia has done things that
appear to not be appropriate,

00:48:35.849 --> 00:48:39.490
according to our
definition of international

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.010
and national security.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.527
Have we made mistakes?

00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:47.694
- Yes, we've made mistakes
and so did the Russians.

00:48:48.735 --> 00:48:53.431
What disappeared because
of those mistakes is trust.

00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:56.772
Today no one would accuse President Trump

00:48:56.772 --> 00:49:00.939
or President Putin of being
paragons of honesty and trust.

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:05.341
And we've paid a heavy price for that.

00:49:05.341 --> 00:49:09.508
And we've made mistake even
in the Clinton administration.

00:49:10.599 --> 00:49:14.766
The one I'm most aware of
the decision to expand NATO,

00:49:16.173 --> 00:49:20.188
and that's a clear case
of not thinking through

00:49:20.188 --> 00:49:22.547
how the other guy feels.

00:49:22.547 --> 00:49:26.714
Suddenly, his satellites
are on the other side of,

00:49:28.145 --> 00:49:32.504
what George Kennadis
called the new Cold War,

00:49:32.504 --> 00:49:34.254
the new iron curtain.

00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:41.709
The Pentagon fought
that decision very hard.

00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:45.498
Dr. Perry didn't need any
convincing that we should

00:49:45.498 --> 00:49:47.498
postpone expanding NATO.

00:49:49.997 --> 00:49:53.181
He made that clear to President Clinton,

00:49:53.181 --> 00:49:56.773
and the President said he disagreed.

00:49:56.773 --> 00:50:01.292
Bill asked for a meeting of
the National Security Council

00:50:01.292 --> 00:50:03.292
and made his case there.

00:50:04.542 --> 00:50:08.409
Strangely enough, Lake and Christopher,

00:50:08.409 --> 00:50:10.899
Secretary of State and the
National Security Advisor,

00:50:10.899 --> 00:50:15.252
were silent but Vice
President Gore felt that

00:50:15.252 --> 00:50:17.002
we could handle this.

00:50:17.938 --> 00:50:21.973
I think he was wrong, I think he misjudged

00:50:21.973 --> 00:50:24.552
the Russian reaction.

00:50:24.552 --> 00:50:27.052
So, we lost, we expanded NATO.

00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:33.652
Whereas, I think, we
could've built on the trust

00:50:34.788 --> 00:50:38.293
that we'd developed something to act on.

00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:42.210
Actually, Vladimir Putin's
mention early 2000's

00:50:43.412 --> 00:50:47.245
that Russia would consider
being part of NATO.

00:50:49.114 --> 00:50:51.030
Well, we missed that train.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.975
Now, that's not to say that the Russians

00:50:52.975 --> 00:50:57.013
didn't make mistakes, (mumbles)

00:50:57.013 --> 00:51:00.742
and causing trouble in
the Ukraine, et cetera.

00:51:00.742 --> 00:51:04.035
- One final comment here,
you called your lecture

00:51:04.035 --> 00:51:07.368
at IGS on this program a moment in time.

00:51:09.416 --> 00:51:13.738
And at the end of your
lecture, you mentioned a gift

00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:17.155
from the Russian General, which, I guess,

00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:20.594
had been a top secret book
before he gave it to you.

00:51:20.594 --> 00:51:24.511
But there was an inscription
and he had written

00:51:25.434 --> 00:51:29.420
in the inscription, East
is East and West is West,

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.380
and never the twain shall meet,

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.639
was the quote from Kipling.

00:51:34.639 --> 00:51:38.499
But you went and checked the source and

00:51:38.499 --> 00:51:39.781
there was more to that.

00:51:39.781 --> 00:51:42.215
- Well, if you'd look at
the (mumbles) of the book,

00:51:42.215 --> 00:51:47.161
which I wanna add was
declassified by the time I got it.

00:51:47.161 --> 00:51:50.555
There's an inscription at
the top of the front of this

00:51:50.555 --> 00:51:52.938
piece in handwriting, but it's Russian.

00:51:52.938 --> 00:51:56.155
So, of course, Irene
Nahanov translated it for me

00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:57.778
and it's what you might expect.

00:51:57.778 --> 00:52:00.778
It's Dr. Harold Smith, with
appreciation, et cetera.

00:52:00.778 --> 00:52:04.445
It was heartfelt, but
below that in English,

00:52:05.597 --> 00:52:09.176
in the same hand, it's not
to say it was necessarily

00:52:09.176 --> 00:52:12.226
Maslin's hand, but in the same hand,

00:52:12.226 --> 00:52:16.066
is East is East, and never
the twain shall meet.

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:20.461
But what most of us don't
know is that particular

00:52:20.461 --> 00:52:24.914
stanza ends with "There is
neither border nor bleed,

00:52:24.914 --> 00:52:26.997
"nor birth that shall"...

00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:30.411
- I have it here if you would like.

00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:31.821
- All right, go ahead.

00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:35.876
- But there is neither
East nor West border,

00:52:35.876 --> 00:52:40.139
nor breed, nor birth,
when two strong men stand

00:52:40.139 --> 00:52:43.736
face to face, though
they come from the ends

00:52:43.736 --> 00:52:44.838
of the earth.

00:52:44.838 --> 00:52:46.175
- Thank you, Harry.

00:52:46.175 --> 00:52:48.176
You'd think I'd remember it.

00:52:48.176 --> 00:52:52.337
But that's a metaphorical
compliment of the first order,

00:52:52.337 --> 00:52:55.587
and Dr. Perry and I agreed, in writing,

00:52:56.919 --> 00:53:00.550
that this was a wonderful way to summarize

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:04.394
the trust that had built up
between Maslin and Smith,

00:53:04.394 --> 00:53:08.149
Russia and the United
States, and now alas,

00:53:08.149 --> 00:53:09.732
that trust is gone.

00:53:11.334 --> 00:53:14.416
I think we're going to have
to wait for a new generation

00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:18.583
of leaders and try again to
build the kind of relationship

00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:24.472
that would make the two
nuclear superpowers cooperate

00:53:24.472 --> 00:53:27.491
as we did then, in the future.

00:53:27.491 --> 00:53:31.429
- Looking back, one final
question, looking back

00:53:31.429 --> 00:53:35.487
at your intellectual journey,
is there one important

00:53:35.487 --> 00:53:39.654
lesson for you that made this
great achievement possible,

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:44.325
and your participation in it?

00:53:44.325 --> 00:53:48.492
- Well, of course, it's
keep reading, keep studying,

00:53:50.453 --> 00:53:55.349
keep searching for new
solutions to today's problems.

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:57.794
They all happen to come at the floor when

00:53:57.794 --> 00:53:58.932
I was at the Pentagon.

00:53:58.932 --> 00:54:02.584
- And if you're a scientist,
don't just focus on the math,

00:54:02.584 --> 00:54:04.470
(men giggling)

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.667
but as (mumbles) read the
literature of whatever

00:54:07.667 --> 00:54:10.731
country you're gonna have to deal with.

00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:12.685
- Very true, we all should be (mumbles)

00:54:12.685 --> 00:54:14.290
as General Maslin was.

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:17.715
He was a military man who
knew the French impression.

00:54:17.715 --> 00:54:20.910
In my case, I was a reader of history who

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.695
happened to be a scientist.

00:54:22.695 --> 00:54:25.792
- Well, on that note,
Harold, I wanna thank you

00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:28.381
for taking the time to
coming on our program

00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:31.798
and reviewing this remarkable achievement

00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:36.728
when the West could talk to the East,

00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:41.382
and with a very effective
result, thank you.

00:54:41.382 --> 00:54:45.306
- Thank you, Harry, it's a great
pleasure to tell this tale.

00:54:45.306 --> 00:54:47.839
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:51.482
for this conversation with history.

00:54:51.482 --> 00:54:55.149
(intriguing rhythmic music)
