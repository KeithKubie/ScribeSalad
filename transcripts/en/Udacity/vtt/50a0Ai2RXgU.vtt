00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
If the learning goals
are what you should know,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.740
and the learning outcomes are what
you should be able to do.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.410
Then the learning assessments
are how we assess whether or

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.730
not you know what you need to know.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.940
And can do what you need to be able
to do by the end of this course.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.930
Here the assessments are going
to be very authentic.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.250
The overall outcome we aim for

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.900
is that you should be able to contribute
to the field of educational technology.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.290
So the assessment will
be based on whether or

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.170
not you contributed to the field
of educational technology.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.270
You'll build a tool, conduct some
research, evaluate some technology.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.040
But by the end of this course
you'll have actually contributed to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.705
the community of educational technology.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.390
Now, there will be a lot of
milestones along the way.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.650
Before you can get to your contribution,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.440
you need to demonstrate
your mastery of some topic.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.550
You need to propose your idea.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.140
You need to execute your plan, and then
you need to deliver your final results.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.200
By the end of it you will have created
a real contribution to the educational

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.120
technology community.
