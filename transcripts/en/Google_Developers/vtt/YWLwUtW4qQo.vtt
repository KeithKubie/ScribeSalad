00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:12.456
Hi, I'm John Burge and I'm the
TL for the predictive analytics

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:12.956
team.

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:16.274
And today I'm gonna talk
about how to do that.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.390
So you're a developer,
you've created your game.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.020
You've figured out how to get
a lot of people into your game,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.540
and now you have to
try to figure out how

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.706
to keep people in your game.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:26.890
So if your game is connected
to Google play game services,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.030
as users are playing
your game, we're

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.280
actually building very
detailed time series of what

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.447
users are doing in the game.

00:00:32.447 --> 00:00:34.738
So let's say that you have
a game about killing zombies

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:35.310
and farming.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.560
So, here's a sample
user in the game.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.029
He's acquired your game, he's
gone and killed 100 zombies.

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:42.070
He's farmed some stuff,
he's farmed some carrots,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.990
and tomatoes, raised
sheep, farmed corn.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.940
But ultimately, he's gonna
end up leaving your game.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510
Wouldn't it be fantastic,
if at some point prior

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.080
to leaving your game, say like
when he was raising sheep,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.496
you could get a signal from
us, that says, hey, this guy's

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:56.560
about to leave your game.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.330
So instead of him
leaving your game,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.880
you can say well, I've
got a golden shotgun.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.982
Maybe I'll give
you a 50% discount

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:03.940
on this golden shotgun.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.489
So instead of
leaving your game, he

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280
picks up this golden
shotgun, and of course

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
with a golden shotgun,
what are you going to do?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.510
You're gonna go out and
kill some more zombies.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.414
So this is exactly the type
of thing that we're doing.

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:16.330
If you go to the predictive
analytics offering

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.746
that we have, you
can actually see

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:20.561
examples of the time series of
real people playing your games.

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.060
And you can see that there's a
huge diversity of events that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.660
show up in these time series.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.980
We've got session
starts, any of the events

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.630
that you define in your game,
they show up, in-app purchases.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.270
We're working on integrating
crashes and reviews.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.320
General RPC activity,
just tons of stuff

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.295
shows up in these time series.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.079
Well, what do we do with them?

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.620
Well, we take a time
series and we're

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.040
going to want to feed it
into some one of our machine

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.961
learning models.

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:45.460
First we're going
to need to extract

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.459
some features from that.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.110
And I'll go into some
details about how

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.682
we extract those features.

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:51.140
But at the end of
the day, features

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.515
for each one of
these time series

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:54.110
just boil down to
a bunch of numbers.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.892
So here you can see, I've got
a bunch of columns of numbers.

00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:59.100
Each one of these columns
corresponds to the features

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.987
that we extract from
one of the games.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.070
And historically speaking,
we can look at the data

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.010
so we know whether or not
someone's turned or stayed

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.551
in your game.

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.695
So we can label each one of
these feature sets either green

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.320
here, for users that
stay in your game,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.440
or red for users that
have left your game.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.100
We take all of the information
that we have about your users,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.183
and we feed it into Google's
Sibyl infrastructure.

00:02:17.183 --> 00:02:18.690
Sibyl is a massive
infrastructure

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.100
that we have at Google for
learning all sorts of types

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.570
of classification tasks.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.060
It's used widely across
many of Google's products.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.560
And now including analyzing how
users are playing your games.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.060
So we take all this
data, we dump it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.150
into the Sibyl infrastructure.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.460
And out comes a trained model.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.490
We do this daily.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.900
And then with this
trained model,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.440
as a user is playing
your game, we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.400
look at the time
series for that user.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.790
Here we have the same time
series that we had before.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.730
We extract features
from it, and then we

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.540
dump those features
into the trained model.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.456
And that model's gonna
spit out whether or not

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:52.140
we think that user is going
to churn out of your game.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.570
So how do we do this?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.660
Well, in any of these
classification tasks,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.010
one of the most important
things is always

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.634
trying to figure out how to come
up with a set of features that

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.082
represent your data points?

00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:02.415
Our data points are time series.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.020
And it's really important that
the features that we extract

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.870
out of this time
series don't completely

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.210
throw away the temporal
information that we have.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.586
So how do we do that?

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.210
Well, we define these
temporal windows.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.126
Here I have an example
of one temporal window.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.927
It's the one day
temporal window here.

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.010
So we really have two time
frames in this example.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.093
We have the one day window,
and we have everything

00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:21.340
that happens before that.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.943
Let's say in your game that
you have an achievement called

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:25.640
the kill megaboss achievement.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.642
If the user killed a megaboss
greater than one day ago,

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.350
then a particular
feature gets turned on.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.530
This one that I have
highlighted in red.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.030
However, if the kill megaboss
happens before one day is up,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.900
then a different
feature gets turned on.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.000
So we're preserving some
temporal information

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.207
in the features that we dump
into our big bag of features.

00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:46.665
Now, technically,
this is something

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:47.500
that you could do on your own.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.041
Although, I'm not
sure why you would,

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:50.700
since we're doing
it for free for you.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.930
But one thing that
you couldn't do,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.250
is you couldn't look at what
users are doing in other games.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.050
So just like we're building time
series for users in your game,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.830
we're building time series
for users in all of the games

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.930
that they're playing.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.660
So let's say that this
particular user is

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.910
playing three games right now.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.500
He's playing your game,
and two other games.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890
We can separate all of these
games into temporal windows.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.934
One day ago, two days
ago, three days ago.

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:13.600
And we can look, for
instance, at what's

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.875
happening three days ago.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.829
Well let's say three
days ago, the user

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.829
triggered four different
events in your time series.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.810
But, he was playing two other
games, and in those other games

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.395
he triggered a total
of seven events.

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:25.770
Well these are
just more features

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.800
that get dumped into
our big bag of features.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.120
In addition to the features that
we get out of our time series,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.730
we actually have a tremendous
number of nontemporal features.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.310
Player demographics, mobile
device, Android version,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.970
game genre, country, language.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.010
All sorts of stuff.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.880
And you can see now that our
bag is getting really, really

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.050
full of these features.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.450
But luckily, Sibyl can deal
with a very large number

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.780
of features.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.459
So in conclusion,
if you want to get

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.250
these type of powerful
predictions from us,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.540
all you have to do is
connect to our Game Services.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.020
The more signals that you
give us, the better we can do.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.120
We currently have two models
that we make predictions on.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.850
Churn prediction and
spend prediction.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.780
We're busy working
to make improvements.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.580
We have two more models, big
spender and lifetime value.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.650
And we're investigating
other ML technologies

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.490
that we have at
Google, such as Google

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.490
Brain and other neural
network solutions.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.790
Thank you.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.090
