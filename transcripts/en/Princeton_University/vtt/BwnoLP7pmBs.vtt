GRACIE STONE: Scratchwork is a
intelligent and collaborative

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.160
whiteboard tool.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.530
Our goal as a
company is definitely

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.920
to make education
collaboration a bit easier.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.290
It's really important to us
not to outdate handwriting.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.650
Rather, we want to
acknowledge that that's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.440
the way people think and
rather than combating

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.870
that in the digital age,
embrace it and take that

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.140
into another platform to
allow for all of the added

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.700
capabilities that a
computer can offer.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.700
GREG GAUTHIER: So you
start with your whiteboard

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.409
and then you can enter items
onto the board as you'd like.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.240
You draw on it with your mouse.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.937
You can draw with an attached tablet.

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.520
One of the things that makes us
different from the competition

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.130
is you can take your
drawings on pen and paper

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.640
and hold it up to a webcam
and take a picture of it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.410
and make them
digital objects, then

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.660
you can rearrange
and move around

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.600
to create just the idea you
were thinking of in your head.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.790
I teach
multi-variable calculus,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.590
and one of the things I do
is I look for problems that I

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.080
can then explain in class.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
I'm able to take
these ideas here,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.900
put them into digital
objects so I can present them

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.370
on the day of class arranged
just the way I like,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.470
and so that my
students have notes

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.395
that they can follow when they
are studying for their exams.

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:18.270
GREG GAUTHIER: The summer
accelerator program

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.560
is a 10-week program.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.630
Each participant gets
a stipend as well as

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.540
housing for the summer, as
well as co-working space

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.590
here in the eHub.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.340
So we have a boot camp at
the beginning of the program

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.180
involving how do
you run a business.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.970
And it can be a
really busy time.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.700
We had seven teams working
in the eHub this summer.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.450
RACHEL YEE: The
co-founders of Scratchwork

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.630
were nice enough to create a
little finance project for me

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.690
to learn in Python.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.320
And I learned how to do some
financial modeling, which

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.650
was really cool that I was able
to contribute in a real way,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.746
and also learned a
skill set at the same time.

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:53.370
I felt that even my
experience compared

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.740
to what I learned
about startups in class

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
were completely different doing it
and physically being there.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
GRACIE STONE: I would definitely
say that the biggest thing is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.080
access to mentors that you
definitely would not otherwise

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.680
have.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.750
They come from
various backgrounds,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.660
and that's what's so powerful
about it is they've been VCs.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.620
They've been
entrepreneurs themselves.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.510
They started things.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.420
They've seen things fail.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.586
They've seen things succeed.

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.130
And we made such
different decisions,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.990
and I think far
better ones than we

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.930
would have been able to make
without access to any of them.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900
GREG GAUTHIER: There's a thing
on the wall here in the Keller

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.400
Center.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.140
We have all the logos that the
6 years to date of the summer

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.120
accelerator teams,
and we're really

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.240
hoping to add
ourselves as an example

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.780
so that people
who are at Princeton

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.530
can look to the
Keller Center to see

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.650
that their entrepreneurship
really is a viable option

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.760
and that there are
resources available.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.510
RACHEL YEE: I think
the Keller Center does

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.860
an incredible job of exposing
students to real-life scenarios

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.700
and companies.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.460
I think that it gives us a
larger perspective on the world

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.930
and how we as individuals
and even as Princeton alumni

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.530
can have a tangible impact
through the businesses

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.100
or nonprofits that we create.
