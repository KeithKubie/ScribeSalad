00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.480
So let's graph these lines.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.560
X =-5, -1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and
then x=-3; -1, 2, 3.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.180
Y=8 is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 and y=3 is up 1, 2, 3.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.220
Then I can see my rectangle here and
it has one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.250
six squares.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.060
Looks like the answer is
that there are 6 squares
