1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,260
Okay, I'll do that. Okay, let me
do one more time. Three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,480
This is Tim Howard and today on radiolab
we've been talking about black boxes

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,070
and the next story started with a radio
piece that I heard at the third coast

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:18,910
international audio festival. There
were a lot of incredible stories,

5
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:23,911
but there was this one called keep
them guessing that I just loved and I

6
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,030
couldn't get it out of my head.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,270
So I sat jad and Robert Down in our
little black box of a studio on deep look.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,770
Tim Howard, I'm not sure.
I like your tone. Okay.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,180
And I connected them with the
guy who made the piece. Hello.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,013
Okay.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,930
I hear the sound of what sounds like
another room. Does he sound like me now?

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,830
Oh, his name is Jesse Cox.
Wow. You spent so close.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,150
Can See your foot far away.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,440
He's actually in Australia where everybody
is because they're upside down from

15
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,200
the rest of us. They are very,
very likely to fall into the sky.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,250
You have as Australians worked
out, down to the tee, rub it.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm gripping on with my hands and the
table. That's what we speak. You'll get.

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,700
Just to start, I mean, maybe just
introduce us to your grandparents.

19
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,250
Who are they? Well, my, my
grandparents were mind readers.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,310
Mm.

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,660
On the radio. Really? Yeah. You don't
have to explain that on what are they?

22
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,040
What are their names? First? Leslie,
Leslie Pennington and Sydney Pennington.

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,050
Piddington. He didn't and
they had a radio show. Yeah.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,870
The show was called the pediatricians or
the amazing Penningtons and was on the

25
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,871
BBC radio in the 1950s now Jesse told
us that for most of his life he didn't

26
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,110
know this.

27
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,470
I guess the reason was that my grandfather
and my grandmother divorced well

28
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:42,180
before I was born, and then his grandpa,
he died when I was four or five.

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,800
Then his grandma remarried,
so nobody talked about it.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,120
Crazily enough,

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,900
I knew that my grandparents had been
famous and my grandma was an actress,

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,200
that it really wasn't until I was a
teenager and a radio produce actually

33
00:01:55,201 --> 00:02:00,200
discovered by accident that my
grandma was alive. I went, what?

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,800
They still have Pennington alive. The
reporter calls up his grandma's like, Hey,

35
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,770
can I interview you? And my grandma
was hesitant. She was like, Oh,

36
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,010
I'm not sure. I'll be very
good. I can try and remember,

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,540
and I came and interviewed her and when
it went to air, when it got broadcast,

38
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,140
we all drove up to his grandma's house
and listened to it around the radio that

39
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:23,010
they would have back in the 1950s and
heard the story and that's when Jesse

40
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,540
discovered that his grandparents,

41
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:29,040
Leslie and Sidney Pennington one time
had an audience of 20 million people.

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,913
Yeah.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,050
Basically the population of Australia
was listening to my grandparents back in

44
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,530
the 1950s no way. I was like, yeah,
why? Why don't I know this is,

45
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,410
this is in my family and why?
Why don't I know it? But he says,

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,770
it was really when he sat down and
listened to the original broadcasts,

47
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,640
what's left to them?

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Two hours of old BBC recordings that
survived today because my grandparents

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,240
pirated them from the
BBC back in 1950 he says,

50
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,790
it wasn't until he heard
those tapes that I went, wow,

51
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,290
tell us this story. Tell us what you
heard that made you go, wow. Well

52
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,120
[inaudible]

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,120
you hear these very dramatic theme song
and this old BBC voice comes into the

54
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,260
tape and says,

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,010
what do you mean? Maybe some
gentlemen, we present the fitting

56
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,660
and the music guys are
all very, very dramatic,

57
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,570
and then the narrator
sets the scene for you,

58
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,870
but eating too old by that Herman here
and the other one pick at least two.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,740
They're right in the middle
of the west end of London.

60
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,820
It was done in front of a live audience
and then you hear my grandfather's

61
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,530
voice. Well, as Steven Grandpa had just
told you, live has been quite Insightly.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,930
Exciting for us. He was
a stutterer out back.

63
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,140
We've had a lot more letters.

64
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,110
There were all these things that meant
it should never have worked on radio.

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,101
Anyhow, anyhow,

66
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:57,510
the night my grandfather was in the
studio on the stage and my grandma,

67
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,970
I'm sorry to say Leslie isn't here,

68
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,720
she was often somewhere dramatic as
in not in the studio somewhere exotic.

69
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,780
One time she was in a
dive in the diving bell.

70
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,390
She was underwater at the
bottom of a test tank.

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,680
One time she was in the
tower of London. Right.

72
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,350
You're there unless they end up town. Yes,

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,850
I am here and I remember pinning good
it here in the Piccadilly studio and

74
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,660
Leslie was in the Tower
of London. So, so your,

75
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,300
your grandpa's on stage and your grandma
you're saying is in a tower by phone or

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,250
no, she's in front of, she's
in front of a microphone now.

77
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,210
This is back in the time when microphones
were the size of small melons.

78
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,310
Very shortly there'd be a microphone
set up in the Tower of London.

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,720
Connected live. Yeah.

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,080
My grandfather then comes on the year
and sets up a series of telepathy tests

81
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,190
that they go into enact.

82
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,960
I know I down to work,

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,250
I will attempt to transmit that
to Leslie on a line of print.

84
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,190
I selected from a number of books
on the table here in the studio.

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,310
So there was a famous one called the book
test and this is where a member of the

86
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:58,000
audience would come up to the stage and
there'd be a pile of books and they'd

87
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:02,320
randomly pick up a book randomly
opened to a page and point to a line.

88
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,110
Would you read out the line
to the listening audience?

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,100
The lines elected is be abandon as the
electrician said that they would have no

90
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,220
color now,

91
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,200
completely random bit of tech selected
out of a stack of books after the texts

92
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,460
had been chosen and only then

93
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,410
I should now call in the tower of London.

94
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,550
They would connect to his grandma Leslie
in the Justin moment at the sound of

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,520
the Gong, I want your complete silence,

96
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,650
your sympathy and your cooperation.

97
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,730
Now concentrate on the line while
I attempt to transmit it to Leslie

98
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,810
and a Gong would sound and he'd kind
of very dramatically Farro his brow.

99
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,640
And the next thing you
heard was my grandmother.

100
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,900
It's sort of fry,

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,150
old gentle voice and she start to unpick
what was being transmitted to her.

102
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,560
It's something to do.

103
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,060
Okay.

104
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,990
And and Christian.

105
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,740
There's something about
light and electricians

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,013
[inaudible].

107
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,670
Remember that line again was

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,090
the abandon. I see electrician said
that they would have no column.

109
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,320
If you concentrate on the word

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,270
[inaudible]

111
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,420
like being Lyft, people being Lyft,

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,350
it's amazing to listen to over 60
years later listening to those tapes,

113
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm still on the edge of my seat,

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,530
abandoned that

115
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,003
knocked light,

116
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,070
concentrate on the word like
light and right at the end,

117
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,680
I think the whole line is

118
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,250
abandoned as the electricians said,

119
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,860
they would not be current

120
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,520
via abandon as the electrician
said that they would have no color

121
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,550
[inaudible] almost every time it would
be 100% correct. Totally remarkable.

122
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,603
[inaudible]

123
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,770
it just was this feeling inside you
that you get going, hang on. What?

124
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,600
When Jessie heard those broadcasts,

125
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,580
his obvious question was
how did they do that? Well,

126
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,720
this is the question that I have wanted
to know for so long and there'll be

127
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,100
many, many theories. I mean,

128
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,890
they used to get letters in
from listeners all the time.

129
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,340
There's this box of press clippings
we found at the bottom of my grandma's

130
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:51,670
closet and we started going through
these press clippings and there were wild

131
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,840
theories, like little morse code
transmitters in their teeth.

132
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,420
Yeah, I mean,

133
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,210
one of the theories I quite liked with
[inaudible] who wrote in saying there was

134
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,930
a green man that ran between the shoulders
and he knew they sought authority

135
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:08,440
because he also had a green man, and
so that was precisely how they did it.

136
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,420
But you are totally convinced that this
was a carefully worked out trick of some

137
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:17,140
kind. Yes. That is the one
part of almost certainty.

138
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:20,690
I can say, oh, there has
to be some secret codes.

139
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm tapping of the some something. Well,

140
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,390
you're not the first person to say that.

141
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,270
The people were constantly trying
to guess what the code was.

142
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,630
That's Jim Steinmeyer. I'm a an
author and a consultant and magicians.

143
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,190
He says that at the time,

144
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:36,160
some magicians in London thought that
his stammer was part of the code.

145
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,700
I do to not see.

146
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,770
I can just think is

147
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,810
Jesse for his part ended up going
through a ton of these theories as he

148
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,980
interviewed magicians and historians
read through magic books initially.

149
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,610
One of the theories that made sense to
him is that the code was in the silence

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that basically my grandparents and my
grandma was so in sync that between each

151
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,230
time a sound or a word was uttered,

152
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,430
that inside their head start going through
the alphabet and they'd be so ensured

153
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,590
and so in sync that whatever letter that
matched up that that would be a code.

154
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,350
Wait, Jad

155
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,630
a, B, c,

156
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,110
Hi de Apathy. No sassy. I am wondering

157
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,350
a, B, c, d, e,

158
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,580
f. G. The next letter is
going to be Jay. Yeah,

159
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,130
of course. As soon as you do,

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,690
as soon as you start playing any
of these theories out on real time,

161
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:36,380
you realize how ridiculous they are and
if you listen to the second broadcast of

162
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,310
the two that survived,

163
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,340
you hear something that makes the whole
idea of a code seem kind of impossible.

164
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,010
Yeah.

165
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,010
That was a test I did on the airplane
broadcast in that broadcast is grandma.

166
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,080
She was in a, an Arrow

167
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,870
flying at a great height, did a great
speed toward something or other,

168
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,850
but we're not sure where

169
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,940
flying around Bristol and she was in
this plane at the same moment that he was

170
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,860
on stage. Exactly.

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,550
And on that time there were numbered
envelopes on everyone's seat.

172
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,080
And my grandfather said, okay,

173
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,020
everyone brought something and put
it in the envelope, seal it up.

174
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,470
Just write a poem off the top of
your head. 150 people do this.

175
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,470
And then sit turns to one of
the judges and says, okay,

176
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:17,370
pick two numbers from one to 150 and
then someone goes into the audience and

177
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:20,010
goes and picks those two envelopes,
brings them back to the stage,

178
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,860
gives them to the judges, and then
the judge picks one of the envelopes,

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,240
pulls out the poem, and then holds
it in front of my grandfather.

180
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,380
And so here you have a poem chosen
seemingly at random and Leslie,

181
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,580
the grandma is several thousand feet
in the air when they finally connect to

182
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:35,980
her.

183
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,860
Best personal comment. Hello.
Hello. The short way relay,

184
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,810
Leslie is still completely isolated.

185
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,800
She can't even hear a
word that they're saying.

186
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,520
She never had a pair of headphones so
she could never actually hear what was

187
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,690
going on in the studio.

188
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,680
She literally just spoken to a microphone
once the technician said, Leslie,

189
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,450
we're ready. We're ready for you.

190
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,280
It's thousands of people
below Sydney is there.

191
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:01,281
Furrowing his brow and the
poem he's trying to send
her is from Keith's one line

192
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:05,640
that goes hail to the blind
spirit bird that will never work.

193
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,160
[inaudible]

194
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,660
oh it's, it's two lines.

195
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,190
[inaudible]

196
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,260
I've got it. I can get it

197
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,460
Heyo to the live spirit bird.
I'll never would I Ms. Young.

198
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,530
Would you read out the ones written
down on the piece of paper that you hold

199
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,420
hail to the blind spirit but
down? Never would. Thank you.

200
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,870
Crazy part. Is it in that trick, your
grandpa doesn't even talk to her.

201
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,530
There's complete silence between seed
and Leslie and if there's silence there

202
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:54,460
can be no coding. So you
know, it was kind of this,

203
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,250
this wonderful prices that I talked
to people and even as I came up with

204
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,084
theories,

205
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,540
you'd listened to the tape and then
realize that even the theories themselves

206
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,420
just seem so implausible.
Well, maybe it's the narrator.

207
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,130
Do you think it's a narrator
or that whatever it is,

208
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:08,560
the narrator says each
night, which is before your,

209
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,400
before the game is even on
somehow encoded into that,

210
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,920
that man's introduction is, is
is the answer. No, because the,

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,170
because the audience hasn't yet gone and
done its random act when he starts the

212
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:24,040
show. There was one thing that I
discovered from reading the magic books,

213
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,100
and this is this whole idea about passing
on a piece of information through a

214
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,100
third party. Now my grandfather
never speaks to my grandma,

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,260
but he says to the
technician in the studio,

216
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,310
can you please call Gilbert Sullivan in
the strata cruiser and ask my wife to

217
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,450
stand by. Then the technician
calls Gilbert and says, Gilbert,

218
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,280
can you please ask Leslie to stand by?

219
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,490
And then Gilbert Sullivan
says to my grandma, Leslie,

220
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,130
please stand by now.

221
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,600
That's is the only thing I can see where
there's some kind of communication,

222
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,803
but then we'll

223
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,230
communicate something like a random
sentence from a book or whatever. Exactly.

224
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,960
And that sent essentially where the theory
falls down because then what happens

225
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,950
next is that my grandma
basically successfully recites
a half written crossword,

226
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
which someone has put into an
envelope and pass up to my grandpa.

227
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,640
So like you go how? How standby
means. That means you know, six down.

228
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,220
I have no idea what that really,
I'm back to square one again. Oh,

229
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,430
I can't work it out. I've
got, you know the to this day,

230
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,240
you don't know to this day, I do
not know to this day. Where's the,

231
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,380
where's the ways we know? We can't know.
There's gotta be somebody who knows.

232
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,990
Can't believe we can go into this
interview. We have no way. We have no,

233
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,060
so it's the technician. It's
gotta be the technician.

234
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,420
You gotta get to the technician because
the technician is looking at her and

235
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,370
he's doing something pilot to do
is move their lips, their, that he,

236
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,620
there's something is happening with
that man's eyebrows. That's the code.

237
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,110
It's the eyebrows. I feel like
I'm just listening to this,

238
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,160
like what's been going on in
my head for about 10 12 years.

239
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,880
So then I ask Jesse like what happened
when he talked to his grandma?

240
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,290
Total dead end.

241
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,230
You mean like showing up around once we
discovered this story around the dinner

242
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,230
table, women visited. Hoed would always
be, but, but why don't you tell us?

243
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,670
Why can't you tell it's with family.

244
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:07,570
Surely you can tell us and she
would fob us often and just say,

245
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,560
you are the judge.

246
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,220
That is the line that I finished or that
is the line they finished with every

247
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,050
single broadcast.

248
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,520
Did they just say no,

249
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,900
only thanks very much everyone and
you're the judge. I will. I think

250
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,990
[inaudible] all right, I'm that,

251
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,850
but we'll know that just through
the predicament. Pick a did it.

252
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,140
She wouldn't even give me the satisfaction
of saying yes, it was a trick.

253
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,960
She won't even say that clearly
you are the favorite grandchild.

254
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,930
It was probably another another.

255
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:37,550
You have a cousin or a sibling who she
really adored at one day without your

256
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:42,050
knowing it, she whispered. No secret to
her, not about to her son. Your father,

257
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,600
what did, did, did she, did she
tell him? Did she tell your dad?

258
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,220
She told my dad something. What
did she tell him? I have no idea.

259
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,190
He will not even admit being

260
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,250
told something if she slipped
up. Is it Jessie's dad?

261
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,410
And I'm not even sure
that she did slip up.

262
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,473
Um,

263
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,430
I see. And I approved my dad

264
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,650
then. Why you can't say yes,
Leslie did tell me something.

265
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,290
I'm not going to tell you, but yes,
she did actually tell me something.

266
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,330
If my mum and trusted me with
something all those years ago,

267
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,630
then I will keep that trust. Why?

268
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,810
Because I believe in keeping

269
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,410
trust. My Dad won't tell my mum they've
been together for over 30 years.

270
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,140
You just have to continue. No nothing.

271
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,560
There is no book that's published.
There's no one that came out and said, ah,

272
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,020
I was the fellow who worked behind
the scenes with the Penningtons.

273
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,600
Let me tell you how it was done.
That's Jim Steinmeyer again,

274
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,480
they left people guessing
and, and walked away. Well,

275
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,380
the thing that got me is when I was
talking to magicians and they said we can

276
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,490
repeat everything that they did
really so they can actually do,

277
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,360
I mean like you know,

278
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,030
one of them is in a plane and
other ones in on the apparently,

279
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,950
but they still themselves don't know 100%
for sure. How my grandparents did it.

280
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,260
If we, if we could figure this
out or would you want you,

281
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,700
it sounds like you would want to know
the answer. I'm not so sure anymore.

282
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,600
Really. We all say we want to know and
we all go completely crazy and mad,

283
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,170
but I, I, I feel like this story
wouldn't have lasted for 60 years.

284
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,170
It wouldn't still captivate people today
if they told people if they hadn't kept

285
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,070
their line, you are the judge.

286
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,510
I kind of feel like that's almost the
greater magic than whatever magic they

287
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:27,131
would do.

288
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:30,650
I just feel like this is a black box
that we can shine a light into it and go,

289
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,270
okay, check that one off the list.
Now we can go to the other ones.

290
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,720
The cool thing. Now, if
we can't figure it out,

291
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,340
then you will be very happy with our
program. If we can figure it out,

292
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,360
we will call you and say,

293
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,280
do not listen to this show because
it will deeply disappointed.

294
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,690
Well, I mean the thing,

295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,720
the thing I think for me that made me
come to peace with not finding out and not

296
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,220
knowing the answer was that a lot of the
interviews I did with my grandma were

297
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,580
from a few years ago and she
actually isn't very well,

298
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,880
she has dementia and she's been
sick the past couple of years.

299
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,410
And so she physically
can't tell it any more.

300
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,750
And Yeah, for me there is
something about, you know,

301
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,500
I visit my grandma now and
you go, she was amazing.

302
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:22,700
She not only did she make this
incredible program with my grandfather,

303
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,150
they had 20 million people listen
to them, which is just incredible.

304
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,370
When you think of the 1950s um,

305
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,520
they've managed to [inaudible]
well, what happened? Hey, no, no,

306
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,430
no. Jess come back. No,

307
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,210
we just went straight on
the hour or is exactly,

308
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,750
it's exactly x nine seconds ago. Yeah.

309
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,960
Mother a cell

310
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,780
phone. I'm just going to call
him. Yeah. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hi.

311
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:50,410
I'm

312
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,770
your booking ran out just a minute ago.
Yes. We noticed that. It that uh, yeah,

313
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,060
yeah,

314
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,820
I think we'll probably need to use the
phone cause that booth now needs to be

315
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:58,630
used.

316
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,380
Sorry. So we call Jesse back and while
we didn't drag him back into the studio,

317
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:07,400
actually we couldn't. Um,
he did send us this tape.

318
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,520
Now you've held onto secret so many, so,

319
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:17,180
so many years. Why haven't
you wanted to reveal it to me?

320
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,950
I think the reason I haven't ever wanted
to reveal the secret is because it's a

321
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:29,290
wonderful mystery and I'd
like to think that, uh,

322
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,600
after I've died, people will still
say, how did they do it? Was it doing,

323
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:35,434
wasn't it?

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,130
It just tickles me to think
about a lot of secrets,

325
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,060
magic secrets.

326
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,590
They get passed down from generations
and they get really performed over and

327
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,930
over again. I guess that very much
becomes a part of that family.

328
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,610
Now as a performer myself, if I
wanted to bring back the pollutants,

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,150
would you feel like you could hand
down this magic trick to your,

330
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,090
to your grandson to
carry it on? Of course.

331
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,670
If I had a grandson who
wanted to carry it on,

332
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,250
I'd have enormous difficulty
telling him how to,

333
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,830
I don't think it would be possible because
there's an awful lot that I wouldn't

334
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:14,140
be able to tell him. What do you mean
you wouldn't get it to handle that man,

335
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,470
son? It's hard to explain.
Why wouldn't be able to,

336
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,740
it's just that I wouldn't be able to.

337
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,990
It's all I can say about that.

338
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Our sincere thanks to Jesse Cox for so
graciously allowing us to air that story

339
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,270
and also thank you to ABC national radios,

340
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,280
three 60 documentaries who
produced the story with him? Uh,

341
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,410
it's called keep them guessing and we've
linked to the original story on our

342
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:49,310
website, radio lab.org.
So, well, you know,

343
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:53,360
I don't think it's actually time for us
to end this because I didn't tell you

344
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,194
this.

345
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,610
We were so interested in trying to
figure out how they did that trick.

346
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,340
[inaudible] that Soren and I,

347
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,170
because we just wanted to find out
like did somebody know how they did it?

348
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,370
So we called this guy.

349
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,553
Okay.

350
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,520
All right. Who ruined everything?

351
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:17,240
This is Penn Jillette who you
probably know from Penn and teller,

352
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:21,020
famous for doing magic tricks and
then telling you how are done now.

353
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,600
I don't really know what I was
expecting when we called him. I,

354
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,610
I guess I was thinking he
would know what they did,

355
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,530
but he wouldn't choose to
tell us. I didn't know.

356
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,460
But when we called them and we played
him the story, as soon as he heard it,

357
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,490
he said, oh, it's a book
test, right? It's a book test.

358
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,980
It's an envelope switch or
what? And there are, you know,

359
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,860
three or four ways to
do it. What did he say?

360
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,710
He said basically I can tell
you how they did it. Yeah.

361
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,740
Or how they might have done it, but
you are not going to like it there.

362
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,840
There go. The only Shukran in magic,

363
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,900
there's only one and that is
that the secret must be ugly.

364
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,870
You cannot have a beautiful secret, a
beautiful secrets, that kind of thing.

365
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,870
It's short and sweet like,
Yo, he folded the hat twice.

366
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:06,670
Or there's mirrors under that table. When
you hear it, it's like, oh, of course,

367
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,220
that's what they would do,
and you love finding it out.

368
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,390
Then you will whisper it to the
person next to you. So in magic,

369
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,840
what you want is an idea
that is not beautiful.

370
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,340
What do you call this as a magic trick?

371
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:21,640
That stays secret is one
that's so boring to tell.

372
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,130
You don't want to tell it and
you don't even want to hear it.

373
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
If I have to say he's lying about this
and there's gaffers tape over behind

374
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,250
there and there,

375
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,340
they're not actually telling you the
exact truth here and it gets so our,

376
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,820
you don't get an Aha.

377
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,750
One of the strongest feelings
you can get in the life.

378
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,310
What are the most rewarding
feelings is the feeling of an Aha.

379
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,240
I finally understand. If you
don't have a wonderful Aha,

380
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,490
people won't figure it out. So I've got,

381
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,360
I can tell you easily
how they did that trick,

382
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,810
but you will not get an Aha.

383
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,370
Basically you said that you answer to
this one is going to kill your joy. Yeah,

384
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,410
it's ugly. So did he, did he
tell you what they did? Yeah.

385
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,640
What'd he say? Well, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you in just a second.

386
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,240
You went into excruciating detail
about how he thinks they did it.

387
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,410
No a book tasks. We
actually do one in our show,

388
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,320
but the more important
thing, he was so right.

389
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:29,321
Once we heard the explanation and the
details and all we were were both like,

390
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,550
yeah, all right. Well,

391
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,400
yes, with a poison dart and love
how much I bugged your shit.

392
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,231
As you can hear.

393
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:45,980
He knew exactly what he was doing with
us and in a way he's asking us a deeper

394
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:49,670
and more of a philosophical
question. I've done this to you.

395
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,110
Will you turn around and do it to your
audience? Will all I've done to you,

396
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,390
you know, because you get to edit.

397
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,720
All I have done is put you in precisely
the position I live my life in.

398
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,340
You now have to make the exact same
decisions that I make and I will,

399
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,920
I will tell you, and this is just true,

400
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,921
that I would have played this particular
thing a differently with almost any

401
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,190
other show. You know, my move on the, uh,

402
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,230
on the chessboard with another
show would be to say, uh, you know,

403
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,810
I do have several ideas as to how this
could be done, but I think I'm, uh,

404
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm going to be like the grandmother
and go to my grave with this. Hmm.

405
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,110
You know, and I would've just given
you that a soundbite. I just have

406
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,840
it set that we've pivoted
the entire piece called, so

407
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,340
it's like all eyes,

408
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,750
all eyes have been directed to the next
sentence. So that's a little difficult.

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,880
But I want to see how you solve
a problem that I solve every day.

410
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,940
But we have like a higher
call, like you're entertaining.

411
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,900
But we're entertaining with the caveat
that we're supposed to be like telling

412
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,430
the truth as best we understand it.

413
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,930
So we have a slightly different set of
gods and our Mount Olympus than you do

414
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:14,690
it. You don't really, you don't really,

415
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,830
because I am not suggesting that you lie.

416
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,330
You're just going to have
to tell your audience.

417
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:23,720
Would you think they need to
hear? And that's where he left it.

418
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,480
So in the days after the interview week,

419
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,850
we just got into this debate
about what we should do.

420
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,500
We obviously have an obligation to you.
You listening to tell you what we know.

421
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,570
Yes. The whole deal. Yeah.

422
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,120
We can't pretend that we don't know
something that we now do know, uh,

423
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,370
even if it would make a
much more beautiful story.

424
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,220
So this leaves us in a
conundrum. A, are we,

425
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,190
are we entertainers or are we
actually lists journalists?

426
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,230
So here's where we ultimately came down.

427
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,060
We have decided not to tell you
how the Penningtons did it. I mean,

428
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,870
we are going to tell you,

429
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,870
but we're not going to tell you here in
this podcast because we have now been

430
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:04,610
soiled by this truth. We
learned off the record and you,

431
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,630
if you want to be soiled,
sure. Come and soil yourself.

432
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,640
You can go to this URL,

433
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,570
radiolab.org/the ugly truth.

434
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,860
Don't click this
radiolab.org/the ugly truth.

435
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,550
Don't no pasta fee. Click this
and we just leave it to you.

436
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,900
You can go there or you can not. All
I've said to you is that it's a trick.

437
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,820
Yeah, and you knew that the fact that
it wasn't the trick you wanted it to be?

438
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,580
No, he did turn sweet at one moment
we were talking about the grandma.

439
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,620
Grandma tells the grandson in the
conversation at the end, she is not sure.

440
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,250
She could explain to him how
it was. That's beautiful.

441
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,290
That is the most beautiful thing that
that happens in the whole thing because I

442
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,910
think she's telling the truth.

443
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,480
She may not know how the trick was
done and yet she was a party to it.

444
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,820
She's the one who he says, you know,

445
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,670
oftentimes when you're doing tricks,

446
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,510
somebody knows everything and the
other person is in the dark. Yeah.

447
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,190
One of the,

448
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,460
you mean like one of the partners
intentionally not knows what's happening?

449
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:20,270
Yeah, there are. There are tricks
in the Penn and teller show,

450
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,960
but I don't really know how they're
done. It might've happened here.

451
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:28,640
He may have, uh, decided that
he would be the knowing one.

452
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,380
She would be the innocent, and maybe
therefore, and this is just a hunch,

453
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,220
but just possibly everything she's
saying to her grandchild instead of being

454
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,940
a kind of dodge or a little bit
of a lie, maybe it was the whole.
