00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.160
Hey guys welcome back!!!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.317
I'm Nate with the king of random

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.560
And today we're gonna be showing you how to make your very own

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.820
Replica from a video game.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.640
In a recent video I got to show you something fun i built for DevinSupertramp.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.200
Some giant Mario kart shells that I drove around on remote-control cars

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.100
Like I said I would i'm now going to show you how I did it so you can make your own

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.442
No interest in Mario kart?

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.240
That's all right you can use the same methods I'm gonna show you

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.940
To make whatever kinds of props you want

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020
In the video where I showed these shells off

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.000
I had these giant 2 foot fibreglass shells

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.820
We're going to be scaling those shells down

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
So it's a little bit more manageable but the same principles can be used for smaller

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.720
Or much larger projects

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.880
The purpose of today's video is to learn how to sculpt

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.500
and prep one foot Mario kart shells out of foam

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.152
The materials for this are pretty basic

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.684
This is called rigid insulation foam

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:44.940
It comes in sheets that are about 1 or 2 inches thick

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.280
and you can usually get it in pink or blue at hardware stores

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.340
The full-size sheets are usually 4 feet wide and 8 feet long

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.663
To make it so I could fit the pieces into my car

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:54.840
this one is cut down to 1/4(quater) of that size

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.500
So it's 4 feet long and 2 feet wide

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.620
This is the 2 inch foam and it's what we're going to be using today

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.960
These shells are tall and almost spherical in shape

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.160
So we're gonna cut out 6 of the squares from the foam

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.960
Glue them all together and that will give us a 1 foot cube

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.266
we have our marks measured out

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.101
And now we're gonna use this handheld miter saw

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.380
To cut out the individual squares

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.000
We have our six squares cut out

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.440
And we're ready to glue them together

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.920
But this foam is made from polystyrene

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.866
Which can be dissolved by the solvents

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.016
And a lot of types of glue

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.380
So what we're going to use

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.600
Is this expanding foam in a can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.700
It glues the foam together really well

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.120
And it doesn't dissolve it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.380
Shake your can of expanding foam well

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.804
Apply a thin layer of the foam

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:01.600
And press your next piece down on to it

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.760
I Like to use bamboo skewers stuck in through the sides

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.780
To keep it from sliding side ways while it dries

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.217
Glue all six pieces together using skewers on each layer

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:26.280
And place a weight on top to help minimise the expansion of the foam

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.940
Always wear gloves when we're using this expanding foam

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.412
Because it's really sticky and very annoying to have on your skin

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.700
Also make sure you're wearing clothing

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.020
If you're okay with getting dirty

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.720
Depending on the temperature and humidity

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.800
The foam will take an hour(60 minutes) or two to dry completely

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070
Once it has it will be rigid and inflexible

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.280
Our expanding foam is dry

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.560
So it's pull out the bamboo skewers

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.367
Sometimes they're glued to the foam on the inside

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.920
So it's good to have a pair of pliers to help with grip

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.840
That one doesn't want to come out

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.600
We'll probably run into that skewer

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.980
While we're trying to carve the foam

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.060
It'll be a little bit annoying

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.800
But we just cut it off as we get to it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.740
Our foam is now ready to go

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.420
So let's start marking up the design

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.020
From the top down these shells are fairly round

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.320
So i'm going to draw an ellipse on the top of the foam

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.480
And then carve off all the sides until we have a cylinder

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.140
I'm going to be using the same handheld miter saw

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.821
That i use to divide the squares up

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.550
It's narrow and it's straight and it

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.589
does a really good job of cutting through the foam quickly (screeches!!!)

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.880
after the quick cut with the saw

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.060
And very rough sandpaper

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.860
Will help you take down the ridges left in the foam

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.880
Now, we have our cylinder

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.640
Let's start adding some basic details

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.180
These shells have a ridge around the middle

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.300
With a little bit of a curve in it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.600
So i'm going to draw that in

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.140
First i'm just adding a mark

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.380
Where the front and the back are

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.089
So I know where the curve should begin and end

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.720
This line i'm gonna draw that goes all the way around

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.509
Will be the highest point that I want the ridge

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.059
This second line will be the lowest point of the ridge

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.119
You, can see that i have now drawn this band going all the way around i'm now going to use a thin razor blade to cut

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.410
About an inch in all the way around the band so that when i cut down from the top the piece will break off

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.210
There's a bamboo skewer that wouldn't come out of the foam i just sliced right through it with the saw

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.890
Now, we will do the same thing on the other side

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840
sounds like bamboo

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.320
that is

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.430
okay guys

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.930
update

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.670
We can now start to see the very basic shape of the shell start to emerge and it's time to take down the excess and

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.349
give it that nice dome shape you can use a saw for taking down the large pieces of if you want but one of my

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.140
favorite tools for shaping this foam is some 36 grit sandpaper it's very rough and takes down the edges quickly

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.379
okay we've got

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.370
A dome for the top of shell coming along quite nicely

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.159
Now let's move on to the bottom of the shell on the bottom these shells do have something of a neck at the front which

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.759
Looks a little bit like a doughnut so the first thing we're gonna do is carve out a place for that

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.889
first we'll draw a line to keep it centered

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.460
Now let's take our razor blade and do the same thing we did with the ridge going all the way around i'll cut around the neck

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.180
and then saw down pieces of the foam to that point

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.629
now that we've got the neck blocked in let's go back to using the saw in the same paper to take off more foam and

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.630
block in the bottom shape of the shell

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.500
we've got our basic shape carved in now let's open up the neck hole and sand down and refine all of our edges to open

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.789
Up the neck hole you could use sandpaper or razor blades if you're really patient but i'm going to use a rotary tool to speed

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.790
things up a bit

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:06.369
eahhh

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.819
foam everywhere just it gets everywhere

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.639
Now that we've taken down the ridges let's go over the whole shell with a high grit sanding sponge to smooth it all out

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:29.049
We smooth down the shell and now the only thing left, to do is put in the four indentations that are the turtles leg holes

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.019
Our shell is carved and smoothed down now all that's left is to carve in the shell ridge pattern on the top and the belly

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.090
lines on the bottom after i draw in those lines i'm going to carve them in using sandpaper wrapped around a pen

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.279
now that we've added in our ridges this shell is ready to prep for the mold if you remember i explained that there are a

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.550
lot of chemicals that can melt the

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.950
Polystyrene that this foam is made from so what we're gonna do is cover the entire thing in a protective layer of

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.289
latex house paint that will form a barrier that will let us do minor repair work and apply mold rubber that won't stick too much

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.509
To the foam since the color we're going

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.890
to be using doesn't matter at all

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.509
You, can usually go to a paint store and ask if they have any incorrect mixes they'll often be sold at a steep discount

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.370
There you have the paint is dry and the only thing left before our shell is ready to mold is to use a little bit

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.390
of spackle to fill in any gaps or cracks or pieces that may have chipped off in the carving

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.689
spreading this spackle a little bit to try and fill in some of the really rough texture

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.550
Now, i've got lots of the gaps in cracks filled with the spackling i like this kind because when it's wet it's a very bright

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.090
Pink color but as it dries it starts turning white so you know when it's ready

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.409
To sand or paint here we go the pink spackling has all turned white which means it's ready

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.060
To be sanded and as soon as we've done that the whole shell will be ready To be molded

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.859
i'm using 400 grit sandpaper just, to smooth down spackle

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.119
There you have it our turtle shell is now built

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:55.699
Sculpted fixed up and prepped and it's ready to be molded which we're gonna show you how to do in our next video to recap

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.099
Our process we took some two inch rigid insulation foam and cut out six squares one foot by one foot using

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:07.159
expanding canned foam we glued those six pieces together into a 1 foot cube we then carved it into the shape of our shell using

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.970
A saw and some high grit sandpaper

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:14.270
Once we had the shape that we wanted carved out of it we painted on a protective layer of latex house paint and then you

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.349
Spackling to fill in any gaps or cracks in the foam and now it's ready, to be molded

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.190
This is the exact same process that i used to make mariokart shells for the devin supertramp video here's the foam shell from that build

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.380
as a reminder you don't have to use these techniques to make shells all sorts of shapes can be made this is just one fun

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.630
example there you have it now you know a quick method of making custom designs of your favorite video and movie pieces

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.400
Thanks for joining us for this project today and we look forward to teaching you how to mold and cast your creation in the next

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.400
video talk to you then

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:48.830
There's, so much static electricity on the foam that i try and brush it off and then all of the foam just like comes flying

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.799
back on it's like a magic trick appearing foam dust

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.520
blaghhh it's everywhere oh my gosh

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.370
that made it worse

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.679
hey guys i hope you're enjoying these new videos with nate as much as i am he's got some

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.729
phenomenal talent when it comes to building and crafting and he really loves what he does

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.489
Give, him some validation if you agree and i'll see in the next video
