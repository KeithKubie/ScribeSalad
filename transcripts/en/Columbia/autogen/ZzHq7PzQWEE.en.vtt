were talking he's like you know you do
something in your artwork yeah he's like

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
something in your artwork yeah he's like
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.750
something in your artwork yeah he's like
sometimes you recycle code you know yeah

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
sometimes you recycle code you know yeah
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.160
sometimes you recycle code you know yeah
he's like I think that's interesting and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170
he's like I think that's interesting and
 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.870

umbrella of this talk is different ways

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880
umbrella of this talk is different ways
 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.060
umbrella of this talk is different ways
to recycle code and well not only to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070
to recycle code and well not only to
 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.590
to recycle code and well not only to
recycle code and I also wanted to make

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600
recycle code and I also wanted to make
 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.440
recycle code and I also wanted to make
it a little broader how in some of my

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
it a little broader how in some of my
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.290
it a little broader how in some of my
projects are either will reuse code or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300
projects are either will reuse code or
 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.910
projects are either will reuse code or
steal code that's a better way to put it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920
steal code that's a better way to put it
 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.510
steal code that's a better way to put it
or reuse or steal aesthetics and so it's

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520
or reuse or steal aesthetics and so it's
 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.860
or reuse or steal aesthetics and so it's
kind of like my interest in how computer

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
kind of like my interest in how computer
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.680
kind of like my interest in how computer
software and computer code all have

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
software and computer code all have
 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.710
software and computer code all have
their own aesthetic and just a lot of my

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
their own aesthetic and just a lot of my
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.860
their own aesthetic and just a lot of my
work deals with mucking around within

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870
work deals with mucking around within
 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.530
work deals with mucking around within
those within that aesthetic and stuff

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
those within that aesthetic and stuff
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.259
those within that aesthetic and stuff
like that so so I picked out a couple

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
like that so so I picked out a couple
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.150
like that so so I picked out a couple
problem a couple projects I think like

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160
problem a couple projects I think like
 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.979
problem a couple projects I think like
seven or eight that deal with those

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989
seven or eight that deal with those
 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.020
seven or eight that deal with those
topics and I tried to arrange them in a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
topics and I tried to arrange them in a
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.350
topics and I tried to arrange them in a
way that makes sense

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
way that makes sense
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.729
way that makes sense
first I'm going to talk about how I got

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
first I'm going to talk about how I got
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.530
first I'm going to talk about how I got
started doing this kind of stuff and it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
started doing this kind of stuff and it
 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.660
started doing this kind of stuff and it
talked a little bit about my work with

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670
talked a little bit about my work with
 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.490
talked a little bit about my work with
beige and that's how I got heavily

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
beige and that's how I got heavily
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.100
beige and that's how I got heavily
involved in this computer stuff and then

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110
involved in this computer stuff and then
 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.720
involved in this computer stuff and then
we're going to go through some projects

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730
we're going to go through some projects
 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.890
we're going to go through some projects
and the first thing we're going to talk

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
and the first thing we're going to talk
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.690
and the first thing we're going to talk
about is this project I did called data

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700
about is this project I did called data
 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.130
about is this project I did called data
diaries which is the project where I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140
diaries which is the project where I
 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.280
diaries which is the project where I
just kind of reinterpret some code that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
just kind of reinterpret some code that
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.600
just kind of reinterpret some code that
I found lying around and then we're

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610
I found lying around and then we're
 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.509
I found lying around and then we're
going to talk about projects that I

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519
going to talk about projects that I
 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.060
going to talk about projects that I
actually steal code from different

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070
actually steal code from different
 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.920
actually steal code from different
sources and turn them into our work most

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
sources and turn them into our work most
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.770
sources and turn them into our work most

do when I'm not screwing around with
 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.780
do when I'm not screwing around with
computers to give you an idea of like

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790

a general overview of my work this
 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.410
a general overview of my work this
doesn't make any sense now but hopefully

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420
doesn't make any sense now but hopefully
 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.030
doesn't make any sense now but hopefully
it'll make sense when I'm doing it and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
it'll make sense when I'm doing it and
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.699
it'll make sense when I'm doing it and
then I wanted to talk about a project I

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709
then I wanted to talk about a project I
 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.890
then I wanted to talk about a project I
did called the infinite filled zone that

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
did called the infinite filled zone that
 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.370

then I wanted to talk about my work with
 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.200
then I wanted to talk about my work with
IBM gorg which deals with a bunch of

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
IBM gorg which deals with a bunch of
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.330

that deal with page scraping which is a

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830
that deal with page scraping which is a
 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.999
that deal with page scraping which is a
technique where you just kind of scrape

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009
technique where you just kind of scrape
 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.999
technique where you just kind of scrape
all the data off of a website and

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009
all the data off of a website and
 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.900
all the data off of a website and
interpret it and then kind of throw it

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910
interpret it and then kind of throw it
 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.260
interpret it and then kind of throw it
back anyway I'll explain it in a bit so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270
back anyway I'll explain it in a bit so
 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.580
back anyway I'll explain it in a bit so
why don't we start off with the first

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
why don't we start off with the first
 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.810
why don't we start off with the first

got pretty heavy into computer art and

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599
got pretty heavy into computer art and
 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.500
got pretty heavy into computer art and
basically about two years into the

basically about two years into the
 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.360
basically about two years into the
program and it was a pretty heavy-duty

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
program and it was a pretty heavy-duty
 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520

I never had learned how to program until

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770
I never had learned how to program until
 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.939
I never had learned how to program until
I went to college and the reason I

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949
I went to college and the reason I
 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.260
I went to college and the reason I
wanted to learn how to program initially

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270
wanted to learn how to program initially
 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.360
wanted to learn how to program initially
initially is because after having being

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370
initially is because after having being
 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.770
initially is because after having being
trained as a class of big guitarists I

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
trained as a class of big guitarists I
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.440
trained as a class of big guitarists I
had no skills at all and so I was like

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450
had no skills at all and so I was like
 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.480

was like it was a practical decision at
 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.670
was like it was a practical decision at
first to learn computers you know what I

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680
first to learn computers you know what I
 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.860
first to learn computers you know what I
mean but as I learned computers and I

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870
mean but as I learned computers and I
 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.570
mean but as I learned computers and I
had all this excess energy from not

had all this excess energy from not
playing guitar six hours a day I got

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680
playing guitar six hours a day I got
 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.860
playing guitar six hours a day I got
pretty heavy into it and it was around

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870
pretty heavy into it and it was around
 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.780
pretty heavy into it and it was around
this time I started collaborating with a

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790
this time I started collaborating with a
 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.280
this time I started collaborating with a
person who have worked with for a number

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290
person who have worked with for a number
 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.740
person who have worked with for a number
of years named Paul B Davis and we

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750
of years named Paul B Davis and we
 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.330
of years named Paul B Davis and we
started a record label together called

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340
started a record label together called
 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.320
started a record label together called
beige records and it was in these early

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330
beige records and it was in these early
 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.620
beige records and it was in these early
collaborations with Paul that kind of

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630
collaborations with Paul that kind of
 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.120
collaborations with Paul that kind of
formed my my artistic look at computers

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130
formed my my artistic look at computers
 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.460
formed my my artistic look at computers
and we had done a lot of talking in

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470
and we had done a lot of talking in
 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.469
and we had done a lot of talking in
those days and that was the days of the

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479
those days and that was the days of the
 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.570
those days and that was the days of the
beginning beginnings of when media arts

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580
beginning beginnings of when media arts
 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.760
beginning beginnings of when media arts
started to hit pretty heavy in in kind

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770
started to hit pretty heavy in in kind
 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.170
started to hit pretty heavy in in kind
of liberal arts colleges you know and so

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180
of liberal arts colleges you know and so
 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.940
of liberal arts colleges you know and so
everyone was screwing on computers and

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950
 
 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.800
 
we just did a lot of talking and just

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810
we just did a lot of talking and just
 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.620
we just did a lot of talking and just
basically for whatever reason cornered

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630
basically for whatever reason cornered
 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.320
basically for whatever reason cornered
ourselves into a hole just being like

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330
ourselves into a hole just being like
 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.060
ourselves into a hole just being like
you know you gotta know how to program

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070
you know you gotta know how to program
 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.120
you know you gotta know how to program
and if you're not programming you're a

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130
and if you're not programming you're a
 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.740
and if you're not programming you're a
poser and I don't necessarily believe

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750
poser and I don't necessarily believe
 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.200
poser and I don't necessarily believe
this today but at the at that time I was

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210
this today but at the at that time I was
 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.580
this today but at the at that time I was
kind of a punk you know what I mean and

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590
kind of a punk you know what I mean and
 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.400
kind of a punk you know what I mean and
I was always like yo you know and so we

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410
I was always like yo you know and so we
 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.960
I was always like yo you know and so we
formed a record label called beige

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970
formed a record label called beige
 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.540
formed a record label called beige
records and it kind of it kind of acted

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
records and it kind of it kind of acted
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.890
records and it kind of it kind of acted
somewhat as a record label and also

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900
somewhat as a record label and also
 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.480
somewhat as a record label and also
somewhat as like a crew you know what I

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490
somewhat as like a crew you know what I
 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.460
somewhat as like a crew you know what I
mean like step two step two beige I mean

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470
mean like step two step two beige I mean
 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.830

was pre IPO eBay and you know like
 

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.589
was pre IPO eBay and you know like
everybody when they first learned about

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599
everybody when they first learned about
 

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:16.900
everybody when they first learned about
eBay they just have like a spaz out that

drains them of a couple hundred bucks

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:18.349
drains them of a couple hundred bucks
 

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:20.980
drains them of a couple hundred bucks
and for Paul it happened to drain him of

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:20.990
and for Paul it happened to drain him of
 

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.219
and for Paul it happened to drain him of
a couple hundred bucks on Ataris and so

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:24.229
a couple hundred bucks on Ataris and so
 

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:25.629
a couple hundred bucks on Ataris and so
our dorm room started to fill up with

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639
our dorm room started to fill up with
 

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.670
our dorm room started to fill up with
these old Atari computers and at a

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680
these old Atari computers and at a
 

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.089
these old Atari computers and at a
certain point we just had kind of a

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:31.099
certain point we just had kind of a
 

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:32.959
certain point we just had kind of a
flash mob idea we were like

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:32.969
flash mob idea we were like
 

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:34.189
flash mob idea we were like
well if we're gonna release another

00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:34.199
well if we're gonna release another
 

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:38.209
well if we're gonna release another
techno record let's let's do a record

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219
techno record let's let's do a record
 

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:39.800
techno record let's let's do a record
but let's make it on these old computers

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:39.810
but let's make it on these old computers
 

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.300
but let's make it on these old computers
right and so we came up with this record

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.310
right and so we came up with this record
 

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.689
right and so we came up with this record
it's called the 8-bit Construction Set

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:47.699
it's called the 8-bit Construction Set
 

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:52.429
it's called the 8-bit Construction Set
and yeah so basically the concept is

00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:52.439
and yeah so basically the concept is
 

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:55.400
and yeah so basically the concept is
that we made one side on the Commodore

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.410
that we made one side on the Commodore
 

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.740
that we made one side on the Commodore
64 home computer right and we made the

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:57.750
64 home computer right and we made the
 

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.300
64 home computer right and we made the
other side on the Atari 800 home

00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.310
other side on the Atari 800 home
 

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.340
other side on the Atari 800 home
computer and these are you know early

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.350
computer and these are you know early
 

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.730
computer and these are you know early
eighties Mac and PC you know I mean it

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740
eighties Mac and PC you know I mean it
 

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.019
eighties Mac and PC you know I mean it
was like these are the two computers

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:06.029
was like these are the two computers
 

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.579
was like these are the two computers
that people had that then people would

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:07.589
that people had that then people would
 

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.800
that people had that then people would
argue about which was cooler right and

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
argue about which was cooler right and
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.019
argue about which was cooler right and
so basically the idea of this record

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:12.029
so basically the idea of this record
 

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:15.170
so basically the idea of this record
it's actually a DJ battle record so it's

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180
it's actually a DJ battle record so it's
 

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.379
it's actually a DJ battle record so it's
them it was it's like it's it's for DJ's

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:18.389
them it was it's like it's it's for DJ's
 

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.269
them it was it's like it's it's for DJ's
you know like everybody familiar with

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279
you know like everybody familiar with
 

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:25.240
you know like everybody familiar with
scratch DJ battles okay anyway okay so

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
scratch DJ battles okay anyway okay so
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.740
scratch DJ battles okay anyway okay so
it just starts off like the record

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:27.750
it just starts off like the record
 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.410
it just starts off like the record
starts off with scratch taupe scratch

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420
starts off with scratch taupe scratch
 

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.379
starts off with scratch taupe scratch
tones so sounds for DJ's to scratch with

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:33.389
tones so sounds for DJ's to scratch with
 

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.509
tones so sounds for DJ's to scratch with
and then mock grooves which are infinite

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519
and then mock grooves which are infinite
 

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:40.639
and then mock grooves which are infinite
repeating loops and then a track like

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:40.649
repeating loops and then a track like
 

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:43.220
repeating loops and then a track like
just like a straight up club track you

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.230
just like a straight up club track you
 

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.309
just like a straight up club track you
know what I mean and then data which is

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:46.319
know what I mean and then data which is
 

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:49.369
know what I mean and then data which is
like a lot of people forget that before

00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:49.379
like a lot of people forget that before
 

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:50.960
like a lot of people forget that before
floppy drives were commercially

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:50.970
floppy drives were commercially
 

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.569
floppy drives were commercially
available computers used to store

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:53.579
available computers used to store
 

00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:56.030
available computers used to store
programs on cassette tape as audio files

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040
programs on cassette tape as audio files
 

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.600
programs on cassette tape as audio files
and so these tracks on the end of the

00:09:59.600 --> 00:09:59.610
and so these tracks on the end of the
 

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.730
and so these tracks on the end of the
record are programs for the Commodore

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
record are programs for the Commodore
 

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.530
record are programs for the Commodore
and the Atari that you could then load

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540
and the Atari that you could then load
 

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.119
and the Atari that you could then load
onto cassette tape and then load and

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:05.129
onto cassette tape and then load and
 

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:07.759
onto cassette tape and then load and
execute into your computer and so it's

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:07.769
execute into your computer and so it's
 

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:10.040
execute into your computer and so it's
also this record is also in a way a

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.050
also this record is also in a way a
 

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.259
also this record is also in a way a
software distribution and so we were

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:12.269
software distribution and so we were
 

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:14.299
software distribution and so we were
really happy about that and while we

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:14.309
really happy about that and while we
 

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:15.769
really happy about that and while we
were making this record basically yes

00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779
were making this record basically yes
 

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:19.119
were making this record basically yes
yes questions good very good I love it

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:19.129

actually made in our band the acid heads

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860
actually made in our band the acid heads
 

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.600
actually made in our band the acid heads
and this is what a 303 sounds like here

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.610
and this is what a 303 sounds like here
 

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:48.199
and this is what a 303 sounds like here
right right hold on yo anyway that make

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:48.209
right right hold on yo anyway that make
 

00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:49.840
right right hold on yo anyway that make
any sense at all

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:49.850
any sense at all
 

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.329
any sense at all
it's like acid house was like this

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339
it's like acid house was like this
 

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:55.310
it's like acid house was like this
version of house music was this one

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320
version of house music was this one
 

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.139
version of house music was this one
synthesizer it just made this one

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:57.149
synthesizer it just made this one
 

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.690
synthesizer it just made this one
particular noise and we were heavy

00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700
particular noise and we were heavy
 

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.550
particular noise and we were heavy
techno nerds and to a certain extent

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560
techno nerds and to a certain extent
 

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.740
techno nerds and to a certain extent
still and I still am a heavy techno nerd

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:03.750
still and I still am a heavy techno nerd
 

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.490
still and I still am a heavy techno nerd
but so yeah this is a program on the

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500
but so yeah this is a program on the
 

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.680
but so yeah this is a program on the
camera that's was supposedly to emulate

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:09.690
camera that's was supposedly to emulate
 

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.910
camera that's was supposedly to emulate
that kind of sound which is just

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920
that kind of sound which is just
 

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.389
that kind of sound which is just
ridiculous but and the Atari side does

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399
ridiculous but and the Atari side does
 

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.889
ridiculous but and the Atari side does
essentially the same thing but it's not

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899
essentially the same thing but it's not
 

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:19.490
essentially the same thing but it's not
quite as involved so does that yeah so

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500
quite as involved so does that yeah so
 

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.350
quite as involved so does that yeah so
that's what it would do to answer Mark's

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360
that's what it would do to answer Mark's
 

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.870
that's what it would do to answer Mark's
question are there any questions about

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880
question are there any questions about
 

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.000
question are there any questions about
this I should also say that there's four

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.010
this I should also say that there's four
 

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.530
this I should also say that there's four
people and it took us about two and a

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540
people and it took us about two and a
 

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.720
people and it took us about two and a
half years to make it and it was in this

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:29.730
half years to make it and it was in this
 

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.660
half years to make it and it was in this
time that we got really heavy-duty into

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:32.670
time that we got really heavy-duty into
 

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.860
time that we got really heavy-duty into
learning how to program these old

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:33.870
learning how to program these old
 

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:39.199
learning how to program these old
computers question oh that's a real I

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:39.209
computers question oh that's a real I
 

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:41.090
computers question oh that's a real I
don't think so many people did like a

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100

and you'd have to ask my my friend Paul
 

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.870
and you'd have to ask my my friend Paul
this and I think maybe one kid got the

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880
this and I think maybe one kid got the
 

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.670

Commodore side but it has a problem
 

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.230
Commodore side but it has a problem
because you have to do it right when you

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240
because you have to do it right when you
 

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.829
because you have to do it right when you
buy the record or it gets scratched you

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839
buy the record or it gets scratched you
 

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:57.139

and that really got me started on making

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:27.459
and that really got me started on making
 

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:29.310

would anyway like I said we were pretty

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.100
would anyway like I said we were pretty
 

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.250
would anyway like I said we were pretty
young anyway so but that came out in

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:17.260
young anyway so but that came out in
 

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.380
young anyway so but that came out in
2001 so that's pretty old but it kind of

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:19.390
2001 so that's pretty old but it kind of
 

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.100
2001 so that's pretty old but it kind of
really set the pace for me to making

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.110
really set the pace for me to making
 

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.090
really set the pace for me to making
this computer stuff so around that time

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.100
this computer stuff so around that time
 

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.510
this computer stuff so around that time
I was also got into programming one to

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:30.520
I was also got into programming one to
 

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.400
I was also got into programming one to
make like to screw on that kind of

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:32.410
make like to screw on that kind of
 

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.100
make like to screw on that kind of
computers into the first kind of

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.110
computers into the first kind of
 

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.110
computers into the first kind of
heavy-duty computer art I made that debt

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120
heavy-duty computer art I made that debt
 

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.060
heavy-duty computer art I made that debt
was code was just to play pranks on

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.070
was code was just to play pranks on
 

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.910
was code was just to play pranks on
people in my school and so I just oh let

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920
people in my school and so I just oh let
 

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.750
people in my school and so I just oh let
me so I so I just wanted to like for

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760
me so I so I just wanted to like for

remember doing in doing by taking apart

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.130
remember doing in doing by taking apart
 

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.949
remember doing in doing by taking apart
a program and disassembling it and

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959
a program and disassembling it and
 

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.040
a program and disassembling it and
reassembling it was it it was back in

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.050
reassembling it was it it was back in
 

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.620
reassembling it was it it was back in
when I went to school kids we had a

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:58.630
when I went to school kids we had a
 

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.389
when I went to school kids we had a
public computer lab and everyone used

00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399
public computer lab and everyone used
 

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.730
public computer lab and everyone used
that lab to check their email and they

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:02.740
that lab to check their email and they
 

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.500
that lab to check their email and they
needed to use a program called telnet

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.510
needed to use a program called telnet
 

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.690
needed to use a program called telnet
which you know now I think you probably

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:06.700
which you know now I think you probably
 

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.430
which you know now I think you probably
have like some online system or whatever

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440
have like some online system or whatever
 

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.269
have like some online system or whatever
and so you'd have to open up telnet and

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279
and so you'd have to open up telnet and
 

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.170
and so you'd have to open up telnet and
and so I

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:13.180
and so I
 

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.060
and so I
I disassembled it does everyone know

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.070
I disassembled it does everyone know
 

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.640
I disassembled it does everyone know
what disassembling means like all

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:17.650
what disassembling means like all
 

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.640
what disassembling means like all
programs on computer are a star this is

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.650
programs on computer are a star this is
 

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.410
programs on computer are a star this is
where this I'm you guys have to help me

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:22.420
where this I'm you guys have to help me
 

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.610
where this I'm you guys have to help me
here our data that's been compiled for

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:26.620
here our data that's been compiled for
 

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.650
here our data that's been compiled for
the machine right and it's just a bunch

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:28.660
the machine right and it's just a bunch
 

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.390
the machine right and it's just a bunch
of ones and zeros and the funny thing

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:30.400
of ones and zeros and the funny thing
 

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.980
of ones and zeros and the funny thing
that a lot of people don't know is you

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:31.990
that a lot of people don't know is you
 

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.770
that a lot of people don't know is you
could then disassemble that and then it

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:34.780
could then disassemble that and then it
 

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.870
could then disassemble that and then it
becomes into sort of a language that you

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880
becomes into sort of a language that you
 

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.220
becomes into sort of a language that you
could understand and then you can go

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.230
could understand and then you can go
 

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.900
could understand and then you can go
futzing with all of that and then

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:39.910
futzing with all of that and then
 

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.000
futzing with all of that and then
reassemble it and then it will do

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.010
reassemble it and then it will do
 

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.140
reassemble it and then it will do
something a little bit different and so

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.150
something a little bit different and so
 

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.490
something a little bit different and so
the first thing I did was I made a mail

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.500
the first thing I did was I made a mail
 

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.410
the first thing I did was I made a mail
program that I would install on all the

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:46.420
program that I would install on all the
 

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.700
program that I would install on all the
computers at school so when you went

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:47.710
computers at school so when you went
 

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.290
computers at school so when you went
when kids went to check their mail the

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.300
when kids went to check their mail the
 

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.300
when kids went to check their mail the
computer would shut down and the cd-rom

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.310
computer would shut down and the cd-rom
 

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.950
computer would shut down and the cd-rom
drive it open and I thought that was the

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:52.960
drive it open and I thought that was the
 

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.280
drive it open and I thought that was the
greatest thing ever because he I could

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.290
greatest thing ever because he I could
 

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.560
greatest thing ever because he I could
just kind of like sit at one computer

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:58.570
just kind of like sit at one computer
 

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.910
just kind of like sit at one computer
and pretend like I was working and some

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.670
kid would sit down and be like and then
they would be like you know and then go

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680
they would be like you know and then go
 

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.620
they would be like you know and then go

computers and take apart and see how

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:14.830
computers and take apart and see how
 

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.370
computers and take apart and see how
operating systems works how operating

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:17.380

between a blink tag and that's why the
 

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.810

phase when I was fussing around in

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:23.260
phase when I was fussing around in
 

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.650
phase when I was fussing around in
school in the public lab and I did this

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:25.660
school in the public lab and I did this
 

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.270
school in the public lab and I did this
other thing that I used to call called

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280
other thing that I used to call called
 

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.510
other thing that I used to call called
um RAM fishing and so what people don't

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520
um RAM fishing and so what people don't
 

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.880
um RAM fishing and so what people don't
know is that the random access processor

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:32.890
know is that the random access processor
 

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.250
know is that the random access processor
of a computer never gets erased it just

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:35.260
of a computer never gets erased it just
 

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.170
of a computer never gets erased it just
gets overwritten until the computer is

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.180
gets overwritten until the computer is
 

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.840
gets overwritten until the computer is
turned off and so what that means is

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:39.850
turned off and so what that means is
 

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.860
turned off and so what that means is
that if you have a computer in

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:40.870
that if you have a computer in
 

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.540
that if you have a computer in
public lab or at least then when you had

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:42.550
public lab or at least then when you had
 

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.180
public lab or at least then when you had
a computer in the public lab it's the

people using that computer all their

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160
people using that computer all their
 

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.860
people using that computer all their
junk was sitting in the random access

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:49.870

they were writing a paper it would get

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:53.860
they were writing a paper it would get
 

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.410
they were writing a paper it would get
loaded into RAM and when they quit the

loaded into RAM and when they quit the
 

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.660
loaded into RAM and when they quit the
program most likely parts of that paper

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:57.670
program most likely parts of that paper
 

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.190
program most likely parts of that paper
were still in RAM and when they are

00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200
were still in RAM and when they are
 

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.840

writing emails the same thing so I used

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:00.850
writing emails the same thing so I used
 

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.580
writing emails the same thing so I used
to go Ram phishing which was I'd sit

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:02.590
to go Ram phishing which was I'd sit
 

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.230
to go Ram phishing which was I'd sit
down at a computer in the public lab and

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240
down at a computer in the public lab and
 

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.120
down at a computer in the public lab and
just fish through a ram for Strings and

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.130
just fish through a ram for Strings and
 

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.010
just fish through a ram for Strings and
see what people had left behind and it

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.020
see what people had left behind and it
 

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.080
see what people had left behind and it
was kind of a way for me to to just

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.090
was kind of a way for me to to just
 

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.049
was kind of a way for me to to just
giggle a little bit and then and this

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:13.059
giggle a little bit and then and this
 

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:14.760
giggle a little bit and then and this
project comes out of that because I I

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:14.770
project comes out of that because I I

was then started screwing with the

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:17.710
was then started screwing with the
 

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.340
was then started screwing with the
QuickTime file format and I learned that

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.350
QuickTime file format and I learned that
 

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.080
QuickTime file format and I learned that
it was a funny thing you could do with a

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.090
it was a funny thing you could do with a
 

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.900
it was a funny thing you could do with a
QuickTime file cook time is like a movie

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:24.910
QuickTime file cook time is like a movie
 

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.720
QuickTime file cook time is like a movie
file on a computer right and see it

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:27.730
file on a computer right and see it
 

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.430
file on a computer right and see it
stopped me if this gets too technical

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440
stopped me if this gets too technical
 

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.720
stopped me if this gets too technical
I wanted this talk to be a little bit

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:30.730
I wanted this talk to be a little bit
 

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.130
I wanted this talk to be a little bit
technical all right ok anyway basically

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:35.140
technical all right ok anyway basically
 

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.750
technical all right ok anyway basically
what I would do is I would have a movie

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760
what I would do is I would have a movie
 

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.720
what I would do is I would have a movie
on the harddrive right and then a file

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:39.730
on the harddrive right and then a file
 

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.250
on the harddrive right and then a file
on the macintosh a-- at the time was

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.260
on the macintosh a-- at the time was
 

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.560
on the macintosh a-- at the time was
organized in two parts one the part of

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:43.570
organized in two parts one the part of
 

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.910
organized in two parts one the part of
the file called the header which told

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:44.920
the file called the header which told
 

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.169
the file called the header which told
the computer what was about to happen

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:46.179
the computer what was about to happen
 

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:48.780
the computer what was about to happen
the header says look computer this is a

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:48.790
the header says look computer this is a
 

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.210
the header says look computer this is a
movie it's going to be two minutes long

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:51.220
movie it's going to be two minutes long
 

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.120
movie it's going to be two minutes long
it's going to be in 16 colors and it's

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.130
it's going to be in 16 colors and it's
 

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.890
it's going to be in 16 colors and it's
going to have an audio track right and

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:55.900
going to have an audio track right and
 

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.020
going to have an audio track right and
the second part of the file is the data

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.030
the second part of the file is the data
 

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.660
the second part of the file is the data
which then that header will read through

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:00.670
which then that header will read through
 

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.260
which then that header will read through
right and so I found by accident that if

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.270
right and so I found by accident that if
 

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.600
right and so I found by accident that if
you delete the data and you double-click

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:06.610
you delete the data and you double-click
 

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.500
you delete the data and you double-click
on the file

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.510
on the file
 

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.650
on the file
it had a QuickTime didn't have any error

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:10.660
it had a QuickTime didn't have any error
 

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.720
it had a QuickTime didn't have any error
checking so it would be like cool we're

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:12.730
checking so it would be like cool we're
 

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.980
checking so it would be like cool we're
gonna have a movie it's gonna be five

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:13.990
gonna have a movie it's gonna be five
 

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.720
gonna have a movie it's gonna be five
minutes long it's gonna be 16 colors and

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:15.730
minutes long it's gonna be 16 colors and
 

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.370
minutes long it's gonna be 16 colors and
then it would just play whatever is in

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:17.380
then it would just play whatever is in
 

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.919
then it would just play whatever is in
the RAM because they had no I had no

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:19.929
the RAM because they had no I had no
 

00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:22.860
the RAM because they had no I had no
idea and the way I found out about this

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:22.870
idea and the way I found out about this
 

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.340
idea and the way I found out about this
was by accident is you know I just I

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.350
was by accident is you know I just I
 

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.620
was by accident is you know I just I
just downloaded a movie and I just

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:28.630
just downloaded a movie and I just
 

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.600
just downloaded a movie and I just
forced quit right after I downloaded it

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:30.610
forced quit right after I downloaded it
 

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.799
forced quit right after I downloaded it
you don't I mean and then I found out

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:31.809
you don't I mean and then I found out
 

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:33.810
you don't I mean and then I found out
how it happened and so the I eventually

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:33.820
how it happened and so the I eventually
 

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.310
how it happened and so the I eventually
ended up doing a project called data

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320
ended up doing a project called data
 

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.380
ended up doing a project called data
diaries out of that which basically what

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.390
diaries out of that which basically what
 

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.390
diaries out of that which basically what
I did was I made a movie out of my RAM

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400
I did was I made a movie out of my RAM
 

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.060
I did was I made a movie out of my RAM
for every day of the month and so does

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.070
for every day of the month and so does
 

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.530
for every day of the month and so does
that make sense so every day it changes

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:43.540
that make sense so every day it changes
 

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.880
that make sense so every day it changes
because god knows what I did that day

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:44.890
because god knows what I did that day
 

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.360
because god knows what I did that day
and so I made 31 movies each one for the

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.370
and so I made 31 movies each one for the
 

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.830
and so I made 31 movies each one for the
day of the month and so I made a website

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840
day of the month and so I made a website
 

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.890
day of the month and so I made a website
for it so let's watch the movies but I

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:52.900
for it so let's watch the movies but I
 

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.740
for it so let's watch the movies but I
can wider color

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:57.750
 
 

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.680
 
okay what day what day did we like okay

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:01.690
okay what day what day did we like okay

think the highest school in Gore goalie
 

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.510
think the highest school in Gore goalie
ever because he would take slap shots

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520
ever because he would take slap shots
 

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.120
ever because he would take slap shots
and wing them off the glass and it would

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.130
and wing them off the glass and it would
 

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.920
and wing them off the glass and it would
bounce into the net very talented man

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:43.570
yeah let's get back to the computer art
 

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.260
yeah let's get back to the computer art
please all right so here's the 27th Oh

gonna be 16 colors and it's gonna be 11

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880
gonna be 16 colors and it's gonna be 11
 

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.960
gonna be 16 colors and it's gonna be 11
minutes long so it's a haul all 128

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:00.970
minutes long so it's a haul all 128
 

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.360
minutes long so it's a haul all 128
megabytes of my RAM let's skip ahead a

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:03.370
megabytes of my RAM let's skip ahead a
 

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.570
megabytes of my RAM let's skip ahead a
little bit oh this is what happens when

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:06.580
little bit oh this is what happens when
 

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.250
little bit oh this is what happens when
the computer crashes and it resets the

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:08.260
the computer crashes and it resets the
 

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.240
the computer crashes and it resets the
RAM so my kid let's see if oh this is

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.250
RAM so my kid let's see if oh this is
 

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.389
RAM so my kid let's see if oh this is
the cool part hold on

00:23:15.389 --> 00:23:15.399
 
 

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:19.889
 
oh man there we go what's up reset oh

00:23:19.889 --> 00:23:19.899
oh man there we go what's up reset oh
 

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:24.359
oh man there we go what's up reset oh
there we go but the thing you should I

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:24.369
there we go but the thing you should I
 

00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:25.440
there we go but the thing you should I
should know about this is I basically

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.450
should know about this is I basically
 

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.200
should know about this is I basically
didn't do anything you know what I mean

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.210
didn't do anything you know what I mean
 

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.659
didn't do anything you know what I mean
that was so it was cool about this

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:30.669
that was so it was cool about this
 

00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:34.700
that was so it was cool about this
project it was like totally low stress

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.710
project it was like totally low stress
 

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.229
project it was like totally low stress
and for those of you taking notes it's

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:37.239
and for those of you taking notes it's
 

00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:38.759
and for those of you taking notes it's
on turbulence it was a commissioned by

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:38.769
on turbulence it was a commissioned by
 

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.829
on turbulence it was a commissioned by
turbulence which is a place that

00:23:40.829 --> 00:23:40.839
turbulence which is a place that
 

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.389
turbulence which is a place that
commissions by Bart and still to this

00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:42.399
commissions by Bart and still to this
 

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:44.909
commissions by Bart and still to this
day so yeah this is what happened my

00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919
day so yeah this is what happened my
 

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:46.950
day so yeah this is what happened my
computer obviously crashed emails

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960
computer obviously crashed emails
 

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.829
computer obviously crashed emails
whatever so does that make sense so all

00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:49.839
whatever so does that make sense so all
 

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:51.749
whatever so does that make sense so all
the days look basically similar let's go

00:23:51.749 --> 00:23:51.759
the days look basically similar let's go
 

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:53.479
the days look basically similar let's go
to a different date one more day anybody

00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:53.489
to a different date one more day anybody
 

00:23:53.489 --> 00:24:03.029
to a different date one more day anybody
okay oh I said that I had a sound I just

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039
okay oh I said that I had a sound I just
 

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:05.759
okay oh I said that I had a sound I just
said that it had a sound file in it and

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:05.769
said that it had a sound file in it and
 

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:07.829
said that it had a sound file in it and
so it's just okay that date is there's

00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:07.839
so it's just okay that date is there's
 

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:11.149
so it's just okay that date is there's
data there's sound data there too right

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159
data there's sound data there too right
 

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:14.609
data there's sound data there too right
like it just basically the entire

00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:14.619
like it just basically the entire
 

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.259
like it just basically the entire
project came down to what the header was

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:16.269
project came down to what the header was
 

00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:17.700
project came down to what the header was
and the way I designed the header was

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:17.710
and the way I designed the header was
 

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.430
and the way I designed the header was
what would what would be just enough for

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440
what would what would be just enough for
 

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.379
what would what would be just enough for
people to see in real time over a 56k

00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:22.389
people to see in real time over a 56k
 

00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:24.450
people to see in real time over a 56k
modem and so it ended up being a movie

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:24.460
modem and so it ended up being a movie
 

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.729
modem and so it ended up being a movie
this size with this sound file and so it

00:24:26.729 --> 00:24:26.739
this size with this sound file and so it
 

00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:28.769
this size with this sound file and so it
was kind of like half determined by the

00:24:28.769 --> 00:24:28.779
was kind of like half determined by the
 

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:31.109
was kind of like half determined by the
restrictions of the web and I guess half

00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:31.119
restrictions of the web and I guess half
 

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:35.060
restrictions of the web and I guess half
determined I don't yeah that's it oh

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.070
determined I don't yeah that's it oh
 

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:42.190
determined I don't yeah that's it oh
that looks cool

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200
 
 

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:51.519
 
yeah question oh no because because the

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:51.529
yeah question oh no because because the
 

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:53.080
yeah question oh no because because the
QuickTime movie would have to have been

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.090
QuickTime movie would have to have been
 

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.789
QuickTime movie would have to have been
the same the same size of this and this

00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799
the same the same size of this and this
 

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:59.560
the same the same size of this and this
actually the trick about this is that

00:24:59.560 --> 00:24:59.570
actually the trick about this is that
 

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.970
actually the trick about this is that
this is actually a quicktime movie about

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:00.980
this is actually a quicktime movie about
 

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.609
this is actually a quicktime movie about
that big that I'm just blowing up on the

00:25:03.609 --> 00:25:03.619
that big that I'm just blowing up on the
 

00:25:03.619 --> 00:25:06.070
that big that I'm just blowing up on the
website well I do get sounds if sounds

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
website well I do get sounds if sounds
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.509
website well I do get sounds if sounds
are uncompressed you could hear like

00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:07.519
are uncompressed you could hear like
 

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.129
are uncompressed you could hear like
like if I made something on Pro Tools

00:25:09.129 --> 00:25:09.139
like if I made something on Pro Tools
 

00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:10.989
like if I made something on Pro Tools
that day you would hear all the samples

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:10.999
that day you would hear all the samples
 

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:13.139
that day you would hear all the samples
in Pro Tools and stuff like that so

00:25:13.139 --> 00:25:13.149
in Pro Tools and stuff like that so
 

00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:15.549
in Pro Tools and stuff like that so
never video but sound because sound is

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559
never video but sound because sound is
 

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:17.789
never video but sound because sound is
often stored uncompressed on a computer

00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799
often stored uncompressed on a computer
 

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:22.930
often stored uncompressed on a computer
does that make sense no the actual movie

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:22.940
does that make sense no the actual movie
 

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.539
does that make sense no the actual movie
is about this big and what I'm doing on

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:25.549
is about this big and what I'm doing on
 

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:27.340
is about this big and what I'm doing on
the website is I'm stretching it and so

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:27.350
the website is I'm stretching it and so
 

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.430
the website is I'm stretching it and so
that's why it it loads so quickly

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440
that's why it it loads so quickly
 

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.509
that's why it it loads so quickly
because it's really tiny and this I mean

00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:34.519
because it's really tiny and this I mean
 

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:36.220
because it's really tiny and this I mean
if I would make it again today the movie

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:36.230
if I would make it again today the movie
 

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.840
if I would make it again today the movie
the pixels would be smaller because

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:37.850
the pixels would be smaller because
 

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:43.210
the pixels would be smaller because
vanitha today is a lot that's cool so it

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:43.220
vanitha today is a lot that's cool so it
 

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.619
vanitha today is a lot that's cool so it
was a fun project because I would just

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:44.629
was a fun project because I would just
 

00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:46.090
was a fun project because I would just
do it every day and then sit and watch

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:46.100
do it every day and then sit and watch
 

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.529
do it every day and then sit and watch
it I'd be like oh cool

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:47.539
it I'd be like oh cool
 

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:54.489
it I'd be like oh cool
I'll be like go me or whatever okay so

00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:54.499
I'll be like go me or whatever okay so
 

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:56.470
I'll be like go me or whatever okay so
yeah I wanted to show that because that

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480
yeah I wanted to show that because that
 

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.359
yeah I wanted to show that because that
I'm trying to keep this talk under

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:58.369
I'm trying to keep this talk under
 

00:25:58.369 --> 00:25:59.830
I'm trying to keep this talk under
control and that's an example just

00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840
control and that's an example just
 

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.989
control and that's an example just
basically just using data that's lying

00:26:01.989 --> 00:26:01.999
basically just using data that's lying
 

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:04.210
basically just using data that's lying
around as art projects right like

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:04.220
around as art projects right like
 

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.019
around as art projects right like
garbage I mean it's essentially garbage

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:07.029
garbage I mean it's essentially garbage
 

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:09.820
garbage I mean it's essentially garbage
okay so next the part of the talk that I

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:09.830
okay so next the part of the talk that I
 

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.039
okay so next the part of the talk that I
want to get into is getting more into

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:12.049
want to get into is getting more into
 

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:13.840
want to get into is getting more into
the disassembly and talking about

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:13.850
the disassembly and talking about
 

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.700
the disassembly and talking about
Nintendo modifications which is another

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:15.710
Nintendo modifications which is another
 

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.549
Nintendo modifications which is another
thing that I do quite a bit and I wanted

00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559
thing that I do quite a bit and I wanted
 

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.430
thing that I do quite a bit and I wanted
to talk about the four different kind of

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440
to talk about the four different kind of
 

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.229
to talk about the four different kind of
a Nintendo modifications and see if I

00:26:23.229 --> 00:26:23.239
a Nintendo modifications and see if I
 

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:26.619
a Nintendo modifications and see if I
could make them make any sense the first

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:26.629
could make them make any sense the first
 

00:26:26.629 --> 00:26:28.479
could make them make any sense the first
one I wanted to talk about oh is Hogan's

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:28.489
one I wanted to talk about oh is Hogan's
 

00:26:28.489 --> 00:26:32.769
one I wanted to talk about oh is Hogan's
Alley perfect okay so around the same

00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:32.779
Alley perfect okay so around the same
 

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.139
Alley perfect okay so around the same
time after the record was done Paul and

00:26:35.139 --> 00:26:35.149
time after the record was done Paul and
 

00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:37.570
time after the record was done Paul and
I started making Nintendo cartridges and

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:37.580
I started making Nintendo cartridges and
 

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.369
I started making Nintendo cartridges and
we learned that you could take apart oh

00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:42.379
we learned that you could take apart oh
 

00:26:42.379 --> 00:26:46.810
we learned that you could take apart oh
yeah perfect wow thank you okay oh but

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:46.820
yeah perfect wow thank you okay oh but
 

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.739
yeah perfect wow thank you okay oh but
this is we're not supposed to see this

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:47.749
this is we're not supposed to see this
 

00:26:47.749 --> 00:26:47.950
this is we're not supposed to see this
yet

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960
yet
 

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.190
yet
yeah sorry that's that's that's three

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200
yeah sorry that's that's that's three
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.479
yeah sorry that's that's that's three
projects no no you could keep it on a

00:26:52.479 --> 00:26:52.489
projects no no you could keep it on a
 

00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:56.440
projects no no you could keep it on a
Nintendo okay so that you could take

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:56.450
Nintendo okay so that you could take
 

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.029
Nintendo okay so that you could take
apart a Nintendo cartridges and there's

00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039
apart a Nintendo cartridges and there's
 

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:00.580
apart a Nintendo cartridges and there's
two chips inside of it and one is a

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:00.590
two chips inside of it and one is a
 

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.889
two chips inside of it and one is a
program chip and one is a graphics chip

00:27:02.889 --> 00:27:02.899
program chip and one is a graphics chip
 

00:27:02.899 --> 00:27:04.629
program chip and one is a graphics chip
and essentially a video game the program

00:27:04.629 --> 00:27:04.639
and essentially a video game the program
 

00:27:04.639 --> 00:27:06.070
and essentially a video game the program
chip tells the graphics to move around

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080
chip tells the graphics to move around
 

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.659
chip tells the graphics to move around
and that's what becomes the game right

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:07.669
and that's what becomes the game right
 

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:11.710
and that's what becomes the game right
and so by soldering different chips into

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720
and so by soldering different chips into
 

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.349
and so by soldering different chips into
back into these cartridges I've done a

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:14.359
back into these cartridges I've done a
 

00:27:14.359 --> 00:27:17.019
back into these cartridges I've done a
lot of projects which kind of just screw

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:17.029
lot of projects which kind of just screw
 

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:20.259
lot of projects which kind of just screw
with video games in different ways some

00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:20.269
with video games in different ways some
 

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:21.639
with video games in different ways some
of them are where I just changed the

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:21.649
of them are where I just changed the
 

00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:23.259
of them are where I just changed the
graphics of a video game which is called

00:27:23.259 --> 00:27:23.269
graphics of a video game which is called
 

00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:25.599
graphics of a video game which is called
a graphics hack which is very easy and I

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:25.609
a graphics hack which is very easy and I
 

00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:27.460
a graphics hack which is very easy and I
hope that you guys could come away with

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:27.470
hope that you guys could come away with
 

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.779
hope that you guys could come away with
this lecture knowing that it isn't so

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:28.789
this lecture knowing that it isn't so
 

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:31.989
this lecture knowing that it isn't so
hard to do another kind of hack is a

00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:31.999
hard to do another kind of hack is a
 

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:33.820
hard to do another kind of hack is a
program hack where you keep the graphics

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:33.830
program hack where you keep the graphics
 

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.169
program hack where you keep the graphics
of the game the same but you tell them

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:35.179
of the game the same but you tell them
 

00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:39.249
of the game the same but you tell them
to do different things and the third

00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:39.259
to do different things and the third
 

00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:41.039
to do different things and the third
kind of hack I wanted to talk about is

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.049
kind of hack I wanted to talk about is
 

00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:43.269
kind of hack I wanted to talk about is
where you just basically barely do

00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279
where you just basically barely do
 

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.830
where you just basically barely do
anything to the game and keep it the

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840
anything to the game and keep it the
 

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.200
anything to the game and keep it the
same and not that's what I'm into right

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:47.210
same and not that's what I'm into right
 

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.700
same and not that's what I'm into right
now which is kind of a little bit too

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:48.710
now which is kind of a little bit too
 

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.720
now which is kind of a little bit too
obscure I think but that's okay and then

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:52.730
obscure I think but that's okay and then
 

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.220
obscure I think but that's okay and then
the fourth kind of hack of a Nintendo

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:54.230
the fourth kind of hack of a Nintendo
 

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.720
the fourth kind of hack of a Nintendo
game is just by writing something from

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:55.730
game is just by writing something from
 

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.849
game is just by writing something from
scratch and but I wanted to talk about

00:27:57.849 --> 00:27:57.859
scratch and but I wanted to talk about
 

00:27:57.859 --> 00:27:59.739
scratch and but I wanted to talk about
the first thing is graphics hacks so

00:27:59.739 --> 00:27:59.749
the first thing is graphics hacks so
 

00:27:59.749 --> 00:28:02.139
the first thing is graphics hacks so
basically you just leave the program of

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:02.149
basically you just leave the program of
 

00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:04.089
basically you just leave the program of
the game alone and you switch the

00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:04.099
the game alone and you switch the
 

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.379
the game alone and you switch the
graphics and so basically you're just

00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:05.389
graphics and so basically you're just
 

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:07.299
graphics and so basically you're just
appropriating the program code from a

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:07.309
appropriating the program code from a
 

00:28:07.309 --> 00:28:08.830
appropriating the program code from a
game and it's quite common and you could

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840
game and it's quite common and you could
 

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.779
game and it's quite common and you could
do it to most games you'd be surprised

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:10.789
do it to most games you'd be surprised
 

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:13.229
do it to most games you'd be surprised
how many games are able to be modified

00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:13.239
how many games are able to be modified
 

00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:16.359
how many games are able to be modified
so just so you guys know that you should

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:16.369
so just so you guys know that you should
 

00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:16.960
so just so you guys know that you should
look into it

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:16.970
look into it
 

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.139
look into it
Wolfenstein is the easiest to learn I

00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:20.149
Wolfenstein is the easiest to learn I
 

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:22.659
Wolfenstein is the easiest to learn I
found out kapha Wolfenstein on the Mac

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:22.669
found out kapha Wolfenstein on the Mac
 

00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:24.999
found out kapha Wolfenstein on the Mac
and Jody did a famous piece the artist

00:28:24.999 --> 00:28:25.009
and Jody did a famous piece the artist
 

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:27.849
and Jody did a famous piece the artist
Jody org called I think it was untitled

00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:27.859
Jody org called I think it was untitled
 

00:28:27.859 --> 00:28:30.249
Jody org called I think it was untitled
do you untitled or s OD

00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:30.259
do you untitled or s OD
 

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:33.159
do you untitled or s OD
anyway SOT yeah and so um well let me

00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:33.169
anyway SOT yeah and so um well let me
 

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.509
anyway SOT yeah and so um well let me
show you this hack and so this is the

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519
show you this hack and so this is the
 

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:35.859
show you this hack and so this is the
hack of the game called Hogan's Alley

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:35.869
hack of the game called Hogan's Alley
 

00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:37.839
hack of the game called Hogan's Alley
and what I in Hogan's Alley is one of

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:37.849
and what I in Hogan's Alley is one of
 

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.580
and what I in Hogan's Alley is one of
those shoot-'em-up games and what I did

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:39.590
those shoot-'em-up games and what I did
 

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.499
those shoot-'em-up games and what I did
was called change it to I shot Andy

00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:41.509
was called change it to I shot Andy
 

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:43.690
was called change it to I shot Andy
Warhol and so essentially I just changed

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:43.700
Warhol and so essentially I just changed
 

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.519
Warhol and so essentially I just changed
all the graphics graphics around right

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:45.529
all the graphics graphics around right
 

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:49.100
all the graphics graphics around right
okay

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.110
 
 

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:53.870
 
oh good okay so and then in a second in

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880
oh good okay so and then in a second in
 

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.850
oh good okay so and then in a second in
a second you'll see the characters and

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860
a second you'll see the characters and
 

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.919
a second you'll see the characters and
so I put you have to shoot the Warhol's

00:28:57.919 --> 00:28:57.929
so I put you have to shoot the Warhol's
 

00:28:57.929 --> 00:29:00.080
so I put you have to shoot the Warhol's
and then of course I switch the bottom

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.090
and then of course I switch the bottom
 

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.140
and then of course I switch the bottom
guys a self-explanatory to the Pope

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.150
guys a self-explanatory to the Pope
 

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.240
guys a self-explanatory to the Pope
Flavor Flav and Colonel Santa's and so

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.250
Flavor Flav and Colonel Santa's and so
 

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.940
Flavor Flav and Colonel Santa's and so
the game acts just like normal and I I

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:07.950
the game acts just like normal and I I
 

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.000
the game acts just like normal and I I
think I I think I could get it to play I

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.010
think I I think I could get it to play I
 

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.460
think I I think I could get it to play I
can't shoot because the gun doesn't work

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:13.470
can't shoot because the gun doesn't work
 

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.980
can't shoot because the gun doesn't work
on a projector it only works on a TV but

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:15.990
on a projector it only works on a TV but
 

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:21.010
on a projector it only works on a TV but
you can see what the game looks like

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:21.020
 
 

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.669
 
self-explanatory okay anyway I'll show

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679
self-explanatory okay anyway I'll show
 

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:26.990
self-explanatory okay anyway I'll show
you what up there's other parts to the

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000
you what up there's other parts to the
 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.740
you what up there's other parts to the
game there's the city section obviously

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:30.750
game there's the city section obviously
 

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.930
game there's the city section obviously
the same thing but it's in a city and

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:34.940
the same thing but it's in a city and
 

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.659
the same thing but it's in a city and
there's the soup shot which when you're

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:38.669
there's the soup shot which when you're
 

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:40.159
there's the soup shot which when you're
making a game modification or you're

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:40.169
making a game modification or you're
 

00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:42.710
making a game modification or you're
taking code you're taking compiled code

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720
taking code you're taking compiled code
 

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.539
taking code you're taking compiled code
and you can't really change how the game

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:44.549
and you can't really change how the game
 

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:48.110
and you can't really change how the game
works right and so there's so many

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120
works right and so there's so many
 

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.940
works right and so there's so many
limited there's a there's a lot of

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:49.950
limited there's a there's a lot of
 

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.850
limited there's a there's a lot of
limitations and so the the clincher of

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860
limitations and so the the clincher of
 

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.650
limitations and so the the clincher of
why I made an I shot with andy warhol

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:54.660
why I made an I shot with andy warhol
 

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.250
why I made an I shot with andy warhol
game as opposed to shoot the Pope or

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:57.260
game as opposed to shoot the Pope or
 

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.590
game as opposed to shoot the Pope or
shoot fat Alveston out skinny Elvis is

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600
shoot fat Alveston out skinny Elvis is
 

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.419
shoot fat Alveston out skinny Elvis is
because that the third part of this game

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:02.429
because that the third part of this game
 

00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:05.200
because that the third part of this game
this is exactly how it was originally

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.210
this is exactly how it was originally
 

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.400
this is exactly how it was originally
can so you know what I mean so I was

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:07.410
can so you know what I mean so I was
 

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.710
can so you know what I mean so I was
like oh it's too perfect you know I mean

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720
like oh it's too perfect you know I mean
 

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.970
like oh it's too perfect you know I mean
I don't even have to do anything to the

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980
I don't even have to do anything to the
 

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.400
I don't even have to do anything to the
last part and it still makes sense so

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:15.410
last part and it still makes sense so
 

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.860
last part and it still makes sense so
that's a secret for you but it's a good

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:18.870
that's a secret for you but it's a good
 

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.710
that's a secret for you but it's a good
example of that when you work with like

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720
example of that when you work with like
 

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.780
example of that when you work with like
appropriating like the code from a video

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:23.790
appropriating like the code from a video
 

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.580
appropriating like the code from a video
game that you have these really intense

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:25.590
game that you have these really intense
 

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.960
game that you have these really intense
limitations you have to work with well

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:29.970
limitations you have to work with well
 

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.120
limitations you have to work with well
that doesn't take that long I mean

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.130
that doesn't take that long I mean
 

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.400
that doesn't take that long I mean
actually well perfect question because

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.410
actually well perfect question because
 

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.130
actually well perfect question because
I've prepared for that the only a hard

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140
I've prepared for that the only a hard
 

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.020
I've prepared for that the only a hard
part about that problem that was it's

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.030
part about that problem that was it's
 

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.580
part about that problem that was it's
not so hard to switch the graphics on a

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:40.590
not so hard to switch the graphics on a
 

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.740
not so hard to switch the graphics on a
graphics chip the hard part was the

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:42.750
graphics chip the hard part was the
 

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.230
graphics chip the hard part was the
limitations of the of the ROM and so

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240
limitations of the of the ROM and so
 

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.169
limitations of the of the ROM and so
okay now who do I put in I've got 32 by

00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179
okay now who do I put in I've got 32 by
 

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:50.740
okay now who do I put in I've got 32 by
52 pixels you know what I mean

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:50.750
52 pixels you know what I mean
 

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.659
52 pixels you know what I mean
who the hell is going to be recognizable

00:30:53.659 --> 00:30:53.669
who the hell is going to be recognizable
 

00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:55.700
who the hell is going to be recognizable
in 32 by 52 pixels you'd be surprised

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:55.710
in 32 by 52 pixels you'd be surprised
 

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.799
in 32 by 52 pixels you'd be surprised
how many people that cancels out like

00:30:57.799 --> 00:30:57.809
how many people that cancels out like
 

00:30:57.809 --> 00:31:00.440
how many people that cancels out like
Pamela Anderson which I tried at some

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.450
Pamela Anderson which I tried at some
 

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.630
Pamela Anderson which I tried at some
point let me see

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640
point let me see
 

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.130
point let me see
just look like some of the girl with a

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140
just look like some of the girl with a
 

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.790
just look like some of the girl with a
bikini on oh Jesus

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:07.800
bikini on oh Jesus
 

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:13.270
bikini on oh Jesus
doesn't even work let's see

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.280
 
 

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.440
 
so yeah the hard part about that game

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.450
so yeah the hard part about that game
 

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.820
so yeah the hard part about that game
was determining who were the most

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:16.830
was determining who were the most
 

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.980
was determining who were the most
recognizable pop figures who actually

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:18.990
recognizable pop figures who actually
 

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.930
recognizable pop figures who actually
were alive in the last 100 years that

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940
were alive in the last 100 years that
 

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.790
were alive in the last 100 years that
would work and that small oh so here's

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:22.800
would work and that small oh so here's
 

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.550
would work and that small oh so here's
Jesus and the reason the reason Jesus

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:25.560
Jesus and the reason the reason Jesus
 

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.580
Jesus and the reason the reason Jesus
didn't work was because he's he had to

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:28.590
didn't work was because he's he had to
 

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.650
didn't work was because he's he had to
get the cross in he had to be smaller

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:30.660
get the cross in he had to be smaller
 

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.450
get the cross in he had to be smaller
than the rest of the characters so it's

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460
than the rest of the characters so it's
 

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.490
than the rest of the characters so it's
like Jesus is not really even

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500
like Jesus is not really even
 

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.860
like Jesus is not really even
recognizable as just a guy he just looks

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:36.870
recognizable as just a guy he just looks
 

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.090
recognizable as just a guy he just looks
like a skinny guy with a little

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100
like a skinny guy with a little
 

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.940
like a skinny guy with a little
loincloth you don't I mean so there are

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:40.950
loincloth you don't I mean so there are
 

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.590
loincloth you don't I mean so there are
these like the the hardest part about

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600
these like the the hardest part about
 

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.420
these like the the hardest part about
that particular project was just kind of

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:44.430
that particular project was just kind of
 

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.160
that particular project was just kind of
dealing with the culture do you not I

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.170
dealing with the culture do you not I
 

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.080
dealing with the culture do you not I
mean whereas the game hack wasn't so

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.090
mean whereas the game hack wasn't so
 

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.870
mean whereas the game hack wasn't so
hard that there was one tiny game hack

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880
hard that there was one tiny game hack
 

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.850
hard that there was one tiny game hack
thing is that the a lot of the

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860
thing is that the a lot of the
 

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.410
thing is that the a lot of the
characters didn't have the same symmetry

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:54.420
characters didn't have the same symmetry
 

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.300
characters didn't have the same symmetry
like Flavor Flav has his hat to the side

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:56.310
like Flavor Flav has his hat to the side
 

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.060
like Flavor Flav has his hat to the side
which means I needed to find out the the

00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.070
which means I needed to find out the the
 

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.950
which means I needed to find out the the
bit in the program that dealt with the

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960
bit in the program that dealt with the
 

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.330
bit in the program that dealt with the
symmetry of the characters and that was

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340
symmetry of the characters and that was
 

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.400
symmetry of the characters and that was
the only kind of hard part I almost

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:04.410
the only kind of hard part I almost
 

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.020
the only kind of hard part I almost
didn't do it because I couldn't figure

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.030
didn't do it because I couldn't figure
 

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:17.150
didn't do it because I couldn't figure
out yes oh it's just a little machine

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.160
out yes oh it's just a little machine
 

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.770
out yes oh it's just a little machine
called an EEPROM burner which is just

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:18.780
called an EEPROM burner which is just
 

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.690
called an EEPROM burner which is just
like a cd-rom burner for computer chips

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700
like a cd-rom burner for computer chips
 

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.700
like a cd-rom burner for computer chips
and they're cheap because a lot of

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:22.710
and they're cheap because a lot of
 

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.320
and they're cheap because a lot of
people like to hotrod their Nissan's now

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:24.330
people like to hotrod their Nissan's now
 

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.790
people like to hotrod their Nissan's now
and it just for some reason it takes the

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:25.800
and it just for some reason it takes the
 

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.990
and it just for some reason it takes the
same chip so when I go by my EEPROM it's

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000
same chip so when I go by my EEPROM it's
 

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.610
same chip so when I go by my EEPROM it's
like this works great in the nissan

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620
like this works great in the nissan
 

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.650
like this works great in the nissan
ultra but I don't play underneath I know

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:33.660
ultra but I don't play underneath I know
 

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.700
ultra but I don't play underneath I know
what they're talking about so it's just

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:34.710
what they're talking about so it's just
 

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.390
what they're talking about so it's just
like a CD you know so it's it's it's not

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:38.400
like a CD you know so it's it's it's not
 

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.130
like a CD you know so it's it's it's not
you know it just takes a little

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140
you know it just takes a little
 

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.660
you know it just takes a little
soldering and I hate doing anything in

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:41.670
soldering and I hate doing anything in
 

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.890
soldering and I hate doing anything in
my hands so if I could do it really

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:42.900
my hands so if I could do it really
 

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.780
my hands so if I could do it really
anybody could do it like I really hate I

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:44.790
anybody could do it like I really hate I
 

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.370
anybody could do it like I really hate I
really hate it do you know I mean like I

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380
really hate it do you know I mean like I
 

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.200
really hate it do you know I mean like I
yeah you know that's what I'm a computer

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.210
yeah you know that's what I'm a computer
 

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.120
yeah you know that's what I'm a computer
artist but it's one thing that I'm

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.130
artist but it's one thing that I'm
 

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.490
artist but it's one thing that I'm
willing to do anyway are there any other

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500
willing to do anyway are there any other
 

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.900
willing to do anyway are there any other
questions let me show you I'll show you

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:53.910
questions let me show you I'll show you
 

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.720
questions let me show you I'll show you
Pamela Anderson and I tried Ponce or

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:56.730
Pamela Anderson and I tried Ponce or
 

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.970
Pamela Anderson and I tried Ponce or
officer ponch some tips and that didn't

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980
officer ponch some tips and that didn't
 

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.410
officer ponch some tips and that didn't
work at all you so that's Pamela

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:00.420

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:11.090
make any sense you know like it doesn't
really make any sense so yeah yeah she

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100
really make any sense so yeah yeah she
 

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.880
really make any sense so yeah yeah she
is symmetrical oh yeah and then first

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:13.890
is symmetrical oh yeah and then first
 

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.880
is symmetrical oh yeah and then first
awhile I was like oh what maybe the pea

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:16.890
awhile I was like oh what maybe the pea
 

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.260
awhile I was like oh what maybe the pea
don't actually have to be real people

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:18.270
don't actually have to be real people
 

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.140
don't actually have to be real people
maybe they could be you know like

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.150
maybe they could be you know like
 

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.170
maybe they could be you know like
characters from beaker or whatever so

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:24.180
characters from beaker or whatever so
 

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.800
characters from beaker or whatever so
anyway I wonder if I should show low

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:27.810
anyway I wonder if I should show low
 

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.750
anyway I wonder if I should show low
level all-stars how long I have an hour

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760
level all-stars how long I have an hour
 

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:36.530

right I got a key oh okay that's max so

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:36.540
right I got a key oh okay that's max so
 

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.030
right I got a key oh okay that's max so
I shouldn't push it so I'll go quick

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.040
I shouldn't push it so I'll go quick
 

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.200
I shouldn't push it so I'll go quick
okay twenty minutes do it do it okay

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.210
okay twenty minutes do it do it okay
 

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:42.680
okay twenty minutes do it do it okay
let's do it

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:42.690
let's do it
 

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.330
let's do it
can you put in that first DVD I showed

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340
can you put in that first DVD I showed
 

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.510
can you put in that first DVD I showed
you real quick when I was making this

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:47.520
you real quick when I was making this
 

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.690
you real quick when I was making this
8-bit record yes I learned about this

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700
8-bit record yes I learned about this
 

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.870
8-bit record yes I learned about this
scene called cracking like cracking and

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880
scene called cracking like cracking and
 

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.170
scene called cracking like cracking and
basically it's started on the Commodore

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:57.180
basically it's started on the Commodore
 

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.110
basically it's started on the Commodore
64 and when kids would when video games

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120
64 and when kids would when video games
 

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.670
64 and when kids would when video games
were available on the floppy disk for

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:01.680
were available on the floppy disk for
 

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.280
were available on the floppy disk for
the Commodore 64 kids would crack them

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:04.290
the Commodore 64 kids would crack them
 

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.250
the Commodore 64 kids would crack them
and then this evolved this this kind of

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260
and then this evolved this this kind of
 

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.860
and then this evolved this this kind of
thing evolved and eventually they would

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:09.870
thing evolved and eventually they would
 

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.480
thing evolved and eventually they would
put their names on the front of the

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:11.490
put their names on the front of the
 

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.639
put their names on the front of the
games they cracked by whatever yo Han

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:13.649
games they cracked by whatever yo Han
 

00:34:13.649 --> 00:34:15.889
games they cracked by whatever yo Han
from Finland or whatever and then and

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899
from Finland or whatever and then and
 

00:34:15.899 --> 00:34:18.139
from Finland or whatever and then and
then they started getting into gangs and

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:18.149
then they started getting into gangs and
 

00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:20.149
then they started getting into gangs and
cracking games together and then making

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159
cracking games together and then making
 

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.710
cracking games together and then making
these elaborate audio-visual

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720
these elaborate audio-visual
 

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.450
these elaborate audio-visual
introductions to games they cracked and

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460
introductions to games they cracked and
 

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.730
introductions to games they cracked and
this was a huge thing for me when I

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740
this was a huge thing for me when I
 

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.440
this was a huge thing for me when I
started making computer art because I

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:27.450
started making computer art because I
 

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:29.030
started making computer art because I
just thought that was the most pure

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040
just thought that was the most pure
 

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.440
just thought that was the most pure
expression that I it's basically

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:30.450
expression that I it's basically
 

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.180
expression that I it's basically
graffiti but it's up for computer nerds

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.190
graffiti but it's up for computer nerds
 

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.100
graffiti but it's up for computer nerds
you know cuz you're basically tagging

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.110
you know cuz you're basically tagging
 

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.380
you know cuz you're basically tagging
software and this was like when I first

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:36.390
software and this was like when I first
 

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.820
software and this was like when I first
learned about that was when I was doing

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:37.830
learned about that was when I was doing
 

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.110
learned about that was when I was doing
all this stuff at school and that was

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:39.120
all this stuff at school and that was
 

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.300
all this stuff at school and that was
the thing that really made me and still

force Amiga and I thought this was

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:16.410
force Amiga and I thought this was
 

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.310
force Amiga and I thought this was
really beautiful and so basically you

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320
really beautiful and so basically you
 

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.510
really beautiful and so basically you
get this video game and it's been

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520
get this video game and it's been
 

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.740
get this video game and it's been
cracked by this kid and this is the

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:21.750
cracked by this kid and this is the
 

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.090
cracked by this kid and this is the
introduction he makes and this is the

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:23.100
introduction he makes and this is the
 

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.580
introduction he makes and this is the
kind of stuff that I think was just I

let's go a couple more head will do one

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:32.790
let's go a couple more head will do one
 

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:38.270
let's go a couple more head will do one
more yeah people still do and people do

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280
more yeah people still do and people do
 

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.470
more yeah people still do and people do
it with software because I learned about

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480
it with software because I learned about
 

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.230
it with software because I learned about
it on Pro Tools like when I use Pro

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240
it on Pro Tools like when I use Pro
 

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.570
it on Pro Tools like when I use Pro
Tools in college I saw some kid had it

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:44.580
Tools in college I saw some kid had it
 

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.670
Tools in college I saw some kid had it
and there was a snowman with a black bar

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680
and there was a snowman with a black bar
 

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.230
and there was a snowman with a black bar
over his eyes as the intro and I was

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240
over his eyes as the intro and I was
 

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.330
over his eyes as the intro and I was
like whoa this is a crib called Fair

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:53.340
like whoa this is a crib called Fair
 

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.600

light which was very very famous and

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:56.610
light which was very very famous and
 

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:01.250
light which was very very famous and
this how about that right they're still

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260
this how about that right they're still
 

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.930
this how about that right they're still
around right what do they do now like

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940
around right what do they do now like
 

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.570
around right what do they do now like
high-end graphics are still cracking

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:07.580
 
 

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.070
 
yeah this guy I ended up getting in

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.080
yeah this guy I ended up getting in
 

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.350
yeah this guy I ended up getting in
touch with and he had said that this

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:12.360
touch with and he had said that this
 

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.230
touch with and he had said that this
particular intro didn't get much play in

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240
particular intro didn't get much play in
 

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.080
particular intro didn't get much play in
the day because it wasn't flashy enough

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.090
the day because it wasn't flashy enough
 

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.760
the day because it wasn't flashy enough
but Alex and I thought it was the

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:19.770
but Alex and I thought it was the
 

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.930
but Alex and I thought it was the
greatest thing we'd ever seen in our

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940
greatest thing we'd ever seen in our
 

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.410
greatest thing we'd ever seen in our
life so ok that's good for that just we

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420
life so ok that's good for that just we
 

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.270
life so ok that's good for that just we
gotta just had to do we had to show that

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280
gotta just had to do we had to show that
 

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.520
gotta just had to do we had to show that
big influence but those are kids that

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.530
big influence but those are kids that
 

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.440
big influence but those are kids that
are basically piggybacking on software

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:30.450
are basically piggybacking on software
 

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.550
are basically piggybacking on software
you know what I mean which i think is

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560
you know what I mean which i think is
 

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.410
you know what I mean which i think is
amazing and it's not so different from

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420
amazing and it's not so different from
 

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.130
amazing and it's not so different from
what I do

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140
what I do
 

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.320
what I do
ok next hack let's do the opposite well

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:38.330
ok next hack let's do the opposite well
 

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.020
ok next hack let's do the opposite well
let's see what else did I bring another

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.030
let's see what else did I bring another
 

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.240
let's see what else did I bring another
project I did was called super mario

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:44.250
project I did was called super mario
 

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.710
project I did was called super mario
clouds and that's almost the exact

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720
clouds and that's almost the exact
 

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.660
clouds and that's almost the exact
opposite in super mario clouds

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:47.670
opposite in super mario clouds
 

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.000
opposite in super mario clouds
I stole the graphics and I just

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.010
I stole the graphics and I just
 

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.550
I stole the graphics and I just
basically erased the program code so

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560
basically erased the program code so
 

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.110
basically erased the program code so
it's it's the opposite of the Warhol

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:54.120
it's it's the opposite of the Warhol
 

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.850
it's it's the opposite of the Warhol
does that make sense

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:55.860
does that make sense
 

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.980
does that make sense
and so basically let's see mm-hmm I just

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:00.990
and so basically let's see mm-hmm I just
 

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.970
and so basically let's see mm-hmm I just
have a row I don't have the actual

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980
have a row I don't have the actual
 

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.620
have a row I don't have the actual
cartridge here so it just looks like

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:06.630
cartridge here so it just looks like
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.010
cartridge here so it just looks like
that so it's just basically the clouds

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020
that so it's just basically the clouds
 

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.570
that so it's just basically the clouds
from the Mario Brothers game so when you

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:11.580
from the Mario Brothers game so when you
 

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.920
from the Mario Brothers game so when you
put in the cartridge to just scroll

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:12.930
put in the cartridge to just scroll
 

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:20.770
put in the cartridge to just scroll
forever and that was pretty easy to do

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:20.780

terrible no how did I are there any
 

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.070
terrible no how did I are there any
questions so that's a very simple and

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:56.080
questions so that's a very simple and
 

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.930
questions so that's a very simple and
around that time my work and we could

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:57.940
around that time my work and we could
 

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.960
around that time my work and we could
talk up I'm gonna try to my work got

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:00.970
talk up I'm gonna try to my work got
 

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.580
talk up I'm gonna try to my work got
simpler and simpler and it's just

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:02.590
simpler and simpler and it's just
 

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.410
simpler and simpler and it's just
getting simpler and simpler because I

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:04.420
getting simpler and simpler because I

and at that time I didn't have much

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240
and at that time I didn't have much
 

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.480
and at that time I didn't have much
exhibition opportunity and so I made a

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.490
exhibition opportunity and so I made a
 

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.760
exhibition opportunity and so I made a
web page for that and how to make it you

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:11.770
web page for that and how to make it you
 

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.700
web page for that and how to make it you
know here's the source code and here's

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:14.710
know here's the source code and here's
 

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.390
know here's the source code and here's
how I made it

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400
how I made it
 

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.940
how I made it
download it make it yourself it's cool

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:17.950
download it make it yourself it's cool
 

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.790
download it make it yourself it's cool
and I had you know hoped that it would

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800
and I had you know hoped that it would
 

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.440
and I had you know hoped that it would
participate in a web culture and it

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:22.450
participate in a web culture and it
 

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.330
participate in a web culture and it
ended up doing it did you know cuz all I

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:24.340
ended up doing it did you know cuz all I
 

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.560
ended up doing it did you know cuz all I
hate here's a kid who did this thing

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:25.570
hate here's a kid who did this thing
 

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.180

with a Mario thing you know so that was
 

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.550
with a Mario thing you know so that was
kind of one of the original impetuses to

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560
kind of one of the original impetuses to
 

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.450
kind of one of the original impetuses to
do that to do that project what was I

do that to do that project what was I
 

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:39.240
do that to do that project what was I
trying to say yeah okay third example is

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:39.250
trying to say yeah okay third example is
 

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.260

what I like to do is I like to change
 

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.040
what I like to do is I like to change
the game as least as possible like

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.050
the game as least as possible like
 

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.660
the game as least as possible like
what's the littlest thing I could do to

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:48.670
what's the littlest thing I could do to
 

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.410
what's the littlest thing I could do to
a game to make it into some kind of art

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:52.420
a game to make it into some kind of art
 

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.900
a game to make it into some kind of art
okay

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:56.910
 
 

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.789
 
so this is a new one that I just did and

00:39:59.789 --> 00:39:59.799
so this is a new one that I just did and
 

00:39:59.799 --> 00:40:01.679
so this is a new one that I just did and
I'm very proud of it and it's called

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:01.689
I'm very proud of it and it's called
 

00:40:01.689 --> 00:40:05.579
I'm very proud of it and it's called
super slow Tetris and and basically

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:05.589
super slow Tetris and and basically
 

00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:08.759
super slow Tetris and and basically
all's it is is a Tetris but it runs

00:40:08.759 --> 00:40:08.769
all's it is is a Tetris but it runs
 

00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:10.919
all's it is is a Tetris but it runs
super slow and I was very proud about

00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:10.929
super slow and I was very proud about
 

00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:12.809
super slow and I was very proud about
this because this isn't really a

00:40:12.809 --> 00:40:12.819
this because this isn't really a
 

00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:14.729
this because this isn't really a
graphics hack and it's hardly a program

00:40:14.729 --> 00:40:14.739
graphics hack and it's hardly a program
 

00:40:14.739 --> 00:40:16.949
graphics hack and it's hardly a program
hack and I didn't even disassemble the

00:40:16.949 --> 00:40:16.959
hack and I didn't even disassemble the
 

00:40:16.959 --> 00:40:19.859
hack and I didn't even disassemble the
game to do it so I just basically what I

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:19.869
game to do it so I just basically what I
 

00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:22.049
game to do it so I just basically what I
did is I opened up the ROM in binary and

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:22.059
did is I opened up the ROM in binary and
 

00:40:22.059 --> 00:40:24.599
did is I opened up the ROM in binary and
I wrote a little thing at the end that

00:40:24.599 --> 00:40:24.609
I wrote a little thing at the end that
 

00:40:24.609 --> 00:40:27.569
I wrote a little thing at the end that
said because that all old computer games

00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:27.579
said because that all old computer games
 

00:40:27.579 --> 00:40:29.699
said because that all old computer games
synced to the television screen and I

00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:29.709
synced to the television screen and I
 

00:40:29.709 --> 00:40:32.489
synced to the television screen and I
just said hey why don't we sync to every

00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:32.499
just said hey why don't we sync to every
 

00:40:32.499 --> 00:40:34.919
just said hey why don't we sync to every
three times the electron goes on the TV

00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:34.929
three times the electron goes on the TV
 

00:40:34.929 --> 00:40:36.689
three times the electron goes on the TV
instead of every one you don't I mean so

00:40:36.689 --> 00:40:36.699
instead of every one you don't I mean so
 

00:40:36.699 --> 00:40:38.579
instead of every one you don't I mean so
it's just a tiny little waiter at the

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:38.589
it's just a tiny little waiter at the
 

00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:40.169
it's just a tiny little waiter at the
beginning in the code and I I show the

00:40:40.169 --> 00:40:40.179
beginning in the code and I I show the
 

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:43.829
beginning in the code and I I show the
code actually here oh oh can we go to

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839
code actually here oh oh can we go to
 

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:45.150
code actually here oh oh can we go to
the computer and then we'll go back to

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160
the computer and then we'll go back to
 

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.939
the computer and then we'll go back to
the Nintendo sorry okay oh I got to put

00:40:50.939 --> 00:40:50.949
the Nintendo sorry okay oh I got to put
 

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.559
the Nintendo sorry okay oh I got to put
it in because it takes so long to get

game makes you wait on the screen for

00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:22.059
game makes you wait on the screen for
 

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:25.620
game makes you wait on the screen for
like 15 seconds and mine makes you wait

on the screen for a really long time so
 

00:41:28.779 --> 00:41:32.009
on the screen for a really long time so
let's give it like 45 seconds and if it

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:32.019
let's give it like 45 seconds and if it
 

00:41:32.019 --> 00:41:34.169
let's give it like 45 seconds and if it
doesn't get over well this will let it

00:41:34.169 --> 00:41:34.179
doesn't get over well this will let it
 

00:41:34.179 --> 00:41:35.489
doesn't get over well this will let it

these patterns and so I really got very
heavy into this and did a show this

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:41.950
heavy into this and did a show this
 

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.070
heavy into this and did a show this
summer called the infinite Phil show or

wanted to show it because I think it's a
 

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.200
wanted to show it because I think it's a
good example of kind of appropriating

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:45.210
good example of kind of appropriating
 

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:48.180
good example of kind of appropriating
code in it in a kind of not so nerdy

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.190
code in it in a kind of not so nerdy
 

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.770

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:55.360
changed their website and so now the
 

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.880
changed their website and so now the
program needs to be updated because it

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:56.890
program needs to be updated because it
 

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:04.770
program needs to be updated because it
doesn't work right now I know right yes

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:04.780
doesn't work right now I know right yes
 

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.460

computer scientist is like a filed an

00:58:47.819 --> 00:58:47.829
computer scientist is like a filed an
 

00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:50.010
computer scientist is like a filed an
official bug list report to like the

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:50.020
official bug list report to like the
 

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.829
official bug list report to like the
central open source bug list repository

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839
central open source bug list repository
 

00:58:52.839 --> 00:58:54.930
central open source bug list repository
which I was like was really happy about

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:54.940
which I was like was really happy about
 

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.910
which I was like was really happy about
because it means like my parties playing

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920
because it means like my parties playing
 

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.589
because it means like my parties playing
with the big boys now or my programs

00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599
with the big boys now or my programs
 

00:58:58.599 --> 00:59:00.059
with the big boys now or my programs
playing with the big boys you know and

00:59:00.059 --> 00:59:00.069
playing with the big boys you know and
 

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:02.490
playing with the big boys you know and
this is also you know open source and

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:02.500
this is also you know open source and
 

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.710
this is also you know open source and
you could download it and do whatever

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720
you could download it and do whatever
 

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.089
you could download it and do whatever
you want to do I should actually also

00:59:06.089 --> 00:59:06.099
you want to do I should actually also
 

00:59:06.099 --> 00:59:08.039
you want to do I should actually also
point out that when I'm not being hyper

00:59:08.039 --> 00:59:08.049
point out that when I'm not being hyper
 

00:59:08.049 --> 00:59:10.440
point out that when I'm not being hyper
lazy I do put all this code stuff online

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:10.450
lazy I do put all this code stuff online
 

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.299
lazy I do put all this code stuff online
so people could learn how to do it and

00:59:12.299 --> 00:59:12.309
so people could learn how to do it and
 

00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:18.329
so people could learn how to do it and
you know dot dot dot dot dot okay any

00:59:18.329 --> 00:59:18.339
you know dot dot dot dot dot okay any
 

00:59:18.339 --> 00:59:19.490
you know dot dot dot dot dot okay any
questions about that

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500
questions about that
 

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.420
questions about that
are there any questions yes oh you have

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:24.430
are there any questions yes oh you have
 

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:25.799
are there any questions yes oh you have
to sign up for Domino's things

00:59:25.799 --> 00:59:25.809
to sign up for Domino's things
 

00:59:25.809 --> 00:59:28.620
to sign up for Domino's things
beforehand yeah so then you put your

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:28.630
beforehand yeah so then you put your
 

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:31.799
beforehand yeah so then you put your
login in a little like RC file and then

00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:31.809
login in a little like RC file and then
 

00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:33.900
login in a little like RC file and then
it it'll automatically do it I mean we

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:33.910
it it'll automatically do it I mean we
 

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:37.710
it it'll automatically do it I mean we
could do it so you have to pay cash at

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720
could do it so you have to pay cash at
 

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.829
could do it so you have to pay cash at
door and that's why it's possible

00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839
door and that's why it's possible
 

00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:41.970
door and that's why it's possible
because if it was credit card it would

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:41.980
because if it was credit card it would
 

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.460
because if it was credit card it would
get into ridiculous but cash it I mean

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:44.470
get into ridiculous but cash it I mean
 

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.799
get into ridiculous but cash it I mean
it's ridiculous that I mean cash a door

00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:46.809
it's ridiculous that I mean cash a door
 

00:59:46.809 --> 00:59:51.900
it's ridiculous that I mean cash a door
I mean I could just like like like I

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:51.910
I mean I could just like like like I
 

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:54.000
I mean I could just like like like I
won't I won't this was a very

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.010
won't I won't this was a very
 

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.430
won't I won't this was a very
conservative art project given the

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440
conservative art project given the
 

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:03.510
conservative art project given the
possibilities the bugs are basically

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520
possibilities the bugs are basically
 

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.370
possibilities the bugs are basically
like it's unencrypted which the Domino

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:05.380
like it's unencrypted which the Domino
 

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.569
like it's unencrypted which the Domino
site is unencrypted so when you're

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:06.579
site is unencrypted so when you're
 

01:00:06.579 --> 01:00:08.130
site is unencrypted so when you're
sending unencrypted passwords over the

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:08.140
sending unencrypted passwords over the
 

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.539
sending unencrypted passwords over the
network that's a bet that's obviously

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:09.549
network that's a bet that's obviously
 

01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:11.130
network that's a bet that's obviously
security far more to do with dominoes

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:11.140
security far more to do with dominoes
 

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.710
security far more to do with dominoes
than to do with my program also there's

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720
than to do with my program also there's
 

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.150
than to do with my program also there's
a there's a file where you could store

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:15.160
a there's a file where you could store
 

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.430
a there's a file where you could store
your password and user name in a file in

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440
your password and user name in a file in
 

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.539
your password and user name in a file in
your directory but it's never a good

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:18.549
your directory but it's never a good
 

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:19.950
your directory but it's never a good
idea to store your passwords and

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960
idea to store your passwords and
 

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.299
idea to store your passwords and
usernames in a file in the directory

01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:21.309
usernames in a file in the directory
 

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:23.069
usernames in a file in the directory
which you don't have to in this program

01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079
which you don't have to in this program
 

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:25.049
which you don't have to in this program
so it's kind of really common sense like

01:00:25.049 --> 01:00:25.059
so it's kind of really common sense like
 

01:00:25.059 --> 01:00:27.960
so it's kind of really common sense like
UNIX security concerns which I was like

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:27.970
UNIX security concerns which I was like
 

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:31.440
UNIX security concerns which I was like
cool wrote a terrible program well me

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:31.450
cool wrote a terrible program well me
 

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:32.519
cool wrote a terrible program well me
and Michael know I should say that

01:00:32.519 --> 01:00:32.529
and Michael know I should say that
 

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:33.839
and Michael know I should say that
Michael did a good job and this is a

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:33.849
Michael did a good job and this is a
 

01:00:33.849 --> 01:00:36.210
Michael did a good job and this is a
good example of a collaboration a good

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:36.220
good example of a collaboration a good
 

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.410
good example of a collaboration a good
collaboration that I did with

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:37.420
collaboration that I did with
 

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.930
collaboration that I did with
I beam Michael is a UNIX nerd and I kind

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:39.940
I beam Michael is a UNIX nerd and I kind
 

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.180
I beam Michael is a UNIX nerd and I kind
of knew about UNIX and he's like no

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:42.190
of knew about UNIX and he's like no
 

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:44.339
of knew about UNIX and he's like no
here's how you do a man page so stuff

01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:44.349
here's how you do a man page so stuff
 

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:48.839
here's how you do a man page so stuff
like that is there any that I guess we

01:00:48.839 --> 01:00:48.849
like that is there any that I guess we
 

01:00:48.849 --> 01:00:51.359
like that is there any that I guess we
should just wrap it up how what do I

01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:51.369
should just wrap it up how what do I
 

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:57.289
should just wrap it up how what do I
need to do to wrap it up anything okay

01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299
need to do to wrap it up anything okay
 

01:00:57.299 --> 01:01:00.059
need to do to wrap it up anything okay
and then I and then I'll play a video

01:01:00.059 --> 01:01:00.069
and then I and then I'll play a video
 

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:01.170
and then I and then I'll play a video
while everybody's leaving because

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:01.180
while everybody's leaving because
 

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.339
while everybody's leaving because
there's one more video I want to play

01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:02.349
there's one more video I want to play
 

01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:04.640
there's one more video I want to play
but I don't think we have time okay yes

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:04.650
but I don't think we have time okay yes
 

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:09.870
but I don't think we have time okay yes
I know yeah I know some of them like

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880
I know yeah I know some of them like
 

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.799
I know yeah I know some of them like
we've met they did a Game Boy yeah did a

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:13.809
we've met they did a Game Boy yeah did a
 

01:01:13.809 --> 01:01:15.539
we've met they did a Game Boy yeah did a
Game Boy thing where they put it back on

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:15.549
Game Boy thing where they put it back on
 

01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:16.500
Game Boy thing where they put it back on
the shelves which I always thought was

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:16.510
the shelves which I always thought was
 

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.270
the shelves which I always thought was
cool so they did something very similar

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280
cool so they did something very similar
 

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.819
cool so they did something very similar
