00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.700
Many people assume that women have a higher
tolerance for pain because...well they give

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
birth.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.940
But, science actually tells us a different
story.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.940
[

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.940
Hi guys and gals, Lissette here for DNews....

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.519
Now I’m sorry but, it’s true.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.589
Research shows that men have both a higher
pain toleranceand higher threshold for pain.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.509
In these studies, women typically report feeling
pain much sooner than men - meaning a lower

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.509
threshold.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.520
And women also tell the experimenters to stop
the pain that’s being inflicted on them

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370
much sooner than men do - meaning a lower
tolerance.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.330
And this all comes from data analyzed in multiple
studies that span a period of more than a

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.510
decade, many of which have been published
in the Journal of Pain.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
Now, researchers study pain using all kinds
of torturous methods - some of the more common

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.740
ways they inflict pain on participants include
putting really cold things directly on the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.700
skin, administering electric shocks, and putting
a lot physical pressure on different parts

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.430
of the participant’s body.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.270
In one study at the University of Lincoln
in the UK, researchers subjected 24 men and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.929
26 women to cold presses and measured their
responses.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.439
Consistent with other studies, they found
that women had a lower tolerance and lower

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.979
threshold for pain compared to men.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.740
But the scientists took the study even further.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.170
When the researchers told the participants
to focus on the physical components of the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.640
pain, it helped decrease the pain felt for
men but not for women.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.909
And when they asked them to focus on the emotional
aspects of the pain, it made the pain feel

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.329
worse for women, but not for men.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.369
So for women, it’s like a double whammy
- they seem to feel more pain more quickly

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.960
and have a harder time coping with it too.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.689
But what’s important to keep in mind is
that most of these studies rely on self-reports,

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.679
which means they are susceptible to biases.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:51.200
Pain, is largely defined by science as subjective
We rely on people to tell us how much pain

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.909
they feel and when they feel it as opposed
to measuring it more objectively like we do

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.159
with height or weight.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.359
Not surprisingly, studies have found that
social factors influence these reports of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.380
pain and the gender difference we see.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.670
In one study on college students from both
India and the US, researchers found that Americans

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.220
were more willingly to express that they’re
in pain than their Indian counterparts.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.970
And this was reflected in how much pain was
reported - American students tolerated less

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.930
pain than Indian students.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.620
Meaning that both sets of students could have
been feeling the same pain, but for cultural

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.670
reasons one group expressed it quicker than
the other.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.740
On top of that, things like who’s conducting
the experiment seem to matter too.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.280
In another recent study published in the journal
Pain, researchers had 80 male and 80 female

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
participants put their hands in icy cold water
to measured their tolerance.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.150
But, the researchers split the participants
so half of them had the test conducted by

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.370
someone of the same sex and half had someone
of the opposite sex..

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.340
The study found that how long they kept their
hand under water significantly varied depending

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.430
on whether the experimenter was a man or a
woman.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.980
If tested by the opposite sex, they lasted
much longer.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.930
Clearly there are mediating social factors
that influence pain.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.870
But this doesn’t mean biology doesn’t
play a role too.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.730
Another study published in the journal Pain
measured pain not by asking the participants

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.600
how much pain they felt, but by measuring
how their pupils behaved with infrared technology.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.730
Researchers hypothesized that the amount the
pupil dilated directly correlated with how

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.290
much pain they were in.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.340
In conditions of high pressure - or pain - women’s
pupils’ dilated much more than men’s.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.660
This is huge because it’s not like the participants
could manipulate how much their pupils were

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.780
dilating.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.760
This is a completely involuntary, biological
reaction.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.430
So it might just be that men and women feel
pain differently.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.420
But some men and some women don’t feel pain
at all!

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.470
Find out why in this video

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.880
Do you find some things totally bearable that
drive others nuts?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.090
Like maybe screeching chalk on a chalkboard?

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.560
