00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.728
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.426
- Greetings, everyone.

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:09.800
My name is Dan
Carpenter and I am

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.230
director of social
sciences academic ventures

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.710
at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.670
We are thrilled that today's
lecture is part of HUBweek,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.680
which-- if you're not
familiar with it--

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.080
is an ambitious
civic collaboration

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.760
between The Boston Globe,
MIT, Mass General Hospital,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.040
and Harvard that showcases
innovation and creativity.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.200
The commitment to
ideas and discovery

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.420
that HUBweek celebrates
is at the core

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.760
of Radcliffe's dual mission--

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.400
first, to support innovative
research and creative

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.880
work that cuts
across disciplines;

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.430
and, second, to share
that work with the public

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.270
through a packed calendar
of events, such as this one.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.780
I also want to extend
an acknowledgement

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.200
to the many reunion classes
who are here this week.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.930
We are celebrating
several fall reunions.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.640
And so a special
welcome to the members

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.100
of the classes of 1972,
1977, and 1987 who

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.450
are with us here today.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840
I'd like to highlight a few
of the upcoming events that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.940
might be of particular
interest to you.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.900
You can find complete details
on our calendar cards, which

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.810
are available at the back of
the room and at the registration

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.530
table downstairs, or
you can find them online

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.460
at Radcliffe.Harvard.edu.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.360
First, each year Radcliffe
holds a major science symposium.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.040
In the fall this year's
symposium, entitled Contagion--

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.670
Exploring Modern Epidemics,
will investigate new ways

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.780
to understand, track, and
respond to epidemic diseases,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.910
as well as social epidemics.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.890
That symposium will
take place here

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.270
in the Knafel Center
on Friday, October 27.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.470
Next Monday, October 16, a
closely related lecture series

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.370
on epidemics will kick off
with a talk called Epidemiology

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.310
Counts, on causes, consequences,
and healthy populations--

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.580
by Boston University School
of Public Health Dean Sandro

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.690
Galea.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.940
Dean Galea will
discuss the complexity

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.760
of how we measure the
health of the population

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.890
and how we determine
which of the factors

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.530
influencing health
matters the most.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.110
And finally, we
are looking forward

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.100
to welcoming historian Michael
Kazin, a distinguished scholar

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.710
of American politics
and social movements

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.530
and editor of the
magazine Dissent.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.250
He will give a lecture entitled
"Does the Left Have a Future"

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.910
here in the Knafel Center
on Thursday, November 2.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.820
I hope you will be
able to join us.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.550
Finally, let me invite
you all to a reception

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.480
to continue the conversation
following this talk immediately

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.180
after the Q&amp;A session
this afternoon.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.340
The reception will take
place right next door

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.520
on the first floor
of Agassiz House.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.120
After the talk
from Julie Guthman

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.340
there will be a question
and answer session,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.380
at which there will be
a standing mic placed

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.640
in the center the center aisle.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060
Please identify
yourself, form a line,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
identify yourself before
you ask a question.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.660
And now let me introduce
today's speaker.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.360
Julie Guthman is a
professor of social sciences

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.750
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz, and the Frances B.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.500
Cashin Fellow here at Radcliffe
her research has focused

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.210
on how neoliberal inflected
capitalism shapes possibilities

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.150
for food system transformation.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.000
As a Radcliffe Fellow,
Guthman is writing a book

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.900
that traces how the soil
pathogen Verticillium dahliae

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.050
gave rise to the technologies
and institutions that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.320
brought the California
strawberry industry success,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.680
yet at the same time locked
in a system of production that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.220
renders less intensive
methods nearly unviable.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.150
Today Guthman will discuss
the origins and development

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.730
of the alternative
food movement and how

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.880
it came to focus on
market-based alternatives

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.130
as well as how the movement
has evolved in response

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.530
to critiques-- for instance
that it has done little

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.620
to undermine industrially
produced food

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.440
and has struggled to
resonate with poor people

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.970
and communities of color.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.480
Guthman holds a PhD in
geography from the University

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.230
of California Berkeley.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.490
She has won four different books
awards, including the Frederick

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.730
H. Buttel Outstanding
Scholarly Achievement

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.250
Award from the Rural
Sociological Society

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.290
for her book Agrarian Dreams--

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.650
The Paradox of Organic
Farming in California,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.250
as well as the ASFS Book
Award for Weighing In--

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.180
Obesity, Food Justice, and
the Limits of Capitalism.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.890
She is also a recipient
of the Agriculture, Food,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.950
and Human Values
Society's Excellence

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.230
in Scholarship Award
and her research

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.910
has received funding from the
National Science Foundation,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.680
as well as being herself
a resident fellow

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.920
of the Rockefeller
Foundation Bellagio Center

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.550
and the University of California
Humanities Research Institute.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.350
I'll also add she is the
2017 Guggenheim Fellow.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.260
Finally, let me underscore, as
a way of thanking our friends

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.120
and supporters at
Radcliffe, that Julie

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.160
is this year the
Frances B. Cashin

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.470
Fellow and her
fellowship is generously

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.670
supported by Richard M. Cashin
and Elizabeth S. Cashin--

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.160
class of '75, both.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.390
And finally, a personal note--

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.060
I had a wonderful and enjoyable
dinner conversation with Julie

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.450
last night.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.490
And I learned a lot about her
work, her family, her food

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.390
habits--

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.270
which are far more
tasteful than mine.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.866
We discussed many
issues in the news

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.240
which have been
rather depressing

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.110
and which I won't
alight upon here,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.950
but I found her
insights at every stage

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.800
to be profoundly thoughtful
and creatively expressed.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.150
I am honored and excited to
have a new colleague in Julie

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.910
and I ask you to extend
her a warm welcome.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.500
- Well, hi there.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.240
And thank you, Dan, for that
really kind introduction.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.375
I appreciate it.

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:26.000
And I really thank all
of you for coming today.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.520
It is truly an honor
and a privilege

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.210
to be here at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.300
And I am deeply grateful to the
work of Dean Cohen, Associate

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.530
Dean Vichniac, and their
truly superlative staff

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.300
in keeping things ticking.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.520
And I'm especially
honored to be invited

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.180
to speak here during Boston
HUBweek and Harvard Reunion

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.922
Week.

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:50.880
That's all to the good.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.820
Now, the bad news is I
came down with a cold

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.100
and so you will have to excuse
my particularly gravelly voice

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.030
today and literal
throat clearing.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.090
And now for the figurative
throat clearing of my talk.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.780
So I want to begin with
the 2014 New York Times

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.270
column penned by noted
food writer Mark Bittman.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.460
In this column,
Bittman described

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.170
having a negative visceral
reaction to the word "foodie."

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.770
Foodies, he argued, are too
often new style epicures

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.790
who enjoy watching
competitive cooking shows,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.840
doing anything to get a table
at the trendy restaurant,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.250
scouring the web for
single estate farro--

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.510
I've not done that one--

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.450
or devoting oneself to
finding the best food truck.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.550
If and when these foodies go
beyond the pursuit of pleasure,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.420
he noted they tend to put their
energies into consumer support

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.150
for sustainable food systems--

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.840
such as the purchase of
organic and local foods,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.410
participating in
community-supported agriculture

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.280
projects, or buying
at farmers' markets.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.060
This, he suggested,
was not quite enough.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.310
He went on to say that making
good food fair and affordable

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.900
cannot be achieved without
going beyond food to address

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.360
questions of justice
and equality and rights,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.929
of enhancing rather than
restricting democracy;

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.919
of making a more rational,
legitimate economy.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.650
Now, as it happens,
Bittman's column

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.070
borrowed a critique that
I and other scholars,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.040
in conversation with
activists, have been

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.830
making for a very long time.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.400
We have argued that
many foodies' and food

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.480
activists' focus on consumption
has overemphasize relatively

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.740
apolitical market based
strategies such as patronizing

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.630
and creating alternative
food businesses.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.910
We have pointed out that
these strategies have

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.630
been embraced and promoted
by those who are generally

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.000
well-off and white.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.710
We have suggested that attempts
by foodies and food activists

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.790
to shift the public's eating
habits toward the notions

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.840
of good food have too
often been encased

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.940
in a politics of conversion.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.600
The attempts to change
individual eating habits

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.980
without understanding the
multiple circumstances,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.720
pressures, and desires
that inform food choices.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.080
It's a classic missionary
position, if you will.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.100
And we've claimed
that food activism,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.350
in focusing on
consuming good food,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.460
has taken the focus off the
conditions of food production,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.180
particularly neglecting
the needs of those

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.845
who work in the food system.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.930
Indeed, as building
positive alternatives

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.640
has become the nearly sole
activity of the food movement,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.520
food producers and
processors have

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.460
been effectively
let off the hook

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.730
for their harmful practices.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:46.515
Little, that is, been done to
undermine the conventional food

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:47.015
system.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.540
Now, in making
these critiques we

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.480
have both angered and
inspired food activists.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.100
Some have suggested that these
critiques are disempowering.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.860
Some have said they've
known them all along

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.770
and didn't feel they
could voice them.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.460
And some have been motivated
to rethink what they do.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.640
So today I want to
do three things aside

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.950
from shameless promotion
for my new co-edited book.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.330
I want to talk about the origins
and development of the food

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.320
movement as a way to
explain how it became

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.320
about market-based
alternatives, often

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.360
at the expense of
social justice.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.220
Secondly, I want to show how it
evolved in response to critique

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.010
such as ours.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.790
And on that note,
I want to suggest

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.580
that these critiques have been
generative and not necessarily

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.880
disempowering.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.970
And they have led to more
inclusion, or attempts

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.955
at inclusion, of social
justice concerns.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.820
And then I want
to briefly discuss

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.060
three cases that reflect this
new food activism, one of which

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.140
focuses on a battle that
motivated my current research

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.500
and led to my project
here at Radcliffe.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.340
Alas, I won't be discussing
my Radcliffe project today,

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.490
but I would be delighted to
answer questions about it

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.470
at the end.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.780
And I will then
conclude by talking

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.480
about the challenges
and opportunities

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.450
of the current moment.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.890
And it is a challenging
current moment.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.690
First, I want to
be clear on what

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.870
food movement I'm referring to.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.080
After all, various
forms of food activism

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.280
have been around for
a very long time.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.340
So I want to discuss
what many refer to

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.810
as the "alternative
food movement."

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.020
And I begin with the
organic farming movement

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.900
because it was so
clearly a progenitor

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:10.420
of this market-based approach
to food system transformation.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.260
Now, in this slide, the person
on the left is unknown to me,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.830
but the person on the
right is Alan Chadwick.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.690
Chadwick came to my university--

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.090
University of
California Santa Cruz--

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:29.890
in 1967 and began the famed UCSC
organic Farm and Garden, which

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.010
now has created-- many, many
farmers around the world

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.970
once worked or trained
at the UCSC Farm.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.900
And his approach was based
on the French Intensive

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.970
biodynamic gardening.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.260
Now, there's legend
that he and the students

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.320
used to farm naked.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.650
I'm fairly willing
to believe it.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.050
And I do know that there's a
few UCSC alums in the audience

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.660
today, and I'd bet that
they would probably

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.900
believe it as well.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.290
But I actually want to start
my story a few years later,

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.450
and that's in 1973.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.310
And I use 1973 as a
watershed because that's

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.030
when a group of
farmers, primarily

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.070
from California and Oregon--

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.590
and here I'm talking
about the US, of course--

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.780
here's when they began
codifying organic agriculture.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.290
In so doing, they
developed a novel way

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.650
to regulate agriculture, without
the support of the government.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.130
In the minds of many
organic farmers at the time

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.200
the US Department of
Agriculture and all

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.270
the other regulatory
agencies that

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.150
might be involved in
agriculture had utterly

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.000
failed to support
an agriculture that

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.860
would conserve soils and reduce
the use of toxic chemicals.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.810
So the original organic
farmers opted instead

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.570
to share the techniques
they had learned

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.330
and call what they did
"organically grown."

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.060
Now, there's longer
origins of organic farming

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.220
that I'm not going
to go into today.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.150
But at this point, their goal
was to give organic farming

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.740
meaning in the marketplace.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.380
So as the organic name
began to have cache,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.750
organic farmers
needed to find a way

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:31.220
to guarantee to consumers that
their purchases were indeed

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.220
organically grown.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.920
And every once in a while there
would be some sort of public

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.430
scare over the incorrect
or excessive use

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:46.130
of a pesticide and consumers
would clamor for organics.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.380
And so many producers
would respond

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:54.050
by becoming organic overnight--
in other words, by faking it,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.550
claiming that they were organic.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.600
And, understandably,
the real organic farmers

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.840
didn't like that.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.900
So they wanted to come up with
a system in which they would

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.210
decide what would
be called organic

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:14.140
and make sure that these newly
arrived organic farmers follow

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.137
the rules.

00:16:15.137 --> 00:16:16.720
And so these farmers
wanted to come up

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.840
with a set of what inputs and
practices would be allowable

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.860
in an organic system.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.390
Now, at first these were
just organic inspectors.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.370
At first the rules they
developed were very simple.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.930
Legend goes that
they were written

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.740
on a half a page of paper.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.720
But the guiding
principles they used

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.380
were generally about that
whether the materials that

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.210
would be allowed
on an organic farm

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.290
were natural and
not synthetic Now,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.490
that turned out to be a
highly contentious distinction

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.350
but that's a discussion
for another day--

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.420
or I am happy to
answer questions

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.430
about the organic
rules during the Q&amp;A.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.160
But these guys also figured
out it wasn't enough just

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.339
to set standards.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.440
It wasn't enough to decide which
materials would be allowable

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.869
in organic production systems.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.440
They had to find a way
to guarantee that growers

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.800
would follow the rules.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.514
So they came up with a
system of peer review--

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.400
is existing organic farmers
would inspect new farms

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.390
to see if these new farmers
were farming in keeping

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.270
with these organic principles.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:44.030
If they decided that they were,
these peer review inspectors

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.045
would certify the
farms as organic.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.840
Again, another legend--
or not so much a legend,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.010
this is came down with many
interviews I conducted years

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.870
ago--

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:01.080
at first certification
was based on a system of,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.170
you know it when you see it.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.980
Today, organic certification
is much, much more complex.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.300
There are Baroque review
processes for the materials

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.660
alone--

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.740
and there's hundreds
and hundreds,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.220
thousands of materials that
are reviewed every year to see

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.790
if they would meet the basic
distinction of natural,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.270
not synthetic, not toxic.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.920
And now, you know,
there's huge volumes

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.510
that now contain the list
of allowable materials

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.000
or disallowed materials.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.400
Today there are hundreds of
certification agencies run

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.300
by states, non-government
organizations,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.670
and private businesses as well.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.190
And these guys all
certify farmers.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.110
And in the United
States this is all

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.350
overseen by the
federal government--

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.360
although the federal
government itself is not

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.135
in the business of actually
certifying farmers.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.310
Now, there's a lot more
to say about organic rules

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.060
and certification and
whether they work effectively

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.340
to ensure the integrity
of organic practices.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.780
But the point I
want to make today

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.650
is actually quite different.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.770
Because regardless of the
complications involved,

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.220
this was a system
that, in it's essence,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.400
was supposed to
reward good behavior.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.760
Producers that wanted to
enter the organic sector

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.630
would agree to abide
by a set of rules

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.350
and pay the cost
of certification.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.550
And in doing so they
expected to be rewarded,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.710
and they expected to be
rewarded with a price

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.620
premium for their efforts.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.760
Now, this system made
sense at the time.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.057
I don't think these
growers went out

00:19:58.057 --> 00:19:59.890
to come up with a system
that wouldn't work.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.620
I think they just
kind of-- its evolved.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.480
But it turns out the
approach had its drawbacks--

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.500
and drawbacks that really didn't
become evident until organics

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.192
entered the mainstream.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.020
So one consequence
of this approach

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:23.100
is that it allowed
significant co-optation.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.220
Organic farmers were
fetching very high prices

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.050
for their produce for a while,
particularly in the 1980s.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.830
But as the organic
sector grew, some farmers

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.800
began to lose out on
the price premiums

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.070
due to intense competition
as many new entrants came

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.860
about-- including companies
like Walmart would

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.840
bring new organic farmers in.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.500
They often would work
with conventional farmers,

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.610
convince them to grow
organically for them--

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.180
because they actually thought
that these conventional farmers

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.830
knew how to grow better than
the original organic farmers

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.955
and would be more reliable.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.780
So what happened is that farmers
that wanted to take advantage

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.520
of the high prices or that
were asked to grow organically

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.750
on behest of the WalMarts or
the Whole Foods or whatever--

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.230
you know, the Mountain
People's Warehouse,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.550
that was a distributor--

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.180
those guys all asked
growers to grow organically.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.840
And so these
farmers came into it

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.050
based on that kind
of market demand,

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.810
but they weren't
committed to incorporating

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.720
the agroecological principles.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.130
And so what they
would do is kind

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.270
of substitute allowable organic
inputs for disallowed ones.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.330
So they'd enter if there was
an input that you could easily

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.490
substitute.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.500
And that means that
there was more entry

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.930
in some crops than others.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.540
So the point here is
that they didn't really

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.070
fully embrace the integrated
systems that organic farming

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.940
was founded on.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.750
Now, the original organic
farmers, understandably,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.340
didn't like this--

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.260
nor did others who
had hoped for more,

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.870
who had hoped that organic
would mean everything that

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.360
was different, they
wanted to be completely

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.070
different than the
conventional food system.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.000
So growers in the
Northeast, for example,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.350
were unhappy to see organic
produce shipped from California

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.030
in their markets.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.910
And I myself was surprised
shopping at the Whole Foods

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.360
at Fresh Pond to
see organic kale

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.380
from California in September.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.566
I mean, if you can't grow
organic kale in Massachusetts

00:22:41.566 --> 00:22:42.690
in September, I don't know.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.210
And it wasn't very good
shipped, I have to tell you.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.690
So as organic stopped being
effective in supporting

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.510
the small farmers that
birthed the movement,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.780
it gave rise to many
beyond organic ideas--

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.025
including locally
grown, including

00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:06.890
fair trade, and many others.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.810
Now, these new
labels were in part

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:13.460
to address the social issues
that the organic standard had

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.550
pretty much neglected.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.610
They were also designed
to support higher prices

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.000
for farmers, with
the expectation

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.710
that these high prices would
enable growers to incorporate

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.810
ecological principles--

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.200
or perhaps pay workers
better or otherwise just

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.460
stay in business.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.850
But the thing about
these standards

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.980
is they serve as
barriers to entry.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.220
They are purposefully
difficult to meet

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.990
to ensure the integrity
of each of these labels.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:56.210
And they're difficult to prevent
that quick and easy entry

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.670
that those organic
farmers once saw.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.610
But this became a major
point of contention

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.470
for the organic
movement or industry.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.330
On the one hand, high
standards are good.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:14.490
They can ensure that a labeled
food is truly different.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.070
On the other hand,
high standards

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.550
can work against
broader transformation

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.320
by keeping producers out.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.350
And this is what the
conventional growers moving

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.086
into organics would
always sell to me.

00:24:27.086 --> 00:24:29.460
They told us they wanted to
feed the world with organics.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.680
Why are they making
it hard for us?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.260
And the fact is they did
make it hard for them.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.340
Because despite
all the attention

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.480
that's given to organics,
all the talk about it,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:48.020
and that it putatively
grows 20% per year, only 1%

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.230
of US farmland is currently
in organic production.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.925
Which is a stunningly
low figure.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.730
Furthermore, by
rewarding only producers

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.680
who use good practices,
those with the bad practices

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.800
remained unconscionably
under-regulated.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.930
Conventional
producers could still

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.440
use highly toxic
materials and inputs,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.760
and this food would
necessarily be cheaper--

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.540
which also means that
the system of regulation

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:31.060
put the cost burden on the
good practices for consumers.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.030
Those consumers who
value the qualities

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.440
here in these labels--

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.160
and if they valued them, they'd
have to pay more for them.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.090
So organic and its
cognates, in other words,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.820
became more costly by design.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:57.670
So that necessarily created
a problem of affordability.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.400
And so that led to some new
social movement attempts.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.940
One of the first, after this
kind of organic and local,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.310
was community food security.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.840
The community food
security movement

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.580
emphasized that both
growers and consumers

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.510
would do better economically if
they cut out the middle person.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.180
So it put a great
deal of emphasis

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.900
on direct marketing
arrangements.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.190
Farmers markets, community
supported agriculture,

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.750
were supposedly both consumers
and producers would benefit--

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.210
although certainly
not the workers

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.580
who work in
distribution companies.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.970
In practice, though,
that particular win-win

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.860
didn't happen.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.920
So some markets were
organized to ensure

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:53.140
high prices for farmers by
price fixing or limiting

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.750
who would participate
in that market.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.630
Now, the market pictured
here is Ferry Plaza

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.160
in San Francisco, renowned
for its beautiful but crazily

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.010
expensive produce.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.890
Now, there are a lot of
farmers markets have sprung up

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.140
that were not so restricted.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.900
And they do provide cheaper
produce for consumers,

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.522
but the farmers at these
markets wouldn't do as well.

00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:20.980
And I've talked to
many farmers who

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.990
would refuse to sell at
the markets that weren't

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.573
the high end markets
because they knew

00:27:24.573 --> 00:27:28.000
they couldn't get good prices.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.940
There were additional issues.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.140
Scholars and activists recognize
that nutritious food, defined

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.430
in less rarefied terms
then local and organic,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.490
was lacking in many
urban environments--

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.150
particularly African-American
neighborhoods.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.630
So this was creating a
problem of geographic as well

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.450
as economic access.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.150
So lack of access
became a watchword

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.250
of the alternative
food movement.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.620
And so here you
see some interface

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.330
with the food desert analysis
that much Michelle Obama

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.840
helped popularize.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.300
An additional critique emerged
that upscale alternative food

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.200
was not resonating in
communities of color.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.600
In other words, that
it borrowed too heavily

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.190
on whitened cultural
histories and practices.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.380
Like, the thing that my
students loved to say

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.402
is like, I want to put
my hands in the soil--

00:28:27.402 --> 00:28:28.860
when we know that
for, some people,

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.920
putting their hands
in the soil is not

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.000
a memory that's a good one.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:40.500
So the food justice movement was
born out of these observations.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.560
Borrowing from environmental
justice activism,

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.210
food justice activists made
two different critiques.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.940
One is that they noted
that people of color

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.680
were disproportionately
exposed to junk food

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.900
based on the lack of economic
and geographic access;

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.820
and, two, they noted that
the food movement primarily

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.820
appealed to the
white and privileged.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.230
To address the access problem,
food justice organizations

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.500
set up shop in
neighborhoods of color.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.530
For instance, they ask liquor
stores to feature fresh fruits

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.180
and vegetables.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.880
They developed produce
delivery services

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.250
from nearby organic farms.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.810
And they set up farmers
markets in some food deserts.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.550
To address the
cultural issue, they

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.590
tried to bring foods
that were associated

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.950
with African-American food
ways, such as collard greens

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.000
and melons.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.150
And I am particularly
focusing on African-American

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.440
neighborhoods here because they
have gotten the lion's share

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.240
of focus from food activism.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.580
The activists also tried to
encourage people of color

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.560
to participate and
take leadership

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.540
in these organizations.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.370
Now, the results
of these efforts

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.490
were honestly quite mixed.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.630
And many residents in the
so-called "food deserts" voice

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.760
that they really just
wanted a supermarket

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.520
in their neighborhood.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.250
Following that trend,
the food movement

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.910
turned to urban farms
and community gardens.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.140
The idea here was to further
close the gap between producer

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.380
and consumer.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.850
And the urban
agriculture movement

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:27.050
also aspire to create
community and provide a safety

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.560
net when public
entitlements are lacking.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.820
And research suggests
that the farms that

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.610
have taken hold, the urban
farms that have taken hold, best

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.290
are in communities
with residents

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.630
not eligible for public
food assistance--

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.540
such as among recent immigrants,
particularly undocumented

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.300
recent immigrants.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.910
And most recently
food justice activists

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.240
began to borrow from peasant
movements in the developing

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.500
world and have called
for "food sovereignty--"

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.750
community control
of the food system.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.020
And then, even more
recently, borrowed

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.900
on things like the
Occupy Movement

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:13.270
to do the Occupy
the Farm movement.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.220
Now, I'll just briefly
elaborate here.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.930
This is a event that took
place in Berkeley, California--

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.490
where I do happen to live.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.090
And this is University property.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.250
It's the Gill
Tract, and it's been

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.640
used as an agricultural
experimentation for years.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.140
And activists took it over
so as an Occupy the Farm

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.350
and wanted to prevent the
university from selling it

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.620
to a land developer who was
going to develop a Sprout

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.980
supermarket there-- like a
Whole Foods type supermarket--

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.040
and a senior recreation center.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.930
Just as an aside, this
was the kind of thing

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.790
that really frustrated
me because it seemed

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:57.610
to me that what would
have been a really more

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.250
important strategy
was for them to demand

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.960
that the University
of California

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.930
change the kind of research
it's doing at the Gill Tract

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.090
to support more
sustainable methods--

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.600
but they wanted to occupy.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.660
Now, let me pause to say
that there's a lot that

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.480
is exciting about all this.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.600
Clearly, food activism has
galvanized young people

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.680
in a big way.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.790
There are more food
initiatives in more cities

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.680
than we could have possibly
imagined 25 years ago.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.250
Funders are paying
attention and nonprofits

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.710
are growing like weeds.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.650
And judging by my
students, young people

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.000
are increasingly aware of and
concerned about the injustices

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.390
of industrial food production.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.720
And let's face it, there's
a lot more good food

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.060
and I, for one,
really like good food.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.310
Yet there are still some serious
limits to these approaches.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.220
One is that they
continue to emphasize

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.640
the consumption of food even
though some of the worst

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.230
injustices stem from
the production of food.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.510
Now, note that over
20 million people

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.450
work in the food sector
in the United States,

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.930
providing about one
sixth of employment.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.700
But people who work in food are
some of the most food insecure

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.720
because of the poor wages
in food processing, food

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.080
service, and farm work.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.480
And it's not only the pay--

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.510
food workers face really
dangerous working conditions--

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.980
particularly in meat packing--

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.680
and sexual harassment.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.190
Farm workers face the
worst pesticide exposures,

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.890
because many chemicals
are formulated

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.590
with consumer health in mind.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.280
And, of course, many
food and farm workers

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.480
have very little means to
contest these conditions

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.120
because they're undocumented.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.889
So basically you
have an approach

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.940
to changing the food system
that ignores the workforce

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.429
in the food system,

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.500
Another limit to
this approach is

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.889
that it promotes alternatives
rather than contest

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.630
what's wrong.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.230
So in effect we're getting
a bifurcated food system--

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.370
we get great food for the
well-endowed, well located,

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.850
and well-funded, and
dregs for the rest,

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.910
including those who
work in the food system.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.770
Now, when I've given
talks like this,

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.940
people say, but you have
to have alternatives.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.219
And you do have to
have alternatives.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.760
You have to have
alternatives and opposition.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.429
If you oppose industrial
agricultural's practices,

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.590
you need to develop
and disseminate

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.430
safer and less toxic
ways of producing food.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:09.170
And indeed growers are
much more willing to move

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.510
to more sustainable
methods when there

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:17.360
are viable agronomic
tools to help them.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.300
But with some very
small exceptions,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.740
the contemporary food movement
has focused almost solely

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.170
on building alternatives.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.430
At the same time that community
gardens and direct marketing

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.740
and farming and cooking
education programs

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.730
have proliferated, work on
policy and corporate behavior

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.880
has pretty much dwindled.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.310
But that, just
recently, is changing.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.660
And in my remaining
time I'm going

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.380
to focus on three examples
that respond directly

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.910
to these critiques.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.180
And all these examples are
drawn from the new book,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.090
and so I'm drawing on
other people's research

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.750
besides my own.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.930
So I'm going to begin
here with an alternative,

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.990
but an alternative that is
organized by people of color

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:12.460
and sees action as collective
rather than individual.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.550
And here I'm drawing
from research

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:19.810
by [? Alison ?]
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.630
So this is about Chicago's
Healthy Food Hub,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.690
and it was established
in 2009 with the aim

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:30.820
of pooling the
resources of its members

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.150
and surrounding communities
to bring home healthier,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.260
tastier, fresher food for less.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.960
This is mainly achieved
through collective purchasing

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.970
of wholesale organic
produce-- so it's

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.800
back to the old
collective purchasing

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.320
model of the 1970s that
so thrived in Cambridge,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.910
Massachusetts when
I visited here then.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:55.180
And they also buy
directly from rural farms

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.400
in the historic black
farming community

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.880
of Pembroke Township, Illinois.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.150
This is a membership
organization.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:09.220
People pay an annual fee
of $25 to become a member,

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.760
and then they receive
discounts on food products

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.600
and can preorder their food.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.560
Now, what's significant here
is that the Healthy Food

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:27.370
Hub was not initially conceived
as a food justice initiative.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.700
It began spontaneously
among a group of patient

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.460
in the care of
the Hub's founder,

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.300
an African-American
holistic practitioner based

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.400
in south Chicago.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.390
She noted that many of
her patients' conditions

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.950
stemmed from poor
nutrition, so she

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.730
expanded what was then her
household practice of buying

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.840
food in bulk to include her
patients and their families,

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.410
in order to secure the best
quality food for the best

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.440
available prices.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.230
Critically, the strategy
of a collective buying club

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.860
has deep historical roots in
longstanding African-American

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.180
practices of collective
survival and resistance.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.640
For instance, the Populist
Colored Farmers' Alliance

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.190
organized purchasing
cooperatives to,

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.130
quote, "Resist the power
of white creditors,"

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.840
unquote, during Reconstruction.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.440
The founders of the Healthy
Food Hub, as well as

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.950
many of its older
members, came to Chicago

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.920
with their respective
families from Mississippi

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.490
during the 1950s and '60s.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.430
And many remember
collective food purchasing

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.120
as a routine family practice.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.940
So this shared
cultural memory may

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:56.130
be one reason why the Hub has
been so successful at enrolling

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:00.000
and engaging its members
while other alternative food

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.220
organizations, working
in similar communities,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.100
have really struggled.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.340
Now I'm going to turn to one
of several campaigns connected

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.440
to the Food Chain
Workers Alliance,

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.000
which is a coalition of
worker-based organizations

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.190
who are organizing
to improve wages

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.180
and working conditions for
workers along the entire food

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.530
chain.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:32.910
And this case study comes from
Joanne Low and [INAUDIBLE] Now,

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.180
this campaign took
place at Taylor Farms,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.000
which is based in
California's Central Valley.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.600
And Taylor Farms is one of
the world's largest processors

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.200
of salads and fresh
cut produce, selling

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.690
to retailers such as WalMart,
Trader Joe's, and Krogers.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.230
They also sell to Chipotle.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.600
But because of the
anonymity provided

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.050
by private labels and
institutional buyers,

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.880
Taylor Farms is
also a company that

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.690
exists beyond the influence
and even knowledge of most

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.730
individual consumers.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.480
Now, about 900 people--
mostly Latino--

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.390
were working at two different
plants in California's Central

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.580
Valley.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.890
2/3 of these workers
were employed

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.236
through temporary
staffing agencies,

00:40:25.236 --> 00:40:26.610
even though some
of them had been

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:31.820
working at Taylor Farms for
many years-- over a decade.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.330
Most were paid the minimum wage.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.910
And, on average, the
workers in these plants

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:44.100
were earning $3 less per hour
then their similar workers

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.350
doing the same job in
the Salinas operations

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:52.010
of Taylor Farms, which tends
to be higher wages in Salinas.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:55.190
And beyond the
notoriously poor wages.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:59.480
The company accrued $80,000
an occupational safety

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:05.970
and health violations
from 2008 to 2013.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:11.130
So in 2013, after months of
behind-the-scenes organizing,

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.480
workers at the Taylor Farms
plants in Tracy, California--

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.130
that's in the Central Valley--

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.580
announced they were
organizing to join a union.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:27.070
Taylor Farms responded with a
variety of anti-union tactics.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:32.320
On the stick side these included
intimidation, harassment,

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.510
and mistreatment.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.570
For instance, they threatened
to call [SPANISH]----

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:44.465
immigration-- and referred to
workers as Latinos [SPANISH]----

00:41:44.465 --> 00:41:46.750
piece of shit Latinos--

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.390
and they fired their
union supporters.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:55.100
On the carrot side, Taylor Farms
made some nominal improvements

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.580
to working conditions, such
as providing sick days.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.870
Most notably and
gratuitously the company

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:06.710
gave roses to the
women on Mother's Day

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.500
and gave backpacks, jackets,
and scarves of the men

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.250
on Father's Day.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.800
Despite the company's
anti-union tactics,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.350
the worker leaders and
the Teamsters organizers

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:24.280
were able to collect
enough signatures on union

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.370
authorization cards to
file for an election

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.700
through the National
Labor Relations Board.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.950
However, the process became
bogged down and didn't go far.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.890
So the campaign turned
toward another strategy,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.580
utilizing a model embodied
in the Good Food Purchasing

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:46.610
Policy adopted by the
city of Los Angeles.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.280
The Good Food Purchasing Policy
sets purchasing guidelines

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.710
across five key values--

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.460
local food economies,
environmental sustainability,

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.510
humane animal treatment,
healthy nutrition standards,

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.610
and fair treatment
and compensation

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.130
of food chain workers.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.280
The idea here was to
leverage purchasing power

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.220
of institutional buyers rather
than through individual fork

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.560
voting--

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.370
you've all heard of
voting with your fork?

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.890
The Teamsters went to the
Oakland Unified School Board

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.790
to inform them on what was
going on at Taylor Farms.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.640
And at that meeting the
Oakland Unified School Board

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.670
announced that the school
district would no longer

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.520
be buying from Taylor Farms.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.970
And this was a loss
of a huge contract.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.820
Eventually they won a
settlement and fired

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.090
workers received back pay.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.610
This last example is
based on my own research,

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:48.100
and concerns thwarting the
highly toxic chemical methyl

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.340
iodide.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.600
Methyl iodine was
developed and released

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.390
to be an alternative
to methyl bromide.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.900
Methyl bromide is an
ozone depleting substance

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.500
that has been the primary
armament of the California's

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.240
strawberry industry's
war with soil disease.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.350
In the early 2000s, facing the
mandated phase-out of methyl

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:15.130
bromide, the strawberry industry
began looking for a replacement

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.420
chemical.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.750
So University of
California researchers

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.540
developed the
compound methyl iodide

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.350
that was very structurally
similar to methyl bromide

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.040
but lacked the ability to
reach the upper atmosphere.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.070
And so then they sold the
patent of methyl iodide

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.850
to Arysta LifeSciences
Corporation.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.670
So Arysta first sought
federal approval

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:45.190
for the use of methyl iodide
on strawberries in 2002

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.440
but faced some problems.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.750
Methyl iodide is apparently much
more toxic than methyl bromide.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:57.080
It is a known neurotoxin
and carcinogen.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.050
It's associated with
thyroid dysfunction,

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.830
respiratory illness,
lung tumors,

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:09.420
and it's a probable cause of
miscarriages and birth defects.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:15.404
It's even used to induce
cancer in laboratory rats.

00:45:15.404 --> 00:45:16.820
Now, I want to
emphasize something

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.580
about these chemical fumigations
that really have motivated

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.320
my existing research--

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.600
they are used before planting.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.310
They're put in the
ground to get--

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.290
they're fumigated,
they're gases.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:31.040
They're put in the ground to get
rid of soil disease and weeds.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.940
They leave no residues on
plants, on strawberries.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.680
So the people who are most
exposed to their toxicity

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.850
are those who live or work
near strawberry fields, who

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.990
don't have the option of
buying their way out--

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:51.920
by buying that organic
strawberry, for instance.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.370
Now, early on in this
battle, over 50 scientists--

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:58.340
several of them Nobel
laureates in chemistry--

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.610
wrote a letter encouraging the
US Environmental Protection

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:05.790
Agency to deny registration.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.090
After some stalling,
the EPA eventually

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.030
allowed the use
of methane iodide.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.000
But methyl iodide faced
a much tougher fight

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.970
in California, which
has more stringent

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.840
environmental regulations.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.560
There, activists organizations--
including anti-pesticide,

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.280
environmental, public health,
and farm worker groups--

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.650
went beyond fork voting and
mounted a major campaign

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:38.190
to prevent the chemical
from being registered.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:43.560
The campaign concluded over
53,000 written public comments

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.580
collected, with almost all
but a handful objecting

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.280
to the use of the chemical.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.040
It included media events,
it included public hearings,

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.800
publicizing the chemical's harm.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.160
It included picketing
besides farmer's fields--

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.590
although not a lot of that.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.320
In addition, activists
filed a lawsuit

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.830
against California's
pesticide regulatory agency

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.310
for failing to abide
by environmental law

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.940
and registering the chemical.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.660
Long story short-- and
it is a long story--

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:20.850
the chemical was pulled
from commercial use

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:25.750
because Arysta no longer felt
it was economically viable.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.200
And this is in large
part because growers

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:34.080
didn't adopt the chemical
for fear of public backlash.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.820
This was an
unprecedented victory,

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.940
one of the few toxic
chemicals to be taken off

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:44.640
the market in the modern history
of US environmental regulation.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.010
And since then the
strawberry industry

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.470
has become much more
serious about finding

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.860
non-chemical alternatives
to fumigation

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.004
than it had previously.

00:47:55.004 --> 00:47:57.170
Unfortunately, as I'm writing
about my current book,

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.760
it's just not finding
an alternative

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.900
that's going to do it--
but that's another story.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.200
So what do these
campaigns tell us?

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.980
They tell us it is possible
to work in collectives.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.045
It is possible to organize.

00:48:13.045 --> 00:48:16.320
It is possible to
be oppositional.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.580
It's possible to win.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.860
It's possible to have
people of color lead.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.470
And it's possible to use
strategies other than voting

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.280
with your fork.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.740
It's possible to be political.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.440
So I want to end by
talking a little bit more

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.090
about the politics of the
possible in the age of Trump.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.910
Now, many of the
arguments and critiques

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:47.690
I've developed over the
years about food movements

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:52.520
have come in conversation
with my students.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.180
So for the last
14 years I've been

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:00.460
teaching in a program whose core
is a six month full-time field

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.120
study with a social justice
and social change organization.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.750
This is a community
studies program.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.400
And I've been the
faculty member who

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.700
works most closely with
students interested

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.360
in food and agriculture.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.690
So I've been able
to closely track

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:22.040
what kinds of social change
opportunities are available

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.720
and what kind my projects are--

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:30.010
excuse me, what kind of projects
my students are interested in.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.160
Many of my students,
to my chagrin,

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.920
have ended up in
projects where the aim is

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.980
to teach low income people
of color what to eat

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.914
or how to grow food.

00:49:40.914 --> 00:49:42.580
That's all that they
can think of doing.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.460
This is what
organizations are doing.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.340
When I've pressed them
on these inclinations

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.090
and asked why they're not more
interested in public action,

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.920
I've heard many times over
that to focus on alternatives

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.790
is easier and more fun.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.890
And even though they
are well trained

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:06.030
in the political
economy the food system,

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.730
they have also said that
affecting policy or changing

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:14.390
corporate behavior
seems impossible.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.180
But that was before
Occupy Wall Street

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.410
and and Black Lives Matter,
two movements that have changed

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.180
the public conversation.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.040
It was the Occupy
Movement that brought

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.520
inequality and the wealth gap
back into public discourse.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.470
Without Black Lives
Matter we wouldn't

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.140
have many people,
including white people,

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.060
talking about how
color-blind activism works

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:43.300
too reenscribe white privilege.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.390
These recognizable changes
in the public conversation

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:50.920
are no doubt the very things
to which the alt-right movement

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.460
is reacting.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.800
Now, I don't think it's a
coincidence that these two

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.940
movements correspond closely
to the critiques of the food

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.990
movement I've discussed
earlier in my talk.

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:07.270
That the movement appealed
too much to markets

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:11.470
and profit-making as a
way to solve problems,

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:17.140
that it's too white, and
therefore these conversations

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.310
have provided new opportunities
for food movements to address

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.480
some of the underlying
causes of food inequities--

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.310
income and health inequality,
insufficient health and safety

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:36.970
regulation, immigration
policy, regressive taxes--

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.680
and to show how
these are connected.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:46.360
Hate to put this next slide
up, but there you have it.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.330
And this new-- you could tell
me when to just shift to another

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.430
slide so you don't
have to look at it--

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.800
this new food activism
couldn't be more

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.092
urgent in the age of Trump.

00:51:56.092 --> 00:51:56.800
Should I go back?

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.700
You've had enough?

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.520
I have.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.020
OK.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.620
We're already witnessing
some of the attacks

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:10.080
on environmental regulation,
including pesticide regulation.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.920
The US pesticide regulatory
system is far, far,

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.420
far from perfect, but it
has played a modest role

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:23.490
in preventing toxic exposures to
consumers, workers, and others.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:27.900
But Scott Pruitt's EPA
suggests huge reversals.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.860
Since being appointed he is
set to dismantle the agency's

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.130
pesticide research apparatus.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.210
He's already reversed
a ban on chlorpyrifos,

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:45.480
a brain-harming agro-chemical
that was about to be enacted--

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.600
the ban, not the chemical.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.140
Trump's immigration policies
need no introduction,

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.540
but building a wall
with the southern border

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.360
and ramping up the
deportations that

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.540
were well underway during
the Obama presidency

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:07.320
has not only worsened a labor
shortage that concerns growers,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.100
it has caused the millions
of undocumented food and farm

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:15.450
workers in the United States
to live in constant fear,

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:19.860
unable to contest wage
theft, pesticide use

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:24.000
violations, and sexual
harassment and assault that

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.150
are mainstays of US
food and farm work.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:33.000
According to some sources,
Trump is threatening

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.810
to cut more than $190
billion over 10 years

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.960
from food assistance programs--

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.600
programs that are already
insufficient and ensuring

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.370
that the country's
poor do not go hungry.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.920
He's also threatening
to cut crop insurance

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.320
and other programs
that protect farmers,

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.500
although these are far
more controversial.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.240
And he is packing
his administration--

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.290
to the extent that he's actually
packing his administration--

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.800
with those who seek no reins on
corporate behavior or mergers,

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.070
clearing the way for even more
corporate control of the food

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.630
system.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.080
It's simply not clear to
me how individual choices

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.020
to purchase organic local
food at the farmer's market

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.040
will stop this agenda.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:26.840
I just have to tell
this little story.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.820
I think I have time.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.740
The day after the election,
when I and many others

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:39.280
were nursing our sometimes
real and definitely proverbial

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.520
hangovers, I managed
to get out of the house

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.326
and go to the UCSC Library--

00:54:44.326 --> 00:54:45.700
I don't know why
I went up there.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.530
But there, in front
of the library,

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:51.370
was someone petitioning--

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.540
or he wasn't petitioning.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:57.190
He had a clipboard and he was
signing up people for his farm,

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:59.711
to buy subscriptions to
get food from his farm.

00:54:59.711 --> 00:55:01.210
It was a classic
community-supported

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.110
agriculture.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.580
He was this typical Santa
Cruz blond, dreadlocks,

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.784
sandal-wearing guy.

00:55:08.784 --> 00:55:10.700
And this was the day
after the Trump election.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:15.040
And, I mean, to me this so
much captured the frustration

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.280
I have with the
alternative food movement.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.340
It felt just so
irrelevant at that moment.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.770
But the good news,
as we have seen,

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:28.210
is that the public is
onto the Trump agenda.

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:30.340
And we've seen a lot of
resistance and pushback

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.740
in many different
arenas, including those

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.814
that bear on our food system.

00:55:35.814 --> 00:55:37.230
And at this point
I don't think we

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.800
have a choice but to
continue on in this vein.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.840
So that's what I have to say.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.580
I think you and I welcome
your questions and comments.

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.040
- Thank you.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.140
[INAUDIBLE] much
more complex than I

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.180
thought it was going to be.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.910
In my experience, corporations
are willing to change.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.320
John Mackey once was
at MIT of Whole Foods,

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.459
his students are giving him the
proper real hard time saying,

00:56:13.459 --> 00:56:14.500
why are you so expensive?

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.630
The poor can't afford it.

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.820
And his response was,
if they eat my food,

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.120
they won't fall as sick.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.350
So in the long
run, they eat and I

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:27.820
failed to convince them, though,
to not eat pork ribs and Coke

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.350
and eat my food, so
I admit that failure,

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.940
but I'm open to any
way you can suggest.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.660
And nobody really
had a suggestion.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.120
When Doug [INAUDIBLE]
of Whole Foods--

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:47.490
of Trader Joe's came, he has
started something here called,

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:49.450
I think, Daily Table.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:51.970
So he said, OK, how do I go
to a disadvantage [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.110
bring the costs down?

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.870
So he takes oranges and
all that are seconds--

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.510
we all like perfect oranges,
so if its got a blemish on it

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.890
you can buy it cheaper.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:02.410
But the jury's still out on it.

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.560
Its a nonprofit.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.730
Its soaked up a lot of money.

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:10.210
[INAUDIBLE] ultimately every
corporation I talked to says,

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.560
I cannot convince the Americans
to ask for price first--

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.840
the cheapest banana, the
cheapest chicken-- so

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.750
what do you want me to
do as a corporation?

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.860
You have an answer to that?

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.410
- Well, there's a few
things I want to say.

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:27.400
First of all, I do want
to say that corporations

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.140
are paying attention to
sustainability issues

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.380
as well-- oh, sorry.

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.520
Corporations are paying
attention to sustainability

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.250
issues as well.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.530
I have a friend here--

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.730
she's visiting here
at Harvard this year--

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.360
who's working on corporate
sustainability initiatives.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.440
But they are dragged
kicking and screaming.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.920
I mean, they're not doing
that out of the goodness

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.610
of their hearts.

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.410
I mean, John
Mackey, when I first

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.430
doing my research
on organics 20,

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.210
25 years ago, he was
quoted as saying,

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:58.480
since when is this movement
about social justice?

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:05.160
But even though
corporations are maybe

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.630
being paying
attention to prices,

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:11.020
this is the problem with
food and agriculture

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.690
is that people talk
about the three

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.360
pillars of sustainability-- or I
would say the three things that

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:16.930
undermine it.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:20.170
But you have environmental
sustainability here,

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.010
you have farmer incomes here,
you have labor issues here,

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:27.160
and you have consumer access
and accessibility here.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.530
These things are
not well aligned.

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.690
They are in tension
with each other.

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:33.430
And in my opinion,
the only thing

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:38.890
that can kind of make it all
work out is state involvement.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.970
Because if you have cheaper
prices for consumers,

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.450
then you have poorer conditions
and poorer wages for workers.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.430
But none of those things, even
that whatever has happened,

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:53.130
none of those things have
happened without fights--

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:55.660
and that's precisely
the point is consumers

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.960
complain in more collectively.

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.890
But you know, Trader
Joe's is a tough one.

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:03.440
I mean Taylor Farms is one
of their main suppliers.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.530
I think Trader Joe's--

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:11.170
their supply chain is not one
that we would want to emulate.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:12.680
There's a reason
the food is really,

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.510
really cheap at Trader Joe's.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:18.410
And the milk they supply comes--

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.110
it's organic milk
but it's coming

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.290
from farms with huge feed lots.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.990
And that farm,
it's Aurora Dairy--

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:27.120
it's more than one farm.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.820
Aurora Dairy is likely to lose
its organic certification--

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.903
so I hear.

00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:33.403
Yeah?

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.910
- Hi, my name's [INAUDIBLE],,
organizer for Equal Exchange.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:46.650
I had kind of a related question
about specifically the Whole

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.790
Foods-Amazon merger and kind
of that press release that was

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:54.660
them really trying to deal with
food access and making those

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.260
products more accessible
to a lower income,

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.690
and what your thoughts
and reactions on, one,

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.240
that merger and then secondly
that press release that talks

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.230
about food access--

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.870
specifically in that context.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.470
- Well, that merger
is distressing to me

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:18.870
because, you know, I'm not
a small is better person.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:21.420
I actually think that
super small businesses

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.590
work at some disadvantage.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.630
I think that there's
some ways in which

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.660
if we looked at more
mid-scale operations

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.150
we could do more of this
collective buying practices.

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:35.220
But any corporation that big,
of Amazon and Whole Foods,

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.960
is a really frightening
thought to me.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:43.860
You know, the accessibility
thing with Whole Foods,

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.080
it's another one of these
double-edged swords.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.510
And this goes back to this
other question before--

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:54.810
I once walked into the Whole
Foods in Berkeley, California

01:00:54.810 --> 01:01:00.270
and there was a handwritten sign
on the cash register that says,

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:03.377
bring in your
damage canned goods

01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:05.460
and we'll give it to the
Alameda County Food Bank.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.230
And I'm like, wait a minute.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:12.090
So we're shopping here
at Whole Foods and, like,

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:15.247
the poor people get our damage,
non-organic goods at the food--

01:01:15.247 --> 01:01:17.580
I mean, there's something
fundamentally wrong with this.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.650
Some of the kind of
food recovery efforts

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.960
really disturb me,
because it's, again,

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.010
reinforcing that the wealthy and
privilege and the well-located

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:28.590
get the good stuff and everybody
else gets the handouts.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.220
And there's something
fundamentally wrong with that.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.200
So that's my reaction.

01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:35.680
- Hi.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.440
My name is [? Leron ?]
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.440
And you'll have to excuse
me, I don't normally

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.890
fan out about
people, but you were

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.420
saying about your
writing has really

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.630
informed a lot of
activists and Weighing

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.900
In is probably the most
marked book on my bookshelf,

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.680
has held dear to me.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.770
And I started
reading this new book

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:59.402
and I do highly recommend it, so
I'll shamelessly plug for you.

01:01:59.402 --> 01:02:01.680
- Aw, thank you.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.850
- And one thing that I see in
your writing to some extent,

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.430
but I think I'm
still grappling with

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.460
and I'm wondering if you
have some ideas about,

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.230
is that I think there's also an
element of self gratification

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.090
with food activism.

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:20.700
You know, we want to buy a
product and feel good about it

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.440
because and that's
something we'll

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.110
enjoy but then it's
also something that's

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:27.750
saving the world, or we want
to donate to the food bank

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:31.050
because that's easy and
we can feel good about it.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.789
But it's not that
lasting change.

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:34.580
And I think with a lot
of social movements,

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.180
instead of challenges,
you're going

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:41.430
to have to grapple with
questions of white power.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:43.937
You have to grapple
with your own privilege.

01:02:43.937 --> 01:02:45.770
And you have to get out
of that comfort zone

01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.910
to then go into that
political sphere, which

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.130
I think a lot of people
have a hard time doing,

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:54.840
or they find that that
easy answer checks off

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.690
enough of that mental
checklist in their brain

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:01.340
that they don't have to move
into that political sphere.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.190
- Yeah, I think it's a
really, really tough question.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:06.170
And I grapple with it
personally all the time.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.609
I know somebody's going to
ask me if I eat organic food

01:03:08.609 --> 01:03:11.150
and buy it-- and somebody will
ask me that, so I'll just say,

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.800
yes, I do.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.410
And I just think that, as
I was telling my students,

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.540
sometimes you have to
live with contradiction.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.581
But I think that there's
something about the food

01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:22.710
movement in particular that--

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:25.790
well, we know what it is about
the food because food is what?

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:26.360
Sustenance.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.545
And food is pleasure.

01:03:27.545 --> 01:03:29.420
So there's something
about that food movement

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.030
where that contradiction
comes to a head.

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:37.070
I mean, while it may be fun to--

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:40.610
oh, I have I still have Black
Lives Matter on the screen;

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:42.710
you have strawberries.

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:47.417
It may be fun to attend
a rally or a march--

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:50.000
which may or may not be all that
effective, but it may be fun,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.052
but it's not what's
motivating you.

01:03:52.052 --> 01:03:54.260
But with food movements
that's what's motivating you,

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.343
and I think that's why so
much food movements have

01:03:56.343 --> 01:04:00.350
been about teaching people
how to eat because, oh, I

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.920
have the pleasures of eating
like Alice Waters of Chez

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.290
Panisse tells me to
with my organic kale

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:09.080
with lots of garlic
and salt and olive oil.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.000
So let me teach
you about it, too.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.720
Let me share the
pleasure with you.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.770
And I think that it's
because of the food

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.680
itself that kind of
gets the movement

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.167
into that very contradictory
place of pleasure and action.

01:04:23.167 --> 01:04:25.250
And I don't know that
there's any way around that.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.020
But I do think it's unique.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.371
And I don't know if that
gets to your question, but--

01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:34.302
- Good effort.

01:04:34.302 --> 01:04:34.802
- OK.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:38.620
- Hi.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.160
Thank you so much for speaking.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.610
I wanted to pick up
on a point that you'd

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.770
made earlier about how
some of your students

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.970
have this tendency to want to
go out and teach poor people how

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:53.650
to cook, which might be
well intentioned but sort

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:54.550
of misguided.

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:57.130
And I wanted to get your
thoughts on something,

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:02.530
because I do think that people
of all economic backgrounds

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.800
do rely too much on
processed food, fast food,

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.290
and it's detrimental
to everyone's health.

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:11.020
I think it can also be
detrimental to our sense

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.380
of culture and just general
empowerment in your life.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.900
And I think that
a lot that you can

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.240
trace that back to
systemic issues--

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.940
we phased out home ec
in schools, for example.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.740
And so I guess
I'm just wondering

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.890
if you have thoughts
on how to address sort

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.770
of the cooking side
of it from more

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.920
of a systemic issue
instead of just these,

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.160
let's do little workshops and
teach poor people how to cook.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.725
- Yeah, no, that's another
kind of a biting question here.

01:05:41.725 --> 01:05:43.010
I was at a--

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.750
I'm sorry.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.625
All these stories keep
popping into my brain.

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:47.385
But I was at this book
fair in Los Angeles

01:05:47.385 --> 01:05:48.760
and I was speaking
about my book.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.974
And there was an
author of a cookbook.

01:05:51.974 --> 01:05:53.890
She says, if all we need
to do is teach people

01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:55.710
how to make vinaigrette.

01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:03.280
The cooking thing is an
interesting one, right?

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.696
And Michael Pollan
and others have

01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:09.610
written about that we
need to get kind of back

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.840
to the kitchen.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.490
And I like cooking.

01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:16.570
Cooking's a good thing.

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:20.060
But I still think
there's this fun--

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.490
why do people not cook?

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.680
Maybe they love the
Jack in the Box,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.590
but I mean when you
have people with two

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:29.420
jobs or single parents,
they're picking up their--

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:33.640
I mean, let's get real here
about the cooking thing.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.750
So I think it's nice to cook.

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:41.600
I'd like to-- ultimately I
think people could eat more

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.080
nutritiously and
possibly cheaper--

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.420
not super cheap with
cooking, but you

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:51.010
have to face the real
obstacles to cooking.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.960
But I think that's
a different issue

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.570
than like this kind of
proselytizing about cooking,

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.390
and for me that when my
students are picking up

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.530
on that is that it's been more
that they can't imagine what

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.690
else is possible to
change the food system.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.276
Now they can more,
but that's where

01:07:07.276 --> 01:07:08.775
they were about 10
years ago-- well,

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:09.983
what else are we going to do?

01:07:09.983 --> 01:07:12.280
I go, well, look, here's
this great organization that

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.740
does great anti-pesticide work.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.545
Well, I don't want
to sit behind a desk.

01:07:16.545 --> 01:07:17.920
I don't want to
be in a computer.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.901
So sometimes that
pleasure really can--

01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:22.400
excuse me.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.816
Something that
pleasure can really

01:07:23.816 --> 01:07:27.422
get in the way of
what's important.

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:31.300
I mean, if we think of other
kind of important moments

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.230
of our time--

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:35.140
important activism,
you wouldn't--

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.740
I'm just trying to think of
some analogous situation.

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.760
If you were concerned about
Syrian refugees, for example,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.177
you wouldn't--

01:07:43.177 --> 01:07:45.760
I can't think of the analogous
situation where we'd say, well,

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.544
I want to do this
because it's more fun.

01:07:48.544 --> 01:07:50.710
So, again, there's something
about the food movement

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.720
that puts us in that, well,
I want to just have fun

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.620
while I'm doing this.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:57.790
- Hi.

01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:59.790
My name's Rachel and I'm
a student at the School

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:00.910
of Public Health here.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.730
And I had a question on--

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.730
you described the current
pessimistic political climate

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:08.950
and also a lot about
what bothers you what

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:10.840
people do around food activism.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.640
But, under the
assumption that everybody

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.070
here is interested
in food activism

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:18.490
and wants to take
action, what do

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:21.960
you recommend as next steps
for when we leave this room?

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.500
Like, is there
anything concrete you

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.920
can think of to do in our daily
lives that would really help?

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.720
- Well, you know there are--

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.700
not many-- but there
are good organizations

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:37.060
that do good work, organizations
that do pesticide activism.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.160
Some Some of them have
letter writing campaigns.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.410
You can join one of those
and get on their ListServes.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:47.410
It's always better to
write individual notes

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:51.069
than just do the
clicktivism, but, you know.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:54.010
Like, for instance, right
now Pesticide Action Network

01:08:54.010 --> 01:09:01.279
is working hard to put that
chlorpyrifos ban back in place.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:03.580
So you have to get
on the ListServes.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.819
You have to write letters.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:07.189
But it worked on this
methyl iodide campaign.

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.830
So that's one place you can go.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:11.500
The Farm Bill should
be coming up soon,

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.189
and I expect to see the
Trump Administration come up

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.680
with a really nasty one.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.080
And there will be
many organizations

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.970
that will be working on that.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:26.260
So whether you only
can write your letter--

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:31.029
but an individualized letter--
or give $100, that's something.

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:33.939
Or if you're a
student and you're

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:37.870
looking to employ
yourself later,

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.359
you can intern and
get involved and work.

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:44.620
But those things do exist.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.799
Or working on--
there's so many--

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.529
how you work on immigration
reform is a tough one, right?

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:57.600
I mean, whether you're
immigration reform

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.520
or immigration, whether
you're like leaving

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.340
plastic jugs of water in the
desert in Arizona or, again,

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:10.030
lobbying your congressperson
about a safer,

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:12.250
better immigration bill,
those are different options.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.440
But there's lots.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.749
But they're not always
as tangibly about food,

01:10:17.749 --> 01:10:19.290
and I think that's
one of the things,

01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:23.040
too, is that the policies that
I think impinge on the food

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.740
system are not always
about that material thing

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.380
called food-- they're about
the systems that are around it.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.442
- Hi-- oh, sorry.

01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:34.650
I'm [? Nicole ?] [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm a Harvard Extension
Sustainability Master's

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.580
student, and my question, or
two of our biggest global issues

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:48.369
is soil security and soil
fertility, as well as the food

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:49.410
waste that we throw away.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:54.040
So in developed countries we're
sending about 40% to landfill.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.490
So my question is, is
there or should there

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.680
be discussions
around a to cradle

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.250
to grave initiative for
the agriculture sector,

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:04.020
and does this present
any opportunities

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.730
to resolve any of the
issues that you've

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.840
discussed with us today?

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:22.700
- Food waste is a tricky one.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:26.540
I think food waste is a
huge aesthetic problem--

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.080
no one likes to see food waste.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.720
Most of the food waste--

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.010
and this isn't answering
your question directly,

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:36.470
it's just what I know about--

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:37.940
most of the food
waste initiatives

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.500
are really geared
toward consumers,

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.170
like, here's how to
reuse that or use

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:44.720
that kale that's been
sitting there in your door

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.000
for three weeks.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.140
Most of the food waste occurs
in agricultural production--

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.260
and lots of it.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.520
And it's-- yes, there are
organizations that do food

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.800
recovery, whether it's
organizing gleaning.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:10.690
But our food production system
is geared to create food waste.

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:13.510
It's profitable to
create food waste.

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:18.760
So, again, it's a matter
of figure out ways

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.320
to address how food is
produced through policy

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.520
and through somehow changing
up the incentives so

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.545
corporate farming--

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:29.920
it's not only
corporate farming--

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.220
individual farmers
just don't leave

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.160
so much food on the field.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.190
But, you know,
your question also

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.710
brings us to bigger
questions about,

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:44.620
what is the nature of hunger?

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:46.990
And if it's about
insufficient food production.

01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:51.490
I'm concerned about food
waste because you don't

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:53.060
want to see soil go to waste.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:59.230
You don't want to see animal
lives put down for nothing.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:02.710
But I'm always worried
about food recovery

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:04.000
as a way to address it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.870
And that's about as much as
I can say about at this point

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.870
because it's not something
I've looked at a lot.

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:12.209
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.190
- Thank you, Julie.

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.050
That was fantastic.

01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.500
Join me in congratulating her
for a stimulating lecture.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.600
