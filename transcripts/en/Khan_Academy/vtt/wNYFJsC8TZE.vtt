00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.672
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:04.412
explore how the floating exchange rate could,

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:07.431
in theory, help resolve trading imbalances.

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:09.380
And for this simplified example,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.649
We are going to assume that

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.895
the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the US $

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:17.471
is 6 Yuan per 1 US $.

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:19.821
And also for simplification, we are going to assume that

00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:23.190
China is only exporting one thing to the United States

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.525
and that one thing is microwaves.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.394
And at 6 yuan per $, the Chinese manufacturer

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:32.570
is going to sell them in the United States for $50 each.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.790
And at that price, there is a demand in the US for 1 million microwaves.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.656
I'm also going to assume that

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.751
the only export from the US to China is software.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.434
And they have demand for 2 million units

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:49.793
if they sell them at 60 yuan per unit.

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:52.668
So let's think about what the demand for the each of the currencies

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.082
will be from each of the manufacturers.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.401
So the Chinese manufacturer over a year

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:00.277
is going to sell a million units for $50 each.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:04.470
So he's gonna get $50 million dollars in revenue

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.160
And he is going to want to convert that $50 million into yuan.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.660
So you can kind of view this as a supply.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.600
This right over here is the supply of US dollars.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.688
And we are going to assume that

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:19.398
these are the only people that are creating currencies,

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:22.650
because they are the only people trading in this ultra simplified world.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.614
Now the US manufacturer is going to sell

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:28.401
2 million units at 60 yuan each.

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:37.650
So that's going to be 120 million yuan of revenue.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.272
And he is going to want to convert this into dollars

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:41.854
at the prevailing exchange rate right then

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.438
which is 6 yuan per dollar.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.725
So he's going to want to convert this.

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:49.190
He divides this by 6.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.224
He's going to want to convert that into 20 million dollars.

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:56.653
And obviously, he's going to want to convert into yuan,

00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:59.460
because that's where his costs are in, that's where he lives.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.194
This guy wants to convert into dollars,

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:03.144
because that's where his costs are.

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.361
Now this is the supply of dollars.

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.685
These dollars wants to be converted into Chinese currency.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.731
This right here is the demand for dollars.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.984
This is the amount of $ needed by a guy converting from yuan.

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:17.790
Now clearly, there is an imbalance.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.060
The supply of $ is much larger than the demand for $ in this situation.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.480
And anytime the supply for anything is larger than the demand...

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.600
If the supply is larger than the demand

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.980
then that means the price must go down.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.310
And we talk about the price of a currency,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.000
in this case, the price of the dollar going down.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.097
We are talking about in terms of yuan.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.450
So the dollar...

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.650
...the dollar will go down.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.466
The price goes down which means the yuan goes up.

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.460
The dollar will become weaker.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.779
The yuan will become stronger.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.208
Now, if that happens,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.791
what happens to the prices over here?

00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.099
If the yuan becomes stronger,

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.282
we start seeing 4 yuan or 5 yuan per $ or even 3 yuan per $.

00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:07.945
Then this Chinese manufacturer

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.063
won't be able to afford to sell at only $50.

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:13.322
He is going to have to raise the price

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:16.154
in order to cover his costs in Chinese currency.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:20.370
If he raises the price, he's going to lower the demand.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.166
On the other side of the equation, the American manufacturer,

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:24.850
in order to get the same number of dollars,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.112
he actually can sell it for fewer yuan.

00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:29.650
Now he needs fewer yuan per each dollar.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.894
So he can actually lower the price in China.

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:33.722
And if he lowers the price in China,

00:03:33.722 --> 00:03:36.383
that's going to increase the demand.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.460
So what you have happening is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.250
because yuan would become stronger,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.126
if you had a floating exchange rate,

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:44.603
the demand for Chinese goods would go down

00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:46.969
and the demand for the US goods would go up.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:52.810
And eventually, you would have this trade and currency imbalance resolve itself.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.315
Now, this is all theoretical,

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:57.843
and reality is that it's not allowed to float.

00:03:57.843 --> 00:04:00.972
We'll describe that more in future videos.

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:05.435
This is Salman Khan from the Khan Academy for CNBC.
