00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, for today's lecture as you
can see up there is molecular --
00:00:08&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
evolution, and ecology.
00:00:16&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.425
And what I mean by this,
it's basically the study or

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:30.545
what we try to figure out in
molecular evolution and ecology

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:35.925
is what genes or gene sequences
can tell us about the evolution

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:42.000
and ultimately also the ecology
of organisms in the environment.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.671
And it's particularly relevant
for thinking about

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.271
microorganisms,
prokaryotes and the

00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.189
environment.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.167
And I hope I can actually
convince you today of that.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:54.696
This is interesting.

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:58.827
The topics that I want to cover
today is, first of all,

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:03.033
I want to review a little bit
what we know about life on

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:07.470
Earth, sort of give an overview
of the evolution of life on

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.000
Earth.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.192
Then, I want to go into
specific topic that's of

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:15.724
particular relevance for the
evolution of eukaryotes.

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:17.830
That's the endosymbiosis
theory.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.430
And then I'll explain how we
can use gene sequences to

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.030
actually reconstruct events that
have happened a very,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.000
very long time ago.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.048
OK, so we'll look at what we
call molecular phylogenies,

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:35.538
with the use of gene sequences
to reconstruct the evolutionary

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:37.746
history of organisms on Earth.

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:41.279
Derived from that,
we'll look at what we call the

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.236
tree of life.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:46.505
That's sort of the big picture
overview of the evolutionary

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.743
relationships of all organisms
on the planet.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.129
And then finally,
I'll introduce you to a topic

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.000
called molecular ecology.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.280
Again, that's how we can use
gene sequences to learn

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.768
something about the diversity of
microorganisms in the

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:12.980
environment that lead us then,
next time, when I come back on

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.468
Monday, into this big topic of
environmental genomics,

00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:24.474
how we can actually expand this
analysis to learn much more

00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:27.994
about organisms in the
environment.

00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:34.000
So, first of all,
let's look at life on Earth.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.557
Does anybody know how old we
think Earth is?

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.315
Say again?

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:46.303
Yeah, 4.5 to 4.6,

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:50.345
I haven't my notes 4.6.

00:02:50.345 --> 00:03:00.012
So, Earth's thought to have
originated about 4.6 billion

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:03.000
years ago.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.935
When did the first solid rocks
appear on earth?

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:20.287
So, when was the surface kind
of solidified?

00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:22.812
Anybody know?

00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:28.251
About 3.9 billion years ago,

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:30.000
OK?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.868
And when do we think life
started to develop on the

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:41.250
planet?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.223
Any ideas?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.789
Take a guess.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:46.578
Two?

00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:51.710
One?
3.5 billion years ago,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.302
OK?

00:03:52.302 --> 00:04:00.000
So, this is really remarkable.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.604
We think it didn't,
I mean, of course it took a

00:04:03.604 --> 00:04:08.070
long time because were talking
about millions of years and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.694
hundreds of millions of years,
but still, if you look at the

00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:17.630
big picture, it didn't actually
take life that long to evolve on

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.492
the planet.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:21.313
So, why do we think that is the
case?

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.585
What's the evidence for that?

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:28.287
Well, we look into sedimentary
rocks, so old rocks that arose

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:31.891
from sediments,
what you find around this time,

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:36.358
you find that chemicals start
to appear, organic molecules

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:42.000
that really resemble organic
molecules in modern life.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, we have sort of chemical
tracers, or chemical fossils.
00:04:47&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.825
So, tracers that indicate the
presence of organisms.

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:10.249
But what we also find is
so-called micro-fossils,

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:17.743
and I have a picture of that
here where when you actually

00:05:17.743 --> 00:05:23.631
take rocks and actually slice
them into very,

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:30.055
very then slices,
you can put them under specific

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:33.000
microscopes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.459
And what you then find is that
many rocks that are very,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.351
very old, have those kinds of
inclusions in them.

00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.243
And these things really
resemble very much modern

00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:48.567
prokaryotic cells,
modern bacterial cells,

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:49.540
for example.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.756
And so, those micro-fossils are
generally taken as an

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:57.405
indication, also,
that life is already present

00:05:57.405 --> 00:06:00.000
during those times.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.945
Now, when we take a quick sort
of overlook of the evolution of

00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:08.189
life on the planet,
again this graph here

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.054
summarizes sort of the last 4.6
billion years or so when life

00:06:13.054 --> 00:06:13.945
originated.

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:18.162
We see that there was a period
of chemical evolution,

00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:21.486
and then somewhere here that
region, it's,

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:25.864
of course, not really well
understood when that exactly

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:30.000
happens, the origin of life is
placed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.412
But I want to alert you to a
couple of really,

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:37.962
really critical steps here that
are shown on this graph which

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:40.312
we'll actually talk more about.

00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:44.559
It is thought that life very
early on is split into three

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.682
major lineages:
the bacteria,

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:49.867
the archaea,
in what is called here nuclear

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:50.246
line.

00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:53.582
And I'll come back to that in a
minute or so.

00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:57.526
Then, a further major event
which you may remember is

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:02.000
oxygenic photosynthesis actually
evolved --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.145
-- which means that
cyanobacteria evolved that

00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:09.198
started to produce oxygen as a
byproduct of photosynthesis.

00:07:09.198 --> 00:07:13.182
And that really fundamentally
changed the chemistry of the

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:13.602
Earth.

00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:16.537
It actually became an oxidizing
atmosphere.

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:20.311
And what you see here is,
once the oxygen concentration

00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:24.155
goes over a certain level,
it allowed the development of

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:25.274
an ozone shield.

00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:28.000
Now, what does that mean?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.230
What was the critical
significance of the presence of

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.532
an ozone shield?

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:34.997
Does anybody know?

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.868
What does it block out?

00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:38.658
Anybody remember that?

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:43.540
What's the big significance of
the ozone hole over Antarctica

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.517
for example?

00:07:44.517 --> 00:07:48.585
It allows UV radiation to heat
the Earth's surface,

00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:53.467
and in fact if there were no
ozone, the UV radiation would be

00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:59.000
so strong that there would be no
life possible on land.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.278
So, once the ozone shield
actually developed,

00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:06.228
organisms could conquer,
basically, the land's surface

00:08:06.228 --> 00:08:08.538
and settle on the land surface.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:11.444
In this, then,
is thought to be at least

00:08:11.444 --> 00:08:15.021
correlated with the development
of endosymbiosis.

00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:17.704
And I'll explain what I mean by
that.

00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:21.802
But it basically led to the
origin of modern eukaryotes,

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.038
so your ancestors essentially.

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:27.168
But there was still a long
time, obviously,

00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:30.000
until humans appeared.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.052
We have here the origin of
animals and metazoans,

00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:40.315
and then the age of the
dinosaurs is already a very

00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:43.473
small blip here on this graph.

00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:49.368
And humans don't even get
featured on that because we are

00:08:49.368 --> 00:08:50.421
so recent.

00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:56.210
So, but what I want to show you
here is that three major

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.000
lineages evolved early on.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.299
These are the bacteria,
archaea, and what we call a

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:10.955
nuclear lineage.

00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:20.251
And the significance of those
nuclear lineages is that it

00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:30.376
basically combined with bacteria
to form the modern eukaryotic

00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:31.206
cell.

00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:38.178
So, the eukarya,
or eukaryotes they're also

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:41.000
called.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:57.731
And it was this combination
that we called the endosymbiosis

00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:00.000
event.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.094
I want to explain this a little
bit more, and then I'll show you

00:10:05.094 --> 00:10:09.460
finally why we actually know
that those things are very

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.614
likely to have occurred a long
time ago.

00:10:12.614 --> 00:10:12.938
Yes?

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:17.870
It means the bacteria and the
nuclear lineages combine to form

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.164
a eukaryote, OK?

00:10:19.164 --> 00:10:23.692
And I'm actually going to
explain this on the slide here.

00:10:23.692 --> 00:10:27.331
So, if you have any more
questions after that,

00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:30.000
please let me know.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.266
So, again, this shows you this
early evolution,

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:38.069
this early split in two
archaea, bacteria,

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:40.852
and this sort of nuclear line.

00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:46.324
It is thought that this nuclear
line, this was single celled

00:10:46.324 --> 00:10:51.797
organisms that increased in cell
size, and then developed or

00:10:51.797 --> 00:10:55.971
partitioned the DNA into a
nucleus, basically.

00:10:55.971 --> 00:11:02.000
So exactly how you find it in
modern eukaryotic cells.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.929
But then what happened is the
cell took up a bacterial cell,

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:11.024
and over time this bacterial
cell became symbiont.

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:13.865
In fact it became the
mitochondria.

00:11:13.865 --> 00:11:18.293
And so what this mitochondria
now does in the moderate

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:23.056
eukaryotic cell as you all know
is it really took over the

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:24.560
energy metabolism.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.657
So, the proto-eukaryotic cell
took up a heterotrophic bacteria

00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:33.000
that form the mitochondria.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.117
And this ultimately then gave
rise to protozoa and to

00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:38.621
modern-day animals.

00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:41.868
But there was a secondary
symbiotic event.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:46.381
This cell, once it had taken up
a heterotrophic bacterium,

00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:50.577
it took up an autotrophic
bacterium, a cyanobacterium,

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:52.873
an oxygenic photosynthesizer.

00:11:52.873 --> 00:11:57.624
And this actually that led to
the development of modern algae

00:11:57.624 --> 00:12:00.000
and modern plants.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.441
So what we can say is that
mitochondria our ancient

00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:24.000
heterotrophic bacteria --
00:12:13&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.916
And the chloroplasts are
ancient cyanobacteria,

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:41.892
so, oxygenic,
photosynthetic bacteria.

00:12:41.892 --> 00:12:53.532
And these obviously have
coevolved to then form animals

00:12:53.532 --> 00:13:00.000
and finally your plants.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.067
So now, obviously we are
talking here about events that

00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:10.000
happened a very,
very long time ago.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.179
And so, the big question is
really how do we really know

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:16.741
this?

00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:22.696
But this takes me to the third
topic, which is that of

00:13:22.696 --> 00:13:24.943
molecular evolution.

00:13:24.943 --> 00:13:30.000
So, we can state the problem
again,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.075
And that is very simply put,
evolution is incredibly slow,

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:38.500
OK?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:44.733
And therefore,
its processes are not directly

00:13:44.733 --> 00:14:01.000
observable.
00:13:47&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.040
And we need to actually use
inference techniques to

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.787
reconstruct evolutionary
processes.

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:11.828
Now, what do we use when we
want to reconstruct the

00:14:11.828 --> 00:14:15.868
evolutionary history of animals
and plants usually?

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:16.515
Anybody?

00:14:16.515 --> 00:14:17.161
Fossils.

00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:17.808
Exactly.

00:14:17.808 --> 00:14:20.474
So you take a shovel,
essentially,

00:14:20.474 --> 00:14:23.545
and dig down into the different
layers.

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:27.828
And there's different
techniques that you can actually

00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:33.000
determine the age of different
sedentary rocks.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.580
For example,
and then you can construct,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.689
if you're lucky,
you'll find enough fossils of a

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:39.946
particular lineage.

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:43.122
You can reconstruct the
evolution of the lineage.

00:14:43.122 --> 00:14:46.496
I'm sure you all have seen the
example of the horse,

00:14:46.496 --> 00:14:49.142
for example,
where we have actually quite

00:14:49.142 --> 00:14:51.987
good evidence when ancient
horses look like.

00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:55.692
And we can reconstruct the
sequence of events that led to

00:14:55.692 --> 00:14:59.000
the evolution of modern-day
horses.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.176
Now, you can imagine,
though, that when we talk about

00:14:59.176 --> 00:14:59.363
such ancient events like these
there really is no fossil

00:14:59.363 --> 00:14:59.387
record.

00:14:59.387 --> 00:14:59.585
OK, so what people have figured
out, then, is that that was

00:14:59.585 --> 00:14:59.778
really a stroke of genius that
came about in the late 60s,

00:14:59.778 --> 00:15:42.000
that DNA molecules can act as
evolutionary chronometers.
00:15:00&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.263
OK, now what do I mean by that?

00:15:44.263 --> 00:15:48.644
I mean that you can take DNA
sequences or gene sequences from

00:15:48.644 --> 00:15:50.761
different kinds of organisms.

00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:54.558
Based on those gene sequences
you can reconstruct the

00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:56.603
relationships to each other.

00:15:56.603 --> 00:16:01.057
You can determine whether two
organisms are closely related or

00:16:01.057 --> 00:16:05.000
whether they are only very
distantly related.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:21.582
And the underlying mechanism of
that, is that mutations happen

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:33.000
with a certain probability all
the time.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.886
So, the idea is that as time
passed on, DNA molecules will

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:41.855
change.

00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:47.943
So they will accumulate,
actually, mutations,

00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:55.415
and so this will lead to,
and that the idea is that the

00:16:55.415 --> 00:17:04.132
amount of change in a particular
DNA sequence is proportional to

00:17:04.132 --> 00:17:12.710
the time of separate evolution
of two different lineages or two

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.000
different organisms.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So, the amount is more or less
proportional --
00:17:26&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:54.000
-- to time since the last
common ancestry.
00:17:42&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.891
So, let me explain how this is
actually done.

00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:14.611
What you really need in order
to do this, is you need genes

00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:21.481
that are related to each other,
OK?

00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:33.000
So, genes, they need to be
universally distributed.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.725
That meets all organisms that
you want to compare need to have

00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:37.824
this type of gene.

00:18:37.824 --> 00:18:50.000
And, those genes need to have
conserved function.
00:18:41&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.271
In these genes,
we can then compare to each

00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:59.457
other, and I will explain how
this is actually done.

00:18:59.457 --> 00:19:02.000
Any questions so far?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.724
OK, so the example that I
actually want to bring is the

00:19:06.724 --> 00:19:26.000
16S ribosomal RNA genes.
00:19:09&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.392
We oftentimes abbreviate this
rRNA.

00:19:31.392 --> 00:19:41.066
Now, does anybody remember what
the ribosomal RNAs are and do?

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:44.237
What's the ribosome?

00:19:44.237 --> 00:19:44.872
Yes?

00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:49.154
Right, and what does it do?

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:56.766
Exactly, it's the location
where messenger RNA is

00:19:56.766 --> 00:20:02.000
translated into protein.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.221
Now, the ribosomal RNAs are an
integral part of the ribosome.

00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:10.582
They play both a catalytic role
as well as a structural role in

00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:11.497
the ribosome.

00:20:11.497 --> 00:20:14.592
And so, fundamentally,
because this is such a

00:20:14.592 --> 00:20:18.110
fundamental organelle,
all living organisms possess

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.321
it.

00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:20.150
So, all organisms have it.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.160
So this allows us to use these
genes to really compare all

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.341
living organisms to each other.

00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:30.000
OK, so this is a very important
point.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.138
I wanted to show you a,
OK, if it wakes up.

00:20:33.138 --> 00:20:34.035
There we go.

00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:38.593
An example of these ribosomal
RNA genes, now this is actually,

00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:42.180
what you see here is a
secondary structure of the

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.421
actual RNA, the ribosomal RNA.

00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:48.830
Now, these molecules have a
secondary structure because they

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.520
play a catalytic and structural
role.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.630
And so, the really amazing
thing is when you look at the

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.665
structure, the structure
determines really the function

00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:04.000
of those molecules in different
organisms.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.631
And then look at this.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:09.265
We have here a bacterium,
and here are an archaea.

00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:13.122
Now, if you think back to the
first couple of slides,

00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:17.424
what I showed you is that those
organisms have not shared a

00:21:17.424 --> 00:21:21.058
common evolutionary history for
about four, or so,

00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:23.506
billion years,
or 3 billion years,

00:21:23.506 --> 00:21:24.248
excuse me.

00:21:24.248 --> 00:21:28.253
But, if you just glance very
quickly at the structures,

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:33.000
you see that they look very
similar to each other.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.917
So, there's an indication that
the function is really very

00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:39.322
highly conserved of those
molecules.

00:21:39.322 --> 00:21:43.308
However, when you actually look
at the sequences in detail,

00:21:43.308 --> 00:21:46.744
what you'll find is that
there's different regions.

00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:49.836
And I'd given some examples
here denoted by A,

00:21:49.836 --> 00:21:51.485
B, C in those molecules.

00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:55.746
And these different regions of
the molecules are really the key

00:21:55.746 --> 00:21:59.938
to its usefulness in figuring
out the evolution and ecology of

00:21:59.938 --> 00:22:02.000
many organisms.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.197
The region number A here,
or denoted by A,

00:22:05.197 --> 00:22:09.175
a sequence stretches that are
the same in all living

00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:09.955
organisms.

00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:14.089
So they are universally
conserved, which means that if

00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:18.300
you get a mutation in a gene in
that particular region,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.314
you are dead.

00:22:19.314 --> 00:22:22.512
OK, that's why it's conserved
essentially.

00:22:22.512 --> 00:22:27.036
Then we have those regions B
where the length is conserved,

00:22:27.036 --> 00:22:30.000
but the sequence is not.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.292
So, there are sequence change
allowed, but the length needs to

00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:35.207
be conserved.

00:22:35.207 --> 00:22:39.500
And then there's the region C
were neither length nor sequence

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.807
is actually conserved,
and where we get a lot of

00:22:42.807 --> 00:22:43.511
variation.

00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:45.411
So, let me write this down.

00:22:45.411 --> 00:23:00.000
We have three types of sequence
stretches.
00:22:49&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:10.531
We have A, what I called the
universally conserved sequences.

00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:19.835
We have B where length,
but not sequence is conserved.

00:23:19.835 --> 00:23:30.191
And, we have C where neither
length nor sequence is actually

00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:42.000
conserved.
00:23:33&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.645
And the first two stretches,
the first two types of sequence

00:23:48.645 --> 00:23:55.515
stretches, are very important in
figuring out the phylogeny or

00:23:55.515 --> 00:24:00.921
the evolutionary relationships
amongst organisms.

00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:07.566
Whereas the sequence stretches
number C because they vary so

00:24:07.566 --> 00:24:11.395
dramatically,
are very important in

00:24:11.395 --> 00:24:15.000
identifying organisms.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.234
And we'll talk more about this
actually next time.

00:24:19.234 --> 00:24:23.728
So what can we actually know do
with those sequences?

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:49.000
Well, the first step is we need
to generate an alignment.
00:24:29&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.962
OK, and this is actually shown
here, where each row denotes a

00:24:53.962 --> 00:24:56.609
gene from a particular organism.

00:24:56.609 --> 00:25:00.000
OK, so these are all
abbreviated here.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.240
These actually aren't ribosomal
RNA genes, but other genes.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.774
And that what you will see here
is we can recognize those three

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:12.137
different regions that I've
pointed out before.

00:25:12.137 --> 00:25:16.451
You have the regions A which
tell you which nucleotides line

00:25:16.451 --> 00:25:19.961
up with each other,
so you use this sort of as an

00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:24.129
anchor because the sequences
never vary amongst organisms.

00:25:24.129 --> 00:25:28.369
And that the sequence region B
where you light up sequences

00:25:28.369 --> 00:25:34.000
that vary or stretches that vary
in sequence but not in length.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.551
Now, why is this important?

00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:42.409
It's important because you have
in each column that nucleotides

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:47.606
that have originated from a
common ancestral nucleotide,

00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:52.708
and whose variation over time
you can actually monitor.

00:25:52.708 --> 00:25:54.881
Is everybody with that?

00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:56.204
Any questions?

00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:58.000
OK, great.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.655
The second step,
then, is the calculation of a

00:26:02.655 --> 00:26:16.000
similarity.
00:26:04&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.803
And this is shown here.

00:26:17.803 --> 00:26:21.960
Again, we have a very
simplified alignment now of four

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.529
different organisms.

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:27.529
Here, we have the sequences
that we want to compare.

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:31.921
And what you'll see is that
they're overall very similar,

00:26:31.921 --> 00:26:36.000
but there are different sort of
nucleotides.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.463
And so, what we simply do is
for each pair of sequence

00:26:40.463 --> 00:26:43.663
combinations,
we calculate the sequence

00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:45.094
similarity value.

00:26:45.094 --> 00:26:49.136
So, what you see is that you
have 12 nucleotides,

00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:53.094
and the first pair differs in
three nucleotides.

00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:56.968
OK, so that tells us,
or it's called actually a

00:26:56.968 --> 00:27:00.000
distance here,
I'm sorry.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Let me write this down here.
00:27:01&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.925
It's simply one minus the
similarity, of course,

00:27:16.925 --> 00:27:22.899
but so basically a quarter of
the nucleotides differ where

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:27.825
it's between A and C,
a third of the nucleotides

00:27:27.825 --> 00:27:29.292
difference on.

00:27:29.292 --> 00:27:34.008
OK, so you do this for each
pair of sequences,

00:27:34.008 --> 00:27:36.000
excuse me.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.728
The third step,
then, is to calculate the

00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:51.308
correction for multiple
mutations affecting the same

00:27:51.308 --> 00:28:08.000
nucleotides.
00:27:54&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.325
Now, you can imagine that over
time there's a probability that

00:28:12.325 --> 00:28:15.374
a particular nucleotide mutates,
say, twice.

00:28:15.374 --> 00:28:19.132
So, in the first instance it
may change from A to a G,

00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:21.188
, but then it changes to a C.

00:28:21.188 --> 00:28:24.378
But when you look at the
modern-day sequences,

00:28:24.378 --> 00:28:27.356
you don't know that this
actually happened.

00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:31.114
And so there's ways to
statistically estimate what the

00:28:31.114 --> 00:28:35.369
likelihood is that a sequence
actually contains such multiple

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:37.000
events.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.979
OK, and this,
we called, a corrective

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:42.213
evolutionary distance then.

00:28:42.213 --> 00:28:46.848
And what you will note is that
the corrected evolutionary

00:28:46.848 --> 00:28:51.648
distance is invariably larger
than the actual observed one.

00:28:51.648 --> 00:28:55.289
Now, what can we can do with
those distances?

00:28:55.289 --> 00:29:01.000
We can constrain them into a
best fit tree of relationships.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.313
So, we can draw what we call is
a best fit tree.

00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:08.347
That's shown here.

00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:14.339
We have our four organisms,
but when you look at those

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:21.460
branches of the tree what you'll
see is that they add up roughly

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:27.000
to the correct evolutionary
distance here.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.552
So, between A and B we have
0.23 and 0.08,

00:29:30.552 --> 00:29:35.577
which roughly gives you 0.3
here, OK, whereas between A and

00:29:35.577 --> 00:29:39.563
C the tree is constrain such
that we have 0.31,

00:29:39.563 --> 00:29:43.375
and here 0.15,
and so overall you roughly get

00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:46.927
the distance here that we have
calculated.

00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:51.953
And so what this means is that
you ordered the organisms by

00:29:51.953 --> 00:29:55.245
their calculated evolutionary
distance.

00:29:55.245 --> 00:30:00.010
And so you have now obtained,
actually, a very intuitive

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:05.296
picture of the relationship of
organisms to each other where A

00:30:05.296 --> 00:30:09.541
and B are obviously the most
closely related ones,

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:15.000
and A and D are the most
distantly related.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.612
Is everybody with it?

00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:21.021
Any questions?

00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:49.000
OK, now, this best fit tree is
what we call a phylogeny.
00:30:31&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.121
Now, excuse me,
these techniques really

00:30:54.121 --> 00:31:01.400
revolutionized the study of
evolutionary relationships,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:09.621
and one of the things that it
allowed us to do is to construct

00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:17.843
universal phylogenetic trees or
what we can also call the tree

00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:20.000
of life.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.865
And I will show you this on the
next slide, and that I want to

00:31:25.865 --> 00:31:30.000
make a few general statements
about this.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.625
So first of all,
when you analyze all known

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:42.187
organisms, and obviously that
would be a big task,

00:31:42.187 --> 00:31:50.357
but representative of all known
organisms, what you'll find is

00:31:50.357 --> 00:31:55.982
that, indeed,
we have three major lineages:

00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:59.330
the bacteria,
the archaea,

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.473
and the eukarya.

00:32:01.473 --> 00:32:08.035
OK, so we have what we call
three domains of life:

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:15.000
the archaea,
bacteria, and the eukarya.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.150
So, this really is the evidence
that life really split very,

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:25.039
very early on into those three
lineages that I showed you

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.000
before.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.836
Interestingly,
two of those major domains here

00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:34.300
are prokaryotic,
OK?

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.228
So, two of the domains are
prokaryotes.

00:32:39.228 --> 00:32:47.010
Moreover, if you actually look
at the types of organisms that

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:54.921
are on here, you'll notice that
even on the eukaryotic side of

00:32:54.921 --> 00:33:04.000
the tree, most of the organisms
here are actually microbial.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.159
So, the single celled
organisms: and that means that

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:15.352
most of the life on the planet
is microbial.

00:33:15.352 --> 00:33:21.149
The vast diversity of organisms
on the planet are

00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:22.961
microorganisms.

00:33:22.961 --> 00:33:29.000
So, we can say that most life
is microbial.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.381
And when you,
then, look at analysis of

00:33:32.381 --> 00:33:36.297
mitochondria,
and chloroplasts which all have

00:33:36.297 --> 00:33:41.281
their own genetic machinery,
and therefore also their own

00:33:41.281 --> 00:33:45.107
ribosomes you'll see that the
mitochondrion,

00:33:45.107 --> 00:33:49.913
OK, and the chloroplasts both
tree within the bacteria.

00:33:49.913 --> 00:33:54.274
So, we really have an amazing
confirmation of this

00:33:54.274 --> 00:33:58.723
endosymbiont theory which
actually developed in the

00:33:58.723 --> 00:34:03.885
absence of gene sequences by
some Russian scientists in the

00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:07.000
early 20th century.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:20.042
So, we have that mitochondria
and chloroplasts tree within

00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:31.483
bacteria, and this really
supports the endosymbiont

00:34:31.483 --> 00:34:34.000
theory.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.823
So really, you could say
eukaryotes are really just

00:34:38.823 --> 00:34:43.357
walking, and swimming,
and flying incubators for

00:34:43.357 --> 00:34:44.901
bacteria, right?

00:34:44.901 --> 00:34:48.084
So, just hosts for
microorganisms.

00:34:48.084 --> 00:34:53.390
OK, so basically you can,
what you should take home from

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:56.574
this is the three domains of
life.

00:34:56.574 --> 00:35:01.204
Two are prokaryotic,
and even more so most of the

00:35:01.204 --> 00:35:05.449
diversity that we find is
actually microbial,

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:10.369
and then finally the
endosymbiont theory is actually

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:15.000
confirmed by those phylogenies.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.227
Now, what I want to cover in
the remaining time,

00:35:19.227 --> 00:35:24.084
is how we can actually use now
those sequences to learn

00:35:24.084 --> 00:35:28.042
something about organisms in the
environment.

00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:41.000
That's the topic of molecular
ecology.
00:35:32&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.190
To introduce this,
I just want to show you a

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.716
couple slides that really sort
of capture what the big problem

00:35:48.716 --> 00:35:50.645
is that we're facing here.

00:35:50.645 --> 00:35:54.651
Now, when we look at the
abundance of prokaryotic cells

00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:57.174
in different types of
environments,

00:35:57.174 --> 00:36:01.551
what we see is that there is an
enormous number of different

00:36:01.551 --> 00:36:04.000
prokaryotes out there.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.742
This summarizes,
here, different types of

00:36:06.742 --> 00:36:07.633
environments.

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:11.335
We have the marine environment,
freshwater environment,

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:14.352
sediment and soils,
subsurface sentiments and

00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:15.174
animal guts.

00:36:15.174 --> 00:36:19.014
And that this number here gives
you the average number of

00:36:19.014 --> 00:36:22.510
prokaryotic cells either per
milliliter or per gram.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.349
And it here we have the total
number of cells obtained by

00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:30.326
multiplying the average number
with the total volume of the

00:36:30.326 --> 00:36:33.000
particular environment.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.683
So what you can see is that in
the marine environment,

00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:40.575
we have an average half a
million cells per milliliter of

00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:41.270
water, OK?

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.328
It freshwater,
we have about a million cells.

00:36:44.328 --> 00:36:46.065
What is that telling you?

00:36:46.065 --> 00:36:48.706
There's a ton of prokaryotes
out there.

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:51.903
What you go swimming,
you take a little gulp of

00:36:51.903 --> 00:36:55.795
water: you've probably eaten
several million prokaryotes,

00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:59.548
that it's nothing to worry
about because what this also

00:36:59.548 --> 00:37:03.162
tells us is that very,
very few prokaryotes out there

00:37:03.162 --> 00:37:07.262
are really pathogens because
otherwise you'd be sick all the

00:37:07.262 --> 00:37:09.000
time.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.057
Now, in sediments and soils,
in as little as a gram you have

00:37:15.057 --> 00:37:19.163
five times 10^9 prokaryotic
cells almost.

00:37:19.163 --> 00:37:25.220
5 billion prokaryotic cells are
out there, and even in very,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.942
very deep sediments that reach
down to 3,000 m,

00:37:29.942 --> 00:37:36.000
you have a substantial number
of prokaryotic cells.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.731
Well, and here's your guts,
10^5 times 10^6 gives you 10^11

00:37:40.731 --> 00:37:41.465
per gram.

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:46.277
So again, you're just a walking
incubator for a very complex

00:37:46.277 --> 00:37:47.909
microbial community.

00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:50.193
Here's the global abundance.

00:37:50.193 --> 00:37:54.598
You see that steeps of surface
sediments and the marine

00:37:54.598 --> 00:37:58.676
environment, probably in terms
of numbers at least,

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:03.000
the most important microbial
environments.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.239
Now, faced with this enormous
abundance of prokaryotes out

00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:11.479
there, very important question
is how many of them are out

00:38:11.479 --> 00:38:11.925
there?

00:38:11.925 --> 00:38:15.644
Or, how diverse our prokaryotes
in the environment?

00:38:15.644 --> 00:38:20.107
That's important if you want to
figure out their function and

00:38:20.107 --> 00:38:23.305
the environment,
and want to understand also

00:38:23.305 --> 00:38:24.495
their evolution.

00:38:24.495 --> 00:38:28.809
And what I want to show you
here is that we've gone through

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:33.049
an amazing development in our
understanding of prokaryotic

00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:37.438
diversity in the environment
over the last 10 to 15 years or

00:38:37.438 --> 00:38:39.000
so.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.068
Who knows about E.O.

00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:42.310
Wilson here?

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.448
One person?

00:38:43.448 --> 00:38:48.310
So, he wrote a very famous book
on biodiversity,

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:54.103
which was published in 1988,
where he tried to summarize,

00:38:54.103 --> 00:39:00.206
really, how diverse the known
organisms are on the planet it

00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:06.000
also try to extrapolate to the
total diversity.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.059
And what you see is that he
came up with about 1.4 million

00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:13.691
different species here,
mostly dominated by insects.

00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:16.896
That's the big section here on
this pie chart.

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:18.818
The plants: very important.

00:39:18.818 --> 00:39:21.952
And if you look,
the prokaryotes feature with

00:39:21.952 --> 00:39:24.089
about 3,500 different species.

00:39:24.089 --> 00:39:27.863
So, in 1988 we thought there
were very few prokaryotic

00:39:27.863 --> 00:39:30.000
species out there.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.071
If you look about 10 years into
the future and take the

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.464
assessment here,
and this just exemplifies how

00:39:37.464 --> 00:39:41.611
the thinking has changed,
you see that we think now that

00:39:41.611 --> 00:39:45.607
there is about 11 million
different species out there,

00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:49.376
and that the vast majority of
them are prokaryotic,

00:39:49.376 --> 00:39:50.507
OK, 10 million.

00:39:50.507 --> 00:39:54.956
So, this big part of the pie
chart is really the prokaryotic

00:39:54.956 --> 00:39:55.710
diversity.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:40:00.309
Now, what really has changed is
that we've actually started to

00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:04.305
use molecular techniques to
determine the diversity of

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:08.000
prokaryotes in the environment.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:18.694
So molecular ecology is really
the use of molecular gene

00:40:18.694 --> 00:40:38.000
sequences obtained directly from
the environment --
00:40:29&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:54.000
-- to learn about the diversity
prokaryotic --
00:40:46&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.876
-- diversity out there.

00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:59.466
Now, this slide just quickly
summarizes this.

00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:04.525
Basically, the idea is that you
go out into the environment and

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:07.870
collect either water or soil
samples that,

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.787
as I just showed you,
invariably contain a lot of

00:41:11.787 --> 00:41:14.072
different prokaryotic cells.

00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:17.662
You then lyse the cells and
purify their DNA.

00:41:17.662 --> 00:41:22.476
And so that you end up with a
mixture of DNA that represents

00:41:22.476 --> 00:41:26.882
the organisms out there,
and then you can use universal

00:41:26.882 --> 00:41:32.022
PCR primers to actually amplify
ribosomal RNA genes from all the

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:37.000
organisms that are present in
your samples.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.022
Now, why can you use universal
PCR primers?

00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:46.291
Well, they target the regions
number A that I showed you

00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:46.961
before.

00:41:46.961 --> 00:41:52.900
Those regions in the genes are
invariant amongst all organisms.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.306
You guys all remember how the
PCR works, right?

00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:58.647
We cover this.

00:41:58.647 --> 00:41:58.934
OK?

00:41:58.934 --> 00:41:59.318
Yes?

00:41:59.318 --> 00:41:59.605
No?

00:41:59.605 --> 00:42:02.000
Who doesn't?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:02.822
You don't?

00:42:02.822 --> 00:42:05.208
All right, come to the board.

00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:06.277
Just kidding.

00:42:06.277 --> 00:42:08.416
OK, you should look it up.

00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:12.200
I don't have time to cover
this, unfortunately,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.807
but basically it's a technique
that allows you to amplify

00:42:16.807 --> 00:42:20.755
specific types of genes millions
to billion fold.

00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:25.609
And once you have done this,
what you can do is that you can

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:29.722
purify the genes on gels,
and then separate them by

00:42:29.722 --> 00:42:34.000
cloning them into individual
plasmids.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.786
And those plasmids have been
inserted into E.

00:42:37.786 --> 00:42:41.314
coli cells, and the E.
coli cells are then

00:42:41.314 --> 00:42:46.219
individually grown up so that
each culture contains only a

00:42:46.219 --> 00:42:50.178
single plasmid,
and you can then sequence these

00:42:50.178 --> 00:42:54.910
ribosomal DNAs or ribosomal RNA
genes from those clones.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:59.643
And so, you have obtained a
library of the ribosomal RNA

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:03.000
genes from the environment.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.154
So, we use environmental
ribosomal RNA gene libraries

00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:23.246
from which we then can actually
compare how many different types

00:43:23.246 --> 00:43:28.000
of genes are out there.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.799
So let me show you an example
of this.

00:43:30.799 --> 00:43:34.961
What we have done recently,
we've gone out in one of the

00:43:34.961 --> 00:43:39.122
first really comprehensive
samplings of coastal bacteria

00:43:39.122 --> 00:43:43.284
plankton, which means the
bacteria that are present free

00:43:43.284 --> 00:43:44.948
living in ocean water.

00:43:44.948 --> 00:43:48.656
And so, we've done this,
we've collected all those

00:43:48.656 --> 00:43:53.120
clones, and then basically we
constructed those phylogenetic

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.509
trees that I showed you before
that really allow us see how

00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:01.897
many different types are out
there, and how closely related

00:44:01.897 --> 00:44:05.000
they are to one another.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.836
And what we found is that in
this environment that you think

00:44:09.836 --> 00:44:14.672
might be very simple because it
just the water column right?

00:44:14.672 --> 00:44:17.213
No, not much structure in
there.

00:44:17.213 --> 00:44:21.967
We found over 1500 bacterial
16S ribosomal RNA sequences to

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:26.885
occur, so an enormous diversity
of prokaryotes of bacteria in

00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:30.000
that particular environment.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.116
And the important point is that
when you actually look at a

00:44:34.116 --> 00:44:37.594
collection of such studies that
I just showed you,

00:44:37.594 --> 00:44:41.782
what you find is that the vast
majority of microorganisms in

00:44:41.782 --> 00:44:44.621
the environment have never been
cultured.

00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:48.241
So traditionally what we do of
course to learn about

00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:51.293
microorganisms when you grow E.
coli, or so,

00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:53.706
you throw them onto culture
plates.

00:44:53.706 --> 00:44:57.610
You make lots of different
cells, and that allows you to

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.810
study some of their properties.

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.940
But when you look,
for example,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.985
at results from the ocean,
this summarizes now coastal and

00:45:05.985 --> 00:45:09.889
open ocean environments,
again, the bacteria plankton is

00:45:09.889 --> 00:45:15.000
those free-floating bacterial
cells in the water.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.961
And you compare this to what
we've actually been able to

00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:21.266
culture from those environments.

00:45:21.266 --> 00:45:25.228
What you see is that you have
some dominant groups here.

00:45:25.228 --> 00:45:28.038
They have all funny names,
most of them,

00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:32.000
because they're just clones and
clone libraries.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.938
But these are the dominant
groups that show up in clone

00:45:35.938 --> 00:45:36.667
libraries.

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.168
Here's their relative
representation in different

00:45:40.168 --> 00:45:43.523
clone libraries from a variety
of environments.

00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:46.660
And so here you have one very
important one,

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.702
the SAR11 group,
or this one,

00:45:48.702 --> 00:45:52.276
the SAR86, that always show up
in clone libraries.

00:45:52.276 --> 00:45:56.506
But we've never see them in
culture, so the important point

00:45:56.506 --> 00:46:00.664
to realize here is that what is
actually happening is that

00:46:00.664 --> 00:46:04.092
whenever we go out,
we find a great diversity of

00:46:04.092 --> 00:46:07.593
bacteria out there,
but we have no idea what they

00:46:07.593 --> 00:46:10.000
actually do.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.617
And this is one of the big
questions that we need to answer

00:46:13.617 --> 00:46:16.424
to understand,
really, how the planet actually

00:46:16.424 --> 00:46:16.799
works.

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:19.918
What are those uncultured
microorganisms out in the

00:46:19.918 --> 00:46:23.286
environment really doing,
and what is their importance?

00:46:23.286 --> 00:46:25.469
And we'll talk about this next
time.

00:46:25.469 --> 00:46:28.900
We're going to talk about
environmental genomics because

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.768
essentially what we can do now,
is we have techniques available

00:46:32.768 --> 00:46:36.261
that allow us to isolate and
least large fragments of the

00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:39.692
genomes, sequence those,
and look at what kinds of genes

00:46:39.692 --> 00:46:42.000
they have present.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.940
And that allows us,
then, to infer some of their

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.443
function in the biogeochemical
cycles in the environment.

00:46:48.443 --> 00:46:52.197
OK, so with this I'm going to
close today unless you have any

00:46:52.197 --> 00:46:53.197
more questions.
