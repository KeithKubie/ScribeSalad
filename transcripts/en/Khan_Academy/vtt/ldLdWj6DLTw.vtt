00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.831
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can evaluate

00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:04.178
the definite integral from 11 pi over

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:05.849
two to six pi

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:07.849
of nine sine of x dx.

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:11.663
So the first thing,
let's see if we can take

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:13.807
the antiderivative of nine sine of x,

00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:15.113
and we could use some of our integration

00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:17.567
properties to simplify this a little bit.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.127
So this is going to be equal to,

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:23.663
this is the same thing as
nine times the integral

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:27.746
from 11 pi over two to
six pi of sine of x dx.

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:35.133
And what's the
anitderivative of sine of x?

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.741
Well we know, from our
derivatives, that the

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.574
derivative with respect
to x of cosine of x

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:46.215
is equal to negative sine of x,

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:49.018
negative sine of x.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.611
So can we construct this in some way

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:53.403
so this is a negative sine of x?

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:55.107
What if I multiplied, on the inside,

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:57.235
what if I multiplied it by negative one?

00:00:57.235 --> 00:00:58.820
Well I can't just
multiply in only one place

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.981
by negative one, I need to multiply by

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.561
negative one twice so I'm
not changing its value.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.755
So what if I said negative
nine times negative sine of x?

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:07.567
Well this is still
gonna be nine sine of x.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.701
If you took negative nine
times negative sine of x,

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.901
it is nine sine of x,
and I did it this way

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:14.949
because now negative sine of x,

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.629
it matches the derivative of cosine of x.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.865
So we could say that this
is all going to be equal to,

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.457
it's all going to be
equal to, you have your

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:28.038
negative nine out front,
negative nine times,

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.621
times, I'll put it in brackets,

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.366
negative nine times, the antiderivative

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.000
of negative sine of x, well that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.892
is just going to be cosine of x,

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:42.892
cosine of x,

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:47.281
and we're going to
evaluate it at its bounds.

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.748
We're going to evaluate it at six pi,

00:01:50.748 --> 00:01:53.356
let me do that in a
color I haven't used yet,

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.507
we're gonna do that at six pi, and we're

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:58.635
also going to do that at 11 pi over two,

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:02.635
11 pi over two, so this
is going to be equal to,

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:06.754
this is equal to negative nine times,

00:02:07.782 --> 00:02:09.949
I'm going to create some space here,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.323
so actually that's probably
more space than I need,

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:15.627
it's going to be cosine of six pi,

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:17.044
cosine of six pi,

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:25.889
minus cosine of 11 pi over two,

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.072
cosine of 11 pi over two.

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.309
Well what is cosine of six pi going to be?

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.645
Well, cosine of any multiple of

00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:43.624
two pi is going to be equal to one.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:45.195
You could view six pi as, we're going

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:47.715
around the unit circle three times.

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:50.279
So this is the same thing
as cosine of two pi,

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.236
or the same thing as cosine of zero,

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:54.438
so that is going to be equal to one.

00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:55.811
If that seems unfamiliar to you

00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:56.919
I encourage you to review the

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.762
unit circle definition of cosine.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.845
And what is cosine of 11 pi over two?

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.129
Let's see, let's subtract some,

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.693
let's subtract some
multiple of two pi here

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:11.930
to put it in values that
we can understand better.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.620
So this is, so let me write it here,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.787
cosine of 11 pi over 2,
that is the same thing as,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.509
let's see, if we were to subtract,

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.288
this is the same thing as cosine of

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:30.955
11 pi over two minus,
this is the same thing

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:34.999
as five and one half pi, right?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.168
Yeah, so this is, so
we could view this as,

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:42.677
we could subtract, let's subtract four pi,

00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:44.966
which is going to be, we could

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.803
write that as eight pi over two.

00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:48.832
In fact, no, let's subtract five,

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:52.999
no, let's subtract four pi,
which is eight pi over 2.

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:56.951
So once again, I'm just subtracting

00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.032
a multiple of two pi,
which isn't gonna change

00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.996
the value of cosine, and
so this is going to be

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:04.579
equal to cosine of 3 pi over 2.

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:09.529
And if we imagine the unit circle,

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.437
and let me draw the unit circle here.

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:15.854
So it's my y axis, my x axis, and then

00:04:18.056 --> 00:04:21.594
I have the unit circle, so, whoops.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.692
So the unit circle just like that.

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:26.189
So if we start at, this is zero,

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.736
then you go to pi over two, then you

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:30.657
go to pi, then you go
to three pi over two,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:33.062
so that's this point on the unit circle,

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:34.630
so the cosine is the x coordinate,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.298
so this is going to be zero.

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:39.658
This is zero so this
is zero, and so we get

00:04:39.658 --> 00:04:42.614
one minus zero, so
everything in the brackets

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:46.211
evaluates out to one,
and so we are left with,

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:50.449
so let me do that, so all
of this is equal to one.

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.376
And so you have negative nine times one,

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:55.914
which of course is just negative nine,

00:04:55.914 --> 00:04:58.860
is what this definite
integral evaluates to.
