00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.090
So I think that there is a special function that's

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.730
only for pickles fields, but I can't remember what it

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.080
was. Maybe we should, copy and paste that error into

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.600
Google and see if it tells us what that error is?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.270
&gt;&gt; Formula for pickless field.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.750
&gt;&gt; Right here, awesome,. Ellen Williams. So, she

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.640
also is writing an if statement that's using

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.460
pickless values. And so you can see here, if is pick val, which is the function

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.760
that you need to use, that's the, stage name

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.090
is the field, and then pending is probably the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.960
pickless value. So if the stage name is pending,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.550
do this. So we need to use that also.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.372
&gt;&gt; It's funny that she was dealing with stages, too.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.641
[LAUGH]

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.641
&gt;&gt;

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.486
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:46.060
&gt;&gt; So let's grab from the functions on the right, and over here.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.813
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.000
&gt;&gt; We can grab text. ISPICVAL.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.270
&gt;&gt; Yep. ISPICVAL.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.640
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.010
&gt;&gt; Okay and where to do we want to put this if?

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.850
&gt;&gt; In that first, yeah, over the Ticket Type VIP.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, then like, pick this field.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.440
It's going to be ticket type, and the text is VIP.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.675
&gt;&gt; Yep. Alright, let's check the syntax now. Awesome.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.860
&gt;&gt; That's cool. Alright. This formula's a bit of a

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.040
beast. I would not have come up with it by myself.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.210
But I guess Google was a good, good tool. Is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.400
that something you find yourself doing a lot when you're developing?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.680
&gt;&gt; yeah. I mean, because, we're not supposed to remember

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.010
everything. And so, definitely whenever I run into errors, I'll Google

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.310
the error itself because a lot of people have ran into

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.200
the same things before. There's also in the upper right hand corner

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.210
these Quick Tips for getting started, seeing samples, more examples. I mean,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.370
there's a lot of tools available if you are new to formulas.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.750
&gt;&gt; Cool.
