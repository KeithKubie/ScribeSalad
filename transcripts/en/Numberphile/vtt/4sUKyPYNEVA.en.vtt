BRADY HARAN: Hi there,
everyone.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.830
I'm on holiday at the moment.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.480
But like any numberphile, I'm
thinking about numbers.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.400
And I've been so impressed with
all the one-roll Yahtzees

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
you've been sending in, I've
decided to up the ante.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.770
So I've got some dice here.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm going to go for another
one-roll Yahtzee.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.010
But have a look at this.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040
I'll show you where I'm
going to do it.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.070
I'm going to need this.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.320
That's a bit of a clue.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.490
Got my flippers, and there
is the Indian Ocean.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.800
That's where I'm going to go
for my underwater Maldivian

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.050
one-roll Yahtzee.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.350
So while I head on out to sea,
here are the latest videos

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.730
from you, the viewers.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.970
Firstly, DoodleChaos.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.040
A fan of Rube Goldberg machines,
came up with this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.325
inspired contraption.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.620
And then went a step further.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.420
We know there's a 1 in 1,296
chance of rolling five

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670
matching dice.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.900
A sixth matching dice,
1 in 7,776.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.446
But it's no dice this
time, I'm afraid.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.100
And I'm still struggling
under water.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.015
Here are some people who
were more successful.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.030
MALE SPEAKER: Yes!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.060
MALE SPEAKER: Oh my God.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.310
Oh my God.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.240
MALE SPEAKER: Whoo!

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.412
MALE SPEAKER: So this is for
Numberphile, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.490
[LAUGHING]

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.619
MALE SPEAKER: Yahtzee.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.869
MALE SPEAKER: Yahtzee.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.250
MALE SPEAKER: Yes!

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.100
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.090
Yahtzee, woo.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.340
Yahtzee.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.040
BRADY HARAN: This isn't
proving easy.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.120
Maybe some homemade software
is the key.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.360
Now I mentioned how tough a
six dice Yahtzee is, but

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.610
here's someone who did it.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.080
Not everyone's so lucky.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.100
Here's someone who never
got a Yahtzee but

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.820
still sent in the video.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.430
And you know what, even
migrating to dry land now, I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.370
don't seem to be having
much luck either.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.840
Stay tuned to Numberphile
though, because we do have

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.360
more videos coming, including
a very special Yahtzee

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.800
contribution from someone
you may recognize.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.470
VIHART: Yo, Brady.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.300
It's ViHart.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.850
And as promised, I'm going
to throw you a Yahtzee.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.690
BRADY HARAN: That's definitely
going to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.970
be one worth watching.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.110
Here's the link to all our
previous Yahtzee videos.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.810
But I promise the next
Numberphile video, that won't

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.370
have any dice at all because,
well, frankly, I'm sick of the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.620
sight of them.
