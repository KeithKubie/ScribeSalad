1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,970
Good.
We're rolling

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,490
some of the major events in human history,

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,790
our population level
consequences of individual
decisions and one that has great

4
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:21,761
impact on the issue of mismatch and of
the health of contemporary populations is

5
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,260
the great transition.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,420
That is the phrase we use to describe
the combination of the industrial

7
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:33,170
revolution and the epidemiological
transition that followed from it

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,640
that lead to declines in mortality,
fertility that are changing selection.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,060
The effects of change selection,
uh,

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,880
are particularly noticeable
in life history evolution.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,340
They have led to increase longevity and
the exposure of antagonistic pleiotropy.

12
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:54,790
The increased longevity is not necessarily
the product of selection and can

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,690
simply be the product of decreased
mortality rates resulting from these

14
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,524
transitions.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,180
There've been associated impacts on
nutrition energetics and fertility,

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,570
and at the same time,

17
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,900
there's been a major shift from
infectious to degenerative disease.

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,130
This is one of the most remarkable
recent experiences in human history with

19
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,630
impact on medical issues.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,480
It is probably the largest single
change in human populations since the

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,970
invention of agriculture and it
combines changes in three areas,

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,480
labor, technology, and
economics. In that context,

23
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:45,860
we refer to it as the industrial
revolution and birth and death rates,

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,340
age distributions, nutrition
and growth. In that context,

25
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:54,110
we refer to it as the demographic
transition and in disease prevalence from

26
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,440
infectious disease and
malnutrition to cancer,

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,050
chronic disease and degenerative disease.
In that context,

28
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,840
we refer to it as the
epidemiological transition.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,630
So these processes are continuing.
They have not yet gone to completion.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,800
They are massively rearranging
the human ecology of the planet.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,650
Yeah.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,650
Here is a diagram that shows you what's
going on with mortality and fertility.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,500
These are births per female per lifetime.

34
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,340
This is life expectancy at birth.

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,250
In this panel, which is pretty
much pre-transition, you see India,

36
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:40,230
about 1900 Sweden about 1775
England about 1750 France,

37
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:45,231
about 1740 and in this panel over
here you see post-transition,

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,730
Hungary, Sweden, and France.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,210
So you can see that the births per female
per lifetime has dropped from about

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,430
six down to less than two.

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,630
And you can see that life at birth has
increased from somewhere between 25 and

42
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,490
40 years up to 75 to 80 years.
That's a huge shift.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,830
Okay.

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,060
Across this transition,

45
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:18,200
the driver of selection on humans
shifted for mortality to fertility.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,430
In this diagram we have births
per female per lifetime.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,980
That's the total fertility rate. Here
we also are plotting on the same graph,

48
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,600
the mortality rate per thousand.

49
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:34,601
This is the mortality rate here and
we are plotting selection intensities.

50
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,200
This is the total potential selection
intensity caused by variation in both

51
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:44,201
mortality and fertility rates and it
can be broken down into the mortality

52
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,520
component and the fertility component.

53
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,180
The timescale runs from 1540 up to
1991 and the sample is from England.

54
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,730
So what we can see here is that
total selection has declined.

55
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,290
Mortality Selection has declined
virtually dizzyhero but selection due to

56
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:10,481
variation in fertility actually has
continued and it is what is maintaining

57
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,860
selection and contemporary populations.

58
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,160
This steep decline here in fertility rate,

59
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,420
the slightly less steep
decline in mortality rate is
what is usually called the

60
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:21,740
demographic transition.

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,160
And if we take the decline in
fertility rate as the marker,

62
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:30,161
then it says the demographic transition
was pretty much completed in the UK by

63
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:34,690
about the about the year 1900

64
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,500
the transition has major effects on
human evolution in some post transition

65
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,650
populations. For example, the
US, Australia and Finland,

66
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,690
researchers found that both men and women
are experiencing selection for earlier

67
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:52,720
age.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,720
At first birth women in the u s are
experiencing selection for greater age at

69
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,490
last birth and at menopause,

70
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,440
greater weight and shorter height and
there was selection for lower levels of

71
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:10,390
cholesterol and systolic blood pressure
and other populations.

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,040
In this case The Gambia,

73
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,370
the results differed selection shifted
from decreasing hide and increasing body

74
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:22,381
mass index to increasing
height and decreasing body
mass index as the population

75
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,991
moved through the demographic transition
in this case that occurred about 1975

76
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,450
in one population in Denmark,

77
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,980
the genetic influences on early fertility
increased strongly so they were being

78
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:39,970
exposed by changes in
nutrition and technology.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,850
What this means is that in
post transitional societies,

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the reproductive window in humans is
broadening the combination of earlier age

81
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:56,030
at first birth and later age at last
birth is broadening that window.

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,900
This may not be surprising
because selection is
increasingly driven by variation

83
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:04,590
in fertility and therefore it's
affecting traits that are associated with

84
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:09,591
fertility is also increasing the intensity
of the conflict between biology and

85
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:11,664
culture.

86
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,060
For in some of these cultures there is
pressure to start having children later

87
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:16,860
in life and to have fewer of them,

88
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,990
particularly in two career families where
many women would like to delay their

89
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,910
first child until
they're in their thirties

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,333
another

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,720
issue that arises with the transition is
that the increased lifespan is exposing

92
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,960
genes that have antagonistic pleiotropic
effects the longer post reproductive

93
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:42,960
lifespans of these
post-transition populations or

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,600
showing us that we had previously
accumulated quite a bit of effect of

95
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,980
antagonistic pleiotropy.

96
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,510
So those are genes that
benefit reproduction early
in life but have negative

97
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,410
effects late in life.

98
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,110
Genetic analyses of cancer
risk in dementia suggested
advantages and fertility

99
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:05,400
or juvenile survival are linked to the
risks of these diseases in old age,

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,930
and these links have been suggested for
genes associated with breast cancer,

101
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,090
with cancer in general and with dementia.

102
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,740
The growing global burden of degenerative
disease is explained in part by the

103
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:23,040
exposure of previously evolved
and previously hidden costs.

104
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,870
So these are some of the vulnerabilities
that the evolution of aging has built

105
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,670
into our genome and they are now being
exposed by a mismatch to a completely new

106
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:33,540
kind of environment.

107
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,100
Yeah.

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,610
They're also impacts on nutrition,
energetics and fertility.

109
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,930
The average person in 1800 was not much
better off nutritionally than an average

110
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,100
person thousands of years earlier.

111
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,660
The great transition
uncoupled cycles of mortality,

112
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,700
infertility from the price of grain

113
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,350
between 1961 and 2003 there was a 25%
global increase in energy consumption.

114
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,760
That's about 550 kilocalories
per person per day.

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,320
The plastic biological response to
improve nutrition and growth was earlier.

116
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,820
Men are shorter time to conception,

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,760
less risk of miscarriage
and leader menopause.

118
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,060
Simultaneous changes in culture including
contraception and the cost of raising

119
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:29,800
children postpone childbearing and
decreased lifetime reproductive success.

120
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,890
Concurrent with these nutritional
changes and demographic changes,

121
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,460
there has been a big shift from
infectious to noncommunicative disease.

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,090
I've shown this figure before.
It deserves emphasis.

123
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,480
During the last half of the 20th century,

124
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,910
the incidence of diseases like rheumatic
fever, hepatitis, a, measles, mumps,

125
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:57,911
and tuberculosis declined strikingly
the incidence of immune disorders.

126
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,390
This is in the United States.

127
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,560
Incidents of immune disorders
climbed considerably,

128
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,230
so this increase also
was found for cancer,

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,510
cardiovascular disease,
obesity, diabetes and dementia.

130
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,590
So there's been a huge shift in the post
transitional societies and the kinds of

131
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,970
diseases that medicine has to deal with.

132
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,560
We can see this is a
striking example of mismatch.

133
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,290
It's really the most recent contribution
of environmental change to mismatch

134
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,124
disease.

135
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,500
The shifts in selection pressures
also measure the degree of mismatch.

136
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,850
So in the mismatch lectures we saw
that when we find mismatch it means the

137
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,280
natural selection is operating.

138
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,820
Yeah.

139
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,820
The causes in this case are largely
cultural and are mediated by economics and

140
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:58,480
technology.
Some of the consequences are biological,

141
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,240
mismatched diseases and
shifts in selection pressures.

142
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,130
Yeah.

143
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,310
So to summarize, improvements
in the quality, quantity,

144
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:10,670
and reliability of food
supply and reduction in child
mortality from infections

145
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:14,020
is infectious.
Disease are sharply changing,

146
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:18,310
both phenotypic plastic end genetic
evolved responses in humans.

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,580
These changed responses include shifts
in metabolic resource allocation and

148
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:28,540
disease resistance, as well as
increases in allergy, asthma,

149
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,000
and autoimmune diseases.
The mismatch diseases,

150
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,910
okay.

151
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,230
Extensions to the lifespan or revealing
previously hidden costs of reproduction

152
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:41,580
that are now expressed lead in life is
increased risk of degenerative disease.

153
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Navigating issues like this in which
biological and cultural evolution are

154
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,350
interacting to change.

155
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,880
Health and disease requires facility
in moving between the interests of

156
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,340
individuals and the
interest of populations.

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Understanding evolutionary processes
helps to develop that facility and that

158
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:04,260
mental agility.
