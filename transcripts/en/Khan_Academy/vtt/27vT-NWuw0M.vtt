00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
 

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.630
Let's say I have a line that
goes through the origin.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.630
I'll draw it in R2, but this
can be extended to an

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.630
arbitrary Rn.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.410
Let me draw my axes.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.310
Those are my axes right there,
not perfectly drawn, but you

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.670
get the idea.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.810
Let me draw a line that goes
through the origin here.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.600
So that is my line there.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.830
And we know that a line in any
Rn-- we're doing it in R2--

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.380
can be defined as just all of
the possible scalar multiples

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.550
of some vector.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.390
So let's say that this is
some vector right here

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.600
that's on the line.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.120
We can define our line.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.320
We could say l is equal to
the set of all the scalar

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.700
multiples-- let's say that
that is v, right there.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.520
So it's all the possible scalar
multiples of our vector

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.870
v where the scalar multiples,
by definition, are just any

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.310
real number.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.380
So obviously, if you take all
of the possible multiples of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.760
v, both positive multiples and
negative multiples, and less

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.239
than 1 multiples, fraction
multiples, you'll have a set

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.720
of vectors that will essentially
define or specify

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.340
every point on that line that
goes through the origin.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820
And we know, of course, if this
wasn't a line that went

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.720
through the origin,
you would have to

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.910
shift it by some vector.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.490
It would have to be some
other vector plus cv.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.450
But anyway, we're starting off
with this line definition that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.580
goes through the origin.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.740
What I want to do in this video
is to define the idea of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.550
a projection onto l of
some other vector x.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.630
So let me draw my
other vector x.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's say that this right here
is my other vector x.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.440
Now, a projection, I'm going
to give you just a sense of

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.770
it, and then we'll define it a
little bit more precisely.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.860
A projection, I always imagine,
is if you had some

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.790
light source that were
perpendicular somehow or

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.370
orthogonal to our line-- so
let's say our light source was

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.220
shining down like this, and
I'm doing that direction

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.950
because that is perpendicular
to my line, I imagine the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.600
projection of x onto this line
as kind of the shadow of x.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.485
So if this light was coming
down, I would just draw a

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:15.630
perpendicular like that, and the
shadow of x onto l would

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.840
be that vector right there.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.500
So we can view it as the shadow
of x on our line l.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.550
That's one way to think of it.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.480
Another way to think of it,
and you can think of it

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.580
however you like, is how much of
x goes in the l direction?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.610
So the technique would
be the same.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.570
You would draw a perpendicular
from x to l, and you say, OK

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.740
then how much of l would have to
go in that direction to get

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.330
to my perpendicular?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.270
Either of those are how I
think of the idea of a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.790
projection.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.140
I think the shadow is part of
the motivation for why it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.710
even called a projection,
right?

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.720
When you project something,
you're beaming light and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.870
seeing where the light
hits on a wall, and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.610
you're doing that here.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.330
You're beaming light and you're
seeing where that light

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.190
hits on a line in this case.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.835
But you can't do anything
with this definition.

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:07.750
This is just kind of an
intuitive sense of what a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.740
projection is.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.570
So we need to figure out some
way to calculate this, or a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.490
more mathematically precise
definition.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.430
And one thing we can do is,
when I created this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.360
projection-- let me actually
draw another projection of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.480
another line or another vector
just so you get the idea.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.030
If I had some other vector over
here that looked like

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.050
that, the projection of this
onto the line would look

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.730
something like this.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.440
You would just draw a
perpendicular and its

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.430
projection would be like that.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.210
But I don't want to talk
about just this case.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.410
I want to give you the sense
that it's the shadow of any

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.130
vector onto this line.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.660
So how can we think about it
with our original example?

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.350
In every case, no matter how
I perceive it, I dropped a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.100
perpendicular down here.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.270
And so if we construct a vector
right here, we could

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.120
say, hey, that vector is
always going to be

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.840
perpendicular to the line.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.920
And we can do that.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.320
I wouldn't have been talking
about it if we couldn't.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.050
So let me define this vector,
which I've not

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.480
even defined it.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.450
What is this vector
going to be?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.410
If this vector-- let me
not use all these.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.970
 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.150
We know we want to somehow
get to this blue vector.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.810
Let me keep it in blue.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.560
That blue vector is the
projection of x onto l.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.500
That's what we want to get to.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.230
Now, one thing we can
look at is this pink

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.920
vector right there.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.580
What is that pink vector?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.910
That pink vector that I just
drew, that's the vector x

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.610
minus the projection, minus this
blue vector over here,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.030
minus the projection
of x onto l, right?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.120
If you add the projection to
the pink vector, you get x.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.050
So if you add this blue
projection of x to x minus the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.480
projection of x, you're, of
course, you going to get x.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.630
We also know that this pink
vector is orthogonal to the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.510
line itself, which means it's
orthogonal to every vector on

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.400
the line, which also means that
its dot product is going

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.880
to be zero.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.330
So let me define the projection
this way.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.680
The projection, this is going
to be my slightly more

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.300
mathematical definition.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.270
The projection onto l of some
vector x is going to be some

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.380
vector that's in l, right?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.390
I drew it right here,
this blue vector.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.590
I'll trace it with
white right here.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.070
Some vector in l where, and
this might be a little bit

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:38.910
unintuitive, where x minus the
projection vector onto l of x

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:47.120
is orthogonal to my line.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.850
So I'm saying the projection--
this is my definition.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.990
I'm defining the projection of x
onto l with some vector in l

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.390
where x minus that projection
is orthogonal to l.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.490
This is my definition.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.180
That is a little bit more
precise and I think it makes a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.940
bit of sense why it connects to
the idea of the shadow or

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.050
projection.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.420
But how can we deal with this?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.860
I mean, this is still
just in words.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.580
How can I actually calculate
the projection of x onto l?

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.620
Well, the key clue here is this
notion that x minus the

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.160
projection of x is
orthogonal to l.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.930
So let's see if we can
use that somehow.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.700
So the first thing we need to
realize is, by definition,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.150
because the projection of x onto
l is some vector in l,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.660
that means it's some scalar
multiple of v, some scalar

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.510
multiple of our defining vector,
of our v right there.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.700
So we could also say, look, we
could rewrite our projection

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.640
of x onto l.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.760
We could write it as some scalar
multiple times our

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.270
vector v, right?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.000
We can say that.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.160
This is equivalent to
our projection.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.120
Now, we also know that x minus
our projection is orthogonal

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.580
to l, so we also know that x
minus our projection-- and I

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.345
just said that I could rewrite
my projection as some multiple

00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:03.990
of this vector right there.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.140
You could see it the
way I drew it here.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.790
It almost looks like it's
2 times its vector.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.330
So we know that x minus our
projection, this is our

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.150
projection right here,
is orthogonal to l.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.710
Orthogonality, by definition,
means its dot product with any

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.460
vector in l is 0.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.720
So let's dot it with
some vector in l.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.060
Or we could dot it with
this vector v.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.580
That's what we use
to define l.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.700
So let's dot it with v,
and we know that that

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.380
must be equal to 0.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.810
We're taking this vector right
here, dotting it with v, and

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.680
we know that this has
to be equal to 0.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.390
That has to be equal to 0.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.020
So let's use our properties of
dot products to see if we can

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.910
calculate a particular value of
c, because once we know a

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.130
particular value of c, then we
can just always multiply that

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.910
times the vector v, which we
are given, and we will have

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.760
our projection.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.720
And then I'll show it to you
with some actual numbers.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.610
So let's see if we can
calculate a c.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.200
So if we distribute this c--
oh, sorry, if we distribute

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.670
the v, we know the dot
product exhibits the

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.940
distributive property.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:14.470
This expression can be rewritten
as x dot v, right? x

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.725
dot v minus c times v dot v.

00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:20.450
 

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.410
I rearranged things.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.180
We know that c minus cv dot
v is the same thing.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.530
We could write it as minus cv.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.520
This is minus c times v dot v,
and all of this, of course, is

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.260
equal to 0.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.750
And if we want to solve for c,
let's add cv dot v to both

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.950
sides of the equation.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:44.750
And you get x dot v is equal
to c times v dot v.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.820
Solving for c, let's divide
both sides of this

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.740
equation by v dot v.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.160
You get-- I'll do it in
a different color.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:09:00.470
c is equal to this: x dot
v divided by v dot v.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.930
Now, what was c?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.090
We are saying the projection of
x-- let me write it here.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:10.250
The projection of x onto
l is equal to some

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.870
scalar multiple, right?

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.110
We know it's in the line, so
it's some scalar multiple of

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.550
this defining vector,
the vector v.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.780
And we just figured out
what that scalar

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.730
multiple is going to be.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:35.080
It's going to be x dot v over v
dot v, and this, of course,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.680
is just going to be
a number, right?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.640
This is a scalar still.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.170
Even though we have all these
vectors here, when you take

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.460
their dot products, you just end
up with a number, and you

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.010
multiply that number times v.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.370
You just kind of scale v and
you get your projection.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.000
So in this case, the way I
drew it up here, my dot

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.240
product should end up with some
scaling factor that's

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.260
close to 2, so that if I start
with a v and I scale it up by

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.700
2, this value would be 2, and
I'd get a projection that

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.210
looks something like that.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.360
Now, this looks a little
abstract to you, so let's do

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.870
it with some real vectors, and
I think it'll make a little

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.610
bit more sense.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.450
And nothing I did here
only applies to R2.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.650
Everything I did here can be
extended to an arbitrarily

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.850
high dimension, so even though
we're doing it in R2, and R2

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.890
and R3 is where we tend to
deal with projections the

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.560
most, this could apply to Rn.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.760
Let me do this particular
case.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.940
Let me define my line l to
be the set of all scalar

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.290
multiples of the vector-- I
don't know, let's say the

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:40.150
vector 2, 1, such that
c is any real number.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:46.000
Let me draw my axes here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.150
That's my vertical axis.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.790
This is my horizontal
axis right there.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.770
And so my line is all the
scalar multiples of the

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.990
vector 2 dot 1.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.250
And actually, let me just call
my vector 2 dot 1, let me call

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.130
that right there the vector v.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.950
Let me draw that.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.570
So I go 1, 2, go up 1.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.490
That right there
is my vector v.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.370
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.380
And the line is all of
the possible scalar

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.970
multiples of that.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.010
So let me draw that.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.020
So all the possible scalar
multiples of that and you just

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.010
keep going in that direction, or
you keep going backwards in

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.040
that direction or anything
in between.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.990
That's what my line is, all
of the scalar multiples

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.240
of my vector v.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.900
 

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.680
Now, let's say I have another
vector x, and let's say that x

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.790
is equal to 2, 3.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.140
Let me draw x. x is 2, and
then you go, 1, 2, 3.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.540
So x will look like this.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.110
Vector x will look like that.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.640
Well, let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.780
Vector x will look like that.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.250
That is vector x.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.560
But what we want to do
is figure out the

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.420
projection of x onto l.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.290
We can use this definition
right here.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.810
So let me write it down.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:08.800
The projection of x onto
l is equal to what?

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.850
It's equal to x dot v, right?

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.810
Where v is the defining
vector for our line.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:24.750
So it's equal to x, which is
2, 3, dot v, which is 2, 1,

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.800
all of that over v dot v.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:36.080
So all of that over 2, 1, dot
2, 1 times our original

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.750
defining vector v.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.010
So what's our original
defining vector?

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.190
It's this one right
here, 2, 1.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.410
So times the vector, 2, 1.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.910
And what does this equal?

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:51.380
When you take these two dot of
each other, you have 2 times 2

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:57.240
plus 3 times 1, so 4 plus
3, so you get 7.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.200
This all simplified to 7.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.490
And then this, you get 2
times 2 plus 1 times 1,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.410
so 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.550
So you get 7/5.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.800
That will all simplified to 5.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.370
That was a very fast
simplification.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.270
You might have been daunted
by this strange-looking

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.540
expression, but when you take
dot products, they actually

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.260
tend to simplify very quickly.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.540
And then you just multiply
that times your defining

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.230
vector for the line.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.620
So we're scaling it up
by a factor of 7/5.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.170
So multiply it times
the vector 2, 1,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.490
and what do you get?

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.730
You get the vector-- let me
do it in a new color.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.860
You get the vector, 14/5
and the vector 7/5.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.840
And just so we can visualize
this or plot it a little

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.380
better, let me write
it as decimals.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:48.310
14/5 is 2 and 4/5,
which is 2.8.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.310
And this is 1 and 2/5,
which is 1.4.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.800
And so the projection of x
onto l is 2.8 and 1.4.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.740
So 2.8 is right about there,
and I go 1.4 is right about

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.210
there, so the vector is going
to be right about there.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.655
I haven't even drawn
this too precisely,

00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:07.660
but you get the idea.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.250
This is the projection.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.290
Our computation shows
us that this is the

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.710
projection of x onto l.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.720
If we draw a perpendicular right
there, we see that it's

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.300
consistent with our idea of
this being the shadow of x

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.170
onto our line now.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.490
Well, now we actually can
calculate projections.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.110
In the next video, I'll actually
show you how to

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.135
figure out a matrix
representation for this, which

00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:36.360
is essentially a
transformation.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:36.860
