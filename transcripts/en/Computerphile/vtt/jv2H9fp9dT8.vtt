00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's what I want to do is focus on the real fundamental

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.209
physical limits of course getting down to the the miniaturization

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.869
And the smallest possible structures is an important aspect

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.149
But there's also a speed aspect if you even get down to that you get your density up. How fast can you process?

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.609
The reason I'm quite keen to come back to computerphile is I spent the first two years of my physics degree going shuddered on computer

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.699
science

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.579
and because I'm really quite a per mathematician to put it mildly, but I'm

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.969
As a cold or at least back in the dim distant days of the past I used to be okay

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.439
I started with the zx81 got into assembly language coding did a lot of from

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.180
Zx80 ones that expect from BBC micro all that type of stuff used to love coding my mantra throughout my undergraduate degree

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.699
And I was not a great student was if I can't code this. I don't understand it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.789
So there's a piece of physics particularly piece of mathematical physics

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.559
I'd always think about how do I call this Fourier transforms convolution correlation?

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.298
Can I reduce this to a piece of discrete mathematics and therefore can I actually code it so I've always loved exploring those links between

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.530
Programming coding computers information and physics before we start thinking about limits

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.720
We've got to start thinking about well

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.599
physically what the computers do what do they actually do they they take information in and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.409
They do some computation and they give information out is that a fair enough description Sean sounds good

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.069
yeah, so the interesting thing is just how you define information and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.409
There's a guy called wheeler who was the PhD supervisor of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.850
Feynman what wheel also had this very famous phrase which was it from bit

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.689
So the idea that the fundamental quantity in the universe is not energy. It's not matter its information and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.920
What does he mean by that well it's it's it's intriguing. Let's play around with these. Let's say. We've got a system

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
which is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.899
Entirely what we'd call reversible right? What does that mean it means that if I drop that ball?

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.359
Let's say you're as you can see I'm slowing it down

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.210
But let's imagine that I was actually just dropping it out of my hand and it was coming right back up to the same height

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.050
All right

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.499
That would be what's called an elastic system

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
There's no energy being removed

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.099
This ball is coming right back up to its same height its end position is exactly the same as its starting position. It's entirely reversible

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850
There is a link to computing a promise so

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.020
What happens if we if we add some if we take some energy out of this system and there's this what we call?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360
dissipation this friction

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.249
Does the ball is squishy so when it hits the floor? It's not a perfectly elastic band

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.020
It just doesn't bounce as if it's a rigid object. You know what's gonna happen. It's fairly boring

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.730
Now we've got a problem because that's our final state. That's a right pot

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.389
That's a right part of the system. Do we have any information at all about the input?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.010
From that no not exactly

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.439
It's just there you drop it from this height you drop it from that height you drop it from that height

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.740
You've lost all information about the initial state

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.159
However if it's if there's no energy leaking out of the system, then you drop it from this height

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.339
If it was a perfectly elastic system. Let's do it like that just to pretend then it comes back up to the same height

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.429
This is already telling us that there are interesting links between information and energy

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.030
Now if we look at a standard to get back into computer files territory. There's a direct relationship between the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030
reversibility of the system

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.040
And the information content of the output so in the second case when the balls like that

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.539
Energy's leaked out the system isn't reversible and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.869
We've we have no idea what the input was so we've lost

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Information in that sense has leaked out into the environment the fascinating aspect of this is if you take a NAND gate

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.809
So what we have now is a is a logical connection

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.199
Connection and boolean logic to this physical problem because let's set this up as a truth table

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.069
Let's put that as output which is not how computer scientist might do it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.000
But I'm a physicist

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.290
So I'll do it this way so if we go zero zero you all know how a NAND gate works zero one zero zero

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.739
zero

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.739
one zero one

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.789
one one

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.789
Now we've got a problem

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.869
Because for three of these outputs. We've got exactly the same. We've got zero

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.140
We've got no connection between this iPod

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:40.039
We've lost information because we don't know what our inputs were we have a lack of reversibility and that lack of reversibility is

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.349
absolutely key in terms of the connections between the physical world and the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.190
Information world the computing world and therefore because we've got a connection from reversibility and energy

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.050
Therefore we've got a connection with the physical world in terms of how we do computation

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.859
There are multiple ways of getting to zero is basically what we've got precisely so if we've got this we can traverse the system

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.449
To know to work out what exactly are our inputs where there's only

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.630
Okay, forgive me for saying this, but is that not just because we've got two inputs that only one output through sir

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.649
Thank you for that exceptionally perceptive question John so what was and what was that's exactly the issue

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.040
So there's a whole host of gears called fredkin gates. Which are developed which have three inputs and three outputs now

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.929
We'll go into them. You don't have to forget setup like this you can have something which is called a reversible gate and

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.210
In principle if you've got that reversible gate input in place though actually

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.909
There's a difference between the physics and the engineering

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.960
engineering one of those gates and actually changing or a computer

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.620
Architecture to move towards all type of fredkin gates is going to take an awful lot of effort

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.670
and an awful lot of cost but in principle if we could do that and if we had a

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.010
Perfect perfect Fred can get then there would be no energy cost to computing

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.650
No energy no. No energy cost because here's the fascinating thing. What costs the energy is not the

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.719
Computation itself it's a raising information that and gate there

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.600
It's the logic of the of the data

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.210
but it doesn't show all the physical connections does it usually these gates have multiple things like Earth's and

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.510
Of course is that right and in fact exactly they have written in fact

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.700
How you clear these in many cases is you ground so if you've got a 1, which is what is a 1 well?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:35.119
It's a voltage how do you set that to 0 you actually ground it? So that's that's a leaker in that sense?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.210
you're leaking out to the environment, and that's what it's a

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.849
Really good way of thinking because that's exactly what's happening here. This is not. This is unravel

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.669
because the the information is

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.470
Leaking out to the environment effectively or in this case the energy is leaking out to the environment

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.470
So you must observe it to see what happens generally?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.180
okay, so with it with the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.400
sort of threat of going down the route of an electric engineering file

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.600
How does this relate to somebody who's practicing a modern-day computer?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:13.010
They saw the key thing here is because it costs a certain amount of energy to erase data and for any

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.520
Computation in the way, we've set up or to lose data particularly with these there's an energy cost to doing this because it's irreversible

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.580
that means that that is setting a fundamental limit in terms of the the

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.219
Amount of energy that it needs to power a computer and in turn you know from both

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.650
environmental and also fundamental physics reasons

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.890
You know we really need to think carefully about how we actually beat that limit if we could beat that limit

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.890
Let's say we do call the DS fredkin gets

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.369
What where we really come up hard against another limit is?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.569
something called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle quantum physics

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.460
So don't worry

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.249
I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about the uncertainty principle

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.640
Apart from to say this is that too often the uncertainty principle is seen as you have a system you make a measurement

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.860
your influence on the system is

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.429
Affecting the measurement, and there is affecting the system and therefore that gives rise to an uncertainty that's not it at all

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:17.480
It's it's much more fundamental than that there is in quantum mechanics the observation effect of the observer effect

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.330
That's a whole we could do 15 hours on that and though indeed there are whole masters courses on that on that

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.759
But in terms of the uncertainty principle actually

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:31.340
Every time you play a guitar if you do play a guitar the uncertainty principle comes it comes about in a nutshell

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.629
The uncertainty principle is is all about

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.670
How waves behave and once you down at the quantum level? You've got to think about

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.030
Particles not just as being particles as little billiard balls

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.379
They've got a way of like characteristic does that mean they change into waves no that would be far too straightforward

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.879
But it means they've got a way of like characteristic and therefore the physics of waves

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.959
Translates all the way there it must do because we're in viewing matter with these wave-like

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.910
characteristics at the quantum level

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:04.790
So therefore the physics of waves in the world around us and the mathematical framework of waves in the world around us has to

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.689
Move down to that level this uncertainty principle is just this if I let that no ring out for a long long time

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.689
Or indeed if I just whistle maybe a whistles in pair on

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.900
For a long time

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.100
And I ask you to tell me what the frequency that whistle is or we look on a signal analyzer

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.659
And we look at the spectrum we'd be able to say as particularly if I whistle for a very long time

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.600
That's at 400 Hertz or whatever and some of you perhaps if you could spectrum analyzer don't even go back and tell me what?

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.719
Frequency that was that the difficulty is this what if I do this?

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.900
Or what if I do this?

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.069
How do I describe that what frequency is a god and the thing is this wide and time

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.300
narrow and frequency

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.329
Narrow in time and in fact if you were to look at this on a spectrum analyzer what you'd see is you need a much

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.720
Wider frequency spectrum to represent that chunk

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.170
So when you hear that happening and lots of metal bands do this

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.479
What that is is the uncertainty principle in action, but that's the key thing

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.920
wide in time

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.319
Narrow in frequency narrow in time wide in frequency. Just get that again

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.760
I wish I'd got that idea in my head as an undergraduate about three years before I did get it in my head and

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.430
Then quantum physics would have been a hell of a lot easier

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.579
How does that relate to this well we coming towards something to do with processing speed?

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.990
We are indeed that's exactly what I'm going with this so the question is to ask yourself

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.380
Let's say with the ideal technology we had you know everything we could manufacture down to incredibly tight limits

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:49.610
We could get down to the single atom limit principle. We may even get below the single-item limit start controlling nuclei. What is the fundamental?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.820
Physical principle that really limits us

00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:00.259
Right down at the lowest possible level we could go to and what it is is it's the uncertainty principle now often

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.190
It's that the uncertainty principle is couched in terms of momentum and position

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.149
for the physicists among you there's also a

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.000
counterpart which is energy and time

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.970
At this point what I'd really like to do is put in a little aside to all the physicists out there

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:27.259
So if you've got something which is wide and time it's an hour on frequency similarly if we try to constrain it in time

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.509
The problem is that we get a much larger range of energy

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.580
so if you want to do a

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.520
computing

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.360
Operation you've got to think about well the number of operations

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.889
you can get by per second that means if you've got a number of operations per second that means you've got a

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.619
Frequency of those operations also means you've got a time between those now the uncertainty principle

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.410
tells us that we've got a

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.500
Fundamental limit on how narrow we can make that time because by narrowing down that time we broaden out the energy

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.320
associated with the atom with the operation which sets a

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.359
Fundamental limit because the narrow narrow narrow narrow we get that the broad on broader and broader the energy becomes

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.400
So that's it's a very fundamental limit when you work it through and there's this grid paper

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:18.829
Ultimate physical limits to computation which was set alight MIT back in 2000. This is a freely available online

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.260
Physics is physics, but this papers 2000 and things have moved on quite a bit interview 2

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.960
But the point he's making here in fact is he talked about having the ultimate laptop and in fact when he means the ultimate

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.870
Laptop. He's not talking about the limit. This is the important thing

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:39.799
That's the engineering limits, and then there's the pure physical limits his ultimate laptop is a plasma at

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.630
just a

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.150
stupidly high temperature

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:49.639
And that's what his ultimate laptop comes down to and even he talks about let's reach in terms of the density of information

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.249
What happens if we get to a density of?

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.349
Information which is comparable to the type of effects we have to consider when we're thinking about black holes

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.560
We are not talking about where the current semiconductor

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.419
Wherever it seemed gonna be in 20 or 30 years were thinking about where our hard limits where for an incredibly advanced civilization

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.199
Where are they gonna stop and?

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:12.979
It turns out that if you think about the uncertainty principle

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:19.159
Which sets this this fundamental limit in terms of the time scale, but 10 to the 50 per second, right?

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.819
So this is operations. It's not so much clock speed so it's more prison to flops

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.719
What's this day of the are the moment for flops

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.769
Thank you for asking me that question cuz I look that up because being a lowly physicist. I wasn't entirely certain so the cray are

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.559
Reasonably confident that by 2020 we'll be at the point where we have exa flops

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:42.589
I believe let me just check that yeah one extra

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:48.378
Flop by 2020 so exaflop so EXA is 10 to the 18 so 10 to the 18

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.899
floating point logic operations per second

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:57.349
There are some suggestions by 2030 will have zetas flops so 10 to the 21

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.610
operations per second

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.369
Whereas our ultimate physical limit in terms of what Lloyd has suggested 10 to the 50?

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.639
right so

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:11.928
that's so 50 compared to 21 doesn't seem like a big number 10 to the 50 compared to 10 to the 21 is a

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:15.678
Huge huge number in fact if you work it through

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:22.849
so we're about I don't know let's say we're off order and meat are shown in terms of height if you compare us to the

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.670
diameter of the observable universe

00:14:26.249 --> 00:14:31.699
It's 26 orders of magnitude so 10 to 26 is compared to ten to the twenty-nine

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:39.678
So what were we are closer to the size of the observable universe the 92 billion light-years?

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:47.089
Then-current computing technology is from the limit. Yeah from the limit, so we've got a long long way to go

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:51.948
My little question is why have you got some pink D poppers on the corner?

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:58.008
So if you if you start this off and it but you'd see it disappears energy

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:01.669
And it comes to arrest and what's happening there was that Energy's leaking out into the environment
