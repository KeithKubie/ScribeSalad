00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.200
&gt;&gt; All right, Jon, can you start off by telling
us a little bit about your company and product?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.590
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: Sure, I'm Jon Kragh. I'm the creator
of vastrank.com, that's V-A-S-T, rank.com.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.679
It's a college rating and review website.
It's all of the content. It's user-generated.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.919
So people come to the site and they'll find
a college or a trade school or anything that

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.760
they've attended and so forth. And they'll
actually create a user review. And basically

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.770
is that I've come up with college rankings
based on the user reviews. And so, no longer

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.840
are the college ratings on the site based
on professional reviews but it's all based

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.350
on user-generated content and something that
the way that the Web is going now with reviews

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.830
in general. And so, that's basically the best
ranking in a nutshell. It has some other unique

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.820
features that were developed and it's the
reason that I'm out here at Google I/O and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.740
showcasing one of the sessions that I did.
&gt;&gt; All right, so what Google development platforms

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.220
are you leveraging?
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: And so, I'm using the--first I'm

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.690
using the Maps API. And so, at Vast Rank,
if you go to Vast Rank and you click on the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.250
Map Tab it's something that we call the Ranking
Map. And what it is, is that depending on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.440
what the user has in view and what the, what
the right criteria that they choose it will

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.159
show you the top-ranked schools or whatever
the user has in view. And so, for example,

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.940
you can zoom in on just the San Francisco
area. And it will show you the top-ranked

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.390
schools. And if you will pick like academics
it will show you the top-ranked schools for

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.140
academics but then you can choose any of the
ratings that users will potentially rate the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.130
college on the Vast Rank. It's completely
dynamic so you can take the map and you could

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.479
scroll over and you see like the East Coast
and you could see the top-ranked schools and

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.600
it's so instantaneous. And so, I use the Maps
API for that. And then I use the language,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.330
the languages API in order to do translations.
And so, basically when a user comes to Vast

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.259
Rank and their browser is set to a different
language other than English on the fly I use

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.090
the Google translation APIs to translate the
user-generated content. Again, the best-ranked

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.620
is centered around user or user-generated
content. And so, that's the most important

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.540
element. And so, it was a perfect fit for
the translation APIs because when a user comes

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.870
to the site, let's say for German I'll detect
that on the server site and emit some JavaScript

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.620
to call the Google APIs to translate that
content for the German user. And actually

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.560
at the conference today I've had a few bilingual
users that came to the booth and they were

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.959
spotting checking things and they were like,
"This is pretty good." And so, I'm really

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.370
happy with that. Client locations and other
API that I'm using that's just available to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.520
you off of the AJAX loader, and so, it's basically
a way to try to find out geographically where

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.160
the user is located and it's based off of
the IP. And the keynote at IL they talked

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.410
about integrating--making client location
better. They used some other methods but right

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.209
now it's available via the AJAX API. You can
actually get a location. And what I use for

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.629
that is two aspects, when you bring up the
ranking you have a choice to set on the map

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.500
where you are which is just like a really
simple use case for that. But also Vast Rank

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.150
has a personalization section which it suggests
colleges to you and it's on the right hand

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.819
side and like as you're browsing through the
site. And as you browse through the site it

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.489
gives an idea of the colleges and the things
that you're looking at. And then I come up

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.180
with--based on historical data I kind of take
what you're looking and look at what other

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.769
users have looked at that you looked at and
come up with things that I might want to suggest

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.590
to you that are interesting. And using client
location I can take those things that I'm

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.900
going to potentially suggest to the user.
And I can actually say, "Okay, I have this

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.950
set of suggestion--possible suggestions, let
me break it down by client location and distance

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.879
to these colleges that I'm going to suggest
and then I present those geographically targeted

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.180
suggestions to the user. And so, a lot of
the AJAX APIs that I'm using, mostly using,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.180
I'm also using the geo-coding APIs to geo-code
the colleges and so forth. And then ahead

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.709
of time and then on the ranking map itself
you have like a little center map function

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.550
which is the functionality. It's just like
using a Google local or a Google Maps now.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.830
And so, if you just enter in any particular
text or you can click Center Map it will center

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.290
on the map. And so, I'm using quite a few
of the APIs actually on Vast Rank.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.510
&gt;&gt; And so, what made you decide to use the
maps and API?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.100
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: Well, originally, I spoke about
this a little bit in the session that I had

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.780
at I/O. But the original vision for Vast Rank
was that every college would have a profile

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.990
and then what's the interesting thing on profiles
and social networking sites. One of the most

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.440
interesting aspects is the profile picture.
And for me being a developer at that time

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.430
I knew Google Maps was cool and it's something
that I wanted to play with and it was about

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.410
a year and half ago when I started to think
about this. And I didn't have a profile picture

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.940
for each college, right? And so, it was hard
enough putting the data together for all the

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.320
colleges but what I needed to do was come
up with something to put in place of the profile

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.220
picture. And so, I started to play with Maps
just that it was an evolution I would say

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.000
that I'm going to put the Google Map there
and then I had it in a high moment because

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.320
I had all these colleges and numbering and
so forth and that evolved into the ranking

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.880
map. And so each profile where normally users
picture would on a--like a MySpace or Facebook

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.889
or any other social networking site. That's
why I put the Google Map and that's how I

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.790
got started with it. And so, it was never
like some great idea that I had. In the beginning

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.220
it was an evolution, you know, of trying things
and experimenting and so forth.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.410
&gt;&gt; Very cool. And so, outside of what you
talked about what are some other benefits

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.389
that you've done in using Google APIs.
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: Really the biggest benefit of the

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:01.630
Google APIs is they provide you these awesome
capabilities like the client location for

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.960
instance and translation but they are dead
simple, right? And so like, when I did my

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.800
session, the session was more about the concepts
of creative ways to use the APIs because,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.199
really, when you're calling the APIs, they're
so simple. And like translating you're basically

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.750
passing a chunk of text. You're passing--here's
the source language at its end and here's

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.990
the target language at its end. And so, and
then you get a result back for a client location

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.240
and for the client geo-coding and the client
location and so forth. Those are just like

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.759
one method going on and so forth. And so,
really, the real benefit of the Google APIs

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.430
is they're just clean, they often use this
like simple, these things that are relatively

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.850
simple functionally-wise you would think.
But you can expand, you can expand on those

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.250
ideas and use them in creative ways and think
about your own business solution or whatever

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.410
you might be developing. And the API just
stays out of your way. For me, the API is

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.660
simply you read the documentation once and
you just go through an experiment and it's

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.030
like dead simple, you know. And so, that's
the biggest benefit that I've seen.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.190
&gt;&gt; And so, it sounds like it has reduced the
amount of work that you've done?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.430
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: Oh, tremendously, yeah. I mean,
oftentimes in one line of code you're getting

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.330
like translation site. I'm adding translating
content on my site. I put it together in 40

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.770
minutes literally. And so, it's been--it saved
a tremendous amount of work.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:28.840
&gt;&gt; And so, what kinds of features were made
possible by having access to the Google API?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.069
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: You know, just the ones I have gone
over so far, you know, like internalization

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:37.229
of content and something that would have--if
I had to go other to other on the news it

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.940
would have much more difficult to international--to
translate all the content. And then the ranking

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.419
map which is like completely driven off of
it. If I didn't have the mapping technology

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.710
in the API with that I would never have been
able to develop the ranking map and so forth.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.630
And personalization which is like a real key
aspect that I really find interesting and

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.660
that has a real high value to users being
able to geographically target suggestions

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.150
and so forth to make their experience better.
I mean, to be able to do that on one line

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.110
of code to get to their location and so forth,
all those features would have not been possible

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:16.660
had it not been for the Google APIs.
&gt;&gt; Well, Jon, I want to thank you for your

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.180
time today.
&gt;&gt; KRAGH: Cool. Cool. Thank you so much.
