00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.800
A single nucleotide variation, or SNV, that changes

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.790
an amino acid to a stop code on like

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.770
this, is called a nonsense mutation. Nonsense because

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.630
it makes nonsense after this, there's nothing left. It

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.270
stops translation. A single nucleotide variation, or SNV.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.880
That changes an amino acid to a different kind

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.450
of amino acid is referred to as a

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.680
missence mutation. It's also referred to as a non

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680
synonymous mutation. And an s and v that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890
doesn't change the amino acid sequence at all from

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.440
the original sequence, is called a silent or

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.100
synonymous mutation. Now, silent mutations can accumulate because there's

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.210
really no selection pressure on them. And they

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.780
don't detrimentally affect the overall protein product. So one

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.600
of the most common kinds of SNVs we

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.900
find are silent mutation SNVs, where someone may code

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.350
for a valine using a GTA, and someone

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.210
else would code for valine using a GTG. Because

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.640
the overall protein is unchanged, there's no direct selection

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
pressure that can happen on the protein. It would

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.170
be completely random which of these alleles would

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.420
fluctuate in the gene pool. Now missense mutations could

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.670
be advantageous or detrimental. It depends entirely on which

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.950
amino acid is replaced and what it's replaced with.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.200
Remember, structure is function. And in this case, it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560
all depends on what the structure of the amino acid

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.250
we're coming from and the structure of the amino

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.400
acid we're going to. And then we have nonsense mutations

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780
which are almost. Always detrimental, because they're going to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.750
shorten a protein sequence. Once a nonsense mutation has been

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.710
induced, everything past that mutation is not going to be

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.950
translated. Take a look at this long sequence right here.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.300
I've given you two mutant versions. They both

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.900
have nonsense mutations. At TGA here, or UGA

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.950
in the genetic code. And TAG here or UAG it would be. Both are stop codons.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.480
I want you to tell me which of these two nonsense mutations is going to be more

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.070
severe, and then I want you to tell me why in this text box right here.
