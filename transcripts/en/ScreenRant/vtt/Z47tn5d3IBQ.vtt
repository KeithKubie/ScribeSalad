00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.550
The team at Disney have produced some of the
most successful movies in history. And their

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.230
legacy extends all the way back to 1923. You
don't achieve that level of success by pleasing

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.520
only half of the audience, so they load their
films with diverse humor. And have a habit

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.740
of making everyone laugh. But some are so
downright sophisticated that calling them

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.380
“kids movies” just doesn’t make sense.
Here are 10 Amazing Disney Movies That Were

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.779
Secretly Made For Adults.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.460
Zootopia
Since it’s release in March, Zootopia has

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.370
grossed over one billion dollars worldwide.
Judy Hopps is a rabbit with big dreams of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.059
law enforcement. Even though her city, is
home to all kinds of animals, no rabbits have

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.690
ever been cops. Some audience members have
spoken out about the parallels between the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.140
movie and underrepresentation in todays society.
Furthermore, one character refers to another

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.500
as “articulate”; a callback to the word
being used as a racist backhanded compliment.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.519
Who knew a kids movie could be so insightful.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.000
Toy Story
Puns are for adults. Kids do not understand

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.300
them. So putting one right in front of their
eyes is a pretty brazen way to tell a joke

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.810
that only a portion of the audience will recognize
as being a joke. The animators behind Toy

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.250
Story are masters of this. And if you look
closely, you’ll recognize some risqué innuendo

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.370
hiding in plain sight. Just have a look at
this hooker and try to tell us we’re wrong.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.899
Finding Dory
Nostalgia is big business, just look to the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.920
latest movie trends for proof. Remakes and
sequels abound, and some pretty cool movies

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.920
are getting made as a result. But some argue
that this past summer’s Finding Dory nothing

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.450
more than a cash grab. Opponents allege that
the movie was made simply to pull the heart

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.560
strings of those who were kids when it’s
predecessor Finding Nemo was released in 2003.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.329
But none of that really matters in the end.
And the movie has gone on to make over nine

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.329
hundred million dollars in the short three
months since its release.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.509
Inside Out
Inside Out follows the story of a young girl

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.399
named Riley, who’s family moves across country
and leaves her life behind. Told with a psychological

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.939
flare, the storytellers turn emotions into
characters. And use the girl’s mind as a

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.770
landscape to show how the change is affecting
her internally. Led by Joy, other emotions

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.710
Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust also play
a big part. But a few lines make it clear

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.260
that this isn’t just a movie for the kids
in the audience. Shortly after Riley sees

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.300
their new house in San Francisco, Fear makes
a remark about bears in the city. And Anger’s

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.980
response made more than a few people chuckle,
since “Bear” is a slang word used in the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.620
LGBT community that describes a certain aesthetic.
And given how important the city has been

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.950
in the gay rights movement, there’s no way
the line wasn't a callback.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.690
Up
Because no kids movie could be so impossibly

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.630
cruel, Up must have been made for adults.
On the outside it’s all balloon houses and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.880
hilarious dogs. But on the inside it’s a
vast pit of despair. The first ten minutes

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.900
are genuinely heart-wrenching as they tell
the story of Carl meeting, loving, and ultimately

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.590
losing, the love of his life. We’re told
that happy things happened after that, but

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.060
after being removed from the theatre for crying
too loudly, we can’t be sure.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.010
The Emperor’s New Groove
Wordplay is a great way to launch a joke right

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.140
over a kid’s head. And combining that with
an innocent-looking visual kicks it up a notch.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.959
But at what point does a movie stop being
for kids and start being for adults? The longer

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.720
you watch The Emperor’s New Groove, the
more you’ll be convinced it was written

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.230
with a mature audience in mind. For example,
a scene where the lovable Kronk spends a night

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.240
in the great outdoors. And while kids may
be laughing at the size of his lean-to, the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.330
adults know what it really means to “pitch
a tent.”

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.409
Wreck it Ralph
Wreck-It Ralph is&nbsp;a movie so loaded with

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.439
references that if you so much as sneeze,
you'll miss one.&nbsp;Inspired by elements of&nbsp;Donkey

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.192
Kong and Rampage, Wreck-it Ralph himself is
a temperamental brute who smashes his way

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:30.489
from A to B during the course of his day job
duties inside a video game. Ralph, the golden-hearted

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.879
thug trying to change his violent ways, attends
Bad Anon, a support group for bad guys. Now,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.939
we don’t want to say you have to be a certain
age to appreciate the classics. But we’re

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.069
willing to bet that most young people wouldn’t
have a clue who a lot of those characters

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.069
are.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.709
Frozen
Since its 2013 release, Frozen has become

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.970
one of Disney’s juggernauts. The tale of
two sisters is one of the highest grossing

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.720
films of all time, and the biggest in the
company’s history. The story is interesting,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.500
and the soundtrack is.. well.. everywhere.
But contrary to popular belief, little kids

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.269
aren’t the ones who benefit most from watching
Frozen. The writers reserved some of the laughs

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.110
for the grownups, throwing in a dirty joke
here and there. Like when Kristof is quizzing

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.769
Anna about her love life, and the question
of shoe size comes up. She might have shrugged

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.400
the question off, but we know it was adults
who got a kick out of that one.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.390
Toy Story 3
Toy Story 3 is about growing up. And maybe

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.769
the only good part of growing up is sex. While
it might not be directly addressed, if you

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.320
pay close attention there are definitely some
sexy jokes in the mix. For example, after

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.360
the Lotso the jerk removes Mrs. Potato Head’s
mouth from her face, her husband shouts some

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:37.350
choice words at the burly bear. It happens
so quickly that even some grown-ups might

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.670
miss it. But in retrospect, it’s pretty
overt.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.900
Hercules
Greek Mythology is complex and loaded with

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.870
intertwining personalities. Much like in Game
of Thrones, they all have their own agendas

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.970
and it can be difficult to keep things straight.
Thanks to the animators behind 1997’s Hercules,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.870
at least audiences will always be able to
recognize the centaur. Especially if they’re

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.521
into phallic comedy. After Hercules wallops
the beast, it’s head swells into a.. well

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.440
you can see it right there. Disney serves
a wide audience, can you blame them for throwing

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.250
in a little low-brow comedy?

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.150

movies do you think were secretly made for
