00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.510
A crosswalk in Germany where you can play
Pong against someone across the street while

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.340
you wait for the light to turn green. And
say hello to the newly discovered Blue Butt

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.160
Monkey.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.359
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.349
New energy calculations suggest warp drive
could scientifically be possible. Previous

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.949
calculations predicted the mass-energy of Jupiter would be necessary

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.810
to cause space-time warp around a football-shaped
starship with a large flat ring encircling

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.680
it. But if the ring were donut-shaped, it may
be powered by a mass the size of a spacecraft

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.700
like the Voyager 1 probe launch in 1977.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.550
"So somebody invest this please, now, thanks"

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.800
Scientists at Argonne National Laboratory
recently demonstrated Acoustic Levitation.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.610
They use sound waves to levitate droplets
of solutions containing different drugs with

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.530
two opposing speakers pumping out 22,000 hertz
that trap the droplets in a standing wave.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.290
The point is to study drugs in an amorphous
state, which is more desireable than the crystalline

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.250
structure most drugs take, because an amorphous
state is more efficiently taken up by the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.080
body. But, the solutions become crystalline
when they evaporate while in contact with

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.220
a surface- hence studying them while floating
in mid air.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.330
There is no pen.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.270
You're looking at the earliest color movies
ever found. The National Media Museum in Bradford,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.659
UK date the films to 1901 or 1902, and they
were produced by Edward Turner using a technique

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.200
in which frames were recorded on film through
red, green, and blue filters, with the sets

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.120
of three images then being projected through
similar filters to recreate the colors.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.390
This super-stretchy sliver of jelly is so
strong it easily bounces a metal ball. The

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.900
hydrogel is a mixture of two polymers, and
it can be stretched 20 times its original

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.310
length without breaking. The developer from
Harvard University claims it's so strong you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.260
can't even tear it apart with your hands,
and they hope to use this kind of material

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.119
in replacement cartilage or as scaffolds for
growing artificial organs.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.619
Tallest Mohawk in the world.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.410
These Prototype GPS shoes will guide you home
no matter where you are in the world. Simply

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.209
upload your destination via a USB Cable to
the GPS located in the heel, then click your

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.450
heels together to activate a ring of LED lights
in the toe that point you in the right direction.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.120
LIFX looks to reinvent the light bulb. Controlled
by a smart phone, it boasts a variety of features

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.120
including color controls, timers like a slowly
fading night light, music visualization, and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.630
even flashing to alert you of your social
media notifications. Find the link below for

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.590
more information.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.510
Finally, Experimental Light Sculpture is a
BTK College of Design student-project involving

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.510
a jagged surface wall and animated project
light. I'm gonna leave you with the deepest swimming pool in the world.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.060
So, this is the 50th episode of Mind Blow,
and whether you've been with Vsauce2 from

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.019
the beginning, or just recently found out
about this channel through the awesome videos

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.409
that Michael is doing over on Vsauce1, I just
wanted to say that I really appreciate all

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.819
the great comments, all the stuff you guys
send me for BiDiPi, and everything else that

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.819
makes Vsauce one of the cooles things on YouTube.
So, here's to 50 more episodes, and, as always,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.510
thanks for watching. Also, I'm not bald, so...I
just like hats.
