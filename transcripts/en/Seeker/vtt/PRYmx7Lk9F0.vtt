00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.169
Understanding how birds navigate has fascinated
scientists for generations.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.669
And we’ve finally cracked that old egg…
turns out, they have quantum compasses in

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:08.669
their eyes.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.669
Easy peasy.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.169
Half of all bird species migrate to find food
as the seasons turn cold.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.080
The exact pathway and location changes between
species, but they all follow a more-or-less

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.600
north-south pattern.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.590
Incredibly, even for those that hunt on land,
birds will take the most direct route, even

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.290
flying over big bodies of water to conserve
energy.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.650
But how do these birds know where to go?!

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.070
They don’t know to follow roads or turn
at that one landmark -- also you’re a bird

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.640
do you even know what a landmark is?!

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.690
You don’t.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
But birds do have one advantage, a built-in
compass.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.429
New evidence from two separate studies — one
looking at zebra finches and the other European

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.079
robins — found some migrating birds have
proteins in their eyes that give them a sort

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.520
of “sixth sense” allowing them to detect
the Earth’s magnetic field.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.520
In both species, the researchers studied the
proteins Cry1, Cry2 and Cry4, three proteins

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.190
called cryptochromes that are associated with
their bodies’ internal circadian clock.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.740
They found that Cry1 and Cry2 levels rise
and fall in regular cycles during the day,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
but the level of Cry4 is constant.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.640
The simplest explanation is that birds need
to produce this protein all the time, for

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640
some reason.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.840
So they looked more closely at Cry4.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.220
This protein is a peculiar one.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.300
Clustered in a part of the birds’ retina
that is especially sensitive to blue light,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.390
this protein is made of a kind of molecule
that sometimes has an odd number of electrons.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.490
The scientists theorize, that as incoming
light enters the eye, a photon hits the cryptochrome

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.080
protein, exciting the electrons on it.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.400
That energy is transferred between two molecules
within the protein yielding two free electrons

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.350
that are quantum entangled and therefore,
correlated.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.511
They theorize the electrons’ spin forms
a coherent quantum state that reacts to a

00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:05.950
weak external magnetic field, say, for example,
the Earth’s magnetic field.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.689
Basically, these two electrons are reacting
to the bird flying through the Earth’s magnetic

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.689
field.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.019
As the bird turns or moves, the electrons
spin differently causing different messages

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.219
to be sent to the birds brain.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.700
The chemical signals that are sent to the
bird’s brain, allow it to detect the magnetic

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.450
field to within just 5 degrees.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.510
Again, theoretically, of course.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.989
The Cry4 protein essentially acts like a magnetic
compass; and enough blue light hits the retina

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.159
to trigger the electrons’ spin to release
that chemical any time of day.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.010
Which is insane if you think about it.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.319
When we humans study quantum particles it
requires supercooling atoms in a lab environment,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.790
and huge complex machinery.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.659
The inside of a bird’s eye is warm, wet
and chaotic.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.080
How the heck does this work?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.040
We don’t really know.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.599
We also don’t know how the chemical signal
part of the compass sends messages to the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.739
brain, or how the birds perceive the magnetic
field.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.180
We’d need a literal bird’s eye view to
fill in these final pieces of the puzzle.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.029
Climate change is ALSO a puzzle, which is
why you should watch Hot Mess!

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.810
THIS episode looks at how long we’ve known
about climate change -- longer than you think.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.090
If you care about our planet, if you care
about climate change and you want to learn

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.109
more about it: absolutely watch Hot Mess.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.900
It’s a great show from PBS Digital Studios
(Who we love) and I think you’ll love it.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.340
Thanks a lot for watching Seeker. We'll see you next time.
