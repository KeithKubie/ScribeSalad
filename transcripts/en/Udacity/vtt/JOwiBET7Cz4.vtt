00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question we throw a ball straight up in the air at 20 m/s

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I want to know what's the highest point above the ground that the ball reaches.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, this question is tricky in several ways.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's first try to identify our knowns, what was given to us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, we threw it straight up with 20 m/s of velocity.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's got to be the initial velocity,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because that's how fast it's going at the beginning of the problem.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, since this is a problem that's taking place on earth,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the object is in free motion, I of course know the acceleration is 10 m/s².

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But then I'm sort of stuck.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What is the highest point above the ground that the ball reaches?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, highest point seems important,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but I'm still a little confused and without a picture,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm not going to make much progress on this question.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, let's draw a picture of what happens when you throw a ball straight in the air with some initial velocity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, it goes up, up, up, up, up.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Eventually it stops and turns around and then comes back down.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Ah, okay, so this highest point, I can see is some sort of change in position.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The problem gives me the initial velocity, and I know the acceleration.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'll need one more piece of information if I'm going to solve for Δx.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you've been listening very carefully, I gave a hint.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which of these two variables do we actually know when the ball is at the top of its trajectory?
