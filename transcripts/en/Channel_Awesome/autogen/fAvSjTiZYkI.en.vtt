understanding it you really kind of have

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840
understanding it you really kind of have
 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.230
understanding it you really kind of have
to do it and I didn't really understand

00:07:59.230 --> 00:07:59.240
to do it and I didn't really understand
 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.820
to do it and I didn't really understand
that until like I was doing it a lot

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:00.830

guess it's sort of like a Venn diagram

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:24.710
guess it's sort of like a Venn diagram
 

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.890
guess it's sort of like a Venn diagram
sort of think is to me they're very

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:26.900
sort of think is to me they're very
 

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.300

um I again I feel like there's this sort
 

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.420
um I again I feel like there's this sort
of overlap there's like the Entertainer

00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.430
of overlap there's like the Entertainer
 

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.490

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459
and then there's the academic who puts
 

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:12.350
and then there's the academic who puts
the films in their context um and I feel

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360
the films in their context um and I feel
 

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.740
the films in their context um and I feel
like there's this sort of like this Venn

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:15.750
like there's this sort of like this Venn
 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.740
like there's this sort of like this Venn
diagram of these three things and

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750
diagram of these three things and
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.690
diagram of these three things and
ideally a critic should be right in the

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700
ideally a critic should be right in the
 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.480

that ideally that that would be the
answer but it's it's not always easy to

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.170
answer but it's it's not always easy to
 

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.260
answer but it's it's not always easy to
hit all three and I certainly feel in

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.430
interesting subject he had and it was
Norma McCorvey who was the original Jane

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440
Norma McCorvey who was the original Jane
 

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:14.170

Roe and she very publicly regrets having
been a part of roe v-- wade and so I

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000
been a part of roe v-- wade and so I
 

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.040
been a part of roe v-- wade and so I
thought that was very interesting but

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.050
thought that was very interesting but
 

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.420
thought that was very interesting but
for them for the most of it it was just

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:19.430
for them for the most of it it was just
 

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.970
for them for the most of it it was just
like so hey I'm an atheist pro-lifer or

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:21.980
like so hey I'm an atheist pro-lifer or
 

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.210
like so hey I'm an atheist pro-lifer or
like hey I'm a crazy bomber person and

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:25.220
like hey I'm a crazy bomber person and
 

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.130
like hey I'm a crazy bomber person and
I'm just like this has nothing to do

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.140
I'm just like this has nothing to do
 

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.660
I'm just like this has nothing to do
with the reality of what it's like to go

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:28.670
with the reality of what it's like to go
 

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.400
with the reality of what it's like to go
through it and I guess like that was

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.410
through it and I guess like that was
 

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.170
through it and I guess like that was
what made me realize like how much the

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:35.180
what made me realize like how much the
 

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.750
what made me realize like how much the
experience of the woman going through it

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760
experience of the woman going through it
 

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.300
experience of the woman going through it
and took some extent than then it's just

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.310
and took some extent than then it's just
 

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.310
and took some extent than then it's just
completely taken out of the picture

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320
completely taken out of the picture
 

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.960
completely taken out of the picture
like I'm the feminist side it's all

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:43.970
like I'm the feminist side it's all
 

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.760
like I'm the feminist side it's all
about like you know you're not allowed

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:45.770
about like you know you're not allowed

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.650
to hurt you're not allowed to to have
any sort of complex feelings on the

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:50.660
any sort of complex feelings on the
 

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.330
any sort of complex feelings on the
subject on the pro-life side it's all

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:52.340
subject on the pro-life side it's all
 

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.040
subject on the pro-life side it's all
about the baby all about the baby if you

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.050
about the baby all about the baby if you
 

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.570
about the baby all about the baby if you
are hurting it's just because you're

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:55.580
are hurting it's just because you're
 

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.520
are hurting it's just because you're
you're wrong and you'll get over that

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:57.530
you're wrong and you'll get over that
 

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.270
you're wrong and you'll get over that
and so like I and I just I felt like I'd

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.280
and so like I and I just I felt like I'd
 

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.560
and so like I and I just I felt like I'd
never seen anything that kind of

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:02.570
never seen anything that kind of
 

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.220
never seen anything that kind of
captured the the reality of it like the

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:06.230
captured the the reality of it like the
 

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.020
captured the the reality of it like the
actual experience of it at least in

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.030
actual experience of it at least in
 

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.780
actual experience of it at least in
documentary form so that that was my

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:10.790
documentary form so that that was my
 

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.120
documentary form so that that was my
intent was just to sort of find other

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.130
intent was just to sort of find other
 

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.470
intent was just to sort of find other
people and originally I wanted to

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480
people and originally I wanted to
 

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.800
people and originally I wanted to
include more men but I think due to the

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:17.810
include more men but I think due to the
 

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.450
include more men but I think due to the
time limit it could be more than 26

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:19.460
time limit it could be more than 26
 

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.050
time limit it could be more than 26
limit 26 minutes um we couldn't do that

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:23.060
limit 26 minutes um we couldn't do that
 

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.270
limit 26 minutes um we couldn't do that
or it did but it kind of messed up the

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:25.280
or it did but it kind of messed up the
 

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.700
or it did but it kind of messed up the
flow which frustrated my producer but

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:29.710
flow which frustrated my producer but
 

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.200
flow which frustrated my producer but
but so it ended up mostly being about

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.210
but so it ended up mostly being about
 

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.650
but so it ended up mostly being about
like the experiences of the women and

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:34.660
like the experiences of the women and
 

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.960
like the experiences of the women and
because just that is so often not really

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:40.970
because just that is so often not really
 

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.690
because just that is so often not really
considered relevant to the discussion

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:42.700
considered relevant to the discussion
 

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.720
considered relevant to the discussion
and this of course is building up to

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.730
and this of course is building up to
 

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.480
and this of course is building up to
your magnum opus I mean that was good

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:49.490
your magnum opus I mean that was good
 

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.340
your magnum opus I mean that was good
