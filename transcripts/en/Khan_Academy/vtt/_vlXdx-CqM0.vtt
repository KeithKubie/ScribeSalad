00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:02.983
- [Instructor] So I have two
different xy relationships

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:04.604
being described here.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.186
And what I would like to do in this video

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:08.231
is figure out whether each
of these relationships,

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:10.982
whether they are either
linear relationships,

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.617
exponential relationships, or neither.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:14.760
And like always, pause this video

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.009
and see if you can figure it out yourself.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.525
So let's look at this first
relationship right over here.

00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:23.273
And the key way to tell whether
we're dealing with a linear,

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.786
or exponential, or neither relationship,

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:28.365
is think about, okay,
for given change in x,

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:30.429
and you see, each time here,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.091
we are increasing x by the same amount.

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.345
So we're increasing x by three.

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:39.521
So given that we're increasing
x by a constant amount,

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:43.973
by three each time, does y
increase by a constant amount?

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:45.150
In which case, we would be dealing

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.708
with a linear relationship.

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:50.564
Or is there a constant ratio
between successive terms

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:52.871
when you increase x by a constant amount.

00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:53.977
In which case, we would be dealing

00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:56.172
with an exponential relationship.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:57.271
So let's see.

00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:59.601
Here we're going from
negative two to five.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.831
So we are adding seven.

00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:04.947
When x increases by three,
y increases by seven.

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:09.639
When x is increasing by three,
y increases by seven again.

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:14.433
When x increases by three,
y increases by seven again.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.636
So here, it is clearly
a linear relationship.

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:20.549
Linear relationship.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.951
In fact, you can even, relationship,

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.335
you could even plot this on a line

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:28.430
if you assume that these
are samples on a line.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.372
You could think even about
the slope of that line.

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:32.932
For a change in x, for
a given change in x,

00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:34.659
the change in y is always constant.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.159
When our change in x is three,

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.544
our change in y is always seven.

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:41.999
So this is clearly a linear relationship.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.713
Now let's look at this one.

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:44.546
Let's see.

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:48.467
Looks like our x's are
changing by one each time,

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:49.467
so plus one.

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:52.147
Now what are y's changing by?

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:54.803
Here it changes by two.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:56.720
Then it changes by six.

00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:00.648
Alright, it's clearly not linear.

00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:02.481
Then it changes by 18.

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.806
Clearly not a linear relationship.

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:08.251
If this was linear, these
would be the same amount,

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.612
same delta, same change
in y for every time,

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:14.106
'cause we have the same change in x.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:16.211
So let's test to see if it's exponential.

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.347
If it's an exponential,

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.971
for each of these constant changes in x's,

00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:22.513
when we increase x by one every time,

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:25.731
our ratio of successive
y's should be the same.

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:26.564
Or another way to think about it

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:28.746
is what are we multiplying y by?

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:30.473
So to go from one to three,

00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:33.473
you multiply, you multiply by three.

00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:38.601
To go from three to nine,
you multiply be three.

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:42.944
To go from nine to 27,
you multiply by three.

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:44.504
So in a situation where every time

00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:48.143
you increase x by a fixed
amount, in this case one,

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:49.903
and the corresponding y's

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:53.480
get multiplied by some fixed amount,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.417
then you're dealing with an
exponential relationship.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.417
Exponential.

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:03.575
Exponential relationship right over here.
