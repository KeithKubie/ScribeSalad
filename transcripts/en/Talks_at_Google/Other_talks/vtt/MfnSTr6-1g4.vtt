MICHAEL PUETT:
Thank you so much.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.950
And thank you all of you.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.180
It's wonderful to
be here at Google

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.600
Cambridge, a tremendous honor.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.518
And thank you all
so much for coming.

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:16.309
So what I'm going to
be talking about today

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.430
is something that may at first
glance seem a little odd.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.310
I'm going to be talking
about, yes, ideas

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.160
from about 2,000
years ago, from China,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.210
and arguing that they are not
only incredibly important,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.460
but actually offer a
fundamental challenge

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.640
to a lot of things
we take for granted,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.180
and a fundamental challenge
that we should even

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.910
take very seriously.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.270
Now before I begin,
let's lay out

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.640
why this may seem like
such an odd thing to do.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.460
First of all and most
obviously, we kind of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.950
think we know how we
should live our lives.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.230
So it's not entirely
clear why we

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.760
would need to be reading text
from 2,000 years ago anyway.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.310
I mean, we know.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.400
The way to do it is to look
within and to find yourself.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.950
And we often tell
ourselves this.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.300
I need to find myself.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.760
I need to find who I really am.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.260
And I need to live
my life according

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.900
to what's best for me.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.770
And when I do find myself, find
my true self we'll often say,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.700
I need to love myself
and embrace myself

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.560
for who I am, accepting
my weak side-- we all

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.500
have weak sides-- but accepting
of course my good sides

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.940
too, and then trying to develop
a life in which I can be me

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.530
according to what
is my good sides

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.500
and minimizing my bad sides, and
what will allow me to be happy

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.110
and a good human being.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.240
And we all think that's clear.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.780
And the problem is just
doing it, looking within

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.810
and finding oneself.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.980
And we have all sorts of
techniques for doing that.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.820
But basically that's
what we should do.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.580
And putting this in a
larger historical context,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.550
if one tends to think
about these ideas of being

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.630
true to oneself, we would
tend to think something

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.830
along the following
lines, that these

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.380
are prototypical modern ideas.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.450
And luckily for us we live in
a modern age so we can do this.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.350
We can look within.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.330
We can live our lives according
to what's best for us.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.550
And sadly, most humans,
we tend to assume,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.430
weren't able to do this.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.840
And if you look at why, we
would often tend to say well,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.470
you know, they live in
these traditional societies.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.660
And in those
traditional societies,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.180
people were told what to do.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.260
They just were born
into a society.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.635
They were told what to do.

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.510
And they had to live
their lives accordingly.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.360
So they couldn't live within and
they couldn't find themselves

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.550
and they couldn't be
true to themselves.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.390
And, let's also
be honest, if you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.230
think of perhaps the culture
that most exemplifies,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.280
in our stereotypes, what such
a traditional world would

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.647
be like, yeah, it's
kind of China, right?

00:02:51.647 --> 00:02:53.230
And if you think of
traditional China,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.540
it kind of fits all
of our stereotypes

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.720
of what a traditional
world would have been.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
In China, we often think that
you're born into a society,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.150
and that these ideas that
we label Confucianism that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570
tell you, you have to
follow a bunch of rituals,

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.470
and those rituals
will socialize you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.890
into playing your
proper social position.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.920
And if you do them well, you'll
live in a harmonious world

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.480
because everyone will be
doing what they're told to do.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.560
And it's sort of the
antithesis of what

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.880
we would tend to think of
as being a good way to live.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.790
And following our
stereotypes a bit further,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.520
we do tend to have
a more positive view

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.890
of another side of
Chinese culture, which

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.690
we tend to label Daoism.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.170
And that's the side
where we think,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.050
OK, you're socialized into
playing your social role

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.670
by doing a bunch of rituals.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.425
But then luckily they had
something called Daoism too

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:46.790
that enabled them to sort of go
off, leave their social roles

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.610
for a bit, and commune with
the larger natural world.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.110
But even there we often
tend to think, yeah,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.810
but still in Daoism,
they're still

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.010
saying it's a harmonious
world out there.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.920
And we're training
ourselves to accord with it.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.510
And so even if it's not as
confining as our social roles,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.040
we're still just learning
to accept the world

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.680
as it is, which means we're
not doing things on our own.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.390
We certainly aren't
finding ourselves.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.730
We're certainly not
living our own lives.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.130
So China kind of
exemplifies our stereotypes

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.160
of a traditional world,
both in the Confucian focus

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.090
on social roles and even
in the more positive way

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.490
we tend to think of it, Daoist
notion of sort of harmonizing

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.990
with the larger natural world.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.384
So if all of that
is the case, it

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:36.300
seems like I have kind
of a tough job in front

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.780
of me arguing that actually
some of these ideas from China

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.040
should be taken very seriously.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.130
And I am indeed
going to argue that.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.090
In fact, I'm going to argue
something much more than that.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.350
I'm going to argue that when
we take these ideas seriously,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.060
they really force us to
question a lot of what we take

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.750
for granted about human beings,
about how to live a good life,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.930
and even about our
grand visions of history

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.460
going from a traditional
world to a modern society.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.530
A grand set of claims,
and let me jump right in.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.700
Now to make my argument,
let me begin with that thing

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.620
I began with, the self,
this thing that we're

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.060
supposed to look within
and find and live

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.130
our lives according to.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.050
So that's one view of the
self, a view of the self

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.850
that all of us are born with one
true self that we should find.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.100
Let's talk about early
Chinese notions of the self.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.540
What do they think the self is?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.390
So let me jump in.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.300
Now I'll forewarn you, the
first few steps of this

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.680
are going to seem very
bleak, but bear with me.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.340
You'll get to the
exciting part soon.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.320
But here's the bleak part.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.770
Are we, as human beings,
a true essential self

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.180
that we should be
trying to find?

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.980
No.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.500
What we are, are big
bunches of messy stuff.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.540
Messy bunches of energies,
dispositions, emotions,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.480
desires, faculties.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.320
And all of us are
equally messy bunches.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.679
That's what we're like.

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:09.470
And that's what we're
like when we're born,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.160
a big bunch of messy stuff.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.190
And because we're these
messy stuffs, what

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.550
we are as human beings,
minus all the things

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.930
we're going to be talking
about momentarily--

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.330
our danger is we're completely
passive in the world.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.810
Because as these
messy stuffs, we

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.530
interact with other messy
stuffs, other people.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.870
And when we do so, we are
constantly dragging out

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.520
responses from each other.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.630
So I, a messy self, am standing
here and someone yells at me.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.000
I get angry.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.980
Well in this way of
thinking, what happens

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.460
is that loud voice, that angry
voice, draws out from me,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.040
pulls out from me
an energy of anger.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.230
When someone smiles at me,
and that pulls out from me

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.350
an energy of happiness.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.920
And all I am throughout the
day is being passively pulled

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.120
by things that happen
immediately around me--

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.370
people I encounter, things they
do, little actions they take,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.520
tones of voice.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.910
And I'm simply passive in this,
being dragged out constantly.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.910
And if that sounds
bleak, it gets worse.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.740
Because the further argument
is that's what we're like.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.470
But we don't simply get
pulled in different directions

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.760
all the time.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.660
Because even worse,
it turns out,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.820
is that we tend to fall
into patterns of responses

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.620
from a very young age.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.400
So that person yells at me
and it draws out my anger.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.340
Someone else simply doing
something that for whatever

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.700
reason emotionally
reminds me of that moment

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.470
will equally draw
out that anger.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.030
And we will tend to fall into
these patterns and ruts such

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.160
that we're not even
really responding

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.980
to things that are actually
happening around us.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.770
We're responding by
patterned responses.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.380
Things happen to draw out,
for whatever reason based

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.250
in these patterns I fall into,
anger and happiness and joy

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.280
and sadness, constantly.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.020
And these patterns can
become so rigid, so reified,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.360
that they can become
determinant of who we are.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.250
So we begin experiencing
the world on a moment

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.080
by moment basis according
to these ruts and patterns.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.909
And if this isn't bleak enough,
it gets worse yet still.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.400
Because once these
patterns and ruts set in,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.289
they not only can continue
for months, years, decades,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.720
they not only can
continue and determine us

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.460
for our entire lives,
they can be passed on.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.890
Because things that I do
in my parents and ruts,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.740
I will pass on to
the next generation

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.280
because I will be playing
out these same patterns

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.264
and ruts that I was falling
into from a young child.

00:08:59.264 --> 00:09:00.930
Many of those came
from the interactions

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.480
I had with my parents.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.760
I will play them out
when I have children.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.330
And my poor children
will grow up

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.010
playing out these same things.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.800
And they can go on
generation after generation

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.480
after generation.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.530
That's what we're
like as human beings.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.440
Now if they're right-- and
I might add parenthetically,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.710
there are now tons of
psychological experiments

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.960
saying this is exactly right.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.600
We like to think we're
these individuals

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.680
with free will making
decisions throughout the day.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.440
It turns out tons
of experiments are

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.840
showing that, no, this portrait
you see from early China

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.250
is basically right.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.830
We're these passive creatures
playing out these patterns

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.540
and ruts all the time.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.782
So if they're right, and if
these psychological experiments

00:09:46.782 --> 00:09:48.490
saying they're right
are onto something--

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.130
and I clearly think they
are-- note immediately,

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.530
when we tell
ourselves, oh my goal

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.220
then should be to look
within, find my true self,

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.870
and embrace myself and
love myself for who I am,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.140
and simply be true
to myself, being

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.580
sincere and authentic to what is
truly right for me, all of that

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.170
sounds great.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.350
But no, if they're
right, what we're loving,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.320
what we're embracing,
what we're trying

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.460
to be true and sincere
and authentic to

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.980
is just a bunch of ruts and
patterns, the last thing,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.640
from this point of view, that
you would want to be embracing.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.370
Because if they're
right, if we are

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.590
these patterned,
rutted creatures,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.240
your goal isn't to love that, to
embrace that, to simply say oh,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.260
I'm just the sort of person who
gets angry at little things,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.610
but I'm the sort of person
who likes to think big.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.660
So I should just find a place
where I, given who I am,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.970
can fit well in this world.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.780
From this point of view what
you're really saying is,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.080
I have fallen into
patterns and ruts

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.670
where these little
things get me angry.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.380
And I'm going to just love
that and embrace that.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.020
In other words, I'm not
going to make any attempt

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.750
to change that whatsoever.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.690
And ironically then,
our grand vision

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.630
of how to live a liberated life,
how to be true to ourselves

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.020
and sincere, from
this point of view,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.860
is just chaining ourselves.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.180
We're chaining ourselves to
this set of ruts and patterns

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.690
we've fallen into.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.150
So, following up the
full argument then,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.330
if they are right and if
our vision of ourselves

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.620
therefore is potentially
restraining, constraining,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.730
dangerous even, what do
they recommend doing?

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.220
Well, now we get to another
one of those surprising ideas--

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.954
rituals.

00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:42.370
Remember the
beginning of the talk

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.030
I mentioned that we tend to
think of rituals as being

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.090
part and parcel of these
traditional societies, part

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.465
and parcel of a
world where we'll

00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:53.830
be born into a society that
would tell us what to do.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.730
And rituals we tend to
think are the things

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.160
that socialize us into
doing those sorts of things.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.760
So rituals kind of perfectly
exemplify why we don't like

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.060
traditional worlds.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.230
They perfectly
exemplify what we don't

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.410
like about a traditional
society because we don't

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.580
like being told what to do.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.240
We should decide
for ourselves as

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.370
opposed to rituals
that socializes

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.660
into certain ways of being.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.320
So, as I've noted,
their vision of the self

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.680
is rather different.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.390
So let's now talk about
their vision of ritual.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.420
Yes, they talk
about rituals a lot,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.000
and they think
they're important.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.440
But here's what they
say about rituals.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.690
Rituals are not there
to socialize you

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.600
into a certain way of being.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.630
The reason you do
rituals is to break you

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.010
from your patterns and ruts and
to open up other possibilities.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.440
That's why we do rituals.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.320
Let me give you a
very clear example

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.080
from their time, before we
follow up the implications

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.530
for what it would mean for us.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.030
But here's one of
their rituals just

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.010
to give you a sense of
what they're talking about.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.470
So we fall into patterns
and ruts, right?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.830
Here's a very common one
we tend to fall into,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.500
father-son relationships,
father-son relationships

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.710
in which patterns and ruts
can play out for generations

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.760
in which the father
will be hopefully

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.330
both trying to be a
good father, but perhaps

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.460
being in the dominant position
of the relationship, perhaps

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.200
a little arrogant and
aggressive, the son both

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.430
trying to live up to the
father, but feeling himself

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.980
always failing, and vis a
vis this authority figure.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.370
And these relationships can play
out for generations, oftentimes

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.600
very tension filled.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.530
So what do they
recommend to deal

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.170
with these sorts of patterns?

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.780
Do they recommend sitting
down and chatting it through

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.360
and having a good, nice talk
through about all the problems?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.380
Well no, because they would
say if we're patterned,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.070
rutted creatures, you can
talk and talk and talk.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.930
But you'll simply return to
the same patterns and ruts

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.810
because they're so much a part
of our whole way of being,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.670
our whole way of emotionally
experiencing those around us.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.220
So here's what you do instead.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.730
You do a ritual.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.070
And in the ritual
what will happen

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.330
is the father and the son go to
the edge of the ritual space,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.240
and they stop.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.360
And then they walk
in without blushing.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.690
Now that may seem like
a really odd thing

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.310
to have as part of a
ritual, but here's why.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.870
Because when they
walk in the ritual,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.050
they're no longer
who they were before.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.170
The son is now his
own grandfather.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.690
And the father is now
the son of his own son.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.780
And the son, but
now the grandfather,

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.640
sits in the richly proper
position facing south.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.460
And his own father, who's
now his son in the ritual,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.760
faces him looking north.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.620
And the father
pays proper senses

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.810
of developing a proper
relationship to his own son,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.340
except it's his
father in the ritual.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.920
And the idea is all
of these tensions

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.440
that he has had with his own
father that can't be worked out

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.850
now because the
father is passed away,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.400
he now works out again,
in a ritual context,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.630
but with his own son.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.960
And his own son, from
a very young age,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.170
also has to play the role of
being the father, learning

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.850
from a young age
what it's like to be

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.920
in a position of authority, the
incredible responsibility that

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.720
comes from that, but equally
the dangers of falling

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.770
into a sort of arrogance
that comes from being

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.350
in a position of power.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.150
And from a young age, he
has to experience that,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:38.300
but looking at his own
father as if he were the son.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.250
And by doing this, by
forcing this role reversal,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.780
but more importantly by forcing
this role reversal where

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.520
each actually has to relate to
the other in precisely the most

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.060
difficult position
of the relationship,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.140
the idea is what you
are doing is breaking

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.990
the kind of patterns that are
playing out outside that ritual

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.880
space.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.625
Then you stand up in the
ritual and you walk out,

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.250
and you're back to
being father and son

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.208
and the same old patterns
begin to recur again.

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:08.460
Of course, the father
starts yelling at the son,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.840
the son starts getting
rebellious, blah, blah, blah,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.830
blah, blah.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.680
But then you go back.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.880
And the idea is by doing this
ritual over and over again,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.420
being forced to play the
opposite role vis a vis

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.290
that very person, what you
doing is breaking those patterns

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.410
over time.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.660
And by doing so-- and this
is really the key point--

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.440
you're opening up
the possibility

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.140
for a different
form of relationship

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.030
outside the ritual.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.760
And let me emphasize
that latter point.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.680
Note immediately,
this ritual is not

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.190
socializing you into playing
the role in the ritual.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.190
The son is not being socialized
into playing the role of being

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.466
the father to his own father.

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:50.840
The father is
certainly not being

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.910
socialized into the role of
playing a son to his own son.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.720
The point of the
ritual is the break.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.520
The point of the ritual is to
say you, for that brief period,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.099
act as if you're a
different person, relating

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.920
to another one in
a different way.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.800
And that break forces
a shift, forces

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.550
a rupture in the usual
patterns that dominate us.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.109
And that opens the possibility
for something else.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:20.885
And what is that something else?

00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:24.079
What that something
else is means

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.780
if we're these patterned,
rutted creatures,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.100
if you begin to break them, what
you begin to realize over time

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.250
is that on the contrary, we are
also very messy creatures who

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.930
have fallen into patterns,
also meaning therefore

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.770
that you begin to
realize that these are

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.850
all alterable and changeable.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.630
And slowly what
begins to happen is

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.370
all of these patterns and
ruts that dominate oneself

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.700
outside the ritual space become
shiftable and malleable and

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.910
workable.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.570
And note, this one ritual
example I gave you is only one

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.680
of a ton you're
doing all the time,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.880
which are constantly forcing
these breaks, constantly

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.520
forcing one-- and I'll
use one of their terms--

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.620
not to find oneself but
to overcome the self.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.820
Now immediately
you might say, OK,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.410
even if we grant
that this is kind

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.970
of intriguing and kind of
perhaps on to something

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.430
about the self, and even a
kind of intriguing definition

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.950
of ritual, it's not
really something

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.170
we can take seriously beyond
that because, well, we

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.470
don't do rituals.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.880
I mean, we don't have rituals
where we do role reversals.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.260
And so even if it worked
for them, well, that's good.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.590
But still, what are we
supposed to do with this?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.800
Well, here's the next
stage of their argument.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.400
I suspect if you took
a lot of these figures

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.290
and plucked them into
contemporary society

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.550
and said do an ethnographic
analysis of what humans

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.540
are like nowadays,
these radically

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.910
modern liberated selves, and
tell us what you would think.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.645
I suspect what
they would say is,

00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.770
they're human beings like
all human beings as we're

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.500
describing them.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.590
They're these patterned,
rutted creatures

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.890
who are just following out these
patterns and ruts all the time.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.260
And part of these
patterns and ruts

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.700
include things
that become reified

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.700
as customs or conventions.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.230
But they're still just different
forms of patterns and ruts

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.790
because we all do them
without thinking about them.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.860
And that's what we're like.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.460
Or putting it in their
eyes, they would say yeah,

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.220
they're just like
we're describing them,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.620
patterned, rutted
creatures, perhaps

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.360
even worse because
they're so convinced they

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.270
are being true to
themselves and living

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.200
their own lives
that they don't even

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.810
realize the degree to which
they're patterned and rutted.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.550
And therefore what would
they say to break them?

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.280
Well, they'd began with the very
things they were looking at,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.500
customs and conventions.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.610
Because you see the ritual
I just described actually

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.860
comes from an earlier one, an
earlier one that was actually

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.390
just a custom that they made
into a ritual in the sense

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.140
they're talking about.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.480
And what this would mean
for us is the following.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.090
We like to think we're liberated
living our lives on our own.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.470
If we're patterned and rutted,
note also among these patterns

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.900
and ruts are these
endless conventions

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.740
that we just play out all the
time without thinking about.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.549
Let me give you a standard
example from America.

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:28.590
You see someone you know
walking down the street.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.932
They say hey, how's it going it.

00:20:29.932 --> 00:20:31.890
And you say oh, pretty
good, how are you doing?

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.170
And the other person goes
oh, pretty good, yeah.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.890
And then you walk along.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.730
Now if you think about
that-- and I've actually

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.460
asked lots of people
to think about it--

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.325
you'll often say
things like, yeah,

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:46.170
that's kind of a weird thing we
do because in fact I'm usually

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.760
not feeling pretty
good right then.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.634
I'm usually when I'm
walking down the street,

00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:52.080
I'm anxious and angry
and fearful of this

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.980
and worried I'm
not getting enough

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.819
done and angry with what's
going on with my partner

00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:58.860
and blah blah, blah, blah,
blah-- in other words,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.890
a typical day.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.030
And then I see someone I say,
oh, things are pretty good.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.710
And if you think about
it, it seems kind of odd.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.222
We're being inauthentic.

00:21:07.222 --> 00:21:09.680
Or maybe I should just say, if
someone says how's it going,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.526
I should just stop
and say oh my god,

00:21:11.526 --> 00:21:14.240
I'm anxious and
fearful and angry

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.580
and lay the whole thing out.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.490
Well, if you take these
ideas from China seriously,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.630
they would say the
precise opposite.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.130
No, we shouldn't be
authentic at that moment.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.260
We shouldn't try to
spill out who we truly

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.630
are at that moment.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.580
Actually on the contrary, we
should make the convention

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.770
into a ritual.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.580
Which means you don't simply
by rote say oh, pretty good.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.622
How are you?

00:21:35.622 --> 00:21:38.220
You actually, if you
think of it as a ritual,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.490
think of it as a rite.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.280
Where yes, at that moment,
you're walking down the street.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.560
You're anxious, fearful,
angry, all the things

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.430
we just mentioned, the typical
roiling set of emotions that

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.910
are often sadly dominating us.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.710
And then at that
moment what you do

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.729
is you act as if you're a
different person relating

00:21:56.729 --> 00:21:58.770
to this other messy person
who's probably equally

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.220
angry, resentful,
and blah, blah,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.300
blah in a perfect way
where, at that moment,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.550
yes, everything is good.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.400
I'm connecting with this person.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.550
This person is a
really close friend.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.010
Everything is wonderful.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.015
Not because it is.

00:22:13.015 --> 00:22:13.820
It's not.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.170
Not because even that
person is a close friend.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.010
He or she probably is not.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.150
Rather, you're acting
as if they are.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.800
And why do you do that?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.450
Because if you do that,
and keep doing this,

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.470
all these little
conventions, you

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.370
begin working on
and breaking them,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.190
acting as if you're a
slightly different person.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.230
What you begin to
notice-- and I mean

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.880
begin to notice
within a few days.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.730
And it's amazing how quickly
you begin to start sensing this.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.895
You start sensing the
degree to which yes, you

00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:45.340
are patterned and rutted,
because you will note

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.250
the little things
that you're doing

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.840
that are in fact affecting
others all the time without you

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.410
noticing it, because we're just
playing out these patterns.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.910
It's affecting them
because they're

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.650
playing out their patterns.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.730
And you begin to notice,
by these little breaks,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.010
that on the contrary,
if you shifting things

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.920
slightly, saying oh pretty good
in a slightly different tone

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.060
of voice, walking in a
slightly different way,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.000
you'll notice it affects
people around you

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.520
in a slightly different way
too-- often times without them

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.290
noticing it.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.080
They're patterned.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.470
They're just responding by ruts.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.100
But then you being
working on it.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.370
And you begin to notice the
degrees to which, for example,

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.120
relationships that
we're in-- we have

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.141
all these problematic
relationships.

00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.890
At home, you have a
partner where you just

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.459
go through the same
fight every single night.

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:33.000
In the office place-- I'm sure
never here-- but in the office

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.940
place you have a
difficult coworker.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.680
And it just seems
to go on endlessly.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.020
Of course it goes on endlessly.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.260
It's patterns.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.440
These are ruts.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.800
But how do you break
them-- little alterations,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.150
little shifts.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.520
And you begin to notice,
smiling at a time

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.330
when you wouldn't
otherwise smile,

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.980
doing something you
wouldn't otherwise

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.330
do begins to actually alter
your relationship-- suddenly,

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.400
slightly.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.486
But then you do it
a little bit more.

00:23:59.486 --> 00:24:03.420
And slowly these
relationships start shifting,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.230
exactly like doing a
ritual where you're

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.791
forced to do a role reversal.

00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.540
Now it's slightly
different because you're

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.950
sort of creating these
alterations as you go.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.550
But it actually
accomplishes the same goal.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.275
You're breaking these ruts.

00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:20.336
And then where
does this take one?

00:24:20.336 --> 00:24:23.160
Well as these ruts
begin shifting,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.581
you also notice
something else too.

00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.710
Your relationships, by
definition, begin to shift.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.722
But you also begin to notice
that who you thought you were,

00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.430
this true self that
was just you with all

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.120
of the witnesses, the fact
that we get angry at things, et

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.160
cetera, is incredibly
alterable too,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.974
because you begin physically
feeling differently.

00:24:43.974 --> 00:24:45.640
You begin physically
feeling differently

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.830
as you begin interacting
with others differently.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.310
You begin experiencing
the world differently.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.090
And it becomes
ever more workable.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.050
And you begin altering that.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.560
And slowly what
you're learning--

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.570
not cognitively
but in practice--

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.420
is that yes, we
are messy selves.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.530
We are messy selves that fall
into these patterns and ruts.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.500
But the flip side of
that-- finally getting

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.560
to the good part--
is if we are messy--

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.580
and I think we are--
that's changeable.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.140
That's alterable.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.320
And you begin to
realize we've fallen

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.830
into entire ways
of being passively.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.620
And you begin to realize by
altering those and changing

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.590
those and shifting those, at the
very ludicrously mundane level

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.220
of just ordinary things
we're doing on a daily basis,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.940
out of that, slowly, you
begin changing yourself,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.330
changing your interactions,
changing your relationships.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.930
And then you start becoming
active in the process.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.960
Then you begin working on
how these relationships are

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.530
affecting those
around you and you.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.490
And the more you work, you
begin forging a different self.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.060
And if everything
is malleable, you

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.150
can start forging
different worlds.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.730
And I mean that
in a strong sense,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.740
forging entire worlds where
instead of interacting

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.900
with others de facto in ways
that are often very harmful,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.440
you're actually acting in
ways that are enabling them

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.970
to flourish and you as well.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.930
Now that seems like
a strong statement,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.640
but let me give again
another of their examples

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.550
before I bring it
to our own age.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.400
So I mentioned
this guy Confucius

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.456
that we tend to associate
with Confucianism, this idea

00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:26.330
that we should just
follow a bunch of rituals

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.030
to train us into being
certain types of beings.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.140
And as we've noticed, they
had a very different notion

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.430
of ritual.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.790
So let me now say a few
more words about Confucius.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.740
If this notion of ritual
is what he's advocating,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.830
where does it take us?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.690
And here's where it took him.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:48.610
Let me describe the way he,
Confucius, is described.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.150
The way he is
described in a work

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.010
c the "Analects," which is a
work beautifully put together

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.960
by his disciples
basically to describe him,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.050
what he was like as a person.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.920
And if we tend to think of him
as this kind of ritual fuddy

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.410
duddy telling people, do
rituals, do rituals, do rituals

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.760
and be socialized
into your position,

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.140
it's a very different portrait.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.020
Here's the way he's
actually portrayed.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.210
He is portrayed as someone
intensely joyous, incredibly

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.660
joyous, incredibly charismatic,
the sort of person that people

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.090
just want to be wound.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:21.710
And the reason they
want to be around

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.020
him is because of what he's
become so good at doing.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.400
And he'll be
described as someone

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.770
who can simply walk
into a situation

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.420
and has become so good, because
he's been training himself

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.120
through a lifetime
of this ritual work,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.660
that he can immediately sense
all the patterns and ruts

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.490
playing out in that situation.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.000
And he'll do little
things to alter

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.870
the situation, little
things like a tone of voice,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.580
the way he holds his body,
the way he'll quote from lines

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.930
of poetry, that will bring out
different responses from those

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.240
around him, that will enable
all the sort of tensions

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.240
and complexities of the
moment to be shifted.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.550
And in that moment, suddenly
you create this pocket

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.380
where people begin to connect
well, sense each other well,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.710
begin to flourish.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.440
And the idea is by doing
that moment by moment,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.270
he's become this
intensely joyous person

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.200
that it's joyous to be
around because he's just

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.790
so good at connecting with
people and working with people

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.200
and shifting situations
for the better.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.570
And by doing this on a
moment by moment basis,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.670
the further argument
is this is what

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.760
he's able to do at
a larger level too.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.330
He's able to with the
immediate people he encounters,

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.840
but at a larger level, able to
do it with more social problems

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.320
because he can sense the
patterns that are creating

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.640
the dangers and
the difficulties,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.590
and can sense how to begin
shifting them and altering

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.040
them and working on them.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.050
We have, again, a
very mundane level,

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.260
because the argument
is it really comes down

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.570
to basic ways of
experiencing the world

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.210
and interacting with
those around us.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.380
That's how he's described.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.730
Or to put it in stronger
terms, the vision

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.530
is he was every bit as patterned
and rutted as all of us.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.190
But he's held up as
an example of someone

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.510
that if you do these
rituals and are constantly

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.210
trying to break these
patterns and ruts,

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.430
and train yourself
accordingly, you can

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.670
become that sort of a person.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.140
The term they use is sage.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.740
And the argument isn't
that we'll become sages.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.800
Their argument is, it's
a lifelong process that

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.360
will never succeed.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.490
But that is the
vision of a life.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.240
The vision of a
life in a nutshell

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.560
is precisely not that we should
be looking within, finding

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.290
ourselves, embracing
ourselves for who we are,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.880
being sincere and authentic
to this true self.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.830
The visions of the self
is, think of yourself

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.610
as something you forge, either
passively, in which case

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.615
you fall into these
rights and that's it.

00:29:52.615 --> 00:29:56.060
And they'll just dominate
your life until you die.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.760
And sadly, you'll pass them
on to the next generations.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.770
Or you forge your life
actively and consciously

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.185
through these constant
daily interactions

00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:09.090
that you're
constantly working on.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.830
And the full argument
is, if you do

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:16.260
that, if you're committed to
that as a vision of the self,

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.240
then what you're really
committing yourself to

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.960
is a constant-- to
use again an odd term

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.130
in our terminology-- kind
of a training exercise.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.890
To give yet another example
that is from our own time,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.200
if you try to think of places
where we do the sorts of things

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.700
they're talking about, they're
actually kind of easy to find.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.830
But we don't really do
them in our daily life.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.776
Think for example
of learning a sport

00:30:42.776 --> 00:30:44.150
or learning a
musical instrument.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.850
It involves incredible
amounts of work and training.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.090
But what you're
achieving is something

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.134
beyond simply playing well.

00:30:53.134 --> 00:30:56.010
So here's an example,
learning the piano.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.990
So if you're learning
the piano, you

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.130
don't just sit down to the
piano and play spontaneously

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.580
and play well.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.100
That's just painful.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.020
What you do on the
contrary is you

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.050
train yourself-- incredibly,
incredibly hard work,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.220
hours a day training yourself
to do the basic chord

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.610
progressions, to
learn to feel the key.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.900
And as the years go by, you
begin to sense the keys.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.450
You begin to sense how, if
you play slightly differently,

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.280
you can bring out certain
moods in those around you.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.090
If you play a little softer
or a little more strongly,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.680
you can affect the
room in different ways.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.890
And as the years go by, you
get so good at doing this

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.110
that you're able to do it, in
their terms, spontaneously.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.380
You've trained yourself to
spontaneously sense the music,

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.750
sense the room,
sense the situation,

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.120
sense how to alter
the mood of the room.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.190
And through that
training, you're

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.940
spontaneously able to so
sense the world around you

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.850
that you're able to play
with this incredible degree

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.500
of power, the power in
the sense of altering

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.880
the world for the better.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.782
That is the vision
they're talking about.

00:32:04.782 --> 00:32:06.240
And that sense that
you've gotten--

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.720
and we've all done something
like this, if not a piano,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.500
then a sport or
something like this--

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.580
there's a sense of
incredible-- yeah,

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.350
I'll use the term--
joyousness that

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.540
comes when you're
so in the moment,

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.910
so sensing a
situation, and so able

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.680
to alter that situation just
by sensing things so well.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.870
So if we kind of know what
they're talking about by things

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.170
we do like when we learn a piano
or learn a musical instrument,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.380
note the final point
that I want to emphasize.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.460
All of the examples
I suspect that we

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.680
would tend to think of when
we kind of realize, oh yeah, I

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.460
kind of understand that you
can train yourself to be

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.690
the sort of person
they're talking about,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.060
these are things we kind
of tend to do on weekends

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.030
to feel better, right?

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.420
Like on weekends, OK,
I'll play the piano.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.080
Now I'll play the sport.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.500
And then I'll go back to
my normal, everyday life.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.380
What in a sense they're
saying is the following.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.380
Suppose you take
that same vision

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.830
of what it takes to train
yourself, but apply it

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.230
to your everyday life such
that your everyday life becomes

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.690
a training exercise,
training yourself

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.380
to sense situations,
sense patterns,

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.465
since these ruts that
we and those around us

00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:20.540
have fallen into, and train
yourself to sense this,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.030
begin to work on this,
alter this, shift this.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.880
And what you're
training yourself to do

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.440
is to [INAUDIBLE] the
ability, over time,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.940
to, yes, create these worlds
around you within which

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.372
people can flourish.

00:33:33.372 --> 00:33:37.080
You do it by not finding the
self but overcoming the self.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.440
You do it by not trying to be
sincere and true to yourself,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.620
but, at the
beginnings, acting as

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.710
if you are different
types of people,

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.430
but slowly therefore over
time constructing the self.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.450
And the goal is to achieve
something like what

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.810
they would call [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.140
Not again that we
achieve it, but something

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.020
along those lines of
becoming the sort of person

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.610
so attuned to
everyone around one

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.690
that, at an immediate level
and a larger social level,

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.280
that you're able to sense
situations and create

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.290
these worlds within which
people can flourish.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.969
In short, if we are
malleable creatures--

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.070
and again, psychological
experiments

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.770
are showing that we
are-- in practice

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.179
we tend to lose that because
we become patterned and rutted.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.730
But take it seriously,
and suddenly

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.846
everything that we thought
was stable becomes changeable.

00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:31.500
Or to put it, again, in very
strong terms, when we go back

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.800
and like to think, yes,
we are a liberated people

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.900
because we can decide
for ourselves how

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.150
to live our lives, as opposed
to those traditional people who

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.480
couldn't, the intriguing
thing is maybe in part

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.190
it's sort of the opposite, that
with our grand visions of how

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:52.170
to live liberated lives by being
true and sincere to ourselves,

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.929
we, ironically,
are creating very

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.510
stable selves-- in their
terminology, patterned and

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.740
rutted selves.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.204
And assuming a very
stable world around us,

00:35:03.204 --> 00:35:05.770
whereas a lot of
these other ideas

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.182
that have arisen
in world history

00:35:08.182 --> 00:35:11.550
were about recognizing the
degree to which the world isn't

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.870
really stable.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.890
We create stable worlds.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.710
But therefore, since we
do it passively, often

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.250
very dangerous, destructive,
discriminatory ones

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.750
in which people are
not able to flourish.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.750
And take it seriously, you
realize the world is really

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.050
incredibly malleable.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.720
And we are, in part, creating
that world, often poorly,

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.190
often passively.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.520
But if you change that and
begin living your life the way

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.570
they're describing
it, suddenly you

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.810
realize that these
worlds can be created

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.984
by the little tiny things
that we're doing all the time.

00:35:45.984 --> 00:35:49.350
In short, if we take
this idea seriously,

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.420
it forces us-- at least
offers, I would say,

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.150
a fundamental challenge to our
vision of the self, our vision

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.540
of what it means to be
a liberated individual,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.200
our vision of what we think
of as the modern world,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.950
and perhaps makes us realize
that, on the contrary,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.080
our vision of the
self is a vision.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.040
It has certain implications.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.010
Some of them at
least are potentially

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:16.210
restraining and dangerous even
to us and those around us.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:20.120
And some of these old ideas
from the traditional past--

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.500
in this case China,
but I'll expand this.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.270
A lot of ideas from
around the world

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.210
can suddenly be taken seriously
again because they're not

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.680
confined to a so-called
traditional world,

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.980
but we realize actually
they're operating

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.040
from a very different
vision of the self,

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.720
but one that's really on
to something fundamental.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.150
And if we take them
seriously, yes, it

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.360
forces us to challenge
our assumptions,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.550
and perhaps opens us to
a very powerful vision

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.160
of what it would
mean to live life

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.430
well in the sense of
enabling those around us

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.840
and ourselves to flourish
through the seemingly

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.680
simple mundane stuff
that we do on a very

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.740
basic, everyday level.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.570
In short, these
ideas are incredibly

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.450
powerful because they
challenge our assumption

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.600
and offer a very
practical vision of what,

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.970
on a daily basis, we could
be doing that would allow us,

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.370
over the course of a
lifetime, to become

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.050
very different and hopefully
incomparably better

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.790
types of human beings.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.760
Thank you so much.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.392
Thank you.

00:37:19.392 --> 00:37:24.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:24.612 --> 00:37:25.320
Great, thank you.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.360
And I would love to hear
questions, comments, thoughts.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.670
Please-- please, yes.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.080
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
about why we might concentrate

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.840
a lot on paying attention to
the self, like what our wants

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.770
and desires are.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:44.020
And the difference between now
and the past, one difference,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.730
is the economy, if
I might go there.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.021
MICHAEL PUETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:47.021 --> 00:37:49.470
AUDIENCE: The economy then,
everybody could basically

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.110
follow one of a very, very small
number of patterns as a male

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.490
or as a female.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.130
Now we're in an
economy where there

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.460
is such a diversity
of paths and everybody

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.410
can't do the same path.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.334
And so you teach
undergrads, right?

00:38:03.334 --> 00:38:04.125
MICHAEL PUETT: Yes.

00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:07.680
AUDIENCE: And all of them
are like, OK, where's mine?

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.520
I can't follow what
everybody else is doing.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.795
So how do those play out?

00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:15.840
MICHAEL PUETT: I think
that's beautifully put.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.630
And I think it's a
perfect example of where

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.950
we are in a sense,
because on the one hand,

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.110
we have a world that should
be open for incredible

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.060
possibilities, as you said,
a world in which seemingly

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.510
endless number of paths
are available to us.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.070
And yet the chilling thing if
one takes these ideas seriously

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:38.460
is how in practice, we can
so imprison and constrain

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.690
ourselves in terms of that work.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.710
So getting back to the
key of your question,

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.880
they would argue if it's
true that the world seems

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.040
to us incredibly open, why do
we not live our lives that way?

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.536
And why on the contrary
are we not pursuing

00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:55.660
all these possibilities
that are really potentially

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.960
available to us, but
on the contrary falling

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.612
into these incredibly
dangerous ruts?

00:39:00.612 --> 00:39:02.570
And I would say that's
true of us individually,

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.580
but I would put it in a
larger social level too.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.390
We live in a world that
is becoming unbelievably

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.990
stratified, where people's
lives are unbelievably-- not

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.940
only routinized,
but actually held

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.980
into certain
socioeconomic positions,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.240
and are surprisingly
unchangeable.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.630
So given what would seem
to be the reality of a very

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.830
open world, and equally
the reality of a world

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:30.130
that we seem to be creating
isn't going on, why not?

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.660
And going back to their
ideas, they would say, well,

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.100
it comes down to the ways
that we live our lives,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.120
and at a larger level,
the kind of social worlds

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.260
that we've accordingly
created, which we now

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.900
think of as grand and
liberatory, but ironically

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.000
are creating a
completely different type

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.352
of world, which surprisingly
we don't even seem to notice.

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:50.080
So thank you,
wonderful question.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.410
Thank you.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.590
Yes please.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.010
AUDIENCE: First of all
I'd like to apologize

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.306
on behalf of the site for
the construction noise.

00:39:57.306 --> 00:39:59.740
MICHAEL PUETT: That is fine.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.960
AUDIENCE: There is one
aspect of finding yourself

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.900
that it strikes me
still has value,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.350
and that is we have
different values.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.240
And so finding your
values, not necessarily

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.700
what makes you feel
good, but what you feel

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.560
detracts from you if you
were to turn against it.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.010
For example, if you value
the helping of others

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.990
and you only pursue wealth, for
reasons other than donation,

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:27.190
then you are not being
true to your values.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:32.510
And that is, I think,
worthwhile to pay attention to.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:38.510
But I agree that the find
yourself seems to often mean

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.752
the self in the sense of
wanting to escape from

00:40:40.752 --> 00:40:42.460
rather than the self
in the sense of what

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.460
values are fundamental to me.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.510
MICHAEL PUETT: Yes,
perfectly put, and I actually

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.820
agree completely.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.790
So were we to conceptualize the
self in the sense of the self

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.970
that we are creating
through the little works

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.690
that we're doing
all the time, then

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.057
I think the notion of
finding a self works great.

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.890
In other words, finding
a self in that sense

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.630
would be an active
constructive process of,

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.990
as you said, developing
the values that we

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.930
want to be guiding our lives.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.190
The danger, as you
said, is so often when

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.662
we use the term finding
ourself, we are using it

00:41:13.662 --> 00:41:14.620
in that opposite sense.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.430
We're using the sense of, I need
to find my true authentic self

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.350
that I should just embrace
and love for who I am.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.600
And the problem is in
practice, even if we say,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.590
and part of that is
I'm the sort of person

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.510
who values certain
things, danger

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.850
is with that way of
thinking, actually the way

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.876
we live in our
daily lives perhaps

00:41:33.876 --> 00:41:35.750
is not at all according
to the values that we

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.610
like to think we hold,
that in fact the daily ways

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.610
we're living and the ways
we're affecting others

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.990
can often directly
contradict what

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.964
we claim to be our own values.

00:41:44.964 --> 00:41:46.880
So getting back to the
heart of your question,

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.400
yes, if we can think of the self
as something we are working on,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.010
constructing, and the values
of the self being something

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.440
that we as human
beings are constructing

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.230
through our daily life and
therefore hopefully embodying

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.850
in the way we live, then it's
a wonderful notion of the self.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.270
Sadly, it tends to be not
the vision of the self

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.780
that we tend to think about when
we're actually living nowadays.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.380
AUDIENCE: It's a
form of surrender

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.854
to love the self you have rather
than the self you aspire to.

00:42:12.854 --> 00:42:15.270
MICHAEL PUETT: Yeah, that's
perfectly put-- perfectly put.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.490
I mean, this sounds so great
to love myself, embrace myself.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.600
But the danger exactly
as you said is,

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.890
well no, you're just embracing
the set of patterns and ruts

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.060
I've fallen into.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.910
And the goal should
be aspirational.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.230
It's to create a great
self, a great self that

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.320
can work well in the world
and help those around one.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.330
And that's the
vision of self I fear

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.390
we're losing, precisely with
our vision of always being

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.197
true to yourself and
sincere to yourself

00:42:42.197 --> 00:42:43.280
and authentic to yourself.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.240
Ironically, we're creating the
exact opposite type of a world.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.210
Great, thank you.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.150
Thank you.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.040
Please, yes.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.040
At the end you have
this beautiful vision

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.810
that the sage's path is
like creating spaces that

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.960
cause joyousness in others.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.150
That was my understanding.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.900
But we also, at
the beginning, you

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.260
point out that if we're
just bundles of stuff,

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.180
the other bundles
of stuff are what

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.010
can cause us to get into
these patterns and ruts.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.610
So like other bundles of
stuff yell at me, and then I--

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.527
And I have this stereotype--
I don't know much

00:43:17.527 --> 00:43:19.610
about Chinese philosophy--
but I have a stereotype

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.490
like Chinese philosophers
were hermits.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.670
And listening to
your talk, I sort of

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.960
could understand
how, to some extent,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.856
I wonder, like, when
I was hearing this,

00:43:27.856 --> 00:43:30.230
well I can protect myself from
the other bundles of stuff

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.790
by just not leaving my
house and creating patterns

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.450
in my own house
that I can control,

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:41.160
because you ultimately can't
control the other bundles.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.550
I guess sort of how do you
take that jump from hermit

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.780
to joyousness?

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.785
MICHAEL PUETT: Yeah, no,
it's a great question.

00:43:50.785 --> 00:43:53.410
And what they would say-- and I
would agree with them on this--

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.100
is that doing the approach
of sort of locking oneself

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.666
in one's room and not
interacting with others

00:43:59.666 --> 00:44:01.040
in the long run
is actually going

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.420
to be completely
disruptive, that really

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.155
the only way to work
on these patterns

00:44:05.155 --> 00:44:07.890
and ruts is through
interactions.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:12.030
And yes, the simple fact-- and I
think you're right about this--

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.619
that so many of our
patterns and ruts

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:15.160
are formed with what
other people are

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.970
doing around us, who are
equally patterned and rutted.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.160
The key is what we're
training ourselves

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.242
to do is both act in ways that
hopefully will break patterns

00:44:24.242 --> 00:44:26.770
and ruts with those
around us, but we're also

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.455
training ourselves
not to be affected

00:44:28.455 --> 00:44:31.710
in the same dangerous
ways, they would put it,

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.230
by those around us as well.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.660
So we turn to that example.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.720
If that person is
yelling at me, that

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.525
will draw out even someone
who's not yelling but using

00:44:39.525 --> 00:44:40.900
a tone of voice
that for whatever

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.270
reason emotionally reminds me of
someone who used to yell at me.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.540
That would draw a
certain response.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.610
So part of the
training exercise is

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.874
you're training yourself
not to passively

00:44:51.874 --> 00:44:53.290
respond that way--
in other words,

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.230
not to respond by those
same patterns and ruts.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.320
And when that person
does something,

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.590
you're training yourself
not to be so affected by it.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.810
And in the long run what you
really train yourself to do

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.890
is the next step too, which
is to realize probably

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.320
if that person is doing
something like either yelling

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.070
or some kind of
strong kind of voice,

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.150
it probably is coming
as well from something

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.762
you're doing too--
unconsciously.

00:45:17.762 --> 00:45:19.970
You're just playing out your
usual patterns and ruts.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.652
But that's creating
the situation

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:22.860
where that person gets angry.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.400
You get angry in return.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.827
You're doing something too.

00:45:25.827 --> 00:45:27.910
And so you're training
yourself not to be affected

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.500
by that person in that way.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.062
But you ultimately
want to train yourself

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.895
to be able to act in
ways that will actually

00:45:33.895 --> 00:45:35.410
shift that person too.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.890
So that person's
anger isn't arising,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.690
it's then generating your anger.

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:42.850
And that sounds incredibly
difficult, and it is,

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.660
but the key is it can
only be done in practice.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.650
So you don't want to
sit out in your room

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.040
and think that's
the way to avoid all

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.710
these difficult relationships.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:54.680
No, it's only by working on
these difficult relationships

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.170
all the time that you train
yourself both to respond well

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.034
to others, but
again, respond well

00:46:00.034 --> 00:46:01.450
in this strong
sense of responding

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.066
in ways that will bring out
better sides of them as well.

00:46:04.066 --> 00:46:04.720
So great.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.340
Thank you.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.540
Yes please.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.190
AUDIENCE: I guess we
often tend to assume

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.490
that the notion of
the self is divorced

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.540
from society as a concept that
arose in the Enlightenment

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.280
in Western Europe.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.750
I just got back from a
couple of weeks in Iran

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:23.040
where I learned a great deal
about the role of martyrdom

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.780
in Shiite Islam and the
very live sense of martyrdom

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:33.160
as something to be
of very high value.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.680
And obviously that's a very
different view of the self,

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.380
sacrificing the self
for the greater good.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.860
To bring this back
to China, I think

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.590
we also tend to think of
this sort of blossoming

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:51.730
of the self as something
recently that has evolved out

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.810
of the Chinese
revolution, and that

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.027
during the Chinese
revolution, again,

00:46:56.027 --> 00:46:58.110
we tend to think there was
a very different notion

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.410
of the self and self-sacrifice.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.890
But again with the development
of capitalism in China,

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.090
fairly clearly a more
Western like view

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:12.610
of the self as something to be
enhanced, fought for, separated

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:17.860
from society seems to have
developed very, very fully.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.630
Can you comment on sort of
more recent Chinese history

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.750
and how you see these
ancient traditions,

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.510
the role of the self, relating
to more modern trends in China?

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.180
MICHAEL PUETT: Yes,
great question.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.680
And until recently, the
way I would have said

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.050
is, sadly from my point of
view, a lot of these ideas

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.070
were rejected.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:41.060
And what I mean by
that is the following.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.090
For much of the 20th
century, these ideas

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.140
were very strongly rejected.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.360
So all the ideas I
mentioned at the beginning,

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.050
that we are modern people--
and luckily for us, rejecting

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.910
these traditional
ideas-- these and such

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.580
a vision of a modern world
destroying a traditional world

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.930
became all pervasive.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.460
And during the imperial
period, these ideas

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.600
became pervasive in the world,
absolutely in China too.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.850
And you had a succession of
governments explicitly devoted

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.220
to the claim, we're
going to modernize.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.270
And to modernize we're going
to destroy traditional society

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.170
altogether.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.980
So texts like these were burned.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.120
The old temples were destroyed.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.150
It was an explicitly modernist
paradigm, and particularly

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.730
of course under Mao, under
the Cultural Revolution,

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.250
literally these
texts were burned.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.300
The idea was to
destroy the past.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.270
Then as you said
more recently, there

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.910
was a reaction against Maoism
and an incredible embrace

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:38.210
of neoliberal capitalism, much
more actually than in America.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.270
And China became a world
where sort of everything

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.180
was up for sale.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.010
Everything was about
money and power.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.730
And as you said, a
vision of the self

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.300
very comparable to ones
that we hold-- in fact,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.260
if anything, more extreme.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.770
Now the interesting
thing-- and I

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.450
mean now meaning
the past something

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:59.270
like eight years-- all of
this is beginning to change.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.450
And there's now a very
self-conscious debate

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.580
going on in China of,
have we lost our values.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.180
Have we simply become a world
where everything comes down

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.470
to money and power?

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.530
And all of a sudden,
all of these old rituals

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.360
are coming back.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.630
The temples are being
rebuilt. These texts

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.320
are being read again.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.720
There's a huge
blogosphere in China.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.450
And now all these passages that
we've been alluding to today,

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.850
they're actively being
debated and discussed

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.210
in the blogosphere.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.390
And all of it is coming back.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.340
Now how this will play
out, I have no idea.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.900
But I suspect at the minimum
what's going on now--

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.490
and I would put this
more globally as well--

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.960
there's increasingly a view
that this one restrictive notion

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.070
of the self, which really
became a global vision

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.010
of the past century,
is now being questioned

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.300
in a lot of quarters.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.400
And in China itself,
a lot of these ideas

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.010
are actively coming back.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.400
And it's going to be, I
think, an exciting moment.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.420
Certainly in China,
but I suspect globally,

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.200
when for the first time
really in a long time,

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.930
the vision of the self
that's been so dominant

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:03.630
is coming under question.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.440
And a lot of these
ideas from the past

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.750
are once again being
taken seriously.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.720
And at the minimum,
this will mean

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.730
another generation
will grow out not

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.810
be told this vision of
the self is the right one,

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:19.550
but actually allowed to take
from very different traditions.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.330
And the fact that this is going
on yet again finally in China

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.124
as well is something I think
it incredibly exciting.

00:50:25.124 --> 00:50:26.290
Yeah, it's a great question.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.750
Thank you.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.510
Yes please.

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.710
AUDIENCE: This seems
like an interesting prism

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:35.010
perhaps through which to view
traditional Western religion as

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:39.080
well, that one can be
cynical and look at it sort

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.340
of, it looks like hypocrisy,
these New Testament

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.172
lessons that seem very
idealistic, not really matching

00:50:46.172 --> 00:50:47.880
the way people normally
live their lives.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.490
But you know, once a
week you go to church.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.210
You listen to these things.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.920
It's like a ritual where,
I think in your framework,

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:03.512
where you practice being someone
else, being someone better.

00:51:03.512 --> 00:51:04.600
Does that seem--

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.482
MICHAEL PUETT: I
agree completely.

00:51:06.482 --> 00:51:07.940
One of the things
that's intriguing

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.760
when you begin
looking at these ideas

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.790
is you begin realizing that
not just Chinese ideas,

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.350
actually if you look at
so-called traditional practices

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.800
in general, a lot of the
rituals were doing exactly this.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.490
And so a lot of the
religious rituals

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.486
that we today
would say oh, those

00:51:23.486 --> 00:51:25.610
are silly because it means
we're being inauthentic.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:26.600
We're being insincere.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.683
We're being hypocritical
as you said because we're

00:51:28.683 --> 00:51:31.890
being asked to act as something
that isn't what we're really

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:35.120
feeling at that moment,
that's precisely the point.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.830
The whole point of these rituals
is yes, you enter a space

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.010
and you are no longer the
person that you were before.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.880
You are acting as if
you're a different person

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.190
in a different world.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.810
And the goal of that is
to change for the better.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.710
So yes, I think a lot of these
ideas work not only for China,

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.080
I think they work in general.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.400
I think they're really on to
something profound about why

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.283
rituals work.

00:51:57.283 --> 00:51:59.270
They work not just
to socialize us

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.280
into a way of being-- in fact
you can put it more strongly,

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.410
when rituals become
that is precisely

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.620
the point at which you get
reactions against them.

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.620
When rituals are alive and
powerful, what they're doing

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.440
is helping break us from
our patterns and ruts.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.010
And I think this applies equally
well to Western religions

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:15.510
as well.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:17.080
So yes, thank you so much.

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.980
Great.

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.080
Well thank you so much.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.538
This has been a tremendous time
and a wonderful experience.

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.650
Thank you so much.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.084
[APPLAUSE]
