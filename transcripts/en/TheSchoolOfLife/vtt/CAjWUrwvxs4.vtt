00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.580
René Descartes was a French 17th century philosopher, famous above all for saying 'I think therefore I am',

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.640
but worthy of our attention for many reasons beyond this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.420
What makes him stand out is that he was a fierce rationalist.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.780
In an age when many philosophers still backed up their arguments with appeals to God,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.920
Descartes trusted in nothing more than the human power of logic.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:40.540
This is how he defiantly kicked off his book 'Rules for the Direction of the Mind': 'I shall bring to light the true riches of our souls, opening up to each of us the means whereby we confined within ourselves,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.020
without any help from anyone else, all the knowledge that we may need for the conduct of life.'

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.900
Descartes had immense faith in what introspection guided by definition, sound argument, and clarity of thought could achieve.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.920
He believed that much of what was wrong with the world was caused by misusing our minds by confusion, bad definition,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.980
and unconscious illogicality.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.120
His life was an attempt to make our minds better equipped for the task of thinking.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.820
To solve key questions, Descartes proposed that one always had to divide large problems into small,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.140
understandable sections by way of incisive questions. This is what he called his 'method of doubts'.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.720
We get muddled by certain questions like 'what's the meaning of life', or 'what is love?',

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.880
because we're not careful enough about how we break these big inquiries down.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.840
He described the method of doubts as akin to having a large barrel of apples

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.020
where good ones are mixed with bad ones. To be a philosopher

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.600
means a commitment to sorting out the entire barrel to inspecting each apple

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.300
Individually and throwing away all the bad ones to ensure only those of the best quality are left.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.480
Another way to think about Descartes,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.380
and this explains why he would among other things,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.680
turn out to be such a hero to the leaders of the French revolution, is that he believed in grounding all of our ideas

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.240
in individual experience and reason, rather than authority and tradition. In his greatest book 'Discourse on the Method' published in 1637,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.400
he explained how he had come to write it: 'A long time ago, I entirely abandoned the study of letters

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.720
resolving to seek no knowledge, other than that which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent my youth

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.820
traveling visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.280
testing myself in situations which fortune afforded me, and at all times

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.460
reflecting personally upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.'

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.640
Descartes spent a large part of his adult life away from his native France in the Dutch Republic,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.440
since he held the belief, not entirely unwisely,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.080
that the mercantile Dutch would, as a people, be far too concerned with earning money to pester a free-thinking man like himself.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
However it turned out that the Dutch were a little less materialistic than he'd hoped,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.080
and the philosopher ended up moving 24 times to keep ahead of spies and government agents.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.200
Descartes' subjective approach to philosophy reached its climax when he arrived at the famous phrase

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.100
'Cogito ergo sum'

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280
—'I think therefore I am'.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.280
The phrase first appeared in French—'Je pense donc je suis'—in the Discourse on the Method

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.800
before then appearing in Latin in the Principles of Philosophy of 1644.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.080
It was intended to be Descartes' ultimate answer to a question that philosophers

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.839
sometimes get perhaps unreasonably interested in, namely

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.899
'How can one know that anything including oneself,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.320
actually exists rather than being some sort of dream or phantasm?'

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.500
On his quest was certainty around this question of whether it might all be a dream

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.000
Descartes began by observing that our human senses are deeply unreliable. He couldn't, for example,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.080
he said, be trusted to know whether he was actually sitting in a room in his dressing gown

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.500
next to a fire, or merely dreaming of such a thing.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.600
But there was one thing he could know for sure: he could trust that he was actually thinking.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.920
His existence could be proved by a neat tautological trick.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.440
He could not be thinking and wondering if he existed if he did not exist,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.660
therefore his thinking was a very basic proof of his being or to return to the maxim 'I think therefore I am'.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.960
This might not sound like a huge insight, but Descartes used it as an Archimedean point

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.260
in an epistemologically unsteady world.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.960
With this certainty safely banked, Descartes argued that his mind could go to discover other similarly irrefutable truths.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.740
Some of the charm of Descartes' work comes through his entwining of personal details,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.440
along with more arid philosophical passages. He tells us, for example, that his revolutionary idea came to him during the winter of

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.200
1619, when he'd escaped the fierce cold of the low countries by hopping into a stove and spending the whole day meditating inside.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.329
Descartes epitomizes the solitary end of philosophy. One can, in his eyes,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.170
solve the most profound problems by searching deep within oneself.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.790
Teams of individuals, or ideas passed through the generations as they are in universities are deeply suspect for Descartes.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.240
Philosophers don't need gangs of scientists using expensive equipment, unheard-of terminology and huge datasets.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.560
They just need a quiet room and a rational mind.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.060
At another point, Descartes recounts that he mocked friends of his

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.640
who once showed up at his home at 11 in the morning and was surprised to find him still in bed.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.820
'What are you doing?' they inquired skeptically.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.960
'Thinking,' Descartes replied.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.820
The group was stunned, but Descartes criticized them in turn for privileging often

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.820
nonsensical practical tasks over the beauty of pure quiet reflection in bed.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.320
In 1649, Descartes finished another great work: 'Passions of the Soul'.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.200
It was the outcome of six years of correspondence with a royal acquaintance,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.640
the Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, who was a keen amateur philosopher, and a rather emotional and turbulent soul.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.200
She had written to Descartes begging him to write about passions in order that she might get to know and control her own more clearly.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.400
Descartes obliged. Thinking that the ancient philosophers had done a poor job of analyzing

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.080
the passions and that ordinary and not-so-ordinary people would benefit immensely from another look at the topic,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.120
he therefore opened the Passions of the Soul with a characteristic claim:

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.000
'I shall be obliged to write just as if I were considering a topic that no one had dealt with before me.'

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.100
The word provides a beautiful taxonomy of pretty much any passion one might feel,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.260
as well as descriptions of their causes, effects, and functions.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.300
This is followed by another section called 'The Discipline of Virtue',

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.580
a manual of advice on how we can control our passions and enjoy a virtuous life.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.780
Descartes identified six fundamental passions:

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.020
wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and sadness.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.500
From these they're followed in his eyes an unlimited number of specific passions;

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.660
combinations of the original ones.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.780
Descartes didn't believe in vanquishing passions as the ancient stoic philosophers had proposed,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.620
merely in learning how to identify them in oneself and understand their impact on one's behavior.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.220
He would have been very sympathetic to psychotherapy.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.820
He believed that a key task of being a philosopher was to help people understand

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.780
and therefore control their passions; that is, become a little less anxious, status-driven,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.800
scared, or inclined to fall head over heels in love with inappropriate people.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.360
He was optimistic about how much progress we could make psychologically.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.920
Even those who have the weakest souls can acquire absolute mastery over their passions

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.380
if they work hard enough at training and guiding them.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.880
Descartes' psychological and philosophical work attracted ever more powerful admirers.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.919
In 1646, Queen Christina of Sweden got interested in sorting out issues in her mind and began a correspondence with Descartes.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.900
She even persuaded the philosopher to move to Sweden to tutor her in passion and philosophy in 1649.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.199
However, the early working hour was required. the queen could only make time for lessons at 5:00 a.m.,

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:04.348
and the harsh cold soon made Descartes ill. He died of pneumonia in 1650 at the age of 53.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:11.440
To remember Descartes by 'I think therefore I am' is perhaps not as shallow as one might initially have presumed.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.800
The sentence does truly capture something important about him and the task of philosophy in general.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.380
It signals a commitment to working through emotional confusion, prejudice,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:28.300
and unhelpful tradition, in order to arrive at an independent rationally founded vision of existence.
