not so good to have a low IQ you know

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
not so good to have a low IQ you know
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.839
not so good to have a low IQ you know
people don't like the idea of IQ because

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849
people don't like the idea of IQ because
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.990
people don't like the idea of IQ because
it seems so arbitrary you know have a

it exactly it's you set up that way

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
it exactly it's you set up that way
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.859

it's very very very very stable you can

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
it's very very very very stable you can
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.670
it's very very very very stable you can
make a high IQ person stupider why no

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
make a high IQ person stupider why no
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.290

not educating them up to the level of
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.509
not educating them up to the level of
their possibility but taking someone who

it's like if you can figure out how to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
it's like if you can figure out how to
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.319
it's like if you can figure out how to
do that well you know Nobel Prize time

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
do that well you know Nobel Prize time
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.150
do that well you know Nobel Prize time
for you because people have tried that a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
for you because people have tried that a
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.790
for you because people have tried that a
lot and most recently with those you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
lot and most recently with those you
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650
lot and most recently with those you
know luminol Lumosity games and that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
know luminol Lumosity games and that
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.420
know luminol Lumosity games and that
sort of thing and the evidence that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
sort of thing and the evidence that
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.360
sort of thing and the evidence that
those produce anything other than

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
those produce anything other than
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.479

because intelligence is a cross-domain

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
because intelligence is a cross-domain

because intelligence is a cross-domain
phenomena and you can get really good in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
phenomena and you can get really good in
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590
phenomena and you can get really good in
a single domain by practicing like Matt

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
a single domain by practicing like Matt
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170
a single domain by practicing like Matt
and what you want is to practice like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
and what you want is to practice like
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210
and what you want is to practice like
Matt in a single domain and hope that it

Matt in a single domain and hope that it
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730
Matt in a single domain and hope that it
generalized to other domains that's the

holy grail of intelligence increase it's
like no no one's done it people claim it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
like no no one's done it people claim it
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.039
like no no one's done it people claim it
but the claims never hold up and people

but the claims never hold up and people
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499
but the claims never hold up and people
have been trying for a long time to do

average IQ is probably 125 130 at at 115

would barely get you going for you for a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
would barely get you going for you for a
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.539
would barely get you going for you for a
hard university 130 you're probably

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
hard university 130 you're probably
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.889
hard university 130 you're probably
graduate school material you know 145

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899
graduate school material you know 145
 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.039
graduate school material you know 145
you're up there at the range where you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
you're up there at the range where you
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.330
you're up there at the range where you
can probably do pretty much whatever you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
can probably do pretty much whatever you
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490
can probably do pretty much whatever you
want although as you get smarter the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
want although as you get smarter the
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859

scatter between your abilities increases

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
scatter between your abilities increases
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.420
scatter between your abilities increases
so you might have a very high verbal IQ

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
so you might have a very high verbal IQ
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490
so you might have a very high verbal IQ
but not be so good at mathematics or the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
but not be so good at mathematics or the
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589
but not be so good at mathematics or the
other way around but it's a massive

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
other way around but it's a massive
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.520

and I don't know what to do about that I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
and I don't know what to do about that I
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.850
and I don't know what to do about that I
mean why do smart people make more money

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860
mean why do smart people make more money
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.410
mean why do smart people make more money
well they get to where the edge of

well they get to where the edge of
production is faster so if you have a

up with the new ideas first and they're

going to have more ideas and they're
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.809
going to have more ideas and they're
going to strategize better and you know

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
going to strategize better and you know
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.620

think well this society is unfair

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580
think well this society is unfair
