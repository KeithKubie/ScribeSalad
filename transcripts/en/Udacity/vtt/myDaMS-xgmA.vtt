00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.820
Imagine that I am holding a piece of chromosome

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.430
2 right here and the part that I am

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.970
holding contains the lactase gene going of to my

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.760
left. The promoter region would be right here next to

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.440
the lactase gene ready to start transcription and turn

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.890
it on or off, and the mutation that controls lactase

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.525
expression. All the way down there where Lauren is

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:22.950
20,000 letters away is the mutation we've been talking about.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.770
&gt;&gt; I feel so far away from this gene. How in the world could

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.630
it be affecting it?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.000
&gt;&gt; I don't know. That's a really good

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.010
question. Why don't you think about it. How do

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.040
you think a letter, a change so far away

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.030
could affect transcription 20,000 letters away at the promoter.
