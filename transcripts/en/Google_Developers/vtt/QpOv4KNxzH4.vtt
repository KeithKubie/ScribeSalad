00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: Sure. I’m Matt Jones. I’m
vice president of Mobile Strategy and Operations

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.490
for Gannett.
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN TALLENT: I’m Stephen Tallent.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.810
I’m President and CTO of Mercury Intermedia.
&gt;&gt; So how did you two come to work together?

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.520
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: Well, we started working together,
I guess, last summer, and we hired Mercury

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.989
Intermedia to develop a native application
for iPhone for us that we launched in December.

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.090
And it’s been enormously successful; we’ve
been very, very pleased. And the next logical

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.321
extension for us, I think, was to move to
the Android platform.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.610
&gt;&gt; So this is for USA Today?
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: For USA Today, yes.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.520
&gt;&gt; So describe the application a bit so I
would understand what it does.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.150
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: Stephen?
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN TALLENT: The application is intended

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.850
to be a very good user experience representing
content that USA Today has, not only headlines

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.030
but also scores and weather, and lots of different
types of photography, and even some interactive

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.740
polls; snapshots where users can vote on a
variety of different currents--current-issue

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.270
type things, and then see the answers to those
polls broken down by state and city or county,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.099
that type of thing. To kind of see how people
in their area are responding to the same question.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.850
&gt;&gt; So you’re already supporting something
like this on iPhone. What made you want to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.600
support Android platforms as well?
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: I think there are a lot of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.560
really important strategic considerations
that went into deciding to build for Android.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.959
Personally, I think, Android holds a lot of
promise as a development platform for Mobile.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.639
I think we’re going to see a lot of growth
in the next, let’s say, six to 12 months

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:45.399
in terms of adoption both by end-users, by
carriers, you know, both here and North America

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.100
and also globally. And, I think it was an
important platform for USA Today to, you know,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.070
continue to innovate, continue to be a leader
in this industry; that was an important platform

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.070
for us to support.
&gt;&gt; So, as a developer when you’re building

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.639
the application, what kinds of features in
Android did you find in those [INDISTINCT]?

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:08.509
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN TALLENT: Already having the app
developed on the iPhone made this more of

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.330
a porting process. So we already knew the
features set. We already know how it needed

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.250
to work. I could really focus on how quickly
can we get it to this new platform and get

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.070
it out to the market. So, I was really interested
in productivity from my development team and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.580
getting it up to speed using XML for the layout
and a lot of the layout classes like the linear

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.140
layout and the relative layout. It really
sped us up as far as getting a faithful reproduction

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.971
of the app on a new platform really quickly.
It kept us really moving along and could move

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:40.130
to more testing as quickly as possible.
&gt;&gt; So in terms of meeting your clients’

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.740
needs for USA Today, how is Android for that?
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN TALLENT: It worked out really well,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.630
in fact, better than the original product
because USA Today has such a recognizable

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.190
visual to their brand, to the colors, the
boldness that needed to translate as [INDISTINCT]

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.050
as possible. So, finding appropriate styles
and themes that we can apply to buttons or

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.860
to lists or to check boxes that match to say
to the brand was really important to us. And,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.580
the way that Android allows the developers
to do the styles and themes made it really

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.610
quick and productive for us to then match
that brand which, of course, users instantly

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.030
recognize us, “Ah, this is USA Today Application,
it feels like USA Today” even though it’s

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.200
a very different form than the printed paper
they’re used to.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.280
&gt;&gt; That’s terrific. So how was, how was
iOpen for you? Have you learned anything in

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.810
the conference? Is there anything that particularly
still stay when you go back?

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.790
&gt;&gt; MATT JONES: iOpen has been really an interesting
experience for me. I don’t go to a lot of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.400
developer conferences. I’m not a, you know,
a developer or a programmer. So, you know,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.250
a lot of it is a little bit lost on me but,
you know, I pick up probably the key components

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.590
to it and, you know, I think it’s just been
really interesting for me to be inversed--to

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.251
be immersed in such an interesting development
environment with, you know, some of the things

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.761
that we see Google rolling out like the announcement
today around Wave. You know, I think, it’s

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:01.920
just really exciting. There’s a tremendous
amount of innovation going on, on the Internet.
