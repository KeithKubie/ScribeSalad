00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.678
I'd like to examine the security issues that arise in

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:06.580
object-oriented architectural styles.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.140
On the positive side, the encapsulation inherented in obj,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.090
inherent in object-oriented systems, can reduce vulnerability.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.870
Negatively, the many relatively small and independent objects increase system

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.140
fragmentation, thereby meaning many more possible points of infection.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.110
Moreover, the relatively unconstrained message passing paradigm can

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.310
ease the spreading of a problem throughout the system.
