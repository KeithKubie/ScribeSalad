00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.460
Let us look a little bit at the scaling of
one electrical,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.589
one piece of electrical apparatus.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.330
I don't want to spend a great deal of time
but a little time we can spend on this.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.930
Let us look a little bit at resistance measures
as a function of scale.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.040
I want to remind you of how resistance works
with scale.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.990
This simple operation of resistors. Here we
have these two electrodes,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.750
and I think we have a couple of people who
are going to work the circuits for us.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.160
Could we have a couple of volunteer circuits?
Thank you very much.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
It is worthwhile first bringing the two electrodes
together

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.559
to show people what zero resistance looks
like on the meter.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.960
Can you do that? Just touch them.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.140
And there the meter, way of here, shows zero
resistance,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.960
and now pull them apart but don't touch them.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.979
Now then they're way over at the other end,
that's almost an infinite resistance,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.170
nothing but the air and the dry wood between
them.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.289
So here is zero resistance, here is a very
high resistance.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.929
Now let's measure your circuit resistance
if we can.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.440
You'll want to wet your hands, I think it'll
help the contact

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.569
because it will make contact more uniform
if the hands are always wet.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:06.260
There's no, or only a tiny battery here, there's
no danger of any kind.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.520
I turn the scale.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.490
And therefore it's about, I read about four
on this scale

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.070
which is a good place to read it.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.600
Now let's try you.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.420
Very good.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.649
And again, not very different, about three.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.009
Slightly larger hands I believe and that makes
the difference.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.130
Now that's three and four. Suppose we make
the circuit go all the way through,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.310
what would you expect to get? The circuit
is being lengthened.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.399
So I think you'll add, first the one resistance
and then the other.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.790
These people are in series.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.030
Of course there's also a little extra contact
resistance

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.670
and the result indeed is about six or seven.
That's very good. That's similar to the sum.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.100
On the other hand let's make the two circuits.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.130
You will allow the circuit to travel, OK?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.130
And then you help her.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
See? Now the circuit is going through both
at once. Each one is helping.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770
The circuit has been widened instead of lengthened

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.700
if you like and now the result is less than
either one.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.759
It's well under two, as you see here on the
meter.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.020
Thank you very much.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.619
Good circuitry.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.630
So we see that the circuit works in that fashion.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.229
And now let me just describe the scaling a
little bit.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
So we get some numbers down.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.470
It's clear if I have a piece of wire like
that or a piece of wire like that.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.890
This is shorter than this.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.110
This resistance should be greater than this
resistance.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.190
So the resistance, in ohms say, is proportional
to the length of the circuit L.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.260
And if I double the length I would expect
to double the resistance,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.920
holding everything else equal.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530
That's what we learned from the series connection.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.890
But what about the other connection which
people call shunt or parallel?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920
Where both circuits work at once.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.590
That corresponds to putting another line here,
to widening it.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.650
And of course if I make it in proportion wider,
twice wider,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.310
I'd expect to get less resistance due to having
more available.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.030
And the less comes both because making it
wider this way,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.350
and also in three dimensions, making it wider
going in and out of the board.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.810
So two powers of L come from that.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.980
And that part goes like L squared.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.680
So the overall result is like one over L.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.370
The resistance, two similar resistors, will
have resistance

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.950
in the proportion one over their characteristic
size, a typical size.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.790
So a big resistor, a big piece of wire will
have a much smaller resistance

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.150
than a small piece of similar wire made by
one power of the size ratio.
