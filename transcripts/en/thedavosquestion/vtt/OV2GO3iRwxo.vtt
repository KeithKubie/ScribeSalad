00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
&gt;&gt; Good Morning, YouTubers. My name is John
Holmes and I'm responsible for coordinating

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.040
disaster relief in the world dealing with
the poorest and those suffering the most in

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.510
the world. My plea to people in countries
or companies or individuals, in particular

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.909
those who are here at Davos at the moment,
is when they are talking about the financial

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.570
crisis or the big political crises of the
world, to give a bit more thought to the effect

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.339
on the ground, in the real world, particularly
on the poorest in the world. Only a small

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.579
proportion on the resources that go into financial
issues, whether they've been lost or won,

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.219
the many billions we're talking about, only
a small proportion of those resources given

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.079
to those poorest in the world would make the
difference. Only a small proportion of thought

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.750
going to the effect on those people, not just
the poorest but also in developing counties

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.329
in general, could make a huge difference so
let's make a bit more of a connection between

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.859
those debates and the realities on the ground
and we have a mechanism to do that. For example,

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.140
through the Central Emergency Response Fund,
which is a UN fund, to help disaster relief.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.609
Any contributions are very welcome and gratefully
received.
