00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.850
 We saw in the previous video that things started 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.540
 Already looks bad 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.180
 In October 1789 we saw the march of women where 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.710
 Doubts began to grow that the royal authority was 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.690
 The grain is stored 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 So they went to Versailles and Aspen 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.530
 In Persia they forced the royal family, and forced Louis XVI 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.460
 Marie Antoinette to be back in Paris 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.710
 Then things went on in the heat. 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.030
 Many revolutions began 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.260
 The king did not know what to do. 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.270
 Of course he did not like the situation 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.020
 People's doubts grew in the king 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.640
 The nobles began to leave the country, they were emigrating 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.410
 Outside France. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.720
 But the King and the Queen have become suspicious that 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.860
 - What if the people have more radical ideas (extreme tendency towards radical change) 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 About that constitutional monarchy? 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.200
 Maybe we should also run away 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.220
 And so we saw in 1791 - and let me write all this on me 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.900
 Timetable. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.950
 We are now in the year 1791 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.000
 This is a review of the previous video 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.135
 In June, we saw the royal family try to escape 

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:09.070
 The royal family is trying to escape 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.280
 But were arrested in "Varnier" and returned 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.470
 To Paris to stay under 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.170
 House arrest in "Toliere" 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.375
 This building is here 

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.400
 No longer exists 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.380
 But if I went to Paris and visited the Louvre, I would 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.660
 You find that the Louvre has a gate open to a shell 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.520
 "Toliere Garden" 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.410
 This is the location of the building's site in the past 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.070
 The royal family ended up under house arrest in the " 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.220
 This was in June. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.230
 Then in July 1791, again a review of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.340
 Previous video 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 People said: Hey, they tried to escape and this is equal 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 To abdicate 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 They do not even want to be our property and our property and we do not 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 We need kings and queens from the ground up 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 Thus began the most radical elements, the most radical and leftist elements 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 And especially the "Yacoubi" group began in 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.115
 Preparation of petitions in "Champ de Mars" is mainly to make people say 

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:12.760
 We do not need the property anymore. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.860
 We need the republic only. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.550
 We need a state without kings and queens. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.610
 But then the National Assembly sent some armies. 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.490
 Conditions worsened. 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.630
 I threw stones and shot and 50 people died. 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.495
 This is what happened in what is known as the Champ de Mars massacre. 

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:37.260
 This is the time of the massacre of the Champ de Mars. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.840
 So things really started to get worse and the situation got worse. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
 And so we get to the end of 1791 but to make things turn 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.070
 Worse yet, we have not yet reached the real end. 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:58.530
 In August, it was the announcement of the "Belentiz" which 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.740
 As we have seen, the rulers of Austria and Prussia say 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.570
 They do not like what happens to 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.250
 The ruling class in France. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.330
 And for obvious reasons. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.020
 Well, first Leopold II was Marie Antoinette's brother. 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000
 But deeper, they did not like the idea that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.150
 People revolt against the ruling / royal class. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.010
 It is possible to give this ideas to the peoples the situation is repeated in 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.460
 Their empires and their country. 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.220
 Therefore, although the situation has not been taken seriously yet 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.920
 These young people have made this declaration. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.440
 This made people in France more skeptical. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.580
 And now, while all this was happening, you may have remembered 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.990
 "The right of the tennis court" was signed 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.800
 Several years ago. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.320
 Where they said we are preparing a constitution. 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.660
 Thus a constitution has already been drafted. 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.880
 Thus in 1791, the National Assembly or Assembly 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:01.010
 Legislative provisions of the 1971 Constitution 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.820
 Established for France as a constitutional monarchy 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.480
 And so they said: Well, we will continue to rule a king. 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.870
 But it will only be a symbolic form. 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.910
 And not necessarily a person who can make laws. 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.050
 The National Assembly will be responsible for this. 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.410
 The MEC will have few powers to challenge legislation 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.920
 And so on. 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.795
 But most of his powers will be removed. 

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.810
 This was the constitutional monarchy. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:35.990
 Constitutional Monarchy 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.400
 Is really on the same line as what was already happening 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.360
 In Britain. 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.610
 But at some levels this is a great achievement. 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.610
 They had this oath "oath" to put the Constitution. 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.300
 But on another level, things were getting worse 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.800
 In France and in Paris in particular. 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 The revolution was completely focused on what was happening 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970
 In Paris and Versailles. 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.370
 The situation was so bad that it looked like it was 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.190
 Side view. 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
 To a certain extent revolutionaries have gone 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.690
 Beyond the desire for constitutional monarchy only. 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.930
 They began to think they needed a republic. 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.530
 We saw this during the massacre of the Champ de Mars, 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.470
 People have already started to sign me 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.240
 Establishment of a Republic. 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.820
 Then he started shooting at them, which probably drove them more to desire 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.020
 In a republican system. 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.660
 You may remember something else from the video 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.620
 First, the thing that hastened 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.460
 The revolution is complete. 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.750
 Or at least in my opinion, one of the most important reasons 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.180
 In fueling the revolution is 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.345
 That France was bankrupt. 

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:37.730
 And people were hungry. 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.950
 I keep this situation all the time where it was all 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.800
 Politicians, revolutionaries and monarchists 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.240
 They move and try somehow 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.040
 Develop a strategy to strengthen their position. 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.110
 No one has solved any of these 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.020
 Problems all this time .. 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.460
 There is no money in France. 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.740
 There is famine, people are hungry. 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.010
 And so we will find almost everyone, whether you look at Louis XVI 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.660
 And let me look at him again, it's nice to remember how he was 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.420
 sound. 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.340
 Whether you are talking about Louis XVI and who is now under 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.480
 Mortgages are house arrest, or you are talking about a lot of 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.040
 The revolutionaries, everyone began to say: God damn how we can 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.890
 To solve that problem? 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.500
 People will send us out if we do not solve 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.470
 The problem of hunger and bankruptcy. 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.500
 As you will see through history more than once, the best solution 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.240
 For this, or what he thinks is the best solution 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.620
 Is the declaration of war. 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.790
 And so they declared war on Austria. 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.380
 If we look at the subject from the point of view of Louis XVI, we find it 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.660
 Think about it as a winner anyway. 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.530
 If the war succeeds after he has put his weight on 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.450
 This war. 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.480
 And this happened - let me write the dates. 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.640
 This always helps me to frame what happened. 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.110
 This was near the end of 1791, and the war was declared 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.860
 In April this was in 1792. 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.670
 Order was here in April. 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.700
 And if we think about the subject at least from a point of view 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.120
 Louis XVI We already found a successful project. 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.630
 If they win the war, this will make him loved 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.380
 More and perhaps more powerful. 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.890
 They may have plundered the country's wealth 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.000
 To help build the cupboard of France. 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.260
 If the situation worsens in the war and France is defeated, what? 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.860
 Will happen? 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.110
 Then Austria and often peoples 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.940
 Which fights against you 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.840
 We will soon realize that France will fight with 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.580
 Most strong European. 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.890
 But if the war is lost, it is those who rule 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.160
 Kings will be rid of 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.640
 The revolutionaries may be Louis XVI's return to power. 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.220
 So it is a good idea from Louis XVI's point of view. 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.380
 For many revolutionaries, they wanted 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.570
 To solve these problems. So they said: Yes, it will be 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.630
 A good chance if we could plunder another country. 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.710
 If we can steal again from other countries to become 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.310
 France at least less hungry. 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.390
 And perhaps we can also spread the revolution. 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.510
 We can get rid of all other kings. 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.225
 This will not be just a French revolution 

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:05.210
 A complete European revolution. 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.120
 Thus the war was declared against Austria. 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.150
 Very quickly, they tried to attack Austria 

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.140
 And Holland which were somehow part 

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.410
 From Austria. 

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.240
 And so they attacked here the Austrian Hollandi. 

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.230
 But they sort of fell into a quagmire there. 

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.200
 The attack was not as successful as they expected it to be. 

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.310
 And Prussia which as you remember was involved 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.470
 In the "Belenitz Declaration" decided to participate in 

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.830
 War alongside Austria. 

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.289
 Thus, Russia attacked an initial attack 

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:38.850
 Very successful. 

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.679
 And was able to move towards France 

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.650
 Then the general in charge of the Prussian army, Duke 

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:54.110
 Brunswick announced the Brunswick statement 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.360
 Let me write this 

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:03.110
 Statement by Brunswick 

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.020
 Which basically corresponds to the Billents statement 

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.500
 But his successor is a bigger force now 

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.960
 Because this man, Duke Brunswick in fact 

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.820
 He has an army invading France 

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.320
 He declares his statement, which he says he intends 

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.810
 To get rid of this revolutionary government 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.710
 It installs the power of the machine again 

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.195
 Prove the king 

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.020
 All this happened in April 1792 

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.440
 The war against Austria was a successful decision in all cases for the king 

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.760
 The rebels wanted to spread the revolution 

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.250
 And looting of other countries 

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.640
 Then, immediately in Russia, they began attacking France 

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.790
 And says it will restore the king's authority 

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.640
 You can imagine now that this happened to the rebels 

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.970
 He made them more suspicious of the King's intentions 

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.920
 I thought that the king held a kind of secret agreement with 

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.100
 Prussian, or with other enemies are 

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.240
 They stand against them. Thus in August 1792, the 

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.090
 Within a few months, 5 or 6 months later 

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.980
 In August 1792, you basically had 

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.420
 Municipality of Paris 

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.790
 When I say the municipality of Paris, in fact it is 

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.590
 Government of Paris at this time 

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.140
 It was also controlled by radical revolutionaries 

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.650
 Mostly "Jacobites" 

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.190
 They broke into the royal residence 

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:31.550
 Eultoleris 

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.950
 This painting here is conceived 

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.930
 The rebels, mostly Jacobites, who really 

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.200
 They broke into the tolieres 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.600
 They imprisoned Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.790
 Because they thought, Well Belarus has an army 

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.630
 Announced its intention to help the King regain his authority 

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.090
 We will jail the king because we do not know 

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.740
 What he intends! 

00:10:51.740 --> 00:11:04.742
 They were imprisoned at King Louis XVI 

00:11:04.742 --> 00:11:07.480
 And Marie Antoinette 

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.380
 They also managed some intrigues inside 

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.000
 National Assembly 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.970
 There is actually a kefal session of the association 

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.800
 Nationalism, which means that a lot of 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.170
 The opponents were not there 

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.720
 Accordingly, there was a meeting of the leftists, 

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.100
 Radicals, and Jacobites. 

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:31.200
 Thus in August and at the Kefal meeting, the Assembly announced 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.450
 For the Republic 

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.630
 As if declaring that Louis XVI 

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.930
 No longer a king. 

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.530
 This is the nation or the state that we have now 

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.510
 Not governed by and will not be ruled by a king 

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.590
 It's now a republic 

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.990
 It is a government without a king 

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.450
 And while all this was happening, we have these 

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.640
 Gangs roam around the area around Paris 

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.240
 They try and kill people who appear 

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.820
 They are skeptical, or they are allied with 

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.650
 Nobles or kings, or appear to have signs of royal support 

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.340
 Or even want to return the property! 

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.400
 In the midst of these riots and arbitrary executions 

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.020
 The gangs killed at least 1,400 people 

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.910
 1400 were executed at this time 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.880
 As you can see, the situation has become even uglier 

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.945
 And in more and more stalemate 

00:12:22.945 --> 00:12:24.220
 The king is imprisoned 

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.430
 And you will see it will not take 

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.140
 Long prison 

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.910
 But the end will not be good for him 

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.030
 Basically, the rebels have said 

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.590
 That France is now a republic 

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.110
 All this has been done and the state is at war with two superpowers, with 

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.920
 Austria and Prussia 

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:45.950
 And now they can stop, and when they say 

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.740
 I'm talking about the French army 

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.890
 Eventually they are able to repel 

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.590
 Invasion of the Prussian army 

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.230
 And this situation they call the Valmy predicament, it is not clear who won! 

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.960
 The Prussians were not eager to enter France 

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.190
 So the Prussians did not press much for sending more armies 

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.480
 Therefore - at least - temporarily external threat 

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.130
 Disintegration, if we want to half the status quo 

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.270
 The National Assembly went ahead and announced that they were 

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.430
 Get rid of - I mean, they already declared the republic 

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.100
 But they are more extinct 

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:24.890
 If we are now in September 1792 

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.480
 We have a truce in Valme 

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:34.970
 Download Download 

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.700
 And then the National Assembly or 

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.010
 National Conference, they decided they would write 

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.780
 A new constitution 

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.440
 Thus the Constitution proclaimed in 1791 is no longer recognized 

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.900
 It lasted only for a year. 

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.840
 Now a new constitution 

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.740
 The intention is to write a new constitution 

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:00.480
 Now, during all this, all the wasted blood 

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.740
 After the imprisonment of Louis XVI, and the riots 

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.320
 Throughout Paris, arbitrary killing, this only 

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.550
 Foreshadowing many unfortunate events that will occur in the future 

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.410
 But in the coming year 

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:16.940
 By 1793 - let me write this in red 

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.990
 If we are now in 1739 

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.760
 And the National Assembly, the first thing they did was, or 

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.650
 Maybe I should be more precise 

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:35.480
 In January 1793, they remembered they had already been put 

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.080
 King, put him in prison, they are in war 

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.410
 With countries that have declared their goal 

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.460
 In the restoration of the King's power 

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:51.210
 The first thing they did was to execute King Louis XVI 

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.950
 This is the picture of execution 

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.820
 He was executed with a guillotine 

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.810
 And here's the guillotine doctor 

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.160
 It was actually chosen, here it is 

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:08.430
 Guillotine, has been invented to be used 

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.690
 In the execution of people in a humane manner 

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.310
 At that time, when people are killed, it is not the goal 

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.750
 They felt pain, only the aim was to execute them. 

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.270
 So we will use this so-called human machine 

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:20.800
 Guillotine 

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.710
 Which we use a very square blade to cut 

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.720
 Someone's head 

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.010
 It was invented by this doctor who stands here 

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.430
 But the first to try it out of the VIPs 

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.560
 Louis XVI, was executed by Guillotine in January 

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.970
 And from February, remember that people are still hungry 

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.920
 They are still eager to spread the revolution, they are still 

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.400
 They want to plunder the rest of the countries 

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.840
 Thus in February, the National Assembly, or the Council 

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.650
 National, Government of Revolution, declared war on 

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.905
 Britain and the Republic of the Netherlands 

00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:06.530
 - 

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.570
 You do not know from this, I will 

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.200
 Tell you later 

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.145
 And the Netherlands 

00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:15.730
 Perhaps now you are wondering, how is this France 

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.930
 One state here, you will be able to wage war on 

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.460
 Austria and Prussia? 

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.740
 Now the war is being declared against the Dutch and Great Britain 

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.150
 The previous month Asania and Portugal also did 

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.770
 Declaring war and allied with 

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.540
 Austria and Prussia 

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.930
 So how this country only, France, how to these 

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.500
 The revolutionary government has to support itself in the face of armies 

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.380
 Of many nations? 

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.250
 The answer to this question is that the revolutionary government 

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.360
 Announced in February what they called collective duds 

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.965
 I'm not French and I seem to say it wrong I'm sure. 

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:54.070
 Collective dams 

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.160
 It is basically the first version of what we know now 

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.450
 The name of the draft 

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.620
 They were able to impose the following 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.190
 Every young Frenchman has not married and is well 

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.710
 He will be a conscript in the army 

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.160
 And thus were able to immediately raise 

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.400
 The numbers of recruits for hundreds of thousands 

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.869
 Within two years he was 

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.410
 The number of recruits, according to several documented sources, amounted to one million 

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.550
 Or more of the soldiers 

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.220
 This is different from what you are doing 

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.730
 Kingdoms to develop the numbers of their armies 

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.819
 They pay salaries to professional recruits 

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.410
 Thus these kingdoms were small armies compared 

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.490
 In France and the revolutionary government in the collection of soldiers 

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.680
 The government said, Well this is a government of the people 

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.560
 It is the people 

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.180
 So now you are not fighting for a king, you 

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.860
 You fight for yourselves 

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.200
 You are fighting for your representation, so no 

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.100
 You return to the control of foreign kings 

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.050
 Thus all the French joined the army of their state 

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.220
 Thus France now has the largest army in Europe 

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.510
 But I repeat that all this happens within a framework 

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.440
 Riots and instability throughout France 

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.640
 There are the kings who are fighting 

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.500
 The revolutionaries 

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.780
 People are still hungry 

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.990
 As a kind of tightening I think, in April 

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:16.580
 1792 National Assembly established a committee 

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.020
 Public Security, which looks like a very nice commission 

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:26.020
 Committee on Public Security 

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.920
 This committee has become the virtual government, or 

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.100
 We can tell the de facto government 

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.640
 She was under the management of this good-looking man 

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.610
 This is here, Maximilian Robesbury 

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.390
 He looks like a civilized man 

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:50.840
 Maximilian Robesbury 

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.530
 But in fact, what the General Security Committee was going through was uncertainty 

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.510
 Great suspicion and uncertainty 

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.010
 Especially under the administration of Maximilian Robesbury 

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.460
 Which was very suspicious of all 

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.290
 Just doubt that someone is not radical enough 

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.360
 Or someone who did not like him, or someone 

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.760
 May help bring him down from the administration of the committee - give orders 

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.190
 To be executed with a guillotine 

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.695
 This was actually the beginning of the period of terror 

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:27.110
 The era of terrorism 

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:33.910
 Almost over the next year, on different orders, what to do 

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.960
 16,000 men were executed with guillotine 

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.350
 They were killed by Dr. Glutani's invention 

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.520
 These are just estimates of murder 

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.750
 There is no documentation for this 

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.100
 But it is believed that nearly 40,000 were done 

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.330
 Execution 

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.550
 This essentially means that their job is: You are guilty of this, and we know you are 

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.260
 Guilty, yes, you soldier, kill him! 

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.230
 - 

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.190
 So these times were really bloody times. 

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.150
 Imagine that all this was happening in 

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.060
 Paris and its suburbs 

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.950
 And suddenly in one basic city 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.940
 There are tens of thousands of people 

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.480
 Slaughtered, only if this man - Maximilian - or from 

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.640
 Working with him or even those who work with them 

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.650
 I think you are not revolutionary enough 

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.950
 Or your allegiance to the revolution is unconvincing 

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.220
 Now in the end people doubt the 

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.540
 Maximilian Robesbury 

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.950
 They began to believe that all this uncertainty would hurt the revolution 

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.340
 More than to help her 

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.720
 And then in a thermodynamic reflex - it seems to be so 

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.580
 Type of refrigerator or heater 

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:44.510
 Thermodynamic reaction 

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:54.330
 Now this is here, this in July 1794 

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.900
 This is called a thermodynamic apostasy, and I am 

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.830
 I may record a full video about it, because 

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.830
 The revolutionary government is a fact 

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.220
 A new calendar has been created 

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.140
 Where one month was renamed Thermidor, which was 

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.490
 Which was basically July was moved a bit 

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.660
 As well as changing the number of hours per day 

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.040
 They had 10 hours a day, 100 minutes an hour 

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.010
 100 seconds per minute 

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.800
 They have a week of 10 days each month 

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.980
 Yes it's a full calendar 

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.100
 But Thermidor was July 

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.430
 The fact was the July Revolution, when people 

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.420
 They were overwhelmed by Maximilian's actions 

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:31.190
 If in 1794 July 1794 is also 

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.120
 - you do it back on you - 

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.630
 Here, in July 1794 

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.720
 Here's this good-looking guy 

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.330
 He was executed with a guillotine. 

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.010
 Now there are two things I would like to point out 

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.160
 I'll go back a little to 1793 

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.290
 Perhaps as a kind of observation 

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:59.170
 We saw that in January Louis XVI was executed 

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.530
 And the opinion is back to you whether it is 

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.730
 The decision to execute him well or bad 

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:08.640
 Marie Antoinette was also executed in October. 

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.330
 Marie Antoinette 

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.800
 She was also executed, and this was in 1793 

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.670
 9 months after the execution of her husband 

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.520
 And as a small note in this paragraph as 

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.890
 You can imagine that all regions of France were unstable and unstable 

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.930
 Then in 1793 there was a rebellion. 

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.730
 This was in July 1793. 

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.450
 So it is a year before the end of the reign of terror, really 

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.460
 During the "era of terrorism" 

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.170
 And in the port of Toulon there was a rebellion against 

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.560
 The government is revolutionary. 

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.160
 They were thwarted with help 

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.070
 Captain Artillery 

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.710
 The artillery captain is the person in charge 

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.220
 Attack using guns 

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.670
 And this artillery captain who helped suppress 

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.970
 Rebellion, attributed to him, I think 

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.640
 In the revolutionary government - I need to write it down 

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.750
 Somewhere in preparation 

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:15.550
 For the next duo - if in July 1739 in Toulon 

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.740
 The new artillery captain seemed to know 

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.640
 what's he doing 

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:25.400
 His name was Napoleon Bonaparte 

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.670
 And we will talk about it a lot in the next video.
