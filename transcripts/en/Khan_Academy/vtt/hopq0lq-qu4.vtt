00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:01.999
- [Voiceover] Welcome to the Khan Academy.

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.646
The goal of this video is to show you

00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.492
all the different things
that Khan Academy has.

00:00:06.492 --> 00:00:08.299
It has videos, it has exercises,

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.621
it has an adaptive,
super, I guess you could

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:14.841
call it robot tutor
thing that will guide you

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.066
through content and
make sure you master it.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.684
So let's just take each
of those one by one.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:21.634
Many of y'all are probably
coming to this saying,

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:24.522
"Hey, I have an exam tomorrow on DNA," or

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.746
"I didn't understand quite
what's happening in class."

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:29.151
There the best thing to do might just be

00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:31.617
go to the search bar,
let me make sure you can

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:34.769
see the search bar, to
go to the search bar

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.650
and you could search for DNA.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:39.862
When you do that you see your first choice

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:41.545
right over is a DNA video.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:44.180
This is actually the main video on DNA

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.776
and which you could start watching.

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:48.124
Or if you look to the
right right over here,

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:50.876
you see that there's
all other related videos

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:53.594
under heredity and genetics.

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:55.125
Then you can start browsing from there.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.845
You could say, "Okay,
let me back up a second.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.291
"Let me go back to just all of biology."

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.976
I can see all of the sections are there.

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:02.489
Similarly, you might wanna search

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.185
for something in mathematics.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:06.675
You might wanna say,
"Oh, I have a question

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:07.999
"about quadratics."

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.722
Quadratics.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.128
I'm gonna do a search there.

00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:12.773
Okay, well let's see, there's something

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.567
about using the quadratic formula,

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:16.652
factoring quadratics 2.

00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:19.039
I don't know which of
these is right for me,

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.855
so let me just go into one of these

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.844
and start getting a little bit of context.

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:28.315
You see that what I
actually just clicked on

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:30.268
is actually an exercise that gets me

00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:32.554
to solve quadratics by factoring two.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.095
I need to write my answer here.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.401
If I don't know the answer,
I have a bunch of hints.

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.436
If this all looks like Greek to me,

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:42.397
I can click on a video

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:45.137
that solves a very similar problem.

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:47.859
Or I might hey, this isn't
what I was looking for.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.995
But look over here, they're solving

00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:51.553
a quadratic equation by factoring.

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:53.132
Factoring quadratic equations.

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:54.625
Maybe this is what I need to learn.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.785
Or maybe I'm not even
thinking about this stuff,

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:59.051
so let me just move up a level

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.109
to quadratic equations.

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:03.430
Now I can see the whole topic here.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.636
Solving quadratics by taking square root.

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:07.644
Solving quadratics by factoring.

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.233
Completing the square,
the quadratic formula.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.782
Quadratic equation, graphing quadratics.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.906
In general if you just wanna browse,

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.311
you say "Let me just see all the subjects

00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:17.669
"that are available on Khan Academy."

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.360
You can go this drop-down right over here.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.079
This starts to give you
a sense of the breadth

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.874
of the content on Khan Academy.

00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:26.436
Just in math, each of
these is an entire subject.

00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.148
K-2nd math, you have pre-calculus,

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:33.170
goes all the way up to
multivariable calculus,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.324
intergal calculus.

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:36.960
If I were to click on
any one of these things,

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:42.682
it's going to take me into
something called a mission.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:46.109
A mission is going to give
me a set of exercises.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.504
We call this right over
here the mission warm-up.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.635
Based on how I perform on
these calculus questions,

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:54.653
the system is starting to get a sense

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:57.485
of what I know and don't
know and it will use that

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.194
to give me guided practice
so I can learn more

00:03:00.194 --> 00:03:01.690
and more and more calculus.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.381
Eventually mastering calculus.

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:04.909
At any point if I have difficulty,

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.766
there's always videos
here that will help me

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:09.075
understand the actual calculus.

00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:12.406
Once I'm done with that, I
will go to this dashboard

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:14.451
and it'll just tell me
about how much have I

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:17.187
progressed in integral
calculus, what have I mastered,

00:03:17.187 --> 00:03:18.736
what have I not practiced yet,

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.620
what are my different badges.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.348
If you do not wanna move immediately

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:24.104
into this mission world and you wanna say

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.272
what does Khan Academy have when it comes

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.466
to calculus in an unguided way,

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:30.420
that's where you go view full list

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.268
of integral calculus content.

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.211
Then you will go to this page,

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.919
where you see the breadth and scope

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.468
of the integral content.

00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:38.774
Integrals, integration techniques,

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.332
integration applications,
sequences and series,

00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:43.588
AP calculus practice problems.

00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:45.762
If you click there, you see the different

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.373
tutorials within, indefinite integrals

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.340
as anti-derivative, area
under a rate function

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.412
as net change.

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:53.750
Hopefully that gives you sense of things.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.372
We don't just have math and we don't just

00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:57.766
have science, we have whole section here

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:00.690
on computer programming,
which is tons of fun

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.895
where you can write your
own computer program.

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:07.766
I'm using my son's account right now.

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:10.971
This is a computer program that we wrote.

00:04:11.363 --> 00:04:12.757
This right here is a computer program

00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:14.894
that we wrote together the other day.

00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:18.227
It was good father/son bonding time.

00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:20.810
And we have things in
the arts and humanities,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.034
like history and art history,

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:25.655
which is also very, very, very exciting.

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:27.580
And we have partner content.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.601
We have partner content from the likes of

00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:34.419
The Museum of Modern Art, Explortorium,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.778
JP Getty Museum, The British Museums.

00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:37.920
So a lot of stuff here.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.008
Hopefully this video gives you a flavor

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:43.199
of the different ways
you can use Khan Academy.
