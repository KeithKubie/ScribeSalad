Hi I’m Kamina Vincent, and I am the producer

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.320
at Mountains Studio

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.960
based in Melbourne, Australia.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.620
For me, this program has been very eye opening.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.960
And seeing how other countries

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
are making games and collaborating

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.720
has been really great.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.960
I think for me, this program is really important

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.480
because it does bring very different teams together

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.560
and people can share what they’ve learnt

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.400
and help build each other up.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.760
It’s great to see this support network

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.240
that has been built here.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.320
I would highly recommend this

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040
accelerator program to indie developers.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.000
What you get from something like this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is knowledge that you just can’t pick up on your own.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.160
It’s accelerated,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.360
you get a vast amount of information all at once.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
You get access to other developers,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.600
you build a community and a network around you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
that you can then lean on,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
and I feel that’s one of the biggest things

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400
that we need in game development.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
it’s this sharing and support

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.760
and this is the program that really does fast track that.
