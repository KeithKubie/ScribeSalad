00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.380
for you to solve every day
problem in simple and powerful

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.780
ways as well as create entirely
new products using technologies

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.670
like machine learning and VR
and voice enabled interaction.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.130
BRAD ADAMS: Your apps are now
available to Google Assistant

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.330

You will be able to build apps
for entirely new assistive use

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:37.286 --> 00:00:41.010

ELLIE POWERS: We are
opening up Android Instant

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.350
Apps to all Android developers.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.382
This means anyone can now build
and publish an instant app.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:53.400
FEI-FEI LI: AI is transforming
everything Google does.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.270

continuing the evolution

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.939
by bringing new, high level
APIs in TensorFlow 1.2.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.730

modern mobile web also

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.810
allows developers to build
deep, rich mobile experiences

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.030

call Progressive Web Apps.

to be the best place for you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.030

Freeing your energies to focus
on making your app awesome,

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.340
