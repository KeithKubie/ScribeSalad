next step which we're gonna check out
 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.210
next step which we're gonna check out
and they see not just remind frequent

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220
and they see not just remind frequent
 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.529
and they see not just remind frequent
viewers that this is a little bit of

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539
viewers that this is a little bit of
 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.950
viewers that this is a little bit of
different we we felt like it might be

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960
different we we felt like it might be
 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.080
different we we felt like it might be
more interesting to go over all the apps

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090
more interesting to go over all the apps
 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.879
more interesting to go over all the apps
really quickly and then start talking

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889
really quickly and then start talking
 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.909
really quickly and then start talking
about their their deeper flaws in today

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919
about their their deeper flaws in today
 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.020
about their their deeper flaws in today
so we're going to go through spend about

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030
so we're going to go through spend about
 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.159
so we're going to go through spend about
two minutes on each of the apps that

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169
two minutes on each of the apps that
 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.779
two minutes on each of the apps that
we're going to look at checkout what

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789
we're going to look at checkout what
 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.270
we're going to look at checkout what
they do is sort of a functional review I

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280
they do is sort of a functional review I
 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.920
they do is sort of a functional review I
suppose with a little bit of commentary

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:46.930
suppose with a little bit of commentary
 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.600
suppose with a little bit of commentary
on how they've done those things and

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.610
on how they've done those things and
 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.890
on how they've done those things and
then we're going to spend more time

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900
then we're going to spend more time
 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.600
then we're going to spend more time
towards the end comparing and

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.610
towards the end comparing and
 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.890
towards the end comparing and
contrasting seeing what they did right

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:52.900
contrasting seeing what they did right
 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.330
contrasting seeing what they did right
what they did wrong and what we think

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.340
what they did wrong and what we think
 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.279
what they did wrong and what we think
would make sort of the ultimate transit

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.289
would make sort of the ultimate transit
 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.710
would make sort of the ultimate transit
app absolutely all of the stuff that

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720
app absolutely all of the stuff that
 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.210
app absolutely all of the stuff that
used to seeing will come just later

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.220
used to seeing will come just later
 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.189
used to seeing will come just later
hopefully that will encourage people to

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199
hopefully that will encourage people to
 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.620
hopefully that will encourage people to
stay and work for longer but it could

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:04.630
stay and work for longer but it could
 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.969
stay and work for longer but it could
also mean that they get bored and some

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:17.289
sorry this is the one that I did look at
 

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:18.990
sorry this is the one that I did look at
I'm more interested in seeing one yeah

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000
I'm more interested in seeing one yeah
 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.459
I'm more interested in seeing one yeah
so this was this was an interesting one

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:20.469
so this was this was an interesting one
 

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:22.589
so this was this was an interesting one
for me although I seem to have the the

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599
for me although I seem to have the the
 

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:24.600
for me although I seem to have the the
wrong label up on the screen so there we

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.610
wrong label up on the screen so there we
 

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.020

go in parking perfect so it took me a

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.030
go in parking perfect so it took me a
 

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.370
go in parking perfect so it took me a
little while to figure out exactly what

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.380
little while to figure out exactly what
 

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.379
little while to figure out exactly what
this app did which is probably my

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:31.389
this app did which is probably my
 

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:33.269
this app did which is probably my
biggest complaint you know I'm a big fan

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279
biggest complaint you know I'm a big fan
 

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.040
biggest complaint you know I'm a big fan
of having apps which as soon as you load

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.050
of having apps which as soon as you load
 

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.630
of having apps which as soon as you load
them up it's pretty obvious what this

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640
them up it's pretty obvious what this
 

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.000
them up it's pretty obvious what this
does how this is going to help you so I

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.010
does how this is going to help you so I
 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.159
does how this is going to help you so I
kind of based on the name expected it to

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.169
kind of based on the name expected it to
 

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.860
kind of based on the name expected it to
help me find where i parked or something

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:43.870
help me find where i parked or something
 

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.290
help me find where i parked or something
similar turns out what it is of what I

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:46.300
similar turns out what it is of what I
 

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.380
similar turns out what it is of what I
think it is is a way to automate the

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.390
think it is is a way to automate the
 

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.449
think it is is a way to automate the
payment of parking so we have like

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:51.459
payment of parking so we have like
 

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:54.449
payment of parking so we have like
sms-based parking payment this app will

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:54.459
sms-based parking payment this app will
 

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.040
sms-based parking payment this app will
help you do that by automating the

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.050
help you do that by automating the
 

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.480
help you do that by automating the
process for you I think

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:58.490
process for you I think
 

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.620
process for you I think
which is where it gets a little

00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.630
which is where it gets a little
 

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.880
which is where it gets a little
complicated so this is basically the

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:00.890
complicated so this is basically the
 

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.320
complicated so this is basically the
screen when you get when you first start

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.330
screen when you get when you first start
 

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.110
screen when you get when you first start
up only this is empty and so then you

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120
up only this is empty and so then you
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.970
up only this is empty and so then you
can go when you click that and if it

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:06.980
can go when you click that and if it
 

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.000
can go when you click that and if it
what it lets you do is add your car

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.010
what it lets you do is add your car
 

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.380
what it lets you do is add your car
registration in the country which are

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:11.390
registration in the country which are
 

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.579
registration in the country which are
belongs to so it's just okay that's a

00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:15.589
belongs to so it's just okay that's a
 

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:18.220
belongs to so it's just okay that's a
registration number country now again

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.230
registration number country now again
 

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.780
registration number country now again
this was kind of confusing because I

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:19.790
this was kind of confusing because I
 

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.490
this was kind of confusing because I
just put in us a bug her the Save button

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.500
just put in us a bug her the Save button
 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.550
just put in us a bug her the Save button
appears is still great out and I felt do

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560
appears is still great out and I felt do
 

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.290
appears is still great out and I felt do
anything there we don't even like save

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:29.300
anything there we don't even like save
 

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.120
anything there we don't even like save
buttons well indeed so I thought well

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.130
buttons well indeed so I thought well
 

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.400
buttons well indeed so I thought well
maybe it's just a legacy save button

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.410
maybe it's just a legacy save button
 

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.220
maybe it's just a legacy save button
which does nothing and if I hit back but

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.230
which does nothing and if I hit back but
 

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.139
which does nothing and if I hit back but
it hasn't actually saved what I've done

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:38.149
it hasn't actually saved what I've done
 

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:40.269
it hasn't actually saved what I've done
so that's that's confusing so I go back

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279
so that's that's confusing so I go back
 

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.639
so that's that's confusing so I go back
in put my registration number hit

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:42.649
in put my registration number hit
 

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:46.060
in put my registration number hit
country again and now if I slowly start

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.070
country again and now if I slowly start
 

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.870

typing United then I get the list and

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880
typing United then I get the list and
 

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.519
typing United then I get the list and
then once I've got something standard

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:51.529
then once I've got something standard
 

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:54.010
then once I've got something standard
then i can hit save and it all works

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.020
then i can hit save and it all works
 

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.130
then i can hit save and it all works
kind of how you'd expect hmm ok only not

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
kind of how you'd expect hmm ok only not
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.660
kind of how you'd expect hmm ok only not
really that intuitive so it took me a

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.670
really that intuitive so it took me a
 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.269
really that intuitive so it took me a
little while to figure out that workflow

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279
little while to figure out that workflow
 

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.230
little while to figure out that workflow
so you can take this and then that's

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240
so you can take this and then that's
 

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.420
so you can take this and then that's
going to be the default or the currently

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.430
going to be the default or the currently
 

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.389
going to be the default or the currently
selected car effectively so that's all

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399
selected car effectively so that's all
 

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.579
selected car effectively so that's all
that's all fair enough but then I do

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:09.589
that's all fair enough but then I do
 

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:11.170
that's all fair enough but then I do
like the size of those touch targets by

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.180

biggest fan the biggest point of
happiness I guess using this happy that

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640
happiness I guess using this happy that
 

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.490

everything is big this could actually be

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.500
everything is big this could actually be
 

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.530
everything is big this could actually be
bigger but still it's nice big targets

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:20.540
bigger but still it's nice big targets
 

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.269

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:47.900
this it's it does i'm actually kind of a
 

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.420
this it's it does i'm actually kind of a
wondering if i should take this off of

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.430
wondering if i should take this off of
 

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.840
wondering if i should take this off of
Wi-Fi um but yeah so it'll it'll show me

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:52.850
Wi-Fi um but yeah so it'll it'll show me
 

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.490
Wi-Fi um but yeah so it'll it'll show me
which which stops are near me and then

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:57.500
which which stops are near me and then
 

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.410
which which stops are near me and then
it'll show me what the route is for that

00:13:59.410 --> 00:13:59.420
it'll show me what the route is for that
 

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.210
it'll show me what the route is for that
stop and i am going to turn off Wi-Fi

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.220
stop and i am going to turn off Wi-Fi
 

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.760
stop and i am going to turn off Wi-Fi
because i think our our google Wi-Fi

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:03.770
because i think our our google Wi-Fi
 

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:16.730
because i think our our google Wi-Fi
here is just getting really crowded

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740
 

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.210
okay so it'll show me that it'll show me

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220
okay so it'll show me that it'll show me
 

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.889
okay so it'll show me that it'll show me
the route it doesn't appear to be

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899
the route it doesn't appear to be
 

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:27.079
the route it doesn't appear to be
showing me just really give me the

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:27.089
showing me just really give me the
 

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:28.670
showing me just really give me the
information here yes I don't know what

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680
information here yes I don't know what
 

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.040
information here yes I don't know what
the 56 must be the it's like the number

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.050
the 56 must be the it's like the number
 

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.269
the 56 must be the it's like the number
of the trip oh that's right yeah I mean

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279
of the trip oh that's right yeah I mean
 

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:34.280
of the trip oh that's right yeah I mean
it certainly tells me that if I go to

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.290
it certainly tells me that if I go to
 

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.460
it certainly tells me that if I go to
the stop I I can Oh Steph to sculpt

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:37.470
the stop I I can Oh Steph to sculpt
 

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.260
the stop I I can Oh Steph to sculpt
number so we're going to stop 56 then I

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.270
number so we're going to stop 56 then I
 

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.650
number so we're going to stop 56 then I
can get the 1242 or 72 okay well that's

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660
can get the 1242 or 72 okay well that's
 

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.300
can get the 1242 or 72 okay well that's
what I was wondering it the other way

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.310
what I was wondering it the other way
 

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.980
what I was wondering it the other way
you could interpret this is that I can

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:45.990
you could interpret this is that I can
 

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.650
you could interpret this is that I can
catch the 56 at executive park and I

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660
catch the 56 at executive park and I
 

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.480
catch the 56 at executive park and I
would be able to transfer to these three

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.490
would be able to transfer to these three
 

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.090
would be able to transfer to these three
lines I'm not really certain I'd single

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100
lines I'm not really certain I'd single
 

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.310
lines I'm not really certain I'd single
summer I think I I agree with you more

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320
summer I think I I agree with you more
 

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.920
summer I think I I agree with you more
except it doesn't seem like 56 could

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:57.930
except it doesn't seem like 56 could
 

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.000
except it doesn't seem like 56 could
possibly be the stock number right hmm

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.010
possibly be the stock number right hmm
 

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.910
possibly be the stock number right hmm
or maybe these well okay so maybe these

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920
or maybe these well okay so maybe these
 

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.769
or maybe these well okay so maybe these
are okay I think it's just the stump

00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779
are okay I think it's just the stump
 

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:08.720
are okay I think it's just the stump
right okay so there's just multiple

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:08.730
right okay so there's just multiple
 

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.180
right okay so there's just multiple
different routes coming off of that yes

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.190
different routes coming off of that yes
 

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.800
different routes coming off of that yes
I see okay in fact that we had to figure

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:15.810
I see okay in fact that we had to figure
 

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.660
I see okay in fact that we had to figure
that out is again it probably doesn't

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:17.670
that out is again it probably doesn't
 

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.430
that out is again it probably doesn't
mean that we're not natives right true I

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440
mean that we're not natives right true I
 

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.840
mean that we're not natives right true I
guess that's one of the challenges when

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:20.850
guess that's one of the challenges when
 

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.160
guess that's one of the challenges when
you're creating a transit up like this

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.170
you're creating a transit up like this
 

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.050
you're creating a transit up like this
is that you've really got to audiences

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060
is that you've really got to audiences
 

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.340
is that you've really got to audiences
you've got people who live there and

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:25.350
you've got people who live there and
 

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.690
you've got people who live there and
you're going to use this every day and

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:26.700
you're going to use this every day and
 

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.010
you're going to use this every day and
they really just want to see really

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.020
they really just want to see really
 

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.639
they really just want to see really
quickly you know things will change so

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:31.649
quickly you know things will change so
 

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:34.280
quickly you know things will change so
when is the next bus tram whatever going

using it that often

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000
using it that often
 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.370
using it that often
to figure out how to get somewhere and

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380
to figure out how to get somewhere and
 

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.220

which which color bust I need to get on
 

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.150
which which color bust I need to get on
to make that happen now this so I had

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160
to make that happen now this so I had
 

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.430

nearby have favorites that makes sense

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440
nearby have favorites that makes sense
 

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.650
nearby have favorites that makes sense
and then I have look up now the truth is

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660
and then I have look up now the truth is
 

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.390
and then I have look up now the truth is
I don't know why this is called look up

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:56.400
I don't know why this is called look up
 

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.060
I don't know why this is called look up
but it does seem to be something where I

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.070
but it does seem to be something where I
 

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.580
but it does seem to be something where I
can find out this is actually the most

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:01.590
can find out this is actually the most
 

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.500
can find out this is actually the most
you arrive right I think it works by

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.510
you arrive right I think it works by
 

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.290
you arrive right I think it works by
being able to go in and basically do

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300
being able to go in and basically do
 

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.730
being able to go in and basically do
specific things so I'm going to get the

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740
specific things so I'm going to get the
 

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.920
specific things so I'm going to get the

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:09.930
10 to Townsend in the outbound direction
 

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.670
10 to Townsend in the outbound direction
and at the cancer Street stop and you'll

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680
and at the cancer Street stop and you'll
 

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.790
and at the cancer Street stop and you'll
tell me when the next buses or tramps I

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800
tell me when the next buses or tramps I
 

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.960
tell me when the next buses or tramps I
suppose it going to arise that's

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:17.970
suppose it going to arise that's
 

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.550
suppose it going to arise that's
actually what i would have to get is

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560
actually what i would have to get is
 

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.460
actually what i would have to get is
very few or 90 play for a native ok and

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:22.470
very few or 90 play for a native ok and
 

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.550
very few or 90 play for a native ok and
and second uh well I can start that I

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560
and second uh well I can start that I
 

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.710
and second uh well I can start that I
think that stars the stop though I'm not

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720
think that stars the stop though I'm not
 

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.480
think that stars the stop though I'm not
sure that that actually stars yeah

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:29.490
sure that that actually stars yeah
 

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.980

doesn't seem to be stowing anything to

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:30.990
doesn't seem to be stowing anything to
 

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.660
doesn't seem to be stowing anything to
me yeah there we go okay let's find out

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:34.670
me yeah there we go okay let's find out
 

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.810
me yeah there we go okay let's find out
alright so I can yeah I guess what I'm

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820
alright so I can yeah I guess what I'm
 

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.480
alright so I can yeah I guess what I'm
looking for here is just I mean we could

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:41.490
looking for here is just I mean we could
 

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.980
looking for here is just I mean we could
talk about this more later but I think

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:42.990
talk about this more later but I think
 

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.740
talk about this more later but I think
that this is a nice clean layout it's

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:45.750
that this is a nice clean layout it's
 

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.850
that this is a nice clean layout it's
just not completely clear how I'm going

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860
just not completely clear how I'm going
 

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.920
just not completely clear how I'm going
to use this exactly it's it's one of

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:51.930
to use this exactly it's it's one of
 

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.060
to use this exactly it's it's one of
those things which I think a lot of

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.070
those things which I think a lot of
 

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.980
those things which I think a lot of
people you know I mentioned this sort of

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:54.990
people you know I mentioned this sort of
 

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.600
people you know I mentioned this sort of
two main use cases and this is an app

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:56.610
two main use cases and this is an app
 

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.820
two main use cases and this is an app
which those in between knows where

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:58.830
which those in between knows where
 

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.410
which those in between knows where
they're saying here is over the data we

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420
they're saying here is over the data we
 

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.380
they're saying here is over the data we
have you can almost see the AP is living

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.390
have you can almost see the AP is living
 

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.270
have you can almost see the AP is living
behind this UI it's like we have an API

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280
behind this UI it's like we have an API
 

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.949
behind this UI it's like we have an API
which lets you specify a line direction

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959
which lets you specify a line direction
 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.870
which lets you specify a line direction
and stop and I'll tell you when the next

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880
and stop and I'll tell you when the next
 

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.540
and stop and I'll tell you when the next
one comes so that's a screen exact would

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.550
one comes so that's a screen exact would
 

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.920
one comes so that's a screen exact would
have an API which tells you sure the

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:12.930
have an API which tells you sure the
 

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.470
have an API which tells you sure the
stops are and which line stop there and

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480
stops are and which line stop there and
 

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.760
stops are and which line stop there and
so that's a screen and that's kind of

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:16.770
so that's a screen and that's kind of
 

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.000
so that's a screen and that's kind of
the wrong way to

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.010

traveling on an underground so I've
 

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.490
traveling on an underground so I've
already been using it so we'll go back

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:38.500
already been using it so we'll go back
 

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.250
already been using it so we'll go back
to the main screen if I can so this is

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.260
to the main screen if I can so this is

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:20.950
right now no probably there you go it
 

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.019
right now no probably there you go it
would probably work so that's quite nice

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:24.029
would probably work so that's quite nice
 

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:25.830
would probably work so that's quite nice
you can go through and you can do a

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840
you can go through and you can do a
 

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.480
you can go through and you can do a
bunch of other things as well so if you

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:27.490
bunch of other things as well so if you
 

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.279
bunch of other things as well so if you
hit the I button again not the most

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:29.289
hit the I button again not the most
 

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:31.680
hit the I button again not the most
intuitive but what this is going to do

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:31.690
intuitive but what this is going to do
 

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.480
intuitive but what this is going to do
is take you to an iphone app which tells

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.490
is take you to an iphone app which tells
 

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.210
is take you to an iphone app which tells
you where what the service is like on in

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:36.220
you where what the service is like on in
 

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.220
you where what the service is like on in
each of the works and iPhone app I see

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.230
each of the works and iPhone app I see
 

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.200
each of the works and iPhone app I see
yeah it certainly doesn't look like an

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.210
yeah it certainly doesn't look like an
 

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.200
yeah it certainly doesn't look like an
interest yeah that's a pretty pretty

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.210
interest yeah that's a pretty pretty
 

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.029
interest yeah that's a pretty pretty
well done imitation and then exactly so

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039
well done imitation and then exactly so
 

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:47.250
well done imitation and then exactly so
this is actually really useful if you if

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.260
this is actually really useful if you if
 

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.139
this is actually really useful if you if
you do use the on an underground

00:20:49.139 --> 00:20:49.149
you do use the on an underground
 

00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:50.669
you do use the on an underground
no English lines are in and out of

00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679
no English lines are in and out of
 

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.589
no English lines are in and out of
service is kind of vital and the

00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:52.599
service is kind of vital and the
 

00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:54.389
service is kind of vital and the
departure boards as well as nice it's a

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:54.399
departure boards as well as nice it's a
 

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:55.680
departure boards as well as nice it's a
shame that it's having to load all the

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:55.690
shame that it's having to load all the
 

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.089
shame that it's having to load all the
information every time would be kind of

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:57.099
information every time would be kind of
 

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:58.979
information every time would be kind of
nice but just preface I think you think

00:20:58.979 --> 00:20:58.989
nice but just preface I think you think
 

00:20:58.989 --> 00:21:00.749
nice but just preface I think you think
a lot of that can be cashed absolutely

00:21:00.749 --> 00:21:00.759
a lot of that can be cashed absolutely
 

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.729
a lot of that can be cashed absolutely
and this actually well let's talk about

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:02.739
and this actually well let's talk about
 

00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:04.289
and this actually well let's talk about
this yeah second exactly so that's

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:04.299
this yeah second exactly so that's
 

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:05.879
this yeah second exactly so that's
basically what it does shows you the

00:21:05.879 --> 00:21:05.889
basically what it does shows you the
 

00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:07.889
basically what it does shows you the
shows you the London Underground map and

00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:07.899
shows you the London Underground map and
 

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.289
shows you the London Underground map and
tells you what the service is like on

00:21:10.289 --> 00:21:10.299
tells you what the service is like on
 

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:12.029
tells you what the service is like on
each of the lines and when each of the

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039
each of the lines and when each of the
 

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.799
each of the lines and when each of the
trains is going to arrive so pretty

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:13.809
trains is going to arrive so pretty
 

00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:17.999
trains is going to arrive so pretty
useful stuff yes next on our agenda I

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:18.009
useful stuff yes next on our agenda I

about some of these yeah you know it's
 

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.450
about some of these yeah you know it's
so much effort for we're talking about

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:28.460
so much effort for we're talking about
 

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.250

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.970
doesn't piss me off very much in fact it
doesn't piss me off at all but it

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:39.980
doesn't piss me off at all but it
 

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.220
doesn't piss me off at all but it
probably wasn't necessary it would have

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:42.230
probably wasn't necessary it would have
 

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.260
probably wasn't necessary it would have
been nicer probably just to have the

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:44.270
been nicer probably just to have the
 

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.300
been nicer probably just to have the
taste yeah you could have more in fact I

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.310
taste yeah you could have more in fact I
 

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.000
taste yeah you could have more in fact I
think else I think our guidance is to

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.010
think else I think our guidance is to
 

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.450
think else I think our guidance is to
pick one right

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460
pick one right
 

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.250
pick one right

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:03.390
law but it required strip I would have
 

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.760
law but it required strip I would have
thought it would be language based

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:04.770
thought it would be language based
 

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.700
thought it would be language based
rather than cliff baby maybe it says you

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:07.710
rather than cliff baby maybe it says you
 

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.400
rather than cliff baby maybe it says you
can't you can't abbreviate information

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.410
can't you can't abbreviate information
 

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.720
can't you can't abbreviate information
to info because I don't know all right

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:14.730
to info because I don't know all right
 

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.060
to info because I don't know all right
the info is kind of boring it's just a

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.070
the info is kind of boring it's just a
 

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.020
the info is kind of boring it's just a
bunch of web pages so I think really the

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.030
bunch of web pages so I think really the
 

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.670
bunch of web pages so I think really the
only thing that's that's good about this

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:22.680
only thing that's that's good about this
 

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.200
only thing that's that's good about this
is the triplet triplet yeah that's

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:24.210
is the triplet triplet yeah that's
 

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.490
is the triplet triplet yeah that's
usually the key thing for something like

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500
usually the key thing for something like
 

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.020
usually the key thing for something like
this and then of course you've got the

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.030
this and then of course you've got the
 

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:32.000
this and then of course you've got the
ah yeah uh interesting menu ob's got its

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.010
ah yeah uh interesting menu ob's got its
 

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.060
ah yeah uh interesting menu ob's got its
got fellas it's got an exit button yeah

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.070
got fellas it's got an exit button yeah
 

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.430
got fellas it's got an exit button yeah
we would be super excited about people

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440
we would be super excited about people
 

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.110
we would be super excited about people
getting rid of these menus completely

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120
getting rid of these menus completely
 

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.030
getting rid of these menus completely
because we're we're embarrassed about

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.040
because we're we're embarrassed about
 

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.710
because we're we're embarrassed about
them and we want them to go away yeah

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720
them and we want them to go away yeah
 

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.590
them and we want them to go away yeah
but yeah this is not great it feels like

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600
but yeah this is not great it feels like
 

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.470
but yeah this is not great it feels like
maybe it was developed on some random

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480
maybe it was developed on some random
 

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.470
maybe it was developed on some random
different phone that had a completely

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480
different phone that had a completely
 

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.350
different phone that had a completely
non standard colors game or no I think

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360
non standard colors game or no I think
 

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.970
non standard colors game or no I think
that's the Achilles game it looks like

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980
that's the Achilles game it looks like
 

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.490
that's the Achilles game it looks like
that's an attempt at branding which is

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500
that's an attempt at branding which is
 

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.050
that's an attempt at branding which is
fine we like branding we like to have

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:00.060
fine we like branding we like to have
 

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.670
fine we like branding we like to have
apps which look unique which have their

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:01.680
apps which look unique which have their
 

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.580
apps which look unique which have their
own distinct look and feel but this I

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:04.590
own distinct look and feel but this I
 

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.800
own distinct look and feel but this I
think is going a little bit too far it's

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:06.810
think is going a little bit too far it's
 

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.480
think is going a little bit too far it's
a little quite a lot too far all right

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:08.490
a little quite a lot too far all right
 

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.070
a little quite a lot too far all right
that's a running a little bit out of

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080
that's a running a little bit out of
 

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.540
that's a running a little bit out of
time so that's let's take a straight up

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:11.550
time so that's let's take a straight up
 

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.670
time so that's let's take a straight up
to the bus checker and okay from there

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:13.680
to the bus checker and okay from there
 

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.450
to the bus checker and okay from there
ok so bus checkers fun alright so bus

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460
ok so bus checkers fun alright so bus
 

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.190
ok so bus checkers fun alright so bus
checker has some of the buttons that I

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200
checker has some of the buttons that I
 

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.890
checker has some of the buttons that I
would kind of expect a course they're

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:20.900
would kind of expect a course they're
 

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.000
would kind of expect a course they're
they're located on a split action bar

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.010
they're located on a split action bar
 

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.800
they're located on a split action bar
and the action bar has to be split

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:24.810
and the action bar has to be split
 

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.650
and the action bar has to be split
because as you can see I I think this is

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:27.660
because as you can see I I think this is
 

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.200
because as you can see I I think this is
actually a standard action bar but the

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.210
actually a standard action bar but the
 

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.340
actually a standard action bar but the
logo here is just so

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:32.350
logo here is just so
 

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.799
logo here is just so
shouldn't be a logo at all in fact I

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:34.809
shouldn't be a logo at all in fact I
 

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:36.539
shouldn't be a logo at all in fact I
guess it could be it's a little bit odd

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:36.549
guess it could be it's a little bit odd
 

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:38.880
guess it could be it's a little bit odd
having so that really wide logo in there

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:38.890
having so that really wide logo in there
 

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.430
having so that really wide logo in there
having it and and yeah I jump on them

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440
having it and and yeah I jump on them
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.350
having it and and yeah I jump on them
and nobody minds that on a on a tablet

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360
and nobody minds that on a on a tablet
 

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.140
and nobody minds that on a on a tablet
here it looks a little weird Oh client

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.150
here it looks a little weird Oh client
 

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.640
here it looks a little weird Oh client
as well they have a pretty distinctive

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:47.650
as well they have a pretty distinctive
 

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.860
as well they have a pretty distinctive
logo as well you know I kind of tempted

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:49.870
logo as well you know I kind of tempted
 

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.659
logo as well you know I kind of tempted
to just stick with the logo approach

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:51.669
to just stick with the logo approach
 

00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:53.310
to just stick with the logo approach
which is another approach in

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320
which is another approach in
 

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.630
which is another approach in
particularly if it gives you the ability

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640
particularly if it gives you the ability
 

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.460
particularly if it gives you the ability
to use the UH performance and those

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:56.470
to use the UH performance and those
 

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.409
to use the UH performance and those
sorts of navigation keys would think

00:25:58.409 --> 00:25:58.419
sorts of navigation keys would think
 

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:01.409
sorts of navigation keys would think
that it doesn't yeah so so yeah we what

00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:01.419
that it doesn't yeah so so yeah we what
 

00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:03.630
that it doesn't yeah so so yeah we what
we'd love to have is just the icon here

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640
we'd love to have is just the icon here
 

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.940
we'd love to have is just the icon here
with the affordance and then it would be

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:05.950
with the affordance and then it would be
 

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.830
with the affordance and then it would be
basically the icon followed by the word

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840
basically the icon followed by the word
 

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.810
basically the icon followed by the word
map and then you know you can navigate

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:09.820
map and then you know you can navigate
 

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.360
map and then you know you can navigate
so map list that that makes a certain

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:12.370
so map list that that makes a certain
 

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.940
so map list that that makes a certain
amount of sense although this doesn't

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:14.950
amount of sense although this doesn't
 

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.409
amount of sense although this doesn't
actually want to go to live yes so

00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:16.419
actually want to go to live yes so
 

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:17.970
actually want to go to live yes so
that's the it's interesting point you

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:17.980
that's the it's interesting point you
 

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.860
that's the it's interesting point you
have to have zoomed in closely enough

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:19.870
have to have zoomed in closely enough
 

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.640
have to have zoomed in closely enough
for it to have found a selection of

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:22.650
for it to have found a selection of
 

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.020
for it to have found a selection of
muscles before it will figure it to you

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.030
muscles before it will figure it to you
 

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.960
muscles before it will figure it to you
know now it does have locate action on

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:27.970
know now it does have locate action on
 

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.419
know now it does have locate action on
the action bar so that like sense so if

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:30.429
the action bar so that like sense so if
 

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:31.980
the action bar so that like sense so if
you have used a color here to indicate

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:31.990
you have used a color here to indicate
 

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.350
you have used a color here to indicate
that that's being used don't use colors

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360
that that's being used don't use colors
 

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.669
that that's being used don't use colors
on the action bar says probably

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679
on the action bar says probably
 

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:38.090
on the action bar says probably
something that I want to avoid right

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100
something that I want to avoid right
 

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.020
something that I want to avoid right
today you go so now you can see all the

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.030
today you go so now you can see all the
 

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.779
today you go so now you can see all the
bus stops at a time I think actually

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:41.789
bus stops at a time I think actually
 

00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:44.100
bus stops at a time I think actually
knowing that that's been used is a

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.110
knowing that that's been used is a
 

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.539
knowing that that's been used is a
relatively useless piece of information

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:45.549
relatively useless piece of information
 

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:48.000
relatively useless piece of information
yeah you can say that because you can

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.010
yeah you can say that because you can
 

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.940
yeah you can say that because you can
stay on the screen exactly that so it'll

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:50.950
stay on the screen exactly that so it'll
 

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.250
stay on the screen exactly that so it'll
it'll show me everything that's nearby

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260
it'll show me everything that's nearby
 

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.090
it'll show me everything that's nearby
it'll show me that on the map it will

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.100
it'll show me that on the map it will
 

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.789
it'll show me that on the map it will
let me search not using a standard

00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799
let me search not using a standard
 

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:01.490
let me search not using a standard
search of films which is a shame because

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500
search of films which is a shame because
 

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.330
search of films which is a shame because

where exactly so all of these apps based

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:01.570
where exactly so all of these apps based
 

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.419
where exactly so all of these apps based
around being able to catch public

00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:03.429
around being able to catch public
 

00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:04.979

transport somewhere near where you are
 

00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:06.599
transport somewhere near where you are
and so having them know where you are

00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:06.609
and so having them know where you are
 

00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.069
and so having them know where you are
without having to type it in yourself is

00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079
without having to type it in yourself is
 

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.109
without having to type it in yourself is
kind of a no-brainer I think most of the

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119
kind of a no-brainer I think most of the
 

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:11.700
kind of a no-brainer I think most of the
apps we looked at today do this Pro

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:11.710
apps we looked at today do this Pro
 

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.879
apps we looked at today do this Pro
which is good so the real trick here is

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:14.889
which is good so the real trick here is
 

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:16.770
which is good so the real trick here is
is keeping track of your location and

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:16.780
is keeping track of your location and
 

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.270
is keeping track of your location and
doing so in a way those are going to

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280
doing so in a way those are going to
 

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.609
doing so in a way those are going to
drain the battery so having the exact

00:34:20.609 --> 00:34:20.619
drain the battery so having the exact
 

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:23.669
drain the battery so having the exact
precise location is not particularly

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679
precise location is not particularly
 

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.500
precise location is not particularly
important to keep track of I think

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:25.510
important to keep track of I think

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640
want is to find when the next bus is or
 

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.599
want is to find when the next bus is or
I want to find how to get from one point

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:01.609
I want to find how to get from one point
 

00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:03.790
I want to find how to get from one point
to another I have these tasks that this

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800
to another I have these tasks that this
 

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.280
to another I have these tasks that this
application can help me with and if it's

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.290
application can help me with and if it's
 

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.740
application can help me with and if it's
not obvious how to achieve those tasks

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:08.750
not obvious how to achieve those tasks
 

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.530
not obvious how to achieve those tasks
right away then I've got a lot larger

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:11.540
right away then I've got a lot larger
 

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.310
right away then I've got a lot larger
mental load I have to find what's the

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:15.320
mental load I have to find what's the
 

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.020
mental load I have to find what's the
closest station to me and then I have to

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.030
closest station to me and then I have to
 

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.060
closest station to me and then I have to
think to myself well where do I need to

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.070
think to myself well where do I need to
 

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.490
think to myself well where do I need to
go and

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:20.500
go and
 

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.830
go and
it was my time frame and I have to do

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:22.840
it was my time frame and I have to do
 

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.480
it was my time frame and I have to do
all of this work that the computer could

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:24.490
all of this work that the computer could
 

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.890
all of this work that the computer could
be doing for me it's important to note

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:25.900
be doing for me it's important to note
 

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.330
be doing for me it's important to note
as well but like these problems have

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:27.340
as well but like these problems have
 

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.890
as well but like these problems have
existed for a long time so there's

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:28.900
existed for a long time so there's
 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.000
existed for a long time so there's
actually a fair amount of infrastructure

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
actually a fair amount of infrastructure
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.250
actually a fair amount of infrastructure
in place to solve this problem with ways

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:32.260
in place to solve this problem with ways
 

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.470
in place to solve this problem with ways
other than using your phone so as soon

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480
other than using your phone so as soon
 

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.820
other than using your phone so as soon
as a user is going you know what it

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:35.830
as a user is going you know what it
 

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.500
as a user is going you know what it
would be easier to ask someone sitting

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:37.510
would be easier to ask someone sitting
 

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.390
would be easier to ask someone sitting
next to me when the next bus is coming

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400
next to me when the next bus is coming
 

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.520
next to me when the next bus is coming
or like get up and walk around to see

want to create something which is easier

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:48.340
want to create something which is easier
 

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.220
want to create something which is easier
for users than what is already there for

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:50.230
for users than what is already there for
 

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.840
for users than what is already there for
them and that's not nothing well and

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:51.850
them and that's not nothing well and
 

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.690

don't forget that unless you're in Seoul

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700
don't forget that unless you're in Seoul
 

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.520
don't forget that unless you're in Seoul
google maps will actually do a better

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:56.530
google maps will actually do a better
 

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.980
google maps will actually do a better
job of this than many of the commercial

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:58.990
job of this than many of the commercial
 

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.020
job of this than many of the commercial
applications okay if you can't beat that

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.030
applications okay if you can't beat that
 

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.460
applications okay if you can't beat that
interface then your competitiveness is

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:05.470
interface then your competitiveness is
 

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.930
interface then your competitiveness is
in question absolutely and I think

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:06.940
in question absolutely and I think
 

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.640
in question absolutely and I think
that's a lot of what the benefit of a

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:08.650
that's a lot of what the benefit of a
 

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.380
that's a lot of what the benefit of a
lot of these apps bring is information

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:10.390
lot of these apps bring is information
 

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.730
lot of these apps bring is information
which you can't currently get under than

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:11.740
which you can't currently get under than
 

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.290
which you can't currently get under than
that so things like how long until the

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:13.300
that so things like how long until the
 

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.030
that so things like how long until the
next bus arrives let the Google Maps

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040
next bus arrives let the Google Maps
 

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.440
next bus arrives let the Google Maps
offers that turning them in all

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:16.450
offers that turning them in all
 

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:17.910
offers that turning them in all
locations so that's a competitive

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920
locations so that's a competitive
 

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.470
locations so that's a competitive
advantage and that's kind of what you

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480
advantage and that's kind of what you
 

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.930
advantage and that's kind of what you
should be making as your primary front

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:21.940
should be making as your primary front
 

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.130
should be making as your primary front

this is kind of an obvious one but one

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:29.500
this is kind of an obvious one but one

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740
no-brainer so let's have a look so we
 

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.200
no-brainer so let's have a look so we
have actually spent far more time

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:18.210
have actually spent far more time
 

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.030
have actually spent far more time
talking about stuff than we necessarily

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040
talking about stuff than we necessarily
 

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.190
talking about stuff than we necessarily
should have but what we want to do now

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200
should have but what we want to do now
 

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.900
should have but what we want to do now
spend a couple of minutes looking at

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:23.910
spend a couple of minutes looking at
 

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.550
spend a couple of minutes looking at
each of these sort of details and in

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560
each of these sort of details and in
 

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.050
each of these sort of details and in
reference to the apps so we should kind

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060
reference to the apps so we should kind
 

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.820
reference to the apps so we should kind
of breeze through these in just a

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:28.830
of breeze through these in just a
 

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.050
of breeze through these in just a
competition so maybe one looks we

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060
competition so maybe one looks we
 

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.350
competition so maybe one looks we
examples recap yeah so so when you why

don't you find that out so the first one

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:34.650
don't you find that out so the first one

yeah uses a standard action bar oh I

instead of dark you've got the light map

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:00.100
instead of dark you've got the light map
 

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.220
instead of dark you've got the light map
in fact this is pretty good guidance and

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:02.230
in fact this is pretty good guidance and
 

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.600
in fact this is pretty good guidance and
something would show Roman is mentioned

people's supposed to be just looking at

time to use dark which is why I think

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:14.470
time to use dark which is why I think
 

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.740
time to use dark which is why I think
YouTube uses the the dark thing for

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:16.750
YouTube uses the the dark thing for
 

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.230
YouTube uses the the dark thing for
everything else lot is kind of a better

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240
everything else lot is kind of a better
 

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.150
everything else lot is kind of a better
approach right so I think that would be

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160
approach right so I think that would be
 

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.980
approach right so I think that would be
a good way to go here yeah especially

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:22.990
a good way to go here yeah especially
 

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.320

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200
thing they did wrong on this screen is
 

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.110
thing they did wrong on this screen is
they should take out the bus checker

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:37.120
they should take out the bus checker

you really want to break that down into
what are the specific tasks that I'm

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:38.550
what are the specific tasks that I'm
 

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.700
what are the specific tasks that I'm
looking for is it you know decide make a

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:40.710
looking for is it you know decide make a
 

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.170
looking for is it you know decide make a
decision for your app what is the most

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180
decision for your app what is the most
 

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.390
decision for your app what is the most
useful thing why is it knowing when the

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400
useful thing why is it knowing when the
 

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.700
useful thing why is it knowing when the
next bus is is it a trip planner is it a

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:46.710
next bus is is it a trip planner is it a
 

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:47.220
next bus is is it a trip planner is it a
map

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:47.230
map
 

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.020
map
figure out what the most useful thing

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:49.030
figure out what the most useful thing
 

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.210
figure out what the most useful thing
that your app does and focus your UI and
