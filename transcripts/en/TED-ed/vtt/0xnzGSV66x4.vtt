00:00:08.754 --> 00:00:13.444
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige,

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:16.244
and near-perfect job security.

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:18.485
And there's only one way to be hired:

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.874
get appointed to the US Supreme Court.

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:24.494
If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court,

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:27.204
the highest federal court 
in the United States,

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:29.334
three things have to happen.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.395
You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States,

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.455
your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate,

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:39.944
and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court.

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:43.554
Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications,

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:47.025
in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession,

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:50.216
or even native-born 
citizenship requirement,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:54.145
a president can nominate any individual
to serve.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:57.305
So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born,

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.855
at least one never graduated
from high school,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:04.375
and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:09.815
Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view,

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:11.785
so a president with a liberal ideology

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:14.493
will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court.

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:18.376
Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:21.396
For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican,

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:24.285
nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice,

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:27.616
Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions.

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:31.342
Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal

00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:32.976
in the Court's history.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:35.106
Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:39.256
as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made.

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:42.196
Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well,

00:01:42.196 --> 00:01:47.155
including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.236
The candidates are then thoroughly vetted

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:53.127
down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:55.186
Once the president interviews 
the candidate

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.406
and makes a formal nomination
announcement,

00:01:57.406 --> 00:02:01.417
the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:04.106
by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:06.316
Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice,

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:08.766
that can stretch over many days.

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:13.127
Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days.

00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:16.796
The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable,

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:21.246
and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote.

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.718
And especially in more recent history,

00:02:23.718 --> 00:02:28.656
the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions.

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:32.627
The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:35.518
with a positive 
or negative recommendation,

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:40.648
often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all.

00:02:40.648 --> 00:02:43.357
Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:47.148
has been a different political 
party than the president.

00:02:47.148 --> 00:02:50.028
When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote,

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:53.297
with ties broken by the vice president.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:54.547
With the Senate's consent,

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.034
the president issues 
a written appointment,

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:59.568
allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:02.963
to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths.

00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:03.963
In doing so,

00:03:03.963 --> 00:03:08.030
they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.669
and do equal right to the poor
and the rich

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.918
and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:19.113
upon a US Supreme Court justice.

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:20.773
This job is for life,

00:03:20.773 --> 00:03:25.371
barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.713
And of the 112 justices who have held
the position,

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:33.868
not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment.

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:37.959
One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans,

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.300
even as different parties take power.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.399
With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility,

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.398
it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be,

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.419
in the words of Irving R. Kaufman,

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.339
"a paragon of virtue,

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.000
an intellectual Titan,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.190
and an administrative wizard."

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.563
Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice.

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:03.740
Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.200
to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.203
time and history.
