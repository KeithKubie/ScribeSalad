them out if we can our project is
specifically working on born digital

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
specifically working on born digital
 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.699
specifically working on born digital
programs technically with the library of

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709
programs technically with the library of
 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.199
programs technically with the library of
congress money we can't really work

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
congress money we can't really work
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.900
congress money we can't really work
directly on any of the analog stuff but

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910
directly on any of the analog stuff but
 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.539
directly on any of the analog stuff but
we're in our planning we're encompassing

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549
we're in our planning we're encompassing
 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.520
we're in our planning we're encompassing
all of the materials that we hold even

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530
all of the materials that we hold even
 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.680
all of the materials that we hold even
though our model repository is really

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690
though our model repository is really
 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.680
though our model repository is really
for the born digital materials and we

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690
for the born digital materials and we
 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.770
for the born digital materials and we
are well along now we're at the end of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780
are well along now we're at the end of
 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.780
are well along now we're at the end of
the third year of what was to be a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
the third year of what was to be a
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.190
the third year of what was to be a
three-year project we've already had it

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200
three-year project we've already had it
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.779
three-year project we've already had it
extended for two more years so we'll be

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789
extended for two more years so we'll be
 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.699
extended for two more years so we'll be
going for a while

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
going for a while
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.800
going for a while
and we are going to our supposed to be

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
and we are going to our supposed to be
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.379
and we are going to our supposed to be
designing a model repository for digital

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389
designing a model repository for digital
 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.029
designing a model repository for digital
video so that's what NYU is really

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039
video so that's what NYU is really
 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.089
video so that's what NYU is really
helping us with and even though you can

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099
helping us with and even though you can
 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.830
helping us with and even though you can
look at the stuff that we've been

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840
look at the stuff that we've been
 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.029
look at the stuff that we've been
looking at all day today actually

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039
looking at all day today actually
 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.490
looking at all day today actually
thinking about a preservation repository

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500
thinking about a preservation repository
 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.589
thinking about a preservation repository
for digital materials is really not as

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599
for digital materials is really not as
 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.659
for digital materials is really not as
simple as it sounds there are a lot of

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669
simple as it sounds there are a lot of
 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.640
simple as it sounds there are a lot of
steps that have to go through in order

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650
steps that have to go through in order
 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.480
steps that have to go through in order
for us to think about preparing the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490
for us to think about preparing the
 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.629
for us to think about preparing the
material to put into a of preservation

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639
material to put into a of preservation
 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.730
material to put into a of preservation
repository and then of course the main

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740
repository and then of course the main
 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.200
repository and then of course the main
thing is being able to retrieve it

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210
thing is being able to retrieve it
 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.089
thing is being able to retrieve it
putting it in isn't so hard but getting

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099
putting it in isn't so hard but getting
 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.270
putting it in isn't so hard but getting
it back out again with integrity with it

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280
it back out again with integrity with it
 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.520
it back out again with integrity with it
being intact in the way that it was

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530
being intact in the way that it was
 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.620
being intact in the way that it was
produced and reflecting the kinds of

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630
produced and reflecting the kinds of
 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.300
produced and reflecting the kinds of
things that were put into it when it was

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310
things that were put into it when it was
 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.659
things that were put into it when it was
originally broadcast or produced are the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669
originally broadcast or produced are the
 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.140
originally broadcast or produced are the
things that we're really working on the

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150
things that we're really working on the
 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.770
things that we're really working on the
challenges that we have been looking at

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780
challenges that we have been looking at
 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.760
challenges that we have been looking at
I want to say that we have a website and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770
I want to say that we have a website and
 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.610
I want to say that we have a website and
we're putting a lot of our material up

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620
we're putting a lot of our material up
 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.529
we're putting a lot of our material up
there it's a little we're little slow

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539
there it's a little we're little slow
 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.930
there it's a little we're little slow
but we're trying to be steady on it we

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940
but we're trying to be steady on it we
 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.969
but we're trying to be steady on it we
have a we have a very excellent report

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979
have a we have a very excellent report
 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.249
have a we have a very excellent report
that was prepared on selection criteria

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259
that was prepared on selection criteria
 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.200
that was prepared on selection criteria
because we're talking about a lot of

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210
because we're talking about a lot of
 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.029
because we're talking about a lot of
quantity of material not just finished

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039
quantity of material not just finished
 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.550
quantity of material not just finished
programs but all the material or not all

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560
programs but all the material or not all
 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.320
programs but all the material or not all
the material but a great deal of

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330
the material but a great deal of
 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.640
the material but a great deal of
material that didn't go into the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650
material that didn't go into the
 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.830
material that didn't go into the
programs so that would be available

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
programs so that would be available
 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.020
programs so that would be available
possibly for non broadcast or even just

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030
possibly for non broadcast or even just
 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.379
possibly for non broadcast or even just
for research later and so we've got a

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389
for research later and so we've got a
 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.439
for research later and so we've got a
paper that we prepared on selection mary

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449
paper that we prepared on selection mary
 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:48.670
paper that we prepared on selection mary
was actually very instrumental in

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680
was actually very instrumental in
 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.310
was actually very instrumental in
writing that we've got a paper that were

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320
writing that we've got a paper that were
 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.890
writing that we've got a paper that were
just about ready to publish on metadata

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900
just about ready to publish on metadata
 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.480
just about ready to publish on metadata
you've heard that a couple of times now

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490
you've heard that a couple of times now
 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.140
you've heard that a couple of times now
and I was very heartened when Marie this

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150
and I was very heartened when Marie this
 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.730
and I was very heartened when Marie this
morning the very first presentation said

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740
morning the very first presentation said
 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.219
morning the very first presentation said
metadata is king because we feel like

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229
metadata is king because we feel like
 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.409
metadata is king because we feel like
it's one of the things the term is

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419
it's one of the things the term is
 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.790
it's one of the things the term is
getting to be a little overused but it's

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800
getting to be a little overused but it's
 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.159
getting to be a little overused but it's
really crucial to being able to retrieve

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169
really crucial to being able to retrieve
 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.439
really crucial to being able to retrieve
digital files digital files are useless

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
digital files digital files are useless
 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.909
digital files digital files are useless
if they don't have the labels and the

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919
if they don't have the labels and the
 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.180
if they don't have the labels and the
labels are in the metadata we also have

labels are in the metadata we also have
a paper on file formats and I'm not sure

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280
a paper on file formats and I'm not sure
 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.129
a paper on file formats and I'm not sure
that people understand in the production

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139
that people understand in the production
 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.670
that people understand in the production
of broadcast video we probably I haven't

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680
of broadcast video we probably I haven't

counted them up we probably go through

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810
counted them up we probably go through
 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.519

protect that information as much as
possible and this of course is where the

possible and this of course is where the
 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.950
possible and this of course is where the
whole idea of standards comes in and

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960
whole idea of standards comes in and
 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.439
whole idea of standards comes in and
also streamlining the production process

done right now for broadcast and what

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930
done right now for broadcast and what
 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.170
done right now for broadcast and what
it's going to take for us to distribute

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180
it's going to take for us to distribute
 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.749
it's going to take for us to distribute
that program in a digital form and to

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759
that program in a digital form and to
 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.139
that program in a digital form and to
preserve that program in a digital form

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:35.149
preserve that program in a digital form
 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.730
preserve that program in a digital form
we're looking at one of the major

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740
we're looking at one of the major
 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.689
we're looking at one of the major
technical problems is a file wrapper

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:40.699
technical problems is a file wrapper
 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.820
technical problems is a file wrapper
which is what it's going to take for us

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830
which is what it's going to take for us
 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.679
which is what it's going to take for us
to package the essence which is the

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:45.689
to package the essence which is the
 

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:47.839
to package the essence which is the
actual moving image material with the

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:47.849
actual moving image material with the
 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:50.959
actual moving image material with the
metadata in some kind of a format so

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:50.969
metadata in some kind of a format so
 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:52.820
metadata in some kind of a format so
that we can put it in a repository and

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830
that we can put it in a repository and
 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.909
that we can put it in a repository and
retrieve it that's why our paper on file

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919
retrieve it that's why our paper on file
 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.709
retrieve it that's why our paper on file
formats and metadata we're going to try

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:57.719
formats and metadata we're going to try
 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:01.040
formats and metadata we're going to try
to mash them up together to actually

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050
to mash them up together to actually
 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.769
to mash them up together to actually
move forward on that we thought that

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:03.779
move forward on that we thought that
 

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:06.529
move forward on that we thought that
other TV producers would be working on

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539
other TV producers would be working on
 

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:09.049
other TV producers would be working on
the problem of file of the file wrapper

00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:09.059
the problem of file of the file wrapper
 

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.659
the problem of file of the file wrapper
and so we went around and talked to the

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:11.669
and so we went around and talked to the
 

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:14.089
and so we went around and talked to the
networks etc nobody was doing it we

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099
networks etc nobody was doing it we
 

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:16.549
networks etc nobody was doing it we
actually found that we were kind of out

00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:16.559
actually found that we were kind of out
 

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.159
actually found that we were kind of out
there by ourselves so we organized a

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:19.169
there by ourselves so we organized a
 

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:21.829
there by ourselves so we organized a
meeting with the support of the Library

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:21.839
meeting with the support of the Library
 

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.529
meeting with the support of the Library
of Congress a year ago and we invited a

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539
of Congress a year ago and we invited a
 

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:26.749
of Congress a year ago and we invited a
lot of people working on file format

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759
lot of people working on file format
 

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.670
lot of people working on file format
particularly video file format issues to

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680
particularly video file format issues to
 

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.579
particularly video file format issues to
talk to us about rappers and we also

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:33.589
talk to us about rappers and we also
 

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:36.290
talk to us about rappers and we also
asked for the help of PBS which was

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300
asked for the help of PBS which was
 

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.659
asked for the help of PBS which was
developing its own kind of a rapper and

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:38.669
developing its own kind of a rapper and
 

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.909
developing its own kind of a rapper and
we found that everyone said oh we'll

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919
we found that everyone said oh we'll
 

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.550
we found that everyone said oh we'll
work with

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560
work with
 

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.769
work with
or we'll follow you so instead of us

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:43.779
or we'll follow you so instead of us
 

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.810
or we'll follow you so instead of us
being able to kind of do follow along

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:45.820
being able to kind of do follow along
 

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.920
being able to kind of do follow along
with what was being developed in the

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:46.930
with what was being developed in the
 

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.500
with what was being developed in the
commercial world we're finding that

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.510
commercial world we're finding that
 

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.610
commercial world we're finding that
commercial folks were ready to follow us

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:50.620
commercial folks were ready to follow us
 

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.160
commercial folks were ready to follow us
so two things have developed out of that

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.170
so two things have developed out of that
 

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.740
so two things have developed out of that
one is that PBS is actually developing

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
one is that PBS is actually developing
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.280
one is that PBS is actually developing
an mxf profile for video files for use

00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.290
an mxf profile for video files for use
 

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.400
an mxf profile for video files for use
for distribution that's going to be

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.410
for distribution that's going to be
 

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.320
for distribution that's going to be
specifically oriented for public

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.330
specifically oriented for public
 

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.750
specifically oriented for public
television because we were finding with

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760
television because we were finding with
 

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.769
television because we were finding with
all of the so-called definition of mxf

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:13.779
all of the so-called definition of mxf
 

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:16.260
all of the so-called definition of mxf
being so flexible all of that that in

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:16.270
being so flexible all of that that in
 

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.290
being so flexible all of that that in
fact some of the mechanisms that were

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.300
fact some of the mechanisms that were
 

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.820
fact some of the mechanisms that were
playing back our files were stripping

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:20.830
playing back our files were stripping
 

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.670
playing back our files were stripping
out the closed captioning obviously not

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680
out the closed captioning obviously not
 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.829
out the closed captioning obviously not
a good thing so we needed to protect

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839
a good thing so we needed to protect
 

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:27.390
a good thing so we needed to protect
that we needed to protect some of the

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:27.400
that we needed to protect some of the
 

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.950
that we needed to protect some of the
information we're coming up with our own

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:28.960
information we're coming up with our own
 

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.800
information we're coming up with our own
profile for mxf which we hope will then

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:31.810
profile for mxf which we hope will then
 

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.260
profile for mxf which we hope will then
be adopted as a standard and that will

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.270
be adopted as a standard and that will
 

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.400
be adopted as a standard and that will
help us greatly with the

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.410
help us greatly with the
 

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.980
help us greatly with the
interoperability we also have recently

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:37.990
interoperability we also have recently
 

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.240
interoperability we also have recently
joined up with Turner Broadcasting

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.250
joined up with Turner Broadcasting
 

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.890

through the production format that again
 

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.340
through the production format that again
we hope would be adopted as a standard

within television so that we'll all be

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560
within television so that we'll all be
 

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.590
within television so that we'll all be
able to use the same material we get the

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600
able to use the same material we get the

we give them and one other thing that

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:07.060
we give them and one other thing that
 

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.910
we give them and one other thing that
we're working on now is that we're

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920
we're working on now is that we're
 

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.460
we're working on now is that we're
starting to archive all the websites in

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:11.470
starting to archive all the websites in
 

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.290
starting to archive all the websites in
public television this is something very

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:13.300
public television this is something very
 

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.170
public television this is something very
recent that we're doing in cooperation

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:16.180
recent that we're doing in cooperation
 

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.420
recent that we're doing in cooperation
with the Internet Archive we felt that

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:18.430
with the Internet Archive we felt that
 

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.540
with the Internet Archive we felt that
with all of the companion websites that

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:21.550
with all of the companion websites that
 

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.070
with all of the companion websites that
were developed for public TV and now

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.080
were developed for public TV and now
 

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.510
were developed for public TV and now
that we're seeing a lot of public TV

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:24.520
that we're seeing a lot of public TV
 

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.030
that we're seeing a lot of public TV
developing out of the websites that we

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040
developing out of the websites that we
 

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.410
developing out of the websites that we
should be capturing those things and

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:28.420
should be capturing those things and
 

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.970
should be capturing those things and
also putting them into some kind of a

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:29.980
also putting them into some kind of a
 

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.290
also putting them into some kind of a
preservation environment or at least

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.300
preservation environment or at least
 

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.090
preservation environment or at least
storing them in a way that we have a

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.100
storing them in a way that we have a
 

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.030
storing them in a way that we have a
historical record of these things

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
historical record of these things
 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.340
historical record of these things
particularly because people seen the TV

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
particularly because people seen the TV
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.130
particularly because people seen the TV
programs at some point will also want to

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.140
programs at some point will also want to
 

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.079
programs at some point will also want to
know what was online and connect

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:43.089
know what was online and connect
 

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:44.820
know what was online and connect
connection with these things so we're

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:44.830
connection with these things so we're
 

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.199
connection with these things so we're
just starting to do this and we're

00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:46.209
just starting to do this and we're
 

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:48.300
just starting to do this and we're
actually very excited about it and

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.310
actually very excited about it and
 

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.150
actually very excited about it and
hopefully we'll have something to be

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160
hopefully we'll have something to be
 

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.680
hopefully we'll have something to be
able to show people soon where they

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:52.690
able to show people soon where they
 

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.880
able to show people soon where they
want to start looking at the history of

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:53.890
want to start looking at the history of
 

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.290
want to start looking at the history of
doing it now you know we won't up too

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.300
doing it now you know we won't up too
 

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.820
doing it now you know we won't up too
much history but if we do it over a

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:56.830
much history but if we do it over a
 

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:57.870
much history but if we do it over a
period of time we know that it'll be

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880
period of time we know that it'll be
 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.730
period of time we know that it'll be
there a new development which has come

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:02.740
there a new development which has come
 

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.370
there a new development which has come
out of all of these various efforts with

standard called dublin core and it's an
 

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.770
standard called dublin core and it's an
expansion of that that's been in the

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:01.780
expansion of that that's been in the
 

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.270
expansion of that that's been in the
works for a couple of years it was

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.280
works for a couple of years it was
 

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.950
works for a couple of years it was
finally released and now we're trying to

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:04.960
finally released and now we're trying to
 

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.470

to use it because it's a standard the

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:10.150
to use it because it's a standard the
 

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.320
to use it because it's a standard the
mic website will map to PB core and it's

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.330
mic website will map to PB core and it's
 

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.550
mic website will map to PB core and it's
something that we feel like is really

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560
something that we feel like is really
 

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.760
something that we feel like is really
important that's out there now and

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:17.770
important that's out there now and
 

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.920
important that's out there now and
something that's also very important

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:19.930
something that's also very important
 

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.380
something that's also very important
which is also fairly recent is the

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:22.390
which is also fairly recent is the
 

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.380
which is also fairly recent is the
extension of the public broadcasting

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:25.390
extension of the public broadcasting
 

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.440
extension of the public broadcasting
distribution system which has been a

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.450
distribution system which has been a
 

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.640
distribution system which has been a
kind of 1.2 many system up until

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:32.650
kind of 1.2 many system up until
 

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.780
kind of 1.2 many system up until
recently in the analog design and is now

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:36.790
recently in the analog design and is now
 

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.120
recently in the analog design and is now
in the process of being transformed into

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.130
in the process of being transformed into
 

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.430
in the process of being transformed into
a digital distribution system which will

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440
a digital distribution system which will
 

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.840
a digital distribution system which will
be based on very broadband access to

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:45.850
be based on very broadband access to
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.350
be based on very broadband access to
program files and will be not just one

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360
program files and will be not just one
 

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.650
program files and will be not just one
point too many but also will involve

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
point too many but also will involve
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.650
point too many but also will involve
peer-to-peer distribution and that's in

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:55.660
peer-to-peer distribution and that's in
 

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.630
peer-to-peer distribution and that's in
the process of being planned and we

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:57.640
the process of being planned and we
 

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.060
the process of being planned and we
found that in looking at the existing

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.070
found that in looking at the existing
 

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.740
found that in looking at the existing
infrastructure and public broadcasting

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.750
infrastructure and public broadcasting
 

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.870
infrastructure and public broadcasting
which we have extensive infrastructure

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880
which we have extensive infrastructure
 

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.930
which we have extensive infrastructure
nationally

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:04.940
nationally
 

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.700
nationally
which is all being transformed into

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:06.710
which is all being transformed into
 

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.500
which is all being transformed into
digital infrastructure that we could

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.510
digital infrastructure that we could
 

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.120
digital infrastructure that we could
include a preservation element in that

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.130
include a preservation element in that
 

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.850
include a preservation element in that
as well so that in addition to having

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:12.860
as well so that in addition to having
 

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.550
as well so that in addition to having
programs available for play out for

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560
programs available for play out for
 

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.710
programs available for play out for
public play out over broadcasting that

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720
public play out over broadcasting that
 

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.870
public play out over broadcasting that
we could capture some of that and be

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880
we could capture some of that and be
 

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.420
we could capture some of that and be
able to store it for long-term

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.430
able to store it for long-term
 

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.210
able to store it for long-term
preservation as well and that that we

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.220
preservation as well and that that we
 

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.850
preservation as well and that that we
can use the existing system to plan how

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:27.860
can use the existing system to plan how
 

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.820
can use the existing system to plan how
that would work and the American archive

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:30.830
that would work and the American archive
 

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.910
that would work and the American archive
is based in part on taking advantage of
