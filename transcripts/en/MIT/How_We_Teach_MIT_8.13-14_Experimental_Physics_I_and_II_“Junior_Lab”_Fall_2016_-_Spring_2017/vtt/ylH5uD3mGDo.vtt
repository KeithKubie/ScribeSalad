ATISSA BANUAZIZI:
In 8.13, students

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.540
have to present over
and over and over

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.190
again throughout the
course of the semester.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.100
And we think that this iterative
process is really important.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.770
We start out giving them some
instruction at the beginning

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.000
of the semester.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.310
But often, they still
don't feel wholly

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.020
comfortable with
what they're doing

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.850
the first time they present.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.040
And so once they've presented,
they get videotaped.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.890
And then we meet with
them to discuss the video,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.680
to discuss the slides,
to see what worked

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.030
and what didn't work.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.600
And those one-on-one conferences
that we have with them,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170
they're reinforcing the core
concepts in the instruction

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.960
but in a way that's really
directly linked to the work

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.570
that they've already done, the
work that they're continuing

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.810
to do, and to challenges that
they've already experienced

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.890
so they can really
understand the significance

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.420
of these strategies.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.239
And so by the time
we have them revise

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.280
one of these presentations
that they present

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640
in the public oral, which
is to their entire class

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.720
and, often, to people
outside the class--

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.460
they might be other faculty;
they might be friends

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.680
of the class of the students--

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.710
they're already fairly
experienced communicators.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.010
And they have a pretty good idea
of what's effective and what

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.510
isn't.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.730
A lot of classes
at the Institute

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.760
do a terrific job
of exposing students

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.580
to many, many genres
of communication.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.680
What I think is unusual
about this class

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.840
is sort of how
deeply they're asked

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.580
to delve into a couple
of very specific genres.
