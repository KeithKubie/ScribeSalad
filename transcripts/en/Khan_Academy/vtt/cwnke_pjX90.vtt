00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:03.439
- [Instructor] Company
A is offering $10,000

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.731
for the first month and
will increase the amount

00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.481
each month by $5,000.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.459
Company B is offering
$500 for the first month

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.310
and will double their payment each month.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.091
For which monthly payment
will Company B's payment

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.099
first exceed Company A's payment?

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.905
So pause this video and
try to work that out.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.139
All right, let's work this out together.

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:32.880
So let me set up a little bit of a table.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.797
So this is going to be,

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:40.328
the first column I'm gonna have is month.

00:00:40.328 --> 00:00:42.495
The first column is month.

00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:48.022
The second column is how much
Company A is going to pay.

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.592
And then third column,
let's think about how much

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.240
Company B is going to pay.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.378
Well, they tell us a few things.

00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:58.735
They say Company A is offering
$10,000 for the first month.

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:02.652
So in month one, Company
A is offering $10,000,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.240
we'll assume, well, I'll
just write the dollars there.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.228
And then Company B is offering
$500 for the first month.

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:12.311
$500 for the first month.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.886
But then they tell us
Company A is offering,

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:19.926
will increase the amount,
each month by $5,000.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:24.093
So month two will be 5,000
more, we'll get to $15,000.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.386
Month three

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.415
we'll get to $20,000.

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.255
Four, we'll get to $25,000.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.110
Five, I think you get the
point, we'll get to $30,000.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.277
Six, we'll get to $35,000.

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:45.155
Seven, we'll get to $40,000.

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:48.560
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.743
Month eight, I'll stop there.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:52.743
Month eight, we will get to $45,000.

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:58.174
Let me extend these lines a little bit.

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:00.372
Now let's think about what's
gonna happen with Company B.

00:02:00.372 --> 00:02:02.523
Company B is offering
500 for the first month,

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:05.250
but will double their payment each month.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.729
So the second month is
gonna be double that.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.409
So that's going to be $1,000.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.550
Then we're gonna double
that again, $2,000.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.241
Then we're gonna double
that again, $4,000.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.091
Double that again, $16,000.

00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:21.341
Double that again, $32,000.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.607
Double that, oh, I skipped one.

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:27.970
I went from 4,000 to 16,000.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.137
4,000, $8,000.

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:34.199
Then we double it again, $16,000.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.367
Again, 32, I sound like
my two year old again.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.277
All right, $32,000.

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:42.962
Then we get to $64,000.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.548
And at that point something
interesting happens.

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:46.617
It's actually good that I
went to the eighth month

00:02:46.617 --> 00:02:48.491
because every month
before the eighth month,

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:52.028
Company A's payment was higher
until that eighth month.

00:02:52.028 --> 00:02:56.716
In that eighth month, Company
B is going to pay more.

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.281
So first we can just
answer their question.

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.518
For which monthly payment
will Company B's payment

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:04.083
first exceed Company A's payment?

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.623
Well, that is month eight, month eight.

00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:10.843
And there's a broader
lesson going on here.

00:03:10.843 --> 00:03:14.626
You might recognize that the
rate at which Company A's

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:17.147
payment is increasing is linear.

00:03:17.147 --> 00:03:19.994
Every month it increases
by the same amount.

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.161
So plus 5,000, plus 5,000.

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:27.199
It increases by 5,000 the same amount.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.084
Company B is increasing exponentially.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:32.449
It's increasing by the
same factor every time,

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.650
so we're multiplying by
the same value every time.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.513
We're multiplying by two,
we're multiplying by two,

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:40.096
multiplying by two.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.766
And so there's actually a
very interesting thing here

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.967
that you can actually
make the general statement

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:49.562
that an exponential function
will, we'll want something

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.569
that is exponentially
increasing, will eventually

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.759
always surpass something
that is linearly increasing.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.010
And it doesn't matter what
the initial situation is,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.169
and it also doesn't even matter that rate

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.528
of exponential increase,
it will eventually always

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:09.291
pass up something that's
increasing linearly.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:12.049
And you can think about
that visually if you like.

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.444
If I were to draw a visual
function, a linear function,

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:20.074
so this is x-axis, this is the y-axis,

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.274
a linear function, well, this is gonna be

00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:23.861
described by a line.

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.944
So it could look something like this.

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:31.549
A linear function is always
gonna be a line of some slope.

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:34.116
And an exponential function,
even though it might

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:37.616
start a little bit slower, it's eventually

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:41.651
going to pass up the linear function.

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:43.769
And this is going to be the
case even if the linear function

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:46.666
has a pretty high slope or a
pretty high starting point,

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:49.011
if it's something like that,
and even if the exponential

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.797
function is starting pretty
slow, it will eventually,

00:04:52.797 --> 00:04:55.686
and even if it's compounding
or growing relatively slow

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:58.826
but exponentially, you know
if it's going 2% or 3%,

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:02.404
it still will eventually
pass up the linear function

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:04.237
which is pretty cool.
