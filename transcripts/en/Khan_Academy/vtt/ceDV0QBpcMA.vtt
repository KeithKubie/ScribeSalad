00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.770
The measure of two angles
of an isosceles triangle

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.340
are 3x plus 5 degrees, we'll
say, and x plus 16 degrees.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.630
Find all possible values of x.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.740
So let's think about this.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.420
Let's draw ourselves an
isosceles triangle or two.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.301
So it's an isosceles triangle,
like that and like that.

00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:23.050
And actually, let me
draw a couple of them

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.290
just because we want
to think about all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.920
of the different
possibilities here.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.202
So we know, from what we know
about isosceles triangles,

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.160
that the base angles are
going to be congruent.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.360
So that angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.620
That angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.490
And so what could the 3x plus
5 degrees and the x plus 16,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.980
what could they be measures of?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.690
Well, maybe this
one right over here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.980
has a measure of
3x plus 5 degrees.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.090
And the vertex is the other one.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.570
So maybe this one up here
is the x plus 16 degrees.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.530
The other possibility
is that this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.000
is describing both base
angles, in which case,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.380
they would be equal.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.540
So maybe this one is 3x plus
5, and maybe this one over here

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.745
is x plus 16.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.520
And then the final
possibility-- actually we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.150
haven't exhausted
all of them-- is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.080
if we swap these two--
if this one is x plus 16,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.730
and that one is 3x plus 5.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.760
So let me draw ourselves
another triangle.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.440
And obviously swapping
these two aren't

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.430
going to make a
difference because they

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.825
are equal to each other.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.950
And then we could make that
one equal to 3x plus 5.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.480
But that's not going to
change anything either

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.980
because they're
equal to each other.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.160
So the last situation is
where this angle down here

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.990
is x plus 16, and this
angle up here is 3x plus 5.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.650
This is 3x plus 5.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.960
So let's just work
through each of these.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.220
So in this situation, if
this base angle is 3x plus 5,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.100
so is this base angle.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.860
And then we know that
all three of these

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.730
are going to have to
add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.920
So we get 3x plus
5 plus 3x plus 5

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.260
plus x plus 16 is going to
be equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.420
We have 3x.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.370
Let's just add up.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.140
You have 3x plus
3x, which gives you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.880
6x, plus another x gives you 7x.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.950
And then you have 5
plus 5, which is 10,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.600
plus 16 is equal to 26.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.030
And that is going
to be equal to 180.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.070
And then we have, let's
see, 180 minus 26.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.210
If we subtract 26 from both
sides, we get 180 minus 20

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.790
is 160, minus another 6 is 154.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.460
You have 7x is equal to 154.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.408
And let's see how many times--
if we divide both sides by 7,

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:06.800
7 will go into 140 20 times,
and then you have another 14.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.235
So it looks like it's 22 times.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:10.140
So x is equal to 22.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.990
Is that right?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.930
20 times 7 is 140.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.210
140 plus 14 is 154.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.700
So we have x is equal
to 22 degrees in this

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.140
the first scenario.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.200
Now let's think about the
second scenario over here.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.080
Now we have these
two characters are

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.070
going to be equal to each
other because they're

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.500
both the base angles.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.100
So you have 3x plus 5
is equal to x plus 16.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.340
Well, you can subtract
x from both sides.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.450
And so this becomes 2x
plus 5 is equal to 16.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.070
We can subtract
5 from both sides

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.510
and you get 2x is equal to 11.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.190
And then you can
divide both sides by 2,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.330
and you get x is equal to 11/2.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.830
So that is our second scenario.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.270
And then we do our third
scenario right over here.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.370
If this base angle is x plus
16, then this base angle

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.850
right over here is also
going to be x plus 16.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.954
They are congruent.

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.329
And then we can
do the same thing

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.420
that we did for
the first scenario.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.670
All of these angles are going to
have to add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.665
So we have x plus 16 plus
x plus 16 plus 3x plus 5.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.020
When you add them
all together, you're

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.570
going to get 180 degrees.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.020
Now let's add up
all the x terms.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.880
x plus x is 2x plus 3x is 5x.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.160
So we get 5x.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.550
And then you have
16 plus 16 is 32.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.800
32 plus 5 is 37.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.055
Plus 37 is equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.710
Subtract 37 from
both sides, and we

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.180
get 5x is equal to
180 minus 30 is 150.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.850
So that gets us to 143.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.620
So it's not going
to divide nicely.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.260
Divide both sides by 5,
you get x is equal 143/5,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
which we can just leave
as an improper fraction.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.440
You could write it
as a mixed number

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.530
or however else you
might want to write it.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.460
And we're done.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.470
These are the three
possible values

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.730
of x, given the information that
they gave us right up there.
