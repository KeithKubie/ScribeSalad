00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.610
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So, good afternoon everyone.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.860
I am extremely thrilled, extremely excited
to welcome Humphrey Slocombe to Talks at Google

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.860
today.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.840
Humphrey Slocombe—
[applause and cheers]

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.310
Yes, yeah.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.340
They even brought us ice cream, how awesome
is that?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.340
[cheers and applause]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh wow a bigger cheer for the ice

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.750
cream than us, come on.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.360
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So for those of you that may

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.930
be tuning in on YouTube, Humphrey Slocombe
is a bit of a San Francisco tradition.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.530
They're an icon, a humble ice cream store
on 24th and Harrison in the mission.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.219
They constantly push the boundaries of ice
cream as a desert and as a way of life.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.050
And today we have joining us the two folks
behind it.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.429
We have Jake Godby and Sean Vahey.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:52.469
And they created the icon.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.329
They're fame has spread nationally.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.510
They're here actually now to talk about their
book, appropriately titled "The Humphrey Slocombe

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.170
Ice Cream Book".

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.559
So without further ado, we'll go ahead and
talk a little bit about the book.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.559
Talk about ice cream making.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
We'll have time for your questions at the
end, we'll have the Q and A mic over there.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.200
So please join me in welcoming Jake and Sean
to Google.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.690
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Jake: Thanks for having us.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.140
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So, the first thing I wanted
to start out with was the book itself.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.960
What was your inspiration, your idea for making
it?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.020
How did it come about?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.120
&gt;&gt;Sean: Well we were actually approached to
do the book initially 'cause it wasn't even

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
on our radar.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.729
&gt;&gt;Jake: No, we had a couple different publishers
approach us about doing a book.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.899
You know at the time we were only like a year
old.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:38.979
And it's like, why?

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.220
And we still felt like such newbies at the
game, so.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.079
&gt;&gt;Sean: And then it took us an additional
year to write it, so we were two years in

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.229
by the time it came out.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.229
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.270
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, cool.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.630
And it seems to me like going through the
book and like reading about your story as

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.720
to how you two met.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.000
You know formed the business and everything.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
It's a story very similar to that of Grant
Achatz and Nick Kokonas over at Alinea's in

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Chicago.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.600
You know one person's doing the flavors, you
know advancing the craft there.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.100
And then one person's handling the business.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.560
So Jake, what I wanted to know, how did you
decide to specialize in ice cream from your

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.820
prior pastry training
&gt;&gt;Jake: Well to be honest I thought we could

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.220
open up an ice cream shop with less people
than it would take to open up like a bakery

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.320
per se.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.190
'Cause when we opened it was just Sean and
I.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.830
I made a, we both scooped it, or we both scooped
it and we were working 20 hours a day, working

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.830
our asses off.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.960
If we did something else, it would be more
of a production that we didn't, was just not

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.980
possible.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.010
And, yeah.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.760
&gt;&gt;Sean: By ourselves sucked.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.020
&gt;&gt;Sean: It was terrible, I mean we literally
worked all day.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.460
You made ice cream all night while I drank.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.360
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: We tried to deal with it.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.310
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you had that champagne
party where you got your first employee.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.980
&gt;&gt;Sean: We did—
&gt;&gt;Jake: Oh yeah.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.850
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's actually an interesting story.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.180
We, when we had kind of a thank you party
for our friends and our family and we had

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.430
so much help.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.180
And during the party, we were like, "We're
gonna hire somebody from this party who's

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.940
helping us portion and pan."

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.380
And the deal was whoever kept my glass full
the entire party is who we'd hire.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.550
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Despite what their background was.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.610
And enter Emily.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.190
&gt;&gt;Jake: And she stayed for three years.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.980
&gt;&gt;Sean: And she stayed for three years.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.430
She could pour a mean glass of champagne.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.060
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: That's nice.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.580
And Sean, so how was the transition to managing
the ice cream front from your prior experience

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.630
in the restaurant business.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.690
&gt;&gt;Sean: It was really weird.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.160
Because I came from a background of Hyatt
and Four Seasons.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.000
So I kind of thought I knew everything.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.340
And I didn't know anything.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.050
You know there, nothing prepared me for what
Humphrey Slocombe brought us.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.480
You know, we're still learning a lot.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.500
So, you think you know something but you know
nothing.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.960
&gt;&gt;Jake: Well I think a lot of our success
comes from his fine dining, or both of our

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.160
fine dining background.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.150
Because we tried to create the same experience
in our little ice cream shop that you would

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.500
get at a nicer restaurant.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.240
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Jake: The same level of customer service.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's right.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.640
I mean customer service I would say is, it's
kind of the same across the board.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.270
No matter if you're like super rich or if
you're just like us.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.270
Poor.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.690
[laughter]
And everyone wants the same good customer

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.690
service.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.289
So it doesn't matter if you're up Four Seasons
or Humphrey Slocombe, you still want to be

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.680
treated well.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.500
And that really interpreted well across the
board.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.340
But everything else, forget it.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.630
You gotta learn how to run a business and
like fast.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.630
So.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.100
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And then, and then also another
key component of your success is your massive

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.100
Twitter following.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.180
And the hundreds of thousands.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.180
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.120
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you described it as—
&gt;&gt;Sean: Were still getting used to that.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.930
We still don't know how it happened, right?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.590
I mean, we knew we had a great product.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.840
And we knew that we wanted people to come
to our area of the Mission.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080
So we turn to Twitter.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960
&gt;&gt;Jake: We had no advertising budget.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.150
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, it was like $-1000.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.940
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: So when we turned Twitter on, we we're

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.280
like, "What is this [censored]".

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.130
It was so boring, it was like, [high pitched
voice] "I'm gonna go to the mall”.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.040
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: And we were like what?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.800
So we made our Twitters really dirty.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.290
And like, really naughty.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.540
And we were just like, we just wanted people
to pay attention to us so that it would, they'd

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.960
eventually come to the store.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.160
So it got us in a lot of trouble, but it also
got us the attention that we wanted.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.510
I've had it described to me that we're like
the sassy gay friend of the twittersphere.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.140
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: I love that.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.770
I had never heard that.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.770
But yeah.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.920
And then as we started getting more people,
you know we toned it down a little bit.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.950
So I think we found a nice balance.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.790
And if you're not following us, follow us.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.210
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: @Humphrey Slocombe.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.210
And likewise you grew like a rabid fan base,
but also some haters that you mention in the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.210
book.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.210
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh yeah.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.210
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: You describe them as your
frenemies.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.210
&gt;&gt;Sean: Well that.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.730
Yeah that was like the harshest reality.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.919
It was like, you know we're, we're generating
a lot of attention through the direction we

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.460
decided to go which was naughty.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.139
So then with all the people that kind of love
the, the spirit of it.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.450
There's also people that are like all right,
if you guys want to be, you know, this sassy

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.450
I'm gonna take you on.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.700
And we had some pretty harsh haters.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.750
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, we've had a parody as well.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.750
&gt;&gt;Sean: And death threats.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.510
&gt;&gt;Jake: And death threats.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.520
And it just, there some crazy people out there.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.810
&gt;&gt;Sean: You haven't lived until you got first
death threat, let me tell you.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.970
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: It's all that fetal kitten,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.900
you know people just can't get behind it.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah exactly.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.070
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you even include some
of the tweets and e-mails in the book.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.330
And I thought that was pretty interesting.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.560
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, that was our publishers idea,
and we weren't sure how we were going to do

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
a.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.350
Originally it was gonna be kind of like a
ticker line across the bottom.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.230
But I'm glad we didn't do that because each
tweet kind of has its own personality I think.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.710
And it's, they're fun to read separately.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.780
So I think our publisher did a great job kind
of separating them.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.590
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Did you have like this archive
of like really crazy e-mails to go on?

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.610
Or did you--
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh my.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.810
&gt;&gt;Jake: I wish we would've saved more.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.950
Cause we didn't know the book was gonna happen
that way.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.950
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.261
So there's so many good ones we last.

00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:08.360
&gt;&gt;Sean: We had so many good ones, and the
ones that were like the scariest we decided

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.720
to post, like, on our freezers just so that
it wouldn't intimidate us like we wanted yo

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720
owner.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
&gt;&gt;Jake: We had to embrace it.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.110
So like the really scary ones, like the death
threats, the ones that said people were gonna

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.570
kill us, we were just like all right let's
post them let's look at them every day and

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.889
lets like own it.

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:24.889
I wish we'd kept them.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.590
&gt;&gt;Jake: I wish we had kept the erotic poetry
that one girl.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.600
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh yeah we had people drop off erotic
ice cream poetry.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.340
&gt;&gt;Jake: Right
&gt;&gt;Sean: We've gotten all kinds of great e-mails.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.949
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you maintain that style
through the book to.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.060
One thing that I really enjoyed was the same
irreverent style you present in the storefront

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.300
is also there in the writing.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.230
So is that a conscious decision?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.240
Did that just sort of—
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.780
Come out of your pen as you were typing along?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.170
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, we, I think we wanted to just
kind of keep our voice.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.120
And that was also the biggest struggle.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.130
Because, you know, we understand that our
publisher wants to sell books and you know

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.130
we do to.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.460
But we also, I mean we had to keep the cursing
down a lot.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.290
&gt;&gt;Jake: I mean if there's anything that both
of us can't stand, we hate cute.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.720
And it's so easy to go cute with an ice cream
book.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.710
&gt;&gt;Sean: They snuck that picture of the kid
in our book.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.280
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: We said that there could be a kid

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.600
in the book, but the kids gotta be crying
and their ice cream has to be on the floor.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.450
&gt;&gt;Female audience member 1: Oh my god.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.310
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Like that's what we wanted.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.850
&gt;&gt;Jake: There are much more pictures of trannies
than children in our book.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.850
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.850
&gt;&gt;Jake: So we fought for that.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.850
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And dentists apparently.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.729
No dentist in the ice cream book except for
this one.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.719
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, I was like Jake you can't mention
you're a dentist in an ice cream book, like

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.770
that's gonna drive people away.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.770
&gt;&gt;Jake: Nah.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.490
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Right and just moving also
onto the ice cream making process.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.329
You know in the book you describe the importance
of creating a base and then you go through

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.839
talking about several different bases.

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:52.910
So we have like the Philly style which is,
you know, without eggs.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.699
We have like a sorbet, we have the full-bodied
cream.

00:08:56.699 --> 00:08:59.119
Do certain bases work better with certain
flavors?

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:02.829
You know what was your approach for you know
choosing the different ones?

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:03.829
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's Jake.

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:04.829
I have spiders in my oven, so.

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:05.829
He's the--
&gt;&gt;Jake: [laughs]

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:12.920
Well I think for the Philly style which is
without eggs, I think that has a more natural

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.260
fit for cleaner flavors like a fruit flavor
like a strawberry because there's less fat

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.250
to mask the tongue.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.560
And you just, it comes across more cleanly.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.160
But the ones that have egg yolks are just
a more fuller richer fatty flavor.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.810
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And then the sorbets, you
know, focus on the essence of the flavor itself.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.990
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.560
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Standing alone.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.769
And then, you know what about sorta nondairy
bases like soy, you know we've seen, almond

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:42.769
milk.

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:43.769
&gt;&gt;Jake: I don't know anything about that.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:44.769
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: All right, we won't mention

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:45.769
any of that at all.

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:46.769
Froyo?

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:47.769
&gt;&gt;Jake: We are an ice cream shop.

00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:48.769
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:52.509
&gt;&gt;Jake: People are asking about that and it's
like it says ice cream on the door.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:56.170
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: We will never intentionally do a fat-free

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.350
or a sugar-free or.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.860
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, it's just, we only have 12 flavors
a day.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.459
There's plenty of other places to go.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:06.959
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And it was interesting actually
today in the cafés at Google, we rolled out

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:08.459
a salute to Humphrey Slocombe.

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:12.209
We had a bit of throwdown, I smackdown if
you will.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:14.220
So we had all frozen yogurt.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.990
We used to have ice cream, but we have since
moved in the froyo direction.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:23.069
But we had some hibiscus beet, we had some
curry caramel. and then you know Secret Breakfast

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:24.069
was cool.

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:25.069
&gt;&gt;Jake: Nice, great.

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:26.069
&gt;&gt;Sean: So good.

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:29.439
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: But yeah I think we need – –
&gt;&gt;Jake: I fully support people who join, doing

00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:30.850
that sort of thing and having fun.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.749
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And that's one of the points
you make in the book too, it's like you know

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:35.559
you need to change the flavors.

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:38.800
You know throw in more of one, less of another.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.380
Like make it your own flavor instead of just
following the book.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.749
&gt;&gt;Jake: I mean it's pretty cheap and easy
to make ice cream in a little ice cream machine

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:47.749
at home.

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:50.079
And if it doesn't work, you start over again.

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:53.480
&gt;&gt;Jake: And put your own personality into
it, you know, that's how Jake come up with

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480
a lot of these.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.079
And it's easy for you to do yourself.

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.660
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, cool.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.220
And so we do have some questions from the
Twitter base.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.500
You know, they submitted using Google moderators.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.429
So the first one that I have it from a Dan
H in the United Kingdom.

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:12.620
He wants to know what is your number one hands
down favorite piece of inspiration, that's

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.480
favorite with a U, you've had which led you
to create a flavor and what was it.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.830
&gt;&gt;Sean: God, Michael Jackson?

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.350
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, that's a good one.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.800
&gt;&gt;Sean: Our biggest selling sorbet is Jesus
Juice.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.649
And, I know
[laughter]

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:33.509
&gt;&gt;Sean: And it was Michael Jackson's passing
that inspired us.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:36.191
&gt;&gt;Jake: There was a, we've done a lot of tribute
flavors over the years.

00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.191
&gt;&gt;Sean: We do a lot of tribute flavors.

00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:38.420
&gt;&gt;Jake: I think that might've been the first
one.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.509
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, my favorite was Golden Girls
though.

00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:42.459
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:45.970
But yeah it's red wine and Coke sorbet in
tribute to Michael Jackson.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.819
If you don't know, get the reference, you
can look, you can Google it.

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:49.819
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Exactly.

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:51.350
&gt;&gt;Jake: We probably can't mention the reference
here.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.139
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So what was the Golden Girls
one?

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:54.139
I think I missed that one.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.839
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh my God; it was strawberry cheesecake.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:57.649
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah when Rue McClanahan died, we
did a –

00:11:57.649 --> 00:11:58.959
&gt;&gt;Sean: When Rue passed away.

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.369
&gt;&gt;Jake: We did a strawberry cheesecake.

00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:01.369
&gt;&gt;Sean: It was so good.

00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:02.369
&gt;&gt;Jake: Tribute flavor.

00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:03.959
&gt;&gt;Sean: I may have eaten like half the batch.

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:05.730
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's not a Humphrey Slocombe flavor.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.230
&gt;&gt;Sean: It's not typical us but I mean you
guys, I don't know if you guys remember Golden

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.230
Girls but.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.529
&gt;&gt;Jake: They all sat around.

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:16.610
&gt;&gt;Sean: They always sat around the kitchen
table eating cheesecake.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:22.970
&gt;&gt;Jake: I think my favorite inspiration story
is Secret Breakfast.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.040
It was way before the shop even opened.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.730
That was back in Ohio on a roadtrip with friends.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.140
And I was thinking about what kind of flavors
I wanted to make with my friends.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.360
And my friend Eric just out of his mouth came
Secret Breakfast.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.139
And that just clicked with me.

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:40.489
And then I figured out what it would be.

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:44.449
&gt;&gt;Jake: And that's also the first flavor you
made me when we decided to get together and

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:45.449
do this.

00:12:45.449 --> 00:12:51.550
And I remember eating it and, like, I was,
like, oh shit, like this is the beginning

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.550
of the end.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.129
Like this is, it's the flavor that, like,
got us going.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.129
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.129
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:12:58.129 --> 00:13:02.070
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, and along those lines
of the small batches we have a question from

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.740
Mark in New York.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.680
He wants to know why you even produce in such
small batches?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.309
And then he goes on to notice inconsistencies
in the flavor profiles when he gets a same

00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:13.649
flavor from a different batch.

00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:14.649
&gt;&gt;Sean: Good.

00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:16.380
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So with salt and pepper and
like olive oil.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.740
&gt;&gt;Sean: He should get a little inconsistency
'cause it's handmade.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.949
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, everything, well the small batch
thing is we didn't know we'd be so busy.

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:27.290
And I should have bought a larger machine.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.970
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: But we work with what we have.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:40.649
And you know what we work with is, or is as
organic as possible, local as possible things.

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:47.819
And if sometimes a batch of strawberries is
sweeter or more tart then another batch.

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:52.240
Sometimes the salt-and-pepper will steep a
little bit longer or it's a finer grain that

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.240
we've used.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.600
And there's gonna be variances and I'm totally
okay with that.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.449
&gt;&gt;Sean: I don't think we've ever been so much
that you're getting a completely different

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:00.449
flavor.

00:14:00.449 --> 00:14:04.559
I mean, we taste the ice cream during the
entire process that it's made.

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:08.480
And you know we like it to be consistent but
you will get different nuances.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.929
And you know a batch of strawberries that
will help deliver will be just intensely sweet

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:17.329
and another batch will be you know have a
little bit of a tartness.

00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:21.110
You know, everything will be a little bit
different because of the fresh ingredients

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.110
that were using.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.249
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Do you, do you get like feedback
and adjust more from the customers or is it

00:14:26.249 --> 00:14:31.019
just more like you prescribing strawberry
should be tart, vanilla should not be ordinary.

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:34.519
&gt;&gt;Sean: Well, we'll bring back flavors because
our guests ask.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:36.019
I mean, that happens a lot.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:37.019
&gt;&gt;Jake: Sure.

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:41.420
&gt;&gt;Sean: Or if like a flavor is not super successful,
we won't put that back in rotation.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.579
And then we also have flavors where the fruits
in season for like, just a couple weeks.

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:49.249
Like, our sweet summer corn is only in season
for a short amount of time.

00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:52.769
And we try to get as much of that out there
as we can.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:55.920
Yeah, we listen to our guest feedback.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920
Very intensely.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.930
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, and then along those
lines we have Kimberly from Illinois was wondering.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.990
What's the most popular flavor beside Secret
Breakfast?

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.759
I mean, Secret Breakfast obviously runs away
on its own.

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:07.759
&gt;&gt;Jake: Coffee.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:08.759
&gt;&gt;Sean: Coffee?

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:10.089
Yeah the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee.

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:13.279
'Cause it goes so well with the Secret Breakfast.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.949
The highest selling sorbet is Jesus Juice
for sure.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:19.259
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And the Coffee is on every
day, or almost every day.

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:21.189
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah it's one of the three flavors
that never changes.

00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:26.560
&gt;&gt;Sean: We keep Coffee, Secret Breakfast,
the Tahitian Vanilla and.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.140
&gt;&gt;Jake: That's it.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.809
&gt;&gt;Sean: We also have Balsamic for the sundae,
but it's not out.

00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.879
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool.

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:36.910
And then, we have a person name Fennel in
Chicago.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.730
Were there any flavors you thought would be
great but just didn't pan out in the marketplace?

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.970
And also what's the most savory ice cream
you've ever made?

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.459
&gt;&gt;Sean: We tried to make a tribute to Peter
Paul and Mary.

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:50.569
Called Puff the Magic Dragon.

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:51.810
That actually didn't even make it on.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.079
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: It didn't even make it past the lab

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.699
phase because we were trying to incorporate
hemp oil into it.

00:15:57.699 --> 00:16:00.079
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: Of, I had forgotten about that.

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.759
&gt;&gt;Sean: And we wanted to make it green.

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.459
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, I think there was some spinach
in there.

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:05.870
&gt;&gt;Sean: It was a horrible.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.899
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, forgotten all about that.

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:13.450
&gt;&gt;Sean: And we had to make it pretty quickly
'cause it was like the next day.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.290
So, that didn't even make it out.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.350
But it was pretty bad.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.839
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Actually I had spinach flavored
ice cream one time in the Google Café

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:20.839
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh nice.

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.089
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: It was surprisingly good it
sort of work.

00:16:23.089 --> 00:16:24.089
Oh.

00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:25.290
&gt;&gt;Sean: It sounds gross.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.379
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So is there also like a master

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:33.730
calendar, you know, that there is gonna be
like some flavor rotation that, you know,

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.800
if you don't see it today within the next
three weeks it'll be back?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800
&gt;&gt;Jake: No.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.279
&gt;&gt;Sean: We'll never, yeah, I mean we can't
promise that just because you know we can't

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.279
look that far out.

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:47.290
And you know we don't know if again I'm using
strawberries.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.709
&gt;&gt;Jake: And I mean, well there's holiday flavors
that we know we're gonna have.

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:50.899
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh yeah, that sort of thing.

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:52.509
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Like Rosemary's Baby and.

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:53.509
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:54.509
Or – –
[laughter]

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:55.910
&gt;&gt;Sean: Pumpkin five spice.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.290
&gt;&gt;Jake: Five spiced pumpkin.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.449
Or, I Have A Dreamsicle on Martin Luther King
Day.

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:03.389
&gt;&gt;Sean: Baracky Road's coming back for obvious
reasons.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.600
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: That' nice.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.089
So the book itself was written towards the
perspective of the home chef.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.250
You know you want more people to make ice
cream on their own.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.569
You know use the machines that they have.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.380
And so you designed it for no matter what
machine they make, so whether it's a Cuisinart

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.020
or a gerbil ball, as you mentioned.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.370
What's one simple mistake or common pattern
that people fall into when they make ice cream

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.570
at home that they can avoid in the future?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.840
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's a good question.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.970
&gt;&gt;Jake: I don't, it's, for me personally I
think.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.539
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: I'm not gonna say specifically for

00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:41.740
ice cream but people are afraid of salt.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.740
Usually.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.649
And all of our ice cream has salt it.

00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:48.530
I think it helps just make the flavors more
punchy.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.559
And so.

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:53.799
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you also talked about
the importance of making the bases and making

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:58.380
sure you get those right before you move on
to sort of the graduating towards more flavors.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.510
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, try a couple by the recipe first
and then when you feel comfortable enough

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.210
to play around, go for it.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.850
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Yeah, focus on the fundamentals.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.850
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yes.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:08.850
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's right.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.860
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So any advice on folding in
ingredients whether that's caramel or like

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.980
nuts or whatever.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.470
That's one issue that I always had when I
make my own ice cream at my apartment.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.950
I just couldn't get the fold right.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.679
&gt;&gt;Jake: What were your issues?

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:26.800
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Well, I mean it seems like
I would put in the top and then I thought

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.130
I was in a Cold Stone I wasn't sure if I need
to dump it onto the marble slab or like do

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.130
it inside the machine.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.460
&gt;&gt;Jake: Well I mean it's certainly up to you,
I mean if you wanted to be completely uniform

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.870
and try and mix it up as much possible.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.049
But I like little pockets of, kind of like
clusters in mine.

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:45.330
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Oh cool.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.389
And then of course your recipes are scalable
too.

00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:50.820
So if you want to do like half a batch or
like a sample, it's doable?

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.390
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, I mean they all make about a
quart so kind of difficult to do less than

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.390
that.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.909
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's pretty standard for homemakers
right?

00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:59.909
The quart?

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:00.909
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:02.149
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool.

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:06.690
And so looking at the wider world, it seems
like once you guys got started like other

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.929
groups popped up as well.

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:12.270
You mentioned in the book that you had this
dream of opening an ice cream truck.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.150
And it seems like our friends in New York,
The Big Gay Ice Cream Truck.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.940
They made it through.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.070
They succeeded where you haven't got off the
ground yet.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.070
Any jealousy there?

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.269
Or how did the relationships start with them?

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:27.630
&gt;&gt;Sean: Actually not really, cause they went
from truck to store.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.390
And we originally looked at a truck and I
don't know.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.710
&gt;&gt;Jake: They have different regulations for
food trucks in New York than we have.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.309
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's pretty impossible to do an ice
cream truck.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:41.820
&gt;&gt;Sean: They don't make their own ice cream
either.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.139
We were required to have a place to make ice
cream and then take it on the truck by the

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:49.180
department, the dairy department.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.830
So that's how we turned into a shop.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.029
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Oh cool
&gt;&gt;Jake: So.

00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:57.440
&gt;&gt;Sean: So basically if you make ice cream,
package it, put on the truck, you can sell

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.450
it fairly easily.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.240
But if it's like us where you make the ice
cream and you want to scoop it on the truck,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.409
there's a whole new set of guidelines which
is why you don't see a whole lot of ice cream

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:06.409
trucks in that style.

00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:08.100
I don't know if you've noticed that.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.529
But there aren't really, there's like one
that I know of.

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:13.539
Mike, thanks a lot.

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:17.230
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And if I remember, you all
created a pop-up restaurant to.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.080
So how did that turn out?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.820
Or will you be doing in the future?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.820
It was so good.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.820
&gt;&gt;Jake: Oh that's--
&gt;&gt;Sean: It's your pop-up.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.820
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.639
I'm doing a little, it's a little side project
just to have something to do that's not ice

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:29.909
cream.

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:31.270
Just for another outlet.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.059
And to have fun.

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:34.059
It's every three weeks.

00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:35.509
&gt;&gt;Sean: It's called the Truckstop Café.

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:38.330
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: It's also on Twitter.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.090
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's a dirty divey little gay bar.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.280
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, cool.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.080
And also the partnership extends to through
area restaurants.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:53.259
You know, you supply ice cream to places like
Mission Street Food, Encanto, Flower + Water.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:56.270
Are there any particular pairings that you're
most proud of?

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.149
And how do you approach the collaboration
with actual restaurants?

00:20:59.149 --> 00:21:02.820
&gt;&gt;Sean: Wow we have so many we love everyone
that we work with.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.440
I know, Jake, you know works closely with
a lot of the chefs.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.390
And you know a lot of our relationships stem
from friendships.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.659
You know just in the restaurant community
that Jake's had or I've had.

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:18.299
We love working with everyone.

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:19.299
It's hard to nail that down.

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:23.580
&gt;&gt;Jake: You know I mean it's different with
each restaurant because a lot of chefs want

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.090
to be involved in every single aspect.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.639
And a lot of them just want nothing to do
with pastry and just want to let us help them

00:21:31.639 --> 00:21:32.720
make decisions.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.059
And we give it and it's a dialogue.

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:39.420
It's actually one of my favorite parts of
the job is just working with the chefs.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.529
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And to what extent do you
have to work with the entire menu or does

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:46.000
the ice cream stand on its own?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.210
&gt;&gt;Jake: Well the entire menu, not at all.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:53.139
But some chefs will ask ideas about pairings.

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:54.880
What you think would go with this?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.460
That sort of thing.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.360
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And apparently, you mention
in the book, olive oil as being the next great

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.250
topping, right up there with hot fudge caramel
and the whole lot.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.220
So I'm a little lost there.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.019
&gt;&gt;Sean: It already kind is, I see olive oil
as an ice cream topping a lot.

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:12.769
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, I think.

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:18.429
&gt;&gt;Sean: Ours is incorporated, we use McEvoy
which we think is the best olive oil on the

00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:19.429
planet.

00:22:19.429 --> 00:22:25.210
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, it's always one of my flavor
suggestions for restaurants because it's a

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:30.000
nice alternative to vanilla in that it pairs
well with almost everything.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.169
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you can, like, you can
build it up with more flavors.

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:34.610
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Sean: Sure.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.700
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.110
And so also I wanted to look a little bit
more towards the future to and so we do have

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.580
time for the audience Q&amp;A.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.899
So if you have questions sort of spinning
in your mind if you will you can actually

00:22:44.899 --> 00:22:48.289
line up at the mic and then we'll get to them
as well.

00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:50.980
You have a new project that you mention in
the book called The Parlor.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.610
Can you tell us anything about that?

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.549
Like, how is that coming along?

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:58.820
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's like every business in San Francisco,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:03.630
it takes a lot longer and a lot more money
than you initially think it's going to be.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:10.130
And this opening up something even after opening
a business it's still extremely difficult.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.690
It's going to be a bakery café.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.730
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Oh OK.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.730
&gt;&gt;Jake: Someday.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.960
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Oh cool, so like still in
the Mission?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.740
&gt;&gt;Jake: Oh yeah, yeah in the Mission.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.299
&gt;&gt;Sean: Florida and 20.

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:20.380
So were close Portrero mission.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.149
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Nice.

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:27.100
And then also, I was wondering as well, like
Humphrey Slocombe, is definitely ingrained

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.180
in San Francisco culture.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.279
It's really a part of SF, it's in the Where
magazine, it sort of, the Food Network comes

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:33.279
by there to.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.929
Do you ever see this tradition expanding beyond
the Bay Area?

00:23:36.929 --> 00:23:41.919
We had one person, Aporvia who was clamoring
for one in San Diego.

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:44.580
So are we gonna see mail order Humphrey Slocombe.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.190
&gt;&gt;Sean: We actually did mail ice cream for
a little while.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.440
And it was a disaster.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.549
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:51.350
&gt;&gt;Sean: It was so bad.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.590
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's extremely expensive to ship ice
cream.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.100
&gt;&gt;Sean: And it's, the timing has to be perfect.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.380
And you can't mail more than what is it 5
pounds of dry ice and it takes 10.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:09.519
&gt;&gt;Jake: And it was just embarrassing to tell
people how much it cost us for them to buy

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.759
like five pints of ice cream.

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:12.730
Because I.
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Need the dry ice.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.680
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah and then it's like I felt like
they thought we were gouging them.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.510
And really we were not making anything off
that.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.510
It just went to FedEx.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.870
&gt;&gt;Sean: It's hundreds of dollars to get 6
pints of ice cream.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.910
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So you think you'll see flavors
in the pint at Whole Foods or the Package

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.250
Liquor Store or something like that?

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.250
&gt;&gt;Sean: We've been approached.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.289
Yeah, people are asking us.

00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:35.269
&gt;&gt;Jake: We're just a tiny little ice cream
shop right now, we have to figure out, we

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:36.670
have to have a larger production facility.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.759
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Well that's part of its charm
to.

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:41.500
Like you know, you come to San Francisco it's
a destination.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.830
You go to the Mission, experience the food
that's there.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.200
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's still such a wonderful thing
to hear, because we are only three years old.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200
And.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.029
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: It's amazing.

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:53.000
So we have some audience Q&amp;A, so you, sir.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
&gt;&gt;Sean: sweet.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.720
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, a quick question about the
upcoming foie gras brand.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.530
What will happen to the ice cream sandwich
the foie gras ice cream sandwich?

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.530
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's a good question.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.419
&gt;&gt;male #1: Can we have a week of only, everyday
or something?

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:06.679
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: We should have like a secret foie

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:07.679
password.

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:13.379
&gt;&gt;Jake: We're gonna start making it pretty
frequently from now on until what is it?

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:14.879
July, I think is the end.

00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:18.200
&gt;&gt;Sean: July 5th
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah we're gonna have it available

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.700
a lot more until the very end.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.700
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanks.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.700
&gt;&gt;Sean: Thank you.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.009
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you made a cheese ice
cream to that comes out every once in a while.

00:25:24.009 --> 00:25:27.840
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah we made a Government Cheese ice
cream, not very often.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.929
It's very expensive to make.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:32.980
&gt;&gt;Sean: 'Cause we really don't use government
cheese.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.429
&gt;&gt;Jake: We use like an expensive French cheese
called Mimolette.

00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:38.580
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Yeah, no Velveeta equivalent?

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580
&gt;&gt;Sean: Nope.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580
It looks like Velveeta.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.620
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah it looks like Velveeta, the color
looks like Velveeta.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.710
&gt;&gt;Sean: Hi.
&gt;&gt;female #1: Have you guys ever thought about

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:48.840
making your own cones?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.840
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh yeah.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.799
We, we did a lot of cone research.

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:55.850
That's a great question because it's a source
of frustration for both Jake and I.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.919
Cause we love ice cream cones to.

00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:01.210
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, and they smell really good when
you go to a place that makes them.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.710
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh my God how great is that.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.120
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah like Ici and Tara's in Berkeley,
they have amazing ice cream.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.980
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh my god, like Ici's cones are so
good right?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.980
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah they're really good.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.269
Is that something you guys are exploring.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:14.730
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah we fully researched it, I mean
I think this is one of the things that we

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.980
did our due diligence on.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.990
In many ways.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:21.120
Because we do love cones and we went through
how many different kinds?

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120
&gt;&gt;Jake: I don't know.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.630
&gt;&gt;Sean: Like a million
&gt;&gt;Jake: But we're sort of small.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:31.559
The shop is tiny and we can barely keep up
with making the ice cream.

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:36.710
And we get 1000 people a day on the weekends
so I just can't see how we could be able to.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.840
&gt;&gt;Sean: And we go through almost as many cones.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.840
And it keeps the price down which is great.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.360
And you can always get a cone with your scoop.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.830
Like I love getting a scoop of ice cream with
cone on top.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.679
And I call it with a hat.

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:58.309
And you know that way we're able to give that
as an amenity away whereas if we made them

00:26:58.309 --> 00:26:59.960
you know it would be a little more costly.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.320
&gt;&gt;female #1: I think you could probably charge
additional for cones.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320
I know Ici does that.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320
&gt;&gt;Sean: No absolutely.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.559
&gt;&gt;female #1: And so that would help maybe
balance economic of it to.

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:07.299
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, we were gonna go down that road.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:11.100
I mean we, the chefs are already standing
shoulder to shoulder in the kitchen.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100
I feel so bad.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.100
&gt;&gt;female #1: Alright, awesome thanks.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.100
&gt;&gt;Sean: Alright thank you.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.290
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Well I'm a dish myself, so
I've never had to cross the cone question.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.630
&gt;&gt;Jake: I'm a dish person as well, you have
to eat it too fast on the cone.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.630
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Yeah exactly.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.630
&gt;&gt;Sean: I'm a dish and cone.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.940
Like why not both worlds right?

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.499
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Get it all.

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.799
Hi.
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi, thank you for coming.

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:29.850
&gt;&gt;Sean: Thanks for having us.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.720
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah, in your book, you mention
if you're using, if you're gonna go with a

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.540
coffee flavor we recommend Blue Bottle.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.769
Or if you're using, you know, this kind of
milk we recommend this brand.

00:27:40.769 --> 00:27:42.409
That's very helpful, thank you.

00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:47.860
But for someone that's trying to experiment
on their own, how do you recommend, like how

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.950
many times do you guys typically try a certain
brand of chocolate before you move onto the

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:52.950
next one?

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.960
Or can you talk a little bit more about that
experimentation.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.630
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's a good question for Jake.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:04.679
&gt;&gt;Jake: Interesting, I mean I've been cooking
for a long time so I have, like, my favorites.

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:08.370
And we use Recchiuti chocolate at the shop
because it's fairly local and it's delicious.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.009
And it's a little bit more, we started out
using Valrhona.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:13.629
&gt;&gt;Sean: Which is so expensive.

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:19.210
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, it's a little bit more cost
effective.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.400
I, we use products from our friends.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.400
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.590
I would say, just like for me cause I don't
cook at all.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.590
Like at all.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.850
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: I would just start off with what your

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.850
favorite things are.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.340
You know like if you have an awesome coffee
that you think rocks your world like use that

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.350
for the coffee.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.880
We love Blue Bottle because we drink it 20
times a day.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.669
And we love them as a company.

00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:43.250
And I think, we think they do a great job.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.010
But if you have a coffee that you're in love
with, use that, like why not.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:48.010
Make it your own.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.650
&gt;&gt;female #2: All right, I'll bring you some
Hula Pie coffee from Hawaii.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.029
&gt;&gt;Sean: Done, that would be great, thank you.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:57.789
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And you also get you know
these ideas for your fans as well like the

00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:59.630
salted licorice girl if I'm not mistaken.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.100
&gt;&gt;Sean: I feel so bad.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.309
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: If you're watching the video,
come back.

00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:05.200
&gt;&gt;Sean: Salted licorice girl I'm so sorry.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.850
We, I love black licorice.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.580
And we make a salted black licorice ice cream
which is just mind blowingly good.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.289
And we, this is when we first started, it
was just Jake and I.

00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:18.759
And, was I just in a bad mood?

00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:19.759
&gt;&gt;Jake: Well, we were cranky.

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:22.340
&gt;&gt;Sean: I was so over it.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.351
We may have even slept in the store that night
like making ice cream all night.

00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:28.450
And then we opened up and I was just like
please someone stab me in the face.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.960
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Like, I'm just done.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.450
And this girl who I'd made this connection
of salted licorice ice cream with came in

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.559
after coming back from like where did she
go?

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.559
She was like in Sweden.

00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:43.070
She brought back these chocolates, and I didn't
recognize her right away and I was like can

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.070
I help you?

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.692
And she was just like, her eyes got really
big and she just threw the licorice at me.

00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:51.410
And I was like, what the hell just happened?

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.919
And then it hit, automatically click.

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:57.659
So licorice girl, I'm so sorry.

00:29:57.659 --> 00:30:01.679
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: I know, it's difficult because we

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:04.580
see 1000 people a day and they only see the
two of us.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.750
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yeah, it takes us a minute to register.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.549
That's I think one of our biggest restrictions
'cause we meet so many people and were so

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:13.210
happy that people are coming in.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.470
And that they want to say hi to us.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.379
But like it takes a second.

00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:19.129
We need like face recognition software.

00:30:19.129 --> 00:30:20.129
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:30:20.129 --> 00:30:21.380
Can you guys work on that first?

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.220
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: It's like our little private joke,

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:29.010
and it's like we'll be nice to meet you and
they'll be nice to see you again.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.010
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.440
&gt;&gt;Sean: We're like wuh wuh.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.960
&gt;&gt;Jake: Ouch
&gt;&gt;Sean: It's tough.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.779
But salted licorice girl, I'm looking for
you.

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:37.809
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And then you had some other
crazy guests come in as well.

00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:40.639
I remember Ferran Adria stopped by one day.

00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:41.639
&gt;&gt;Sean: Oh my god.

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:42.639
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: So what was that like?

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:43.690
&gt;&gt;Jake: That was huge.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.759
&gt;&gt;Sean: So humbling.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:46.570
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Like one of everything I think.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.129
&gt;&gt;Jake: I mean, he's a culinary rockstar.

00:30:48.129 --> 00:30:52.490
And you know he did have one of everything,
he stayed for like an hour and hung out.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.600
And had his picture taken with everyone in
the shop.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.470
&gt;&gt;Sean: And he's the quote on the back your
books.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.490
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah, and it's just like he travels
with an entourage and his chain-smoking interpreter.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:07.999
&gt;&gt;Sean: And that's what we want, we want an
entourage and a chain-smoking interpreter.

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.240
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jake: It was surreal.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
Yeah.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240
&gt;&gt;Sean: Sure.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.139
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: And so what you think to like
you know with Ferran and the molecular gastronomy.

00:31:16.139 --> 00:31:20.490
We have different ways of making ice cream,
too, so there's a place in SF that does the

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.919
liquid nitrogen-based ice cream.

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:24.869
Like how does that sort of fit in your worldview
with.

00:31:24.869 --> 00:31:27.690
I mean, you got exotic flavors, traditional
methods.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.460
They got some more ordinary flavors, exotic
methods.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.860
&gt;&gt;Sean: We love it, we love Robin.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.860
She's great.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.140
And what a great idea.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.140
You know.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.140
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah it's fun.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.539
&gt;&gt;Sean: I mean Jake and I have always said,
especially in San Francisco there is room

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:40.539
for everybody.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:41.539
&gt;&gt;Jake: Room for everyone.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:43.990
&gt;&gt;Sean: And if you set up 20 more ice cream
places, like there's room.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.669
So go, I think everyone should get as creative
as possible.

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:48.690
And go crazy.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.799
Because it's ice cream, like who doesn't want
ice cream?

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:51.799
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yeah.

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:52.990
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Cool, cool.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:58.730
So I wanted to close by saying, one part of
Google culture that I liked which I think

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.679
really blends in with your thoughts in the
book.

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:02.840
So we have a program called culinary internships.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.760
So for those in the audience that haven't
done it yet, you got to do it.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.499
You go into the café for a morning, you can
spin out some ice cream or froyo.

00:32:09.499 --> 00:32:13.259
And it was really one of the pivotal experiences
of my time at Google was making ice cream

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:14.950
in the café.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.080
&gt;&gt;Sean: Nice.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080
And anybody can do that?

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080
&gt;&gt;Male speaker: Yeah pretty much.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.049
Like you just sign up and you can do different
things too.

00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:24.659
So we had one of our chefs was closing down
the café and so he had whole animal week.

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:28.890
And so it culminated with us, as interns,
making the bacon implosion.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.520
Which was like everything a burrito is except
all the parts are made from bacon.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.890
&gt;&gt;Sean: Nice
&gt;&gt;Male speaker: And then baked in the oven.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:34.890
&gt;&gt;Sean: Yum.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.249
&gt;&gt;Male speaker: So that was like the craziest
thing I made.

00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:38.289
But we do normal things.

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:43.220
We did some Calvados caramel ice cream which
was like an alcoholic candy apple.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.220
&gt;&gt;Sean: Excellent.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.639
&gt;&gt;Jake: Yum
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: It's good stuff.

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:46.990
&gt;&gt;Sean: That's a great idea.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.990
So yes.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.419
&gt;&gt;Jake: It must be a fun place to work.

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:53.059
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Well, you're welcome to stop
by anytime, we had Humphrey Slocombe today.

00:32:53.059 --> 00:32:54.059
But we need to.

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:55.610
&gt;&gt;Jake: Can I have an application?

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.679
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Continue those google dot

00:32:57.679 --> 00:32:58.679
com slash jobs.

00:32:58.679 --> 00:32:59.679
Way to go.

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:00.950
Well, if that's the case.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.179
I wanted to thank you both for stopping by.

00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:06.330
The book, as I said is available in stores
right now, it's the Humphrey Slocombe, ice

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.529
cream book.

00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:10.090
Amazing read, use it to revolutionize your
ice cream at home.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.090
Thank you for stopping by.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.139
&gt;&gt;Sean: Thank you guys, thank you.

00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:13.149
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Sean: Wow.
