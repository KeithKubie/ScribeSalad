so one of the strongest memories I have
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.780
so one of the strongest memories I have
of really getting my hands on in terms

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
of really getting my hands on in terms
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.850
of really getting my hands on in terms
of science and I think is that as a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
of science and I think is that as a

child eva is a student it's all about

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
child eva is a student it's all about
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.260
child eva is a student it's all about
hands-on experiences and for me because

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
hands-on experiences and for me because
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790
hands-on experiences and for me because
when we first I set to the piece heart

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
when we first I set to the piece heart
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.480
when we first I set to the piece heart
and it was so fascinating to do

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
and it was so fascinating to do
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.890
and it was so fascinating to do
something like that and I know it's it's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
something like that and I know it's it's
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170
something like that and I know it's it's
gory and it's quite intense in that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
gory and it's quite intense in that
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820
gory and it's quite intense in that
sense but that's what had a real

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
sense but that's what had a real
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429
sense but that's what had a real
appreciation of that science is part of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
appreciation of that science is part of
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590
appreciation of that science is part of
ourselves and pop every aspect of our

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
ourselves and pop every aspect of our
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440
ourselves and pop every aspect of our
life and our world and just having that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
life and our world and just having that
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.639
life and our world and just having that
kind of hands-on experience and really

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
kind of hands-on experience and really
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.229
kind of hands-on experience and really
getting down and dirty it was a

getting down and dirty it was a
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.000
getting down and dirty it was a
