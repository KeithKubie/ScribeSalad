1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey, I'm Chad. I boom, rod. Hi, I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,840
we begin on a plane. Thank you Brooke,

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,400
which carried our newly married
producer Tim Howard to the Galapagos.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,910
So I took the plane from Quito.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,260
We had just finished the honeymoon
that morning. They got up

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,070
[inaudible] they make announcements
and at a certain point the flight

7
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:27,491
attendants,

8
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:32,170
they open up all of the overhead bins
and they walk up and down sprayings some

9
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:36,560
sort of insecticide
for what? For like, uh,

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,470
invasive species I think. Yeah,

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,260
like whatever bugs might've
snuck out in the brain.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,450
But at this point I'm
getting super excited and I'm
thinking about Darwin and I

13
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:48,850
start reading voyage of the Beagle,

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,520
his book on this new book that
I had bought for the trip,

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,910
but then my power supply
didn't work and my nook died.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,500
That was a big problem for Darren
to run out of power, his book. Okay.

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,450
And then the islands come into site.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,610
What is the color of the Pacific Ocean
when you look at the plane window?

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,180
That was actually the first thing
I noticed. It's this totally wild,

20
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,630
like I've never seen
like this storybook blue,

21
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:18,490
green iridescent aqua marine
and I, I'm thinking like, wow,

22
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,480
this is going to be like dropping
into another world, you know,

23
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:24,280
like nature in its purest form.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,260
My version was is my dream of what it
would be like is you land on it and it

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,190
sort of like low grassy knoll
and an enormous turtle comes by.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,250
The one that you could
sit on the top of it,

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,320
it wouldn't notice that you were there
just going to meet to the airport just

28
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,990
wandering by and that it's
very similar to to what I was

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,590
picturing, but maybe I
need [inaudible] to land.

30
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,550
We take the 40 minute
bus ride to play Yarra

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,280
[inaudible] our Toyota, which
turns out to be kind of a big town.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,970
Tons of people live there. Oh, it's
like a fishing village. Tons. No,

33
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,770
it's way bigger than a fishing village.

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,960
And just let me say that my first hours
in Galapagos work totally different than

35
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,794
I was expecting.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,980
I'm sort of the first thing
that really just like,

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
where the hell am I?

38
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,230
I am walking through the towns kind
of late Sun is just starting to set,

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,020
I'm actually walking down
Charles Darwin Avenue,

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,390
just kind of getting the lay of
the land when all of a sudden

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
[inaudible] this line of cars comes
around the corner honking endless honking

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,050
and waving flags, blue flags. At first
I didn't know what that was happening,

43
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,430
but turns out it was an election

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,620
and I was just really blown away that
this continued this procession for like 15

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
minutes.

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,920
And I remember asking one guy who's gonna
be up though, they're driving so slow,

47
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,800
I can just walk up to them, go and say,
I've got it up. I sold car. I'm like,

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,970
who's your candidate? And they're like,

49
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,520
I didn't know who the guy was, but
it turns out he was the incumbent.

50
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,530
And I'm like, is he gonna win? And this
guy he like doesn't even say anything.

51
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,010
He just kind of points you like points
at the cars in front and behind as if

52
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,270
like, dude, seriously. You
see how many of us there are?

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,660
But then at a certain point I noticed
this one guy by himself standing on the

54
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,800
sidewalk wearing a white shirt
and jeans. He's waving a flag,

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,270
but his flag is a different color.
It's white and it's really loud.

56
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:47,950
But I go up to him and I yell at
him, who's your candidate? He said,

57
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,110
I am a candidate. And I'm like,
what are you kidding? Seriously.

58
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,930
So his name is laminate

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,680
[inaudible] [inaudible]
he is a naturalist guide.

60
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,850
You actually ended up meeting a lot of
people employed that way in Galapagos and

61
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:09,200
he tells me [inaudible] outsider
politica politically speaking,

62
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,400
he's an outsider.

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,420
And of course I'm wondering why he's
standing there by himself waving a flag at

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,230
this entire parade of people
who don't support him at all.

65
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,470
And he tells me cl
moment, well I'm nervous

66
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,220
[inaudible] if the party in power now
the front runners, if they get elected,

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,293
they

68
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,990
[inaudible] [inaudible] and I
see a dark and uncertain future.

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,560
The hotel is more big hotels,
more of these enormous boats,

70
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:44,561
more people [inaudible] and
if things keep going this way,

71
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,480
who's going to stand up for nature?

72
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,390
This is Radiolab and we are dedicating
the entire hour to this little set of

73
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,130
islands. And to that question,

74
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,940
as the world is filling up with
more and more and more people,

75
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,310
is it inevitable that
even the most sacred,

76
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:06,120
pristine places on the planet
will eventually get swallowed up?

77
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,220
And how far are we willing to go to return
a place to what it was before we got

78
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,810
there? And more importantly,

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,680
can we, oh, I'm never a
doubter. Okay, so this is Linda.

80
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,120
Linda Caio currently the science
advisor for Galapagos Conservancy.

81
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,220
I began my work in Galapagos in 1981
she first came to study tortoises back

82
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:31,790
then. You know, Galapagos
was really isolated,

83
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,150
barely any cars, super
limited electricity.

84
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,270
All I remember is having a smile on
my face all the time because you know,

85
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,520
as a biologist going to
Galapagos is like going to Mecca.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,610
[inaudible]

87
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,060
she says you have islands with
massive volcanoes, forests,

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,190
tree ferns that grow, you know,
well above a human's height.

89
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,070
Yeah, I mean powerful
colors. You know, there's

90
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,850
green mangroves, black flower
flows and pink flamingos.

91
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,970
This is Mathias Espinosa and naturalist
guide in Nicola was in like Linda,

92
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,970
he says that when he first got to the
Galapagos in the 80s he couldn't believe

93
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,130
that the place was real
to his breast taken.

94
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,430
He visited an island called Fernandina
and the first thing they saw was a of

95
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,330
fluid was moving

96
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,050
[inaudible].

97
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes. What's what's going on, you know?
No, no, that's not the lava flow.

98
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,190
This is like 1000 seat
Iguanas taking a sunbath

99
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,290
and he says he would go on these dive.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,533
Can you imagine

101
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,610
the school itself,

102
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,610
how the head checks like 500 800
passing in front of you like tuna?

103
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,750
I mean like, like sardines.
It shows you the power.

104
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,910
It shows you all for evolution.
There is revolutions, varies child.

105
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,910
Okay, so quick context,

106
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,930
a Galapagos islands cluster of islands
way off the coast of Ecuador in the

107
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:04,250
Pacific, 19 bigger islands, bunch of
smaller ones. And this is the place,

108
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:04,880
of course,

109
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,880
we're Darwin landed in 1835 and
as he went island to island,

110
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,600
he started noticing that there were
all of these creatures that were really

111
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,720
similar to each other, but
also a little bit different.

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,580
The tortoise's had different shells
depending on the kind of island they lived

113
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,170
on. The finches look similar,

114
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,470
but their beaks were always a little bit
different. And this gets him thinking,

115
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,500
what if it isn't the way
that everybody always says?

116
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,090
What if God didn't create every single
species in the beginning and leave them

117
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,660
unchanged? What if in fact
life is purely change?

118
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,390
What if everything has
been changing all the time?

119
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,820
Darwin's five weeks on Galapagos push
him to develop his theory of evolution.

120
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,790
And that's also why when
we think of evolution,

121
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,160
we think of the Galapagos
and in particular

122
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,160
we think of two iconic
creatures, the tortoise

123
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,270
and the finch.

124
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,320
Let me start by telling you about
the tortoise. It's hot, it's bright.

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,190
It's such a perfect day for tortoise.

126
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,800
Something are not hunting. But you know,

127
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,310
looking for fourth day I was there. Um,

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,170
I went to the island of Floriana,

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,820
which Darwin visited and they're up in
the highlands basically in the middle of

130
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,680
this yard. Oh my God.

131
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,420
There are these three massive tortoise's
just clustered together under a tree.

132
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,150
Wow. That is freaking amazing.
Describes them. What do they look like?

133
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,260
These are such alien looking creatures.
They're like the size of, Jeez,

134
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,790
I don't even know what they're massive.

135
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,400
They look like they would
crush you to death. Well,

136
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,870
now how many years these
guys have been here for?

137
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,540
They can live for over 150 years. Wow.

138
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,460
[inaudible] is trying
to get over a branch.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,240
[inaudible]

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,140
who is that? That is the
sound of a tortoise breathe.

141
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,243
That's cool.

142
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,030
So, uh, Linda,

143
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,630
when she first went to Galapagos to
study these [inaudible] is about 30 years

144
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:15,420
ago. I did a trip where we
backpacked around the Caldera.

145
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,160
She took a trip to this island called
Isabella hiked up the side of a volcano

146
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,780
and looked at all the tortoise country
and it was an impenetrable forest,

147
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,420
basically tortoise heaven.

148
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,450
And what makes it so perfect
for tortoise's is in the
dry season in Galapagos

149
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,380
that go Roula, which is a very, very
thick mist, comes onto the island.

150
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,300
It rolls over this forest and it
catches in the branches of the trees.

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,880
The water then drips down from the top
of the trees down to the ground creating

152
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,140
what we call drip pools,

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,690
which provides tortoises with
water during the dry season.

154
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,760
And they liked to rest in water.

155
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,890
And so there under the trees you have
these ponds with dozens of Torrid's domes

156
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,480
just rising out of the water.

157
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,030
So that was my first experience. It
was a magical, magical area. And then,

158
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,440
um,

159
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,550
I actually didn't get back there for
maybe 15 years from when I was there the

160
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:17,384
first time.

161
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,930
And when I returned that
forest was 100% gone.

162
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,300
The drip pools were just
dry dust bowls. Wow.

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,130
There was no shade tortoises where
we're sitting out in the sun or,

164
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:39,250
or crowded around the couple of
stalks that were still there.

165
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,750
This is Carl Campbell.

166
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,740
I work for island conservation and I'm
based here in the Galapagos Islands.

167
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,460
Carl's actually the guy who showed me
those tortoises. Um, it was just a, yeah,

168
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:49,720
it was a barren landscape.

169
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,650
Yeah. Barron Barron grounds.
What happened to the forest? Um,

170
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,823
goats.

171
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,530
Goats. That was definitely not what
I thought you were going to say.

172
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,320
I thought you were gonna say people,
it was kind of a collaboration.

173
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,700
So here's the story.

174
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,220
Goats were originally sort of brought
to the Galapagos and probably by pirates

175
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:14,630
and wireless back in the 15 hundreds.
You had tons of sailors making these,

176
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:18,580
these long voyages across the Pacific.
And uh, Galapagos was, you know,

177
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,650
the major port on, on the
whaling route, um, where yeah,

178
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,130
you'd come and get fresh
water, but you'd also, uh,

179
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,190
come in and pick up a tortoise's plan
tortoises and boats and take away several

180
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,650
hundred of them often and turn them
upside down and they can last for up to a

181
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,613
year and a half.

182
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,020
Shit, like lying there upside down. Yeah.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,920
Lying there upside down in order
to make space for the tortoises.

184
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,760
The whalers and pirates would often take
goats that they brought with them and

185
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:47,840
throw them onto the islands.

186
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,410
That way when they're on their way
back and sick of eating tortoises,

187
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,260
they could grab those goats.
So whalers and Buccaneers,

188
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,310
they introduced goats to Galapagos,
but on islands like Isabella,

189
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,370
which is this massive
island size of Rhode Island,

190
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,810
the goats were actually penned in to just
a little part of it because there was

191
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:12,400
this black lava rock that ran across
the island stream, Lee rough lava,

192
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,730
that's extremely difficult to
walk across 12 miles of it.

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,270
So that had acted as a barrier
basically with goats on one side,

194
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,080
tortoises on the other.
But according to Linda,

195
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,830
some sometime in the late
1970s the goats got brave.

196
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,230
We were probably talking just a few goats,

197
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,850
but by the 1990s those few goats,

198
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,670
the population had exploded and you
just about a hundred thousand goats.

199
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,080
And if you think of 100,000 goats
eating everything in their path,

200
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,310
every sort of plant that even the bark
off of trees, they destroy the forest.

201
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,920
So now they had a dilemma. On the
one hand, the tortoise's needed help.

202
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,813
On the other hand,

203
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,750
you had all of these goats that didn't
choose to be on the island. You know,

204
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:05,470
it wasn't their fault. And the goats
that were out there were gorgeous.

205
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,690
You know, they had curled horns, different
colored fur, just beautiful animals.

206
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
And they'd been there for 500 years.

207
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,950
Some people were concerned, you know,
with the goats have their own sort of,

208
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,880
if you will, right to be there. Those
arguments came up frequently. Do,

209
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:24,960
which Carl would respond. Yeah. Are we
going to let tortoise's go extinct? Yeah.

210
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:28,020
There's thousands of islands around
the world that have goats on them.

211
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,050
These tortoises are only found
here. So where do your values lie?

212
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,820
[inaudible]

213
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,820
and so in 1994 we had what we called
the tortoise summit in England.

214
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,110
And that was where we started the
discussions about what are we gonna do?

215
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,930
Experts came from all over
the world. Linda says,

216
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,130
we want to get rid of the goats.

217
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,910
And many of them thought we were
nuts and that it was impossible.

218
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,530
There's 100,000 of them. So many doubters.
Carl says he even heard the idea,

219
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,010
why don't you put lines?

220
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,410
Yeah, they eat, go and see in Africa.
Yeah, why don't you get lines on there?

221
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,960
And those are really interesting ideas,

222
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,200
but at some point they're going to get
hungry and they're gonna start eating all

223
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:10,920
the other things that you know, you
treasure bike, the occasional tourist.

224
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,870
In any case, after endless planning
and meetings took eight years,

225
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,550
I think they commence

226
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,140
project Isabella.

227
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,800
So the helicopters we used,

228
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,630
they're [inaudible] MD five hundreds
small helicopter there for four passengers

229
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,060
with one pilot, single
turbine, five blades.

230
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,800
This is phrased phrase a Sutherland.

231
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,860
I was the engineer pilot and sharp shooter
2004 through to 2006 almost everyday.

232
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,140
During that time, Frazier
would fly over Isabela island.

233
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,100
Two guys with two shooters are the
side of the helicopter. What you do is,

234
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:50,490
so you come across when you're flying
along and you might see one guy says he

235
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,240
followed that goal, does it
ran away till join its friends?

236
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you have to find all those
other guides circled real low?

237
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,960
You'd fly around them, around them up,
try and get them in with a single grape,

238
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,303
and then

239
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,300
you start picking off the
goats one by one by one.

240
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,790
And there are actually videos online
where you see these packs of goats running

241
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,290
for their lives and then
dropping to the ground.

242
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,050
The last goat or two might sort of run
into a area where it's impossible to

243
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,600
reach, oh actually go into

244
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,623
caves.

245
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,110
And what would do is would find a location
as close as we could or ride on top

246
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:32,860
of the cave,

247
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,920
drop out one of the two shooters that
was in the helicopter and he'd physically

248
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:38,540
go into the cave shoe,

249
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,290
the goats out or shoot them on site.

250
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,440
And then you go on and actually in
under a year through this aerial attack,

251
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,620
they end up wiping out 90%
of the goats on Isabella.

252
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,450
But to give an example of the nature
of this business, that's Josh Donlin.

253
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,060
He runs an NGO that was
involved in project Isabella.

254
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,190
It's relatively easy to remove 90%
of a goat population from an island.

255
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,480
But as they become rare and rare,
they're harder and harder to detect.

256
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,300
The goats become quote,
educated. They learn that

257
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,240
sound means

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,750
so the goats start hiding.
So they'll go onto bushes,

259
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,170
they won't move to learn to stand
under a tree, holding their breath.

260
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,100
And so you end up flying around
and an expensive helicopter,

261
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,570
not finding an it goes. Now the way we
deal with that, it's an interesting one.

262
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:33,110
We use this technique
called Judas goats. Yeah,

263
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,970
Judas goats. Initially it was,
Carl's suggestion was goats, uh,

264
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,830
gregarious and like being in groups.
They're herd animals, right? And so,

265
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,250
uh, the technique that we would
use was you would fire them,

266
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,370
the helicopter, you fly around, you'd
find some goats, you capture goats,

267
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,550
capture them, lie, and then
come back back to base camp.

268
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,010
Offload Dan and

269
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,790
we put a radio collar on him and
you throw them back on the island

270
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,753
and then you wait.

271
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,120
Instinctively that lone guy will
go and find out the goats. A week.

272
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:14,840
Two weeks go by, you fire up the
helicopter, they get back over

273
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,220
the island with this little
device. It's a directional antenna.

274
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,870
Start Tracking the Judas go fill. They
spot it with some other goats and then

275
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,280
everyone gets shot except the
Judas go there. [inaudible]

276
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,110
go finds more friends and then

277
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,390
everyone gets shot except the Judas go.

278
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,250
And then they do it again.

279
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,890
Everyone will get shot
except the Judas go.

280
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,660
And you do that every two
weeks for a year. Oh my God.

281
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,070
And that is how they

282
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,070
go from 90% go free to 91 to 92 to 93
to 94 just like having a pogrom on you

283
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:00,060
over and over and over
again. Jesus, it gets worse.

284
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Now Judas Goat is a good Judas goat until
it gets pregnant cause then it doesn't

285
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,410
want to be social anymore.

286
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,430
It goes off and has this
kid and is very solitary,

287
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,160
which is the last thing you want when
you're trying to get goats off islands.

288
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,730
So Carl kept mulling this problem.
What would it take to basically make,

289
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,590
you know, the the perfect year disco,
the Ideal Judas goat, if you will.

290
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,280
Um,

291
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,180
is it goat that would search for and be
searched for and that would never get

292
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:27,660
pregnant.

293
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,660
So curl Campbell figured out a technique
where we could sterilize them in the

294
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:33,660
field.

295
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,890
It grabbed the goats Darden and then in
a matter of minutes SnipSnap did you do

296
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:41,940
this? Yeah. Well I, I stood next
to Karl and watched him do it

297
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,470
and Carl took it one step further and
he actually gave these females hormone

298
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,100
implants, basically put them in
the heat for an extended duration.

299
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,890
Normally a female goat would be in
heat for maybe a couple of days.

300
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,600
These females would go for more than
190 days. And wherever they went,

301
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,080
they would lower those male goats out
of their caves. So that, you know,

302
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,600
all in all over the course
of this two year program,

303
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,920
we had hundreds of Judas goats
out and using those goats,

304
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,480
they were able to go from 94%
goat free to 96 to 97 to 98.

305
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,920
And basically when you have only Judas
goats meeting up with other Judas Coats,

306
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,580
then you can say the goats have been
eliminated, that you're down a point.

307
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,850
They got to, at least
on Isabella in mid 2006,

308
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,373
uh,

309
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,710
this kind of eradication program was
far beyond anything that anyone had ever

310
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,790
done anywhere in the room

311
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,180
because it turns out they weren't just
doing this on Isabella island. No,

312
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,840
we're talking about island by island.
Over the course of about seven years,

313
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:55,110
they eliminate over 250,000 goats.

314
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,523
[inaudible]

315
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,520
so you, um,

316
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,450
you complete that with
Isabella and did it work?

317
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,650
Yeah. The results of this
were absolutely impressive.

318
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,460
You had plants re-emerging you had
trees growing back and in a really short

319
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:19,461
period of time and this allowed for
those important drip pools and tortoises,

320
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,930
they basically got their home back.

321
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:23,860
[inaudible]

322
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,210
this is a real thing.

323
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,490
Tortoise's walking around

324
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,380
[inaudible]

325
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,140
same craven. So they did
it. They got all the goats,

326
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,100
not all the goats. What do
you mean there's Judas goats?

327
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,710
They kept them around. Why? I would just,

328
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,630
I would've shot them first out of
sympathy for them. Yeah, exactly. Well,

329
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,270
they needed the goats because, well

330
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,890
there was the problem of people

331
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,350
[inaudible]

332
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,280
because during the 90s these
demonstrations started.

333
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,553
That happened.

334
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,660
Demonstrations. So outrage
and violent activities.

335
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,610
Yeah.

336
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,010
Constant conflict to explain

337
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
[inaudible] [inaudible] this is
Augustine Lopez, longtime fisherman.

338
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,640
And he told me that in
the 70s and eighties

339
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,170
[inaudible] lobster was fished all
year round. Have you have it yet? Okay,

340
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,870
no restrictions.

341
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,800
And then fishermen started making a
killing fishing sea cucumber because there

342
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:42,130
was this huge demand. But then
the national park comes in,

343
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,490
same group that's doing the
goat eradication and they
tell the fisherman they're

344
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,920
overfishing, the sea cucumber.
They've got to limit their catch.

345
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,820
And the fishermen are like, who are you
to tell me that I can't feed my family?

346
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,853
So they lash out.

347
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,263
[inaudible]

348
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,370
they marched down Charles Darwin Avenue.

349
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,820
They would come down the street throwing
rocks and sticks and everything.

350
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,410
And that's Paul Watson, founder of this
East Shepherd Conservation Society.

351
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,150
He was there counter protesting,

352
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,390
and he says that at one point they went
after national park buildings and they

353
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:15,560
were attacking the ranger stations with
Molotov cocktails. They blockaded roads.

354
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:19,100
They literally drove the Rangers out of
the National Park headquarters and took

355
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:22,910
it over on Isabella. They burned down
a building, the kidnap some people,

356
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:26,990
including some of my crew. And
they even killed dozens of towards

357
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,480
it says slitting their throats
according to some accounts.

358
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:36,460
They even hung them from trees. Uh, so,

359
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
but not only that, but
according to Linda, those goats,

360
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,550
couple islands where they've been
eliminated, fishermen have put them back.

361
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,540
Really? Oh yeah.

362
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,290
And so what they decided to do is leave
the Judas goats on various islands where

363
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:56,850
they can live out their sterilized
days, chomping on grass,

364
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,170
sharing war stories until such time

365
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,780
as they might be needed. Again.

366
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,970
It, the F is the war between the Greens
and the and the fisherman and Sochi.

367
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,180
Is that still hot and difficult
and are they still, you know,

368
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,920
killing tortoises and they're
not the fishermen? Um,

369
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,830
they seem to have stopped, you know,

370
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:32,060
taking over national park and
killing tortoises to know why it,

371
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,270
it's a combination of
reasons. On the one hand,

372
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,340
fishermen have started to participate
in the actual fisheries management more

373
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,550
cause it seems like they realize if
they're going to keep their livelihood,

374
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,100
they can't just fish everything
out. But then at the same

375
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,780
time the tourism economy has been taking
off. And so all of these fishermen,

376
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,980
they find that it's easier for them to
actually survive by using their boats,

377
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,410
um, to take tourists
around island to island.

378
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,870
So they're all kind of converting
over into the tourism economy.

379

This is radio lab and this hour,

399
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,610
well the honeymoon's over Galapagos.

400
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,600
This is the place where Darwin began to
develop his theory of evolution and it's

401
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,670
the place 170 year or maybe, Eh,

402
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,830
180 years later where our producer Tim
Howard landed wearing fishnets in a bad

403
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:28,180
brains tee shirt to find,

404
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,990
to find a very different
landscape than what Darwin saw.

405
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,320
And we just told you a story about how
far humans are willing to go to protect

406
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:36,730
something. This next part,

407
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,350
it's about how far we're willing to go
to get something back that we've already

408
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:46,030
lost to sort of restore a place and
a creature to its quote. Wild state.

409
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,440
This story unfolds on one of Galapagos
is most northern islands where they also

410
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:52,950
had to get rid of some goats.
Oh, it's called Pinta. Pinta.

411
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,810
Pintos was a very special
place. This is James Gibson,

412
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,840
professor of conservation biology
at the State University of New York.

413
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,950
It's a one of those islands. It's not
part of any tourist visitation site.

414
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,390
So there are no people there. And
uh, when you set foot first on Pinto,

415
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:11,470
you immediately sense sure

416
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,353
[inaudible] birds

417
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,650
problem is on pin a, things
were spinning out of control.

418
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,920
The vegetation was growing wild,

419
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,660
the forest was getting overgrown
with the wrong kind of plant.

420
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,680
And the whole ecosystem was
just teetering out of balance.

421
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,770
And one of the reasons for this,

422
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:43,500
according to Linda Coyote is that
we had an island with no tortoises

423
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,980
because tortoises are
sorta like the lawn mower.

424
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,110
You know, they, they plow down
vegetation, disperse seeds,

425
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,300
but for centuries had been hunted
by those whalers. And in about 1906,

426
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,700
the pinto tortoise went
extinct. 1906 yeah,

427
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,010
a little over a hundred years ago.
They don't know the exact date,

428
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,270
but then one evening in March of 1972

429
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,660
yes, this fellow pizza, she h partook.
He's a well known tortoise researcher.

430
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,930
He was on Santa Cruz island having
dinner with some friends and we got to

431
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,650
chatting about tours. And one of the
people he's eating with says, Hey, uh,

432
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:25,150
I was recently on Pinna island
collecting snails and I saw this tortoise

433
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,740
and I thought, do you
know what you have done?

434
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,830
[inaudible] a hundred years.

435
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,980
He in some National Park Rangers race
out to Pinta and there was this beautiful

436
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,040
shoulders, one male
tortoise, maybe 50 years old.

437
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:45,720
They weren't sure they'd eventually
name Him George Lonesome George.

438
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,170
But at the time the immediate
question was, are there any more?

439
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,900
Because if they could find a female
for George, then they could, you know,

440
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,070
maybe de extinct the species.

441
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,120
So I poked around in the areas where
we've got the one and I found a shell of a

442
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,530
female dead animal. Oh, it won't happen.

443
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,190
Well, how had, how had this
female toward his died?

444
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,270
Uh, someone chopped it in half. No,

445
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,310
you see the marks where
it was just chopped up.

446
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,130
I felt violent. I wanted
to borrow someone's gun.

447
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,230
I'd gone kill the person.

448
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,230
Everyone held out hopes for just
finding more tortoises back.

449
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,570
James says they kept going back and
combing the island with highly trained

450
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,330
tortoise sniffing dogs. But
in the end there was just,

451
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:35,360
George then shifted the
focus on, now what do we do?

452
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:42,250
We then went to a wolf volcano island
next door and collected two females,

453
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,680
two females that sort of looked like
George but weren't quite the same species.

454
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,960
And we put them with George to
see if we could get him to breed.

455
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,400
He never did

456
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,420
well. It's an interesting, so they
thought, hmm, maybe he needs a pinto lady.

457
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,140
So now of course there are no female
tortoises on Pinta, but they thought,

458
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:00,321
you know,

459
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,620
maybe a zoo somewhere or
private collection has one
cause you really never know.

460
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,080
So they called around,
offered huge cash rewards.

461
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,790
People sent in dozens of tortoises.

462
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,350
But Linda took one look at them
and was like, no, no, no, no,

463
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,370
they weren't Pinterest.

464
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,900
So then they thought we've got to
take matters into our own hands.

465
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,960
Basically what you do is you sit at the
back of the tortoise and first you have

466
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:27,910
to get to where they'll allow you to
touch them. Um, and eventually you start,

467
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,630
um, you know, fondling their,

468
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,360
their legs and tails and,

469
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,220
and hoping to get them to ejaculate
and had a volunteer working with me.

470
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:42,010
Her name was viva greed,
Gianni. She worked with

471
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,180
him every other day or so for a few
months and was never successful.

472
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,800
We were really starting to get
kind of desperate about options.

473
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,910
And James says, in a way it was a
paradox because on the one hand, awesome,

474
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:58,570
we have an actual living Pinta island
tortoise. But on the other hand,

475
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,770
he might've actually been like the
worst possible candidate for last of his

476
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,380
kind. He seemed to really
like to keep to himself.

477
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:07,690
He never really liked
other tortoises much.

478
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:10,900
He didn't seem to like humans
and maybe that's why he survived.

479
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:15,280
He wasn't curious. Yes. James says a lot
of tortoises, they hear your footsteps,

480
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,330
they raise their heads,

481
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,690
they come out to see what's going
on and then they get whacked. Yeah.

482
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,720
In any case, for about 40 years,

483
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,450
scientists tried everything
humanly possible to get loan,

484
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,810
some George to meet with another tortoise
so they could resurrect the species

485
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,880
and bring Pinta island back to
its original state. Nothing worked

486
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,763
until

487
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,570
one day in July of 2008 George turns
to the two female tortoises that he had

488
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:48,060
been ignoring for years and he says

489
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,200
inexplicably, he just suddenly
decides to me with both of them,

490
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,180
they each lay eggs.

491
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,720
Two clutches were ultimately laid in
his corral and the scientists are like,

492
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,620
doc George got our hopes up dramatically,

493
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,760
but they ultimately were infertile.

494
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,483
Mother

495
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,360
mid eighties they were having a meeting
about this. That's conservationist.

496
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,330
Josh Donlin again,

497
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,280
whole bunch of herpetologists were out
there and some island conservationist and

498
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,670
they're talking about what to do
Pinta and they can't get one of them,

499
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:29,140
George to reproduce,

500
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:32,170
which we were hoping to do because then
they could build a Pinta population and

501
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,770
put it on Pinta and he says that as
the meeting wore on, it got tense. Oh,

502
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,330
for sure. In fact, one guy spoke

503
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,081
Harry Green,

504
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,530
I'm a professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology at Cornell University

505
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,630
said that at this meeting there was
one guy who just couldn't take it.

506
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,590
Oh, all I remember is him just fuming.

507
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,860
He sat there getting more
and more and more frustrated.

508
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,500
Then finally he just blurted out,

509
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,780
shoot that tortoise and
uh, quit wasting our time.

510
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,363
[inaudible]

511
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,310
because in his view, this,

512
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,640
the single individual was holding up
this huge conservation [inaudible]

513
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,240
and of course the shock was there was
a way went around the room when he said

514
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,074
that.

515
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,670
I recall seeing sort of second wave as
the Spanish translation of passed around

516
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:17,380
the room.

517
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,850
And really what that guy was specifically
saying was, don't be precious.

518
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,650
A tortoise as a tortoise, as a tortoise.

519
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,460
Let's just take some tortoises from a
nearby island and put them back on Penta,

520
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,720
but there's a much bigger question
here that that goes way beyond globe

521
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,890
[inaudible],

522
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,460
which is basically like, what is
the right way to protect nature?

523
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,070
Now people are right now
throwing beers at each

524
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,710
other around what is the right strategy.

525
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,510
[inaudible]

526
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,290
Josh says that there are basically
two camps right now on the one side,

527
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,430
you've got this classic,

528
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:52,610
like what you might call Eden
approach conservation biology.

529
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,750
It's foundation is this idea of pristine
wilderness from the very beginning.

530
00:32:57,751 --> 00:33:00,720
I think all of us, well, I can't
speak for other people, but,

531
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,810
but you always have this idea of wanting
to get it back to some kind of pre

532
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,310
human condition.

533
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,510
Every human being the operative
word. And, and if you think about it,

534
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,010
we all have this. We all have this,

535
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,250
this picture of what we want
to bring it all back to,

536
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,190
you know what might be like, oh,

537
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,490
the planes just covered with buffalo, or,

538
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,110
or maybe the Serengeti desert
with lions and elephants,

539
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,840
or maybe it's 10,000 hammerhead
sharks, but whatever the scene is,

540
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,110
it just doesn't have any people.
But is carrying that idea,

541
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,830
those pictures of your head
even like youthful anymore.

542
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,820
It's like so Sanuk no, but
it just seems so unrealistic.

543
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,400
Right? But I mean, in the bigger picture,

544
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:46,600
you can make the argument that humans
now affect every square meter of the

545
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,400
earth.

546
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,960
There's no place, no matter how remote
we get, you can go to the North Pole.

547
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:55,650
It's been affected by human
activity. You can go, I don't know,

548
00:33:55,651 --> 00:34:00,480
the depths of the impenetrable jungle.
It's been affected by human activity.

549
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,960
That's how they dream is
she's an environmental law
professor at the Berkeley

550
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,710
School of law in California. You're
radically remaking the world.

551
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,860
And the question is,
what's our responsibility?

552
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,870
And this brings us to our
second school of thought,

553
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:17,580
which in its most extreme version goes
something like this. We're God. Yeah,

554
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,910
we might as well get good at it.

555
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,110
And we're going to have to create these
ecosystems based on our best science.

556
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,670
And you could argue we're going to have
to get a whole lot better at making some

557
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,140
very, very difficult decisions.

558
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Climate change seems to mean that a
lot of species are pretty much doomed,

559
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:50,370
30% 40% 50% of the species now on
the planet in a few decades maybe

560
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,713
disappearing.

561
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:57,930
And this is what I think is really the
tough question now is if we can see EAD

562
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,200
that we can't any longer
save all the species,

563
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,050
then does that put us in the situation
of having to decide which ones we'll save

564
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:09,100
and which ones we won't?

565
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:12,100
And do we have any basis for
making those kinds of decisions?

566
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,813
Hmm.

567
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,570
So you're saying that the, that the
club, let's go back to when it was good.

568
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,220
Let's go back to a better
time. That's just silly.

569
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,150
I didn't say it was silly. Okay. What
did you yeah, I said it was impossible.

570
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,340
Thinks might not be silly.
They might not be stupid ideas,

571
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,220
but we still might not be able
to do them. Okay. So here's, um,

572
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,283
a

573
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,293
plaque.

574
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,400
It says lonesome George is the last
survivor of the dynasty of land.

575
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,170
Tortoise is from Pinta island.

576
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,260
And in fact in 2012 after
decades of trying to get him to,

577
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,663
to Breed

578
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,550
[inaudible]

579
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,550
lonesome George Dies r I p 24th of June,

580
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,413
2012

581
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,890
and the [inaudible] went
extinct. So damn case in point,

582
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:09,100
I guess no, going back. Yeah,
I mean that's what I thought.

583
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,750
But then I spoke with this woman. Hello.
Hello. Just tell it. Do you hear me?

584
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:18,440
Yes, I do. Who kind of
scrambled everything up for
me. Can I get you to, um,

585
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,030
introduce yourself? Yes.
My name is [inaudible].

586
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,860
I am a senior research scientist at
Yale University. And just tell us,

587
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:29,290
come up with kind of a radical
idea. I call it the Phoenix project.

588
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,970
Here's the backstory.

589
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,970
In the mid nineties we started in 94 to
Cielo and some folks from the Galapagos

590
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,790
National Park, they began taking a census
of all the tortoises in the Galapagos,

591
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,220
the population of tortoises
on all the islands.

592
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,170
They were going to do this
big population studies.

593
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:45,460
So they went island by island,

594
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:47,680
took a little bit of blood from
all these different tortoises,

595
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,700
did a genetic analysis and Oh,

596
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:53,080
pla found something they never expected.

597
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,560
A group of tortoise is not on
Pinta that had a lot of Pinto

598
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,180
DNA. I remember very clearly. That
moment was very, very exciting.

599
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:06,190
It's like, yes, look at this. Yeah.

600
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,140
Wait, you're saying this Pinta DNA was
on a nother island? Yeah. None on Pinta.

601
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,470
No. Well, how would that happen?
Um, we don't think it was natural.

602
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,830
Just Ella thinks it might've
been the whalers made.

603
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,260
They're the whalers or the pirates,

604
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:19,681
you know,

605
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:23,340
because like we talked about in the
1718 hundreds these whalers would come

606
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,950
along, grab a bunch of
tortoises, put them on the ship,

607
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,870
and then they would hunt
for whales or [inaudible].

608
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,930
And sometimes when they were done in the,

609
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,470
the ship was filled with Wale products.

610
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,310
Here they throw a few
extra tortoises overboard.

611
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,780
Say a few from Pinta, maybe those pins,

612
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:46,890
tortoises swam with occurrence to that
nearby island set up a little ex-pat

613
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:47,724
community

614
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,110
[inaudible]

615
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,440
and started breeding with the locals.
That's our working hypothesis,

616
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,950
which brings us to her idea.

617
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,240
Perfect.

618
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,661
You know,

619
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:03,661
on average 50% of your genome comes
from your mom and 50% from your dad,

620
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:05,050
but it's an average.

621
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,130
So just sell it though. Just by
chance, some of these tortoises,

622
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,060
they're gonna have a little bit more
Pinta DNA from their Pinta ancestors than

623
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:15,060
others. Yes. So what if
we took those tortoises

624
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,410
and bred them together?

625
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,440
So act them for the next generation so
that you can give a push to this process.

626
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,680
She says, if we keep doing this, taking
the babies with the most painted DNA,

627
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,870
breeding them together slowly,

628
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,530
surely in four generations you could
have 90% of the painter genome restored.

629
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,920
Really? Yeah. But

630
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,370
that's four generations
of tortoises, not rats,

631
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,670
which means at least a hundred
years. But in the meantime, the,

632
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:48,070
the vegetation on Pinta is growing out
of control from an ecological point of

633
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:52,540
view. Painter can't wait. So in
2009 they come up with a stop gap.

634
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,580
They take 39 tortoises raised in captivity
and they use them as placeholders.

635
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,570
They sterilize them and put them
on Pinta. [inaudible]. Yeah.

636
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,060
Well these are very purest sort of
visions. Okay. Yeah. They sterilize them.

637
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:10,260
39 of them should, they're just basically
the lawn mowers. They're not. Exactly,

638
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,480
and they put them on Pinto and
they're just chomping away right now.

639
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:18,310
They're living out their lives
really happily on Pinta, you know,

640
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:19,660
until the originals are ready.

641
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,390
Now Linda says in the end,

642
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:26,660
you don't actually need to do the full
aggressive for generation breeding thing.

643
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,320
You can just take the best
Pinta is tortoises you find

644
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,950
and put those on Pinto and you know,

645
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,980
over the next 200,000 years

646
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,550
they will evolve into a paint a tortoise
and it could be a bit different than

647
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,190
the past.

648
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,290
Paint a tortoise because evolution and
mutation and all of that doesn't occur

649
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,124
the same.

650
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,180
But eventually nature's going to take over

651
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
and they will evolve
into painted tortoises.

652
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,170
[inaudible] [inaudible]

653
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,620
is this the way that everybody who
works on the tortoises thinks about it?

654
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:16,000
This kind of deep time? I don't know.

655
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,140
I'm not sure many other
people think about that.

656
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,250
We'll be back in less than 200,000 years
am but we will be different when we

657
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,370
come back and we will stay tuned. Hi,

I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab today,

673
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,830
a whole hour on the Galapagos Islands.

674
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:29,790
The place that inspired Charles Darwin
to create his theory of evolution,

675
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:34,970
whose basic ingredients are lots of
time isolation and then constant change.

676
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:39,270
But Darwin didn't
consider this possibility.

677
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,580
What if on these islands,

678
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,840
thousands of tourists arrive every
day carrying fruits and chocolates and

679
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,120
souvenirs, jumping from island to island.

680
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,720
Now the Galapagos government spends
millions of dollars checking all of the

681
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:55,230
goods that come in and out trying to
quarantine the ones that might have things

682
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:56,064
that are a problem.

683
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,640
But what if simply putting your foot on
the ground can completely transform it?

684
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,860
A place that

685
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,910
[inaudible] active producer Tim Howard.
So I met this woman named Hunky Yeager,

686
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,750
who is a like a plant scientist.

687
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm the restoration ecologist at
the Charles Darwin Foundation,

688
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,950
and here we are in Los Angeles.

689
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,640
We were going to look at these incredible
craters called low semi-loads. Oh,

690
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:26,050
I almost got hit by a car. And as we're
walking along the path, let's see.

691
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,390
She's like, oh wait,
look at this right here.

692
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,560
She points just to the right of the
path. Look at this species here.

693
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,490
Small leafy green thing. They
call it Yangton and Spanish.

694
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,760
It is in it's plantar ago,

695
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,830
I think in the u s they call it the,
um, was it the wrench of the white man?

696
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,610
The range of the white man? Yes. It's
actually the footprint of the white man.

697
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,390
It doesn't matter. Point is an
introduced species. It's introduced,

698
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,000
it's found in Europe. North
Africa shouldn't be here.

699
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:01,360
And you have this one here.
She points right next to it.

700
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,870
It's called Titus Canthia sharpie
thing. A green and white leaves.

701
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,780
It has a terrible common name in
English. I'm not going to say it.

702
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,090
Wandering Jew basic house plant.
You can buy it at home depot, but a,

703
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:16,330
there it is in the Galapagos.
And um, along this path,

704
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,610
just looking to the right and the left.

705
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,720
And then she just starts counting the
number of invasive species at one, two,

706
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:26,380
three, four. As you can see here,
it's only right next to the trail,

707
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,640
but not so much for them.

708
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:32,310
You see that they're only there for
this border of about to 10 inches

709
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,360
along the edge of that path. Why
would that be? Because hunky said,

710
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:39,810
what happens is it Taurus, they'll
be back in their home country,

711
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:44,070
there'll be walking around in a garden
or a park and it'll be filled with tiny

712
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,490
seeds. The seeds stick

713
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,100
tissues and socks and chowders.

714
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,230
They wear the trousers on a plane and
then they wear them when they come here,

715
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,670
and then people walk and then just
distribute or disperse the seats along the

716
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:57,630
trail. Wow.

717
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,650
Now most of these plants are actually
probably harmless and you know,

718
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:05,130
like you said, Galapagos National
Park, they spend tons of money,

719
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:07,680
tons of time trying to keep invasives out,

720
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,120
but the fact is there's only so much
you can do. And every once in a while,

721
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,160
one of these hitchhikers slips under
the radar and just wreaks havoc.

722
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,363
[inaudible]

723
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,190
you just grabbed it just like that.
You just put your hands around here.

724
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,980
That's the only possible the first day.

725
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,830
So while we were in the
highlands of Santa Cruz,

726
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,250
Hunky took me through the woods to meet
this guy named Arno. My name is Onecima.

727
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,240
Dom is an ornithologist from
the University of Vienna.

728
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,710
And shortly after we walked up,

729
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,060
he reached out into this tree and he
grabbed this tiny little baby fins right

730
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:49,650
off the branch is the door.
Well, he says, oh my God,

731
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:53,940
he said he, he looks a little bit
furry, almost really tiny vulnerable.

732
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,860
A fledgling of a, of finch. [inaudible]
is the smallest of the Darwin's finches.

733
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,690
You can like see him pulsing kind of as
he breathing. So Darwin's finches. Yeah.

734
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,080
In short, Darwin, when
he visited Galapagos,

735
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,520
he collected a lot of specimens of
finches, took them back to England,

736
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,610
and eventually he realized

737
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,040
that the beaks had all adapted.

738
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:19,610
They were all little bit
different depending on which
island the finches lived

739
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,880
on with the beaks. Beaks adapt to
whatever the thing is you're eating.

740
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,860
One islands finches had literally like
the beak would be shaped sort of long.

741
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,670
And then the next island it would
look almost the same but much shorter.

742
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,200
And this became one of the, one of the
most important pieces of evidence that,

743
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,620
you know, when animals would
move from one place to another,

744
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:42,680
that they would begin to differentiate
based on what cities are very,

745
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:44,210
very important things. Yes.

746
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,280
But speaking of beaks, that finch, that
Arno is holding, it's just the Fred,

747
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,580
his beak that you see the
specially decide is extremely huge.

748
00:46:55,831 --> 00:47:00,630
Yeah. Oh, the nostrils. Nostrils
have have big holes. Yeah.

749
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,160
Something had gotten inside this little
finches, nostrils drilled these holes,

750
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,420
and it was no eating the flesh on
the inside of the birds nostrils.

751
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:17,610
Scientists first began to see this in
1997 when they started to find nests full

752
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:19,770
of dead baby finches. At first,

753
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:21,930
nobody had any idea what
kind of creature it was.

754
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,450
So they began to frantically study it.

755
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,370
I actually visited

756
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,760
one of the main researchers, PA
doddling Congo. I keep the name of

757
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,900
[inaudible]. She's lived in
Galapagos for over a decade.

758
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,400
And she showed me her lab.

759
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,810
I'm surrounded by shelves
and on the shelves there are
these tiny little plastic

760
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:47,130
cups that are filled with, um, flies.

761
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,810
This is the villain.

762
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:57,030
But I see say Solo [inaudible] a little
black fly looks like every other flies

763
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,360
is [inaudible]. In fact, P dot.

764
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:06,950
Says that it's actually in the same
family as the regular house fly,

765
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,940
but it's actually a bot fly
called the Lorena's down z.

766
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,410
Can you just spell fullness
down z? Yeah, it's p. H. I. L.

767
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:18,360
I can't spell out loud feel lore.

768
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,680
L. O. R. N. I. S. D. O. W. N. S. I.
Okay. Following this actually means,

769
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,750
but loving that Charlotte Coston,

770
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:30,020
she's a researcher at the Charles
Darwin Foundation. She says,

771
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,540
there's actually very
little known about the fly.

772
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,940
They're not sure where it came
from or quite how it got here,

773
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:35,870
but here's what they do know.

774
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:37,640
[inaudible]

775
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,110
the adult fly seems to be harmless,
yet a fly is actually vegetarian.

776
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,240
It feeds on flowers and we
think decomposing fruits,

777
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,280
baby flies. They're not vegetarian.
That will, you know, suck blood.

778
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,320
And what happens is that I'm, as
soon as bad start laying eggs,

779
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,430
mother flies swoop in and lay
their eggs on the base of the nest,

780
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,760
sort of underneath the finch
eggs. Once the eggs hatch,

781
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,020
the eggs hatch of the flies as well.

782
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,130
And the larvae wriggling little larva
will crawl out from the bottom of the nest

783
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,190
of the finches body into its beat.

784
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,330
And they go into the
noses and, um, of, uh,

785
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,070
of the baby finches and just started
eating. You know, they basically, um,

786
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,500
feed on the blood of the, the baby beds.

787
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,940
How did these little fly
babies? No, I mean, that's a,

788
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,840
that's a very specific trip
to take. Good question.

789
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,750
We're still trying to figure
that out. Um, you know,

790
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:41,090
we assumed that it was carbon dioxide,

791
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,230
carbon dioxide from the
breathing of the beds. Yeah.

792
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,930
She's opening a box of some
of the birds that little, um,

793
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,920
being sewn as the finches.
Oh God. It's the noise.

794
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:58,923
No to man.

795
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,310
Pa Dad showed me this, this tiny
little dead finch in the spa.

796
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,060
[inaudible] wow. There's a little hole
into the brain of this little finch.

797
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,710
Oh my God.

798
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:16,960
Wiggle in there and I spotted that they
ate the whole back of this little finch.

799
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,400
It's a, how big a problem is this? Well,
I talked to one scientist, Sonia Klein.

800
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:26,090
Dorfer, I'm professor in animal
behavior at Flinders University,

801
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,960
South Australia.

802
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,380
And she told only that researchers
recently did a survey of finch nest for

803
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:35,381
different species on two islands and
all research groups found about 95%

804
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:37,790
mortality in the nest.

805
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,590
95% of the babies were dead. Yeah.

806
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,390
And Arno told me that this
year, small tree finches.

807
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:50,430
So far we have only two
nests with fledglings and
all the others were on that.

808
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,330
So it's a lot. Yeah,

809
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,670
but even worse so far, we
found file on us on 39 islands.

810
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,800
The flies spreading island to island.

811
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,510
Is there any timescale
we should worry about?

812
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:06,710
Like are these finches disappearing
very fast? Very slowly.

813
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,000
Depends on the species.

814
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:12,800
We have at least five species that are
known to be facing extinction and another

815
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:17,360
six in serious decline.
These five species,

816
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:22,450
does that mean that they may go
extinct in the next five years,

817
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,000
in the next 50 years? I hope not.

818
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,350
Um, you know, we have the
case of the mangrove finch.

819
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,250
We have 60 to 80 individuals left. Wow.

820
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,560
It's a race against time.

821
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:39,390
[inaudible].

822
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,160
So for starters,

823
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:44,760
they put up all these tracks and
[inaudible] and they took me outside.

824
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,820
They showed me where the traps are.

825
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:49,200
A trap hanging from a tree here and you
see them actually all over Santa Cruz,

826
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:53,700
these bright yellow traps hanging from
trees. [inaudible] Lord in his own name.

827
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,240
But, and this is to control
the fly population? No, no, no.

828
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,890
They would need like millions of
drops every few feet to do that.

829
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,770
This is just to grab a few
flies, take them back to the lab

830
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,450
and study them so they can
learn how to fight him.

831
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,730
Charlotte and pay Dodd's fantasy is that
the flies use a pheromone to attract

832
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:13,190
the opposite sex CDO finally testicle.

833
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,360
It would be lovely if we could find
something like that because if they could

834
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:19,960
find that chemical, that love chemical
that the flies use to attract each other,

835
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,470
they could disrupt it, confused the
flies and screw up their mating.

836
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:28,300
And another possibility is
sterile insect technique,

837
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:32,410
sterilize male flies and introduce them
back into the wild so that the female,

838
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:37,360
I'm mates with a starer fly and
obviously doesn't produce fertile eggs.

839
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,060
If they can't make babies,
the population will crash.

840
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,750
And in some cases you can
successfully eradicate a species.

841
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,500
This is very much like the mosquitoes
that Andy talked about a couple podcasts

842
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,240
ago. Right. But here's the problem.

843
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,970
[inaudible] if they're gonna release
sterilize male flies into the wild,

844
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,510
they have to be able to
raise [inaudible] million.

845
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,730
These fires in the lab

846
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:07,630
[inaudible] and they're trying like
crazy showing me all of the larvas that

847
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,581
hatch today.

848
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:12,590
And that showed me four baby flies that
had just hatched and they're in these

849
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,423
Little Cup

850
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:19,270
[inaudible] but she told me that
these four flies will probably die.

851
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,760
Mm.

852
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,710
Because they always die.

853
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,580
Right now we have huge problems trying
rear file on this and captivity,

854
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:31,290
which is ironic given you know
how abundant it is in the wild

855
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,540
[inaudible] when I was there. Yeah.

856
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,000
That told me that so far they had
only successfully raised three,

857
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:44,100
$3 flies when you're saying
they needed millions. Yeah.

858
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,480
And meanwhile the finch populations
are just getting decimated.

859
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,330
Charlotte says that
they're trying to respond.

860
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:55,560
Ornithologists have started to notice
some new behaviors. For instance,

861
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,760
picking the Lafayette of the
nostrils of, of the baby birds.

862
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,640
And what we're starting to see is that
they're beginning to consume them.

863
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,570
You mean eat the fly lower? Yeah.
Which 15 years ago they would never do.

864
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,740
Back in the year 2000 Sonya and some
colleagues tried feeding the finches some

865
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:14,670
fly larva. And if ever there were
a look of disgust on a finch face,

866
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,190
that was it. So I think
there's been a change.

867
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,030
They're also seeing baby finches
climbing up over each other,

868
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:24,650
just struggling to get away from the
larva on the bottom of the nest. I'm,

869
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,530
and they'll even start standing on the
nest room just to avoid being eaten by

870
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,640
it. When I asked Charlotte what she
makes of all of these changes, she said,

871
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,790
um, I think probably too little, too late.

872
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:42,550
[inaudible]

873
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,430
but then Sonia told me something
really surprising. Yeah. That,

874
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,680
that was a very unexpected discovery.
Takes a couple steps to get there,

875
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,820
but just to set it up,

876
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:56,530
back in 2000 she was on Floriana island
for the first time I started studying

877
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,940
Darwin's finches in particular
three Trufant species, the small,

878
00:55:00,941 --> 00:55:03,540
the medium and the large.
And we went out and we,

879
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,880
we set up our mist nets and we caught
the birds and we measured them.

880
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,810
And the thing to know is that even
though these are three different species,

881
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,600
they're actually really
hard to tell apart visually.

882
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,770
So she would end up relying on their
songs, their mating calls. Yep.

883
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:21,330
Do you remember the song types? Could
you whistle them for me? Oh yes. It's,

884
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:25,270
it's a very simple song. The small tree
finch goes something like two, two,

885
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:26,150
two two two two two

886
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,233
[inaudible].

887
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,160
That's a small tree finch and the,

888
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,500
the medium tree finch is just a
bit slower for the medium as a t,

889
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:39,930
t t t for the large g,

890
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,440
g G. G. Wow.

891
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:48,441
It's like a soprano saxophone in an
alto and the 10 or something like that.

892
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,780
That's right. So we, we just, you
know, sat in the forest and we're,

893
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,940
and we would always quiz each
other. What's that? What's that?

894
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:57,570
And we all agreed because the calls are
really distinct, easy to tell apart.

895
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:01,620
But the interesting thing was from
year to year, it got more difficult.

896
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,990
As Tony says, each time
she'd go into the field,

897
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,860
the song sounded like they
were starting to blur together.

898
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,050
Then when I showed up
after a few years, again,

899
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,980
I was truly even more
perplexed. Should I dad,

900
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:23,620
why can't I tell these finches
apart? It was very confusing.

901
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,740
Am I losing my touch? But
that shouldn't really happen.

902
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:30,250
You should actually get better
with experience. Not Worse.

903
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:33,250
And that's where I thought, oh,
something's changed in the system.

904
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,670
I like to think of it as a kind of,
um, Darwin finch, you know, slew thing,

905
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,533
adventure.

906
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,590
So Sonia and your team rounded up some
of the birds they tagged and we collected

907
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:48,940
genetic samples, got some DNA and song
samples, made some recordings. Yep.

908
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,470
Brought all this stuff into the lab,

909
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:55,471
analyze the genetic samples and had
this terrible realization that the large

910
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:58,810
tree finches now extinct.

911
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:00,730
[inaudible]

912
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:05,160
totally gone from the island. So you
really only had two species left.

913
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,660
You had the small tree finches
and the medium tree finches.

914
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,090
And based on that genetic data,

915
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,900
the small tree finches not doing great,

916
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:18,700
but compared to the medium tree finches
they are because the medium tree finches

917
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,020
were on the brink of extinction
like a large ones. Yeah.

918
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,130
But then she sees something
amazing in that genetic data.

919
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:32,310
She sees a small group of
birds who have mixed up genes,

920
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,550
a hybrid cluster,

921
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,660
some genes from the small tree finches
and some from the medium tree finches.

922
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,520
Huh? What does that mean? Well,

923
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:43,720
it means that these two different finches
had started having babies together,

924
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,380
which should never actually happen because
these are totally separate species.

925
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:52,410
That's really the classical definition
of a species is like a biological rule

926
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,620
about who you're not going
to make a baby with. So they,

927
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:59,320
they choose not to breed even
if they could for who knows,

928
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:03,200
maybe a million years. The medium tree
finch has patrolled that boundary. Like,

929
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,340
I've got my thing over here.
You got your thing over there.

930
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:11,730
But then along come the flies and all
of a sudden like over maybe 20 years,

931
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,150
these medium tree finches,

932
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,270
they start to break their own biggest
rule and they start to meet outside of

933
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:22,630
their own kind. And these hybrid finches,

934
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:25,480
are they doing better against
the flies? Well, there's,

935
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:29,490
there's a couple of clues that say maybe,
yeah. For example, when you look at

936
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,363
in the nest,

937
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:35,370
they seem to have fewer parasites and
they seem to have more babies that survive

938
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,550
15% wow.

939
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,710
Whereas the numbers were very small for
the medium tree finch and smaller for

940
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:45,820
the small tree finch. Wow. I dare
say that sounds kind of hopeful.

941
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,800
It does. Yeah. Now the jury is still
very much out on what will happen,

942
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,330
but if the hybrids do have a fitness
advantage and if they survive,

943
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,690
we may be witnessing in hyperspeed the
creation of an entirely new species.

944
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:06,030
It would possibly be one of the first
vertebrate examples of speciation in real

945
00:59:08,231 --> 00:59:11,460
time that we can observe.

946
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,830
So talk to into the story of these finches

947
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,220
is the story of Galapagos.

948
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,400
Uh,

949
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,480
same exact story that Darwin saw.
These processes that you've described

950
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,500
[inaudible]

951
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,660
they just never ever stopped.

952
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,720
It's this [inaudible] ending

953
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,323
struggle.

954
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,243
[inaudible]

955
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,330
one last thing. My last night there,

956
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,380
I went to meet up with that Guy
Lonidas who was running for mayor.

957
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,010
I met him at this pizza place. The
election had happened the night before.

958
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,990
And did he win? No. A Buccellati
the incumbent one. So we,

959
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,760
we go outside. Chelonian [inaudible]
Paralis I was running as the mayor.

960
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,110
Turns out he speaks some
English. So we, you know,

961
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,780
we do this interview in English and I'm,

962
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,560
I'm almost embarrassed that I wanted to
talk to him because I think that dude is

963
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:06,760
just going to be so down and
out. Exactly the opposite.

964
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,930
He was so joyful to have lost. That's
what I thought. You're not sad.

965
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,920
You're not sad. Oh No. Never
Fred. And he's like, friend,

966
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,400
this is a field of four. The other
three all have money behind them.

967
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:22,860
And you see their flags all over Santa
Cruz. I just came in second. Whoa.

968
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:27,820
The guy who wins. He spent
$500,000 I spent what, two grand?

969
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:28,540
It's

970
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,200
the beginning. Is DV [inaudible] of a new,

971
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:34,510
a new future for the Galapagos island.

972
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:40,660
We are ascending and we
keep, we have our dreams up.

973
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:45,130
So nature has a boys. Now the
sea lion has a boys in us.

974
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,300
The tortoise as a Boise, not
the penguin in everywhere.

975
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,580
So something is happening.
That's exactly how he sees it.

976
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:55,150
So thank you very much for the interview.
I hope you enjoy the Galapagos island.

977
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,040
We call that the song

978
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,153

979
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:15,490
producer Tim hour before we close.

Very special thanks to Matthew Judas
kilty without whom Tim have been crushed

981
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,910
just by the sheer amount of tape
that he gathered from deed. Also,

982
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,470
thanks to Dylan Key for original music.

known musician in Galapagos.

986
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,000
Turns out thanks to the
