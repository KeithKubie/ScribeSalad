00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.359
On April 18, 1955 the father of relativity,
Albert Einstein, died of a burst Aorta and

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.170
was taken to a mortuary in Princeton, New
Jersey.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.320
Einstein’s wish was to be cremated but the
pathologist on duty thought it a shame to

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.960
destroy such a celebrated brain.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.050
So, without permission, he picked up a saw
and cut Einstein’s cranium and extracted

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.210
his brain… oh and he also grabbed his eyeballs.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.780
Dr Harvey then plopped everything into a couple
of jars.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.340
And promptly alerted the New York Times.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.860
The family was furious, but Harvey eventually
convinced them his actions were all in the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.750
the name of science!

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.300
The jar of eyes was given to Einstein’s
eye doctor Henry Abrams who placed them in

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.510
a safe deposit box which is rumoured to be
somewhere in New York City.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.700
The brain however, went on a far wider journey.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.040
after cutting the brain into 240 blocks he
was able to make a thousand slides out of

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.930
different portions of Albert Einstein's brain.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.789
He boxed up those slides and sent them to
researchers around the world.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.439
Although Harvey stole the brain in the name
of science, promising to publish important

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.270
research, &nbsp;in the four decades that followed
he never did...But the slides that Harvey

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.159
sent to qualified brain researchers around
the world did reveal some interesting things

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.740
about Einstein’s brain.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.979
Even though Einstein’s IQ was way higher
than most, the size of his brain was actually

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.299
smaller than the average male.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.229
More significantly though, Einstein’s inferior
parietal region was about 15 percent larger

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.990
than average.It’s thought to be the part
of the brain that helps with language and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.200
mathematics.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.143
Another anatomical difference is that he was
lacking a crevice in the skull area in the

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:52.420
brain called the Sylvian fissure.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.581
Also his brain did not show any significant
signs of aging.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.843
which it appears in the brain with age.

00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:01.399
It was lacking a substance called lipofuscin,
which is an autofluorescent brown-yellow pigment

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.679
that’s not very well understood.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.669
What we do know is that it accumulates in
the human body with age, and yet at 76 years

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:12.780
old, Einstein’s brain was almost completely
void of it.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.540
But none of these facts could be considered
a huge breakthrough in understanding Einstein’s

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
genius.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.989
So eventually the hub bub died down and for
the most part, the famous brain was forgotten.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.720
The remainder of Einstein's brain that was
not dissected into slides was put into a cider

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.719
box under a beer cooler in Dr. Harvey’s
home.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:39.900
After spending decades in a beer cooler, Dr
Harvey donated the brain to Princeton Hospital.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.230
As for the 1000 slides?

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.230
What happened to them.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.290
There were five boxes of slides created of
Einstein's brain.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.890
We know that one set of slides is at the National
Museum of Health and Medicine.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.560
At the Mutter Museum we have 46 ….the rest
of the slides are MIA.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.459
There’s no doubt that what Harvey did wasn’t
exactly ethical and probably not in the name

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.739
of science BUT hopefully with modern technology
and our developing knowledge of the human

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.120
brain, secrets about Einstein’s brain may
finally be revealed and it’s long journey

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.170
from an Ivy League hospital to a beer cooler
won’t be for nothing.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.459
Thanks for watching, if you were
still wondering about Einstein’s eyeballs,

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.489
in the 90s, there was a rumor that Michael
Jackson wanted to buy them for $5 million,

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.450
but Dr Henry Abrams quickly denied they were
for sale.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.300
As far as we can tell they are still in a
safety deposit box somewhere.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.990
