00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.100
 
well we have to figure out what our

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110
well we have to figure out what our
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.259

you spend then you have a decision of
 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.050
you spend then you have a decision of
these taxes or borrow and we're

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060
these taxes or borrow and we're
 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.140
these taxes or borrow and we're
borrowing just future taxes I think for

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150

really can't raise taxes enough to pay
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.300
really can't raise taxes enough to pay
for that I don't mean we can't buy

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310
for that I don't mean we can't buy
 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.110
for that I don't mean we can't buy

growth so I think we really have to talk
 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.740
growth so I think we really have to talk
a lot about how to scale back some of
