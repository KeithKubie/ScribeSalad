and see how this is true so I'll I'll do
the derivation for the condition over H

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750
the derivation for the condition over H
 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.730
the derivation for the condition over H
given X all right so first of all let's

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740
given X all right so first of all let's
 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.240
given X all right so first of all let's
just write P of H given X so we can

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250
just write P of H given X so we can
 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.520
just write P of H given X so we can
write that as the joint over X and H

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530
write that as the joint over X and H
 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.540
write that as the joint over X and H
divided by the marginal over just X so

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
divided by the marginal over just X so
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.810
divided by the marginal over just X so
that's the summation over all possible

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
that's the summation over all possible
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.850
that's the summation over all possible
hidden layer vector which I'm calling H

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860
hidden layer vector which I'm calling H
 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.110
hidden layer vector which I'm calling H
prime here of the joint P of X and H

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120
prime here of the joint P of X and H
 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.600
prime here of the joint P of X and H
prime so this whole sum here that's just

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610
prime so this whole sum here that's just
 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.530
prime so this whole sum here that's just
P of X so let's let's just actually

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540
P of X so let's let's just actually
 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.670
P of X so let's let's just actually
write the what P of X and H is well

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
write the what P of X and H is well
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.110
write the what P of X and H is well
that's just the exponential of the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120
that's just the exponential of the
 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.290
that's just the exponential of the
negative energy which is that divided by

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
negative energy which is that divided by
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.000
negative energy which is that divided by
the normalization constant or the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010
the normalization constant or the
 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.430
the normalization constant or the
partition function and similarly here

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440
partition function and similarly here
 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.850
partition function and similarly here
and also I've just written explicitly

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860
and also I've just written explicitly
 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.470
and also I've just written explicitly
over what we're iterating where we're

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480
over what we're iterating where we're
 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.880
over what we're iterating where we're
performing the sum here so we're

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890
performing the sum here so we're
 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.640
performing the sum here so we're
iterating over all vectors that are

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650
iterating over all vectors that are
 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.550
iterating over all vectors that are
binary of size capital H capital H is

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
binary of size capital H capital H is
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.480
binary of size capital H capital H is
the number of hidden units so we notice

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
the number of hidden units so we notice
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.850
the number of hidden units so we notice
that first we can cancel out the

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860
that first we can cancel out the
 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.950
that first we can cancel out the
partition function at the numerator

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960
partition function at the numerator
 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.890
partition function at the numerator
denominator and we can also cancel out

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900
denominator and we can also cancel out
 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.310
denominator and we can also cancel out
this term here in here and that's

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
this term here in here and that's
 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.090
this term here in here and that's
because it does not depend on H so it

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100
because it does not depend on H so it
 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.280
because it does not depend on H so it
doesn't depend here at the numerator on

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290
doesn't depend here at the numerator on
 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.560
doesn't depend here at the numerator on
H Prime and so we can actually take that

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570
H Prime and so we can actually take that
 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.260
H Prime and so we can actually take that
out so we could multiply here by the

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270
out so we could multiply here by the
 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.690
out so we could multiply here by the
exponential of C transpose X and remove

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700
exponential of C transpose X and remove
 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.310
exponential of C transpose X and remove
it from here and then it would cancel

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320
it from here and then it would cancel
 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.790
it from here and then it would cancel
out with what's at the numerator next

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800
out with what's at the numerator next
 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.020
out with what's at the numerator next
we'll just write down this whole term

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030
we'll just write down this whole term
 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.430
we'll just write down this whole term
here into an explicit sum over all

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440
here into an explicit sum over all
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.290
here into an explicit sum over all
indices in the hidden layer so in this

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300
indices in the hidden layer so in this
 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.340
indices in the hidden layer so in this

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350
well first up this B transpose times H
 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.760

J and also this we can actually write it

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900
J and also this we can actually write it
 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.500

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060
W times the value of the jail hidden
 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.820
W times the value of the jail hidden
unit so if you don't see this that

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830
unit so if you don't see this that
 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.170

recommend you just sit down and and see

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180
recommend you just sit down and and see
 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.980
recommend you just sit down and and see
how this is equivalent to that and then

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990
how this is equivalent to that and then
 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.630
how this is equivalent to that and then
I'm just writing exactly the same thing

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640
I'm just writing exactly the same thing
 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.690
I'm just writing exactly the same thing
at the denominator I've also written

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700
at the denominator I've also written
 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.660
at the denominator I've also written
explicitly that this sum here can be

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670
explicitly that this sum here can be
 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.420
explicitly that this sum here can be
written down as a sequence of sums over

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
written down as a sequence of sums over
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.010
written down as a sequence of sums over

the first hidden unit till the last
 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.930
the first hidden unit till the last
hidden unit so a sequence of nested sums

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940
hidden unit so a sequence of nested sums
 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.620
hidden unit so a sequence of nested sums
over each individual hidden unit then

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630
over each individual hidden unit then
 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.600
over each individual hidden unit then
because the exponential of a sum is the

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
because the exponential of a sum is the
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.400
because the exponential of a sum is the
product of Exponential's I have that

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410
product of Exponential's I have that
 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.710
product of Exponential's I have that
this is equivalent to that we have the

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720
this is equivalent to that we have the
 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.830
this is equivalent to that we have the
product of the exponentiated terms that

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840
product of the exponentiated terms that
 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.800
product of the exponentiated terms that
were into the sum here and I have

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810
were into the sum here and I have
 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:40.640
were into the sum here and I have
exactly the same thing here then I

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650
exactly the same thing here then I
 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.540
exactly the same thing here then I
notice that in this product in the

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550
notice that in this product in the
 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.170
notice that in this product in the
denominator each factor in the product

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180
denominator each factor in the product
 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.900
denominator each factor in the product
actually depends on a single hidden unit

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910
actually depends on a single hidden unit

H other elements of H Prime and so what

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520
H other elements of H Prime and so what
 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.940
H other elements of H Prime and so what
this means is that if I'm summing say

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:04.950
this means is that if I'm summing say
 

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.360
this means is that if I'm summing say
over H prime capital H all of the terms

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370
over H prime capital H all of the terms
 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.490
over H prime capital H all of the terms
here in this product are constant with

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500
here in this product are constant with
 

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.030
here in this product are constant with

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.040
respect to H prime H capital H except
 

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.660
respect to H prime H capital H except
for the last one except for H prime H so

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.670
for the last one except for H prime H so
 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.260
for the last one except for H prime H so
the last term for J equals capital H so

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.270
the last term for J equals capital H so
 

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.060
the last term for J equals capital H so
it means that all of the other factors

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.070
it means that all of the other factors
 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.650
it means that all of the other factors
in this product I can actually put them

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660
in this product I can actually put them
 

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.230
in this product I can actually put them
in front of the Sun and just perform the

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
in front of the Sun and just perform the
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.780
in front of the Sun and just perform the

sum over the last hidden unit of the
 

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.550
sum over the last hidden unit of the
corresponding factor in this whole

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560
corresponding factor in this whole
 

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.640
corresponding factor in this whole
product here and once I compute this

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:37.650
product here and once I compute this
 

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.150
product here and once I compute this
well then this is a constant with

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.160
well then this is a constant with
 

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.800
well then this is a constant with
respect to all of their hidden units so

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.810
respect to all of their hidden units so
 

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.410
respect to all of their hidden units so
I could actually put it in front of this

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420
I could actually put it in front of this
 

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.330
I could actually put it in front of this
whole sum and in this way I could

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:47.340
whole sum and in this way I could
 

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.540
whole sum and in this way I could
actually write down this nested sum here

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.550
actually write down this nested sum here
 

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.820
actually write down this nested sum here
as just a product of these

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:52.830
as just a product of these
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.660
as just a product of these
over the first 18 units times the sum

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:56.670
over the first 18 units times the sum
 

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.330
over the first 18 units times the sum
over the second unit and so on so what

00:08:59.330 --> 00:08:59.340
over the second unit and so on so what
 

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.810
over the second unit and so on so what
I've done is that I've converted this

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:01.820
I've done is that I've converted this
 

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.330
I've done is that I've converted this
nested sum over all in units as just a

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:05.340
nested sum over all in units as just a
 

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.140
nested sum over all in units as just a
linear product of the as just a product

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.150
linear product of the as just a product
 

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.700
linear product of the as just a product
of a sum over an individual hidden in it

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:13.710
of a sum over an individual hidden in it
 

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.150
of a sum over an individual hidden in it
for each hidden unit so this sum here

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160
for each hidden unit so this sum here
 

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.280
for each hidden unit so this sum here
was a sum of an exponential number of

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.290
was a sum of an exponential number of
 

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.290
was a sum of an exponential number of
terms and now here we have actually a

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300
terms and now here we have actually a
 

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.060
terms and now here we have actually a
product over capital H number of factors

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:26.070
product over capital H number of factors
 

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.940
product over capital H number of factors
and each factor in the product is this

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:28.950
and each factor in the product is this
 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.290
and each factor in the product is this
here it's just the sum over an

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300
here it's just the sum over an
 

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:37.250
here it's just the sum over an
individual in the unit so now here I'm

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260
individual in the unit so now here I'm
 

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.510
individual in the unit so now here I'm
just writing that as a product with the

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:41.520
just writing that as a product with the
 

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.480
just writing that as a product with the
product sign over J of the sum over the

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.490
product sign over J of the sum over the
 

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.930
product sign over J of the sum over the
jf hidden unit that's just the

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940
jf hidden unit that's just the
 

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.900
jf hidden unit that's just the
definition of that symbol really and

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:53.910
definition of that symbol really and
 

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.750
definition of that symbol really and
then I can actually write down what this

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760
then I can actually write down what this
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.000
then I can actually write down what this
sum is it's only over two terms for H

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.010
sum is it's only over two terms for H
 

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.440
sum is it's only over two terms for H
prime J equals 0 or H prime J equals 1

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.450
prime J equals 0 or H prime J equals 1
 

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.540
prime J equals 0 or H prime J equals 1
so if H prime J is equal to 0 then

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:05.550
so if H prime J is equal to 0 then
 

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.420
so if H prime J is equal to 0 then
that's 0 that's 0 so the Exponential's 0

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.430
that's 0 that's 0 so the Exponential's 0
 

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.830
that's 0 that's 0 so the Exponential's 0
is 1 and then if H prime J is equal to 1

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:12.840
is 1 and then if H prime J is equal to 1
 

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.170
is 1 and then if H prime J is equal to 1
then that would be the exponential of

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180
then that would be the exponential of
 

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.980
then that would be the exponential of
just BJ which is here Plus this term

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:18.990
just BJ which is here Plus this term
 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:25.730
just BJ which is here Plus this term
here because this would be 1 next I can

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740
here because this would be 1 next I can
 

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.280
here because this would be 1 next I can
just write this as a single product

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.290
just write this as a single product
 

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.370
just write this as a single product
instead of the fraction of two products

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.380
instead of the fraction of two products
 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.100
instead of the fraction of two products
since both products over the same

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.110
since both products over the same
 

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.730
since both products over the same
indices J then that's just a product

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740
indices J then that's just a product
 

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.120
indices J then that's just a product
over J of the fraction of the

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.130
over J of the fraction of the
 

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.030
over J of the fraction of the
exponential of the factor that involves

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040
exponential of the factor that involves
 

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.100
exponential of the factor that involves
H J divided by 1 plus the exponential of

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.110
H J divided by 1 plus the exponential of
 

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.870
H J divided by 1 plus the exponential of
BJ plus DGH

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880
BJ plus DGH
 

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:58.160
BJ plus DGH
Rho of W times X and now I notice that

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.170
Rho of W times X and now I notice that
 

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.740
Rho of W times X and now I notice that
this is actually a probability so if H J

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:03.750
this is actually a probability so if H J
 

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.410
this is actually a probability so if H J
was equal to 1 then I get this term if

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420
was equal to 1 then I get this term if
 

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.750
was equal to 1 then I get this term if
HG was equal to zero I get this term so

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760
HG was equal to zero I get this term so
 

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.990
HG was equal to zero I get this term so
if I sum over this fix if I sum over

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000
if I sum over this fix if I sum over
 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.350
if I sum over this fix if I sum over
this expression for each values of that

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360
this expression for each values of that
 

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.990
this expression for each values of that
H J can take which value H you can take

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000
H J can take which value H you can take
 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.300
H J can take which value H you can take
actually sum to one so that's actually a

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.310
actually sum to one so that's actually a
 

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.269
actually sum to one so that's actually a
distribution and so and this it turns

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279
distribution and so and this it turns
 

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.509
distribution and so and this it turns
out is just then the probability it must

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519
out is just then the probability it must
 

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.620
out is just then the probability it must
be the probability of HJ taking its

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:30.630
be the probability of HJ taking its
 

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.750
be the probability of HJ taking its
given value condition on X so that we've

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760
given value condition on X so that we've
 

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.509
given value condition on X so that we've
shown we finally shown that P of H given

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519
shown we finally shown that P of H given
 

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:42.379
shown we finally shown that P of H given
X so the full conditional over all the

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:42.389
X so the full conditional over all the
 

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:44.990
X so the full conditional over all the
elements in H is just the product of the

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000
elements in H is just the product of the
 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.750
elements in H is just the product of the
elements per element conditional

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760
elements per element conditional
 

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.509
elements per element conditional
probability of the hidden units in my

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519
probability of the hidden units in my
 

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:55.790
probability of the hidden units in my
hidden layer now let's actually show

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800
hidden layer now let's actually show
 

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.340
hidden layer now let's actually show
that this is just a sigmoid of the

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:58.350
that this is just a sigmoid of the
 

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:04.790
that this is just a sigmoid of the
linear transformation of X so we had

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800
linear transformation of X so we had
 

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.079
linear transformation of X so we had
before that this is equal to that that's

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:09.089
before that this is equal to that that's
 

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:11.360
before that this is equal to that that's
just the last part of our derivation on

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.370
just the last part of our derivation on
 

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.759
just the last part of our derivation on
the previous slide and now I notice that

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:16.769
the previous slide and now I notice that
 

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:19.759
the previous slide and now I notice that
if I multiply here by the exponential of

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:19.769
if I multiply here by the exponential of
 

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:29.660
if I multiply here by the exponential of
minus VJ minus WJ dot X here and here as

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.670
minus VJ minus WJ dot X here and here as
 

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.900
minus VJ minus WJ dot X here and here as
well

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:29.910
well
 

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.329
well
so essentially multiplying the whole

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339
so essentially multiplying the whole
 

00:12:32.339 --> 00:12:34.880
so essentially multiplying the whole
expression by one then this would cancel

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:34.890
expression by one then this would cancel
 

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.360
expression by one then this would cancel
out with that this here would cancel out

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.370
out with that this here would cancel out
 

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.370
out with that this here would cancel out
with that and then one here would be

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380
with that and then one here would be
 

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.170
with that and then one here would be
replaced by the exponential of the

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180
replaced by the exponential of the
 

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.170
replaced by the exponential of the
negative term and so that's exactly what

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180
negative term and so that's exactly what
 

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.269
negative term and so that's exactly what
we have here we have 1 over 1 plus the

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279
we have here we have 1 over 1 plus the
 

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:51.230
we have here we have 1 over 1 plus the
exponential of the negative the linear

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240
exponential of the negative the linear
 

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.050
exponential of the negative the linear
transformation of X and by definition 1

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060
transformation of X and by definition 1
 

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.259
transformation of X and by definition 1
over the exponential sorry 1 over 1 plus

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:00.269
over the exponential sorry 1 over 1 plus
 

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:02.809
over the exponential sorry 1 over 1 plus
the exponential of minus something

00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:02.819
the exponential of minus something
 

00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:05.030
the exponential of minus something
that's this sigmoid so that's just

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040
that's this sigmoid so that's just
 

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.189
that's this sigmoid so that's just
really the sigmoid of the lamed

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199
really the sigmoid of the lamed
 

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.379
really the sigmoid of the lamed
transformation of X so now we've shown

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:09.389
transformation of X so now we've shown
 

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:11.269
transformation of X so now we've shown
that this conditional distribution over

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279
that this conditional distribution over
 

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:14.720
that this conditional distribution over
a single hidden unit is the sigmoid of

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:14.730
a single hidden unit is the sigmoid of
 

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.960
a single hidden unit is the sigmoid of
the linear transformation of X when it's

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:17.970
the linear transformation of X when it's
 

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.150
the linear transformation of X when it's
multiplied by the connections between

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160
multiplied by the connections between
 

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.780
multiplied by the connections between
HJ and all elements and X and then we

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:23.790
HJ and all elements and X and then we
 

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:32.330
HJ and all elements and X and then we
add the bias of djf hidden unit and just

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:32.340
add the bias of djf hidden unit and just
 

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.270
add the bias of djf hidden unit and just
a final remark that really here I've

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:35.280
a final remark that really here I've
 

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.940
a final remark that really here I've
done a full demonstration of this

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:37.950
done a full demonstration of this
 

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.390
done a full demonstration of this

that we get some conditional

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200
that we get some conditional
 

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.440
that we get some conditional

one layer given all the values in the
 

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.420
one layer given all the values in the
other layer but in fact we could have

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:53.430
other layer but in fact we could have
 

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.970
other layer but in fact we could have
used a general result known as the or

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980
used a general result known as the or
 

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.190
used a general result known as the or

variable Z 1 up to set Z V and so here I

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600

notice here it should be said I minus 1
 

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.440
notice here it should be said I minus 1
said I plus 2 I plus 1 so here's that I

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.450
said I plus 2 I plus 1 so here's that I
 

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.340
said I plus 2 I plus 1 so here's that I
should not appear because it's here so

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.350
should not appear because it's here so
 

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.350
should not appear because it's here so
the local Markov property says that this

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360
the local Markov property says that this
 

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.880
the local Markov property says that this

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:40.890
conditional distribution of one random
 

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.120
conditional distribution of one random
variable given all the others it

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.130
variable given all the others it
 

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.970
variable given all the others it
actually reduces to just the conditional

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980
actually reduces to just the conditional
 

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.510
actually reduces to just the conditional
probability of Z I given only its

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:50.520
probability of Z I given only its
 

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.710
probability of Z I given only its
neighbors so in other words P of Z I

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720
neighbors so in other words P of Z I
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.020
neighbors so in other words P of Z I
sorry Z I is conditionally independent

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.030
sorry Z I is conditionally independent
 

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:05.450
sorry Z I is conditionally independent
of all other elements in the Z variables

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:05.460
of all other elements in the Z variables
 

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.290
of all other elements in the Z variables
given its neighbors in the markup

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.480
given its neighbors in the markup
network and so then we have that this

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:14.490
network and so then we have that this
 

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.340
network and so then we have that this
conditional distribution here can be

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.350
conditional distribution here can be
 

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.790

divided by the marginal over justice

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.310

neighbors where we've marginalizing over

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.080
neighbors where we've marginalizing over
 

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.740
neighbors where we've marginalizing over
Zi and because this is a

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:33.750

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.960

undirected graphical model which we can

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:35.970
undirected graphical model which we can
 

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.210
undirected graphical model which we can
write down as a product of factors like

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220
write down as a product of factors like
 

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.269
write down as a product of factors like
this then we get the product overall its

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279
this then we get the product overall its
 

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.160
this then we get the product overall its
factors but the factors that involve

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.170
factors but the factors that involve
 

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.350
factors but the factors that involve
either only the neighbors or any other

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360
either only the neighbors or any other
 

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.800

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:51.810
that I've variables in the full vector
 

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.439
that I've variables in the full vector
are actually going to cancel out in the

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:54.449
are actually going to cancel out in the
 

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:57.319
are actually going to cancel out in the
numerator and denominator so in the end

00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:57.329
numerator and denominator so in the end
 

00:15:57.329 --> 00:16:02.780

this reduces as just the form which is

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:02.790
this reduces as just the form which is
 

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.910

constant so the same thing where we are

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.350
constant so the same thing where we are
 

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.019

fact so we could have used that formula

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240
fact so we could have used that formula
 

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.929

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:36.889
we write down as a product of factors
 

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:39.799
we write down as a product of factors
but so that's just a general property

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:39.809
but so that's just a general property
 

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:43.999
but so that's just a general property
for the for Markov network and its

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:44.009
for the for Markov network and its
 

00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:46.699
for the for Markov network and its
associated undirected graphical model so

00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:46.709

local Markov property really only refers

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:54.089
local Markov property really only refers
 

00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:58.160
local Markov property really only refers
to this and then we can exploit the fact

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.170
to this and then we can exploit the fact
 

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.629
to this and then we can exploit the fact
that we have an object undirected

00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639
that we have an object undirected
 

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:02.689

gets this slightly simplified form and

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360
gets this slightly simplified form and
 

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.970
gets this slightly simplified form and
by doing this we could actually have the

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980
by doing this we could actually have the
 

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.020
by doing this we could actually have the
right the previous result so for the
