00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Here's a ruler. Where's the center of gravity? Where presumably it's in the middle, and that's certainly true.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.720
If I put my finger in the middle, and somewhere there, Oops!, It balances.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.040
So that's the center of gravity. But suppose I attach some weight at one end, wher-where is it?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.520
Well it's not so easy to guess right? But there's a very nice way of finding the center of gravity,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.840
which i'll start by doing it without weight.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.220
You simply put two fingers to support the object, and then you bring them toward each other,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.240
and automatically, you see that one stops and one starts and one stops-and then they meet

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.360
automatically at the center of gravity. And I can even do this with my eyes closed

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.020
( Opens mouth)

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.300
This works in general if i attach, for example a mass at one end.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.180
I don't know where the center of gravity is but, my fingers automatically

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.260
find the center of gravity. (Opens mouth)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.860
And, if I put a hefty mass at the other end,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.900
well the center of gravity will be really close to that end, and indeed,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.920
it finds the center of gravity over here. And if I put both of them at the same time,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.560
where is it? Well

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.160
aaaa-it automatically

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.100
finds the center of gravity. Again I am not deliberately controlling the movement of my fingers,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.320
I'm just bringing slowly towards each other.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.700
And automatically one of them starts sliding and the other stops and the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.800
other starts sliding and the one stops and they meet always at the center.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.420
So how does it work?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.920
It works because of a really simple but, widely applicable principle.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.040
to start sliding, there is something opposing the slide and that's called friction

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.040
It turns out that the friction is proportional to increases with the force that is pressing the two bodies

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.740
against each-against each other but also, is proportional to some coefficient.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.520
The fact of matter, it's very very widely established observational fact.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.720
When you are sliding, the friction is slightly smaller than when you are stopped and wanted to start sliding.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.780
We talk about the difference between the dynamic friction ( that's the friction that's acting when the bodies already sliding)

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.400
vs static friction (when the two bodies are stopped against each other and then they wanted to start sliding)

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180
Static friction is a little larger than dynamic friction. Okay.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.020
Suppose that I start bringing those two fingers toward each other.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.300
There will be some random error in the beginning.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.960
So first this finger started moving for some reason. Ok.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.580
When the-this finger is closer to the center of gravity than this finger, this finger is taking more weight

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.360
over the ruler than this finger, so there is more friction there.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.680
And so because there is friction on this finger than on this finger, naturally the finger that slides is this one.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.640
But you see, once this finger starts sliding, it's sliding with dynamic friction, whereas this is stopped at static friction.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.460
So, in principle you see, when these ar-equal distances from the center of-center of gravity.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.600
They take equal weights so they should have equal frictions, but thats not true

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.700
because this is already sliding, so it's taking the sliding friction (dynamic friction) whereas this is taking

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.160
static friction. So, this one can keep sliding although it's taking more and more weight

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.220
because it's friction is a little less than this one, so it overshoots towards the center,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.800
and when it's really close, than the other one starts moving and so on. That's why they alternate.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.080
Stick-slip mechanism this is called-slip-stick slip-stick

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.080
and then they come toward each other, so if you take a weighted  version,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.860
well for a long time this left finger slides because, left as seen from you,  slides because it's of course it's far from

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.720
the center of gravity so it has less weight on it, so it has less friction

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:07.060
But, it overshoots and then the other one starts sliding, overshoots overshoots overshoots and then

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.640
they finally meet in the center. So this mechanism is using the slight difference between the dynamic and

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.580
static friction and the fact that, well, when you come at equal distances from the center of gravity

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.880
the one that's already sliding can overshoot, and then once that stops it stays there for a while and then only when

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.360
the other sliding finger has stopped, can (the) this one start sliding again and then overshoot and then come to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360
us and that's how they come to a stand

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.720
Brady: Is there accepted number of times there will be a slip and a stick,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.140
like over the course of thirty centimeters?(tha-te) that seems arbitrary. Tadashi: that is very very-that is an

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.780
excellent question. I think its umm case by case, and you can do a very very precise calculation using a simple

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.540
model of stickslip and so forth, but the fact of the matter that it-a is a very unstable process.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.920
I mean depending on tiny tiny irregularities of the surface and so on

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520
and the number seems to vary quite a lot

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.540
So, I think we have to resort to just experiments and theoretical calculations does give

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.620
some picture but I don't think it gives really as accurate um you know prediction as the numbers suggest

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.920
paper clips is included in our band but not between themselves. Let's finish with something that is work in

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.520
progress. So far, we have been linking paper clips together and sometimes we refer to this as addition
