00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.456
- [Instructor] Julia's
revenue is r of t thousand

00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:07.066
dollars per month, where t
is the month of the year.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.832
Julia had made $3,000 in
the first month of the year,

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:14.076
what does three plus
the definite role from

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.298
one to five of r of t dt equals 19 mean?

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:18.551
And we have some choices.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.464
So like always, pause the video and see

00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:22.270
if you can work through it.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.413
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:27.849
So they tell us that she made
$3,000 in the first month

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.813
and we also see this three
here, so that's interesting.

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:32.989
Maybe they represent the same thing,

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.577
we don't know for sure yet.

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:36.609
But let's look at this definite integral.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.299
The definite integral from one to five

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:42.038
of r of t dt, this is the
area under this rate curve,

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:44.721
r of t is the rate atwhich
Julia makes revenue

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.088
on a monthly basis.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.612
So if you take the area
under that rate curve,

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:51.281
that's going to give you the net change

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.398
in revenue from month one to month five,

00:00:54.398 --> 00:00:56.862
how much that increased.

00:00:56.862 --> 00:00:59.330
And so if you add that to the amount

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.562
she made in month one, well that tells you

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.524
the total she makes from
essentially time zero

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:06.648
all the way to month five.

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:08.949
And they're saying that is equal to 19.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:10.870
So let's see which of these choices

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.343
are consistent with that.

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.962
Julia made an additional $19,000 between

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:16.604
months one and five.

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:18.795
Choice A would be correct if you didn't

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:20.379
see this three over here.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.841
Because just the definite
integral is the additional

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.407
between months one and
five, but that's not

00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:28.745
what this expression says,
it says three plus this

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.439
is equal to 19.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.338
If it said Julia made
an additional $16,000,

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:35.365
well that would make
sense because you could

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:37.500
subtract three from both sides
and you'd get that result,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.246
but that's not what they're saying.

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:42.914
Julia made an average
of $19,000 per month.

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:44.612
Well once again, that's also not right

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:47.560
because we just said from the beginning,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.824
from time zero, all the
way until the fifth month,

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:54.157
she made a total of $19,000.

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:58.493
Not the average per month is $19,000.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.511
Julia made $19,000 in the fifth month.

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.749
Once again, this is not just saying what

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.219
happened in the fifth month.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.118
This is saying, we have the
$3,000 from the first month

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:11.289
and then we have the additional from month

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.123
between month one and month
five, so that's not that.

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:16.430
So this better be our choice.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.949
By the end of the fifth
month, Julia had made

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.191
a total of $19,000.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.858
Yes that is correct.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.534
She made $3,000 in month
one and then as we go

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.484
between month one to
the end of month five,

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:33.712
to the end of the fifth
month, she has made

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:35.295
a total of $19,000.

00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:39.278
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.871
So here we're told the function k of t

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:46.892
gives the amount of ketchup in kilograms

00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:50.559
produced in a sauce
factory by time in hours

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.403
on a given day.

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.573
So this is really quantity
is a function of time,

00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:00.453
it isn't rate, what does
the definite integral

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:03.682
from zero to four of k
prime of t dt represent?

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.607
Once again, pause the video and see if you

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:07.185
can work through it.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.910
Well k of t is the amount of ketchup

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.052
as function of time.

00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:15.120
So k prime of t, that's going to be the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.571
rate at which our amount of ketchup

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:19.876
is changing a function of time.

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:23.041
But once again, when
you're taking the area

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:26.213
under the rate curve, that
tells you the net change

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:29.498
in the original quantity
in the amount of ketchup.

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:33.495
And as the net change between
time zero and time four,

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.552
so let's see which of these
choices match up to that.

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:39.337
The average rate of change of the ketchup

00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:41.858
production over the first four hours.

00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:45.899
No, that does not tell us
the average rate of change,

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.435
there's other ways to calculate that

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.170
the time it takes to
produce four kilograms

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.337
of ketchup, so does this
represent the time it takes?

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:57.385
To represent four kilograms of ketchup.

00:03:57.385 --> 00:03:59.911
No, this four is a time right over here.

00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.144
This is gonna tell you how much ketchup

00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:05.428
gets produced from time zero to time four.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:09.305
The instantaneous rate of
production at t equals four.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:11.821
Now this would be k prime of four,

00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:13.739
that's not what this integral represents.

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.034
The amount of ketchup produced over the

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:19.701
first four hours, yep
that is exactly right.
