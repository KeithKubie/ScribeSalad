&gt;&gt; MEHAT: Hi. I'm San Mehat, a kernel engineer
on Android. I'm notoriously bad with breaking

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.000
cell phones. I drop them, I lose them, I'm
even known to drive them over one of my cars.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.940
When I have one of these missteps, it's a
real pain to get my contacts back on my new

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.230
phone. One of the things I love about Android
is that when I have one of these problems,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.850
it's no problem. Let me show you. All I need
to do is enter in my account information,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.019
sign-in. And once signed-in, my calendar,
email and contacts all start synchronizing

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.699
down. It just takes minutes and it's easy.
