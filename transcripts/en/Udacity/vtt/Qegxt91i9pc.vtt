00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, let's go over the possible answers together.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We say that a statement has to be an identifier followed by an equals sign

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
followed by an expression.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Lata, l-a-t-a, is definitely an identifier using our previous rules.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That's a collection of upper and lower case letters that may include an underscore,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but the underscore can't come first.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is an identifier, and expression can go directly to number,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and 1 is a number, so this is totally valid.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here we have Mangeshkar = 19 + 29.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, Mangeshkar is longer, but it's still an identifier.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's a collection of letters, and it may have underscores, but it doesn't.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then we have the equals sign. That matches.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And now we're going to use this rule here, expression goes to expression + expression

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to get this + sign, and then expression will go to number for 19,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and expression will go to number for 29.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I like this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here we have Lata = Lata + 1.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This one is tricky because it's totally valid in Python,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but it's not valid in this grammar.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I haven't said that expression can go to identifier,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so Lata is an identifier.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The equals sign is an equals sign.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But over here I need something like 1 + 1.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I don't yet have a rule that would allow me to have Lata + 1.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If I had this mysterious fifth rule, then this would be in the language of the grammar.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But I don't yet, so it isn't.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And then over here, Mangeshkar = 25,000 - 1,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that's an identifier =,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and now we're going to use this rule here, expression - expression.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This totally works out.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Lata Mangeshkar is a famous Indian playback singer.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
She's recorded over 25,000 songs,

00:01:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
a world record for quite some time, and she's also received India's highest civilian honor.
