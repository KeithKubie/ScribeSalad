programming is really a lot like writing

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
programming is really a lot like writing
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.700
programming is really a lot like writing
a recipe if you've read a recipe you

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710
a recipe if you've read a recipe you
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.500
a recipe if you've read a recipe you
know what what the structure of a recipe

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510
know what what the structure of a recipe
 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.680
know what what the structure of a recipe
is it's got some things up at the top

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
is it's got some things up at the top
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.660
is it's got some things up at the top
that are the your ingredients and below

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670
that are the your ingredients and below
 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.939
that are the your ingredients and below
that the directions for how to deal with

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949
that the directions for how to deal with
 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.100
that the directions for how to deal with
those ingredients well it's very similar

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110
those ingredients well it's very similar
 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.380
those ingredients well it's very similar
thing happens in a computer program you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390
thing happens in a computer program you
 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.139
thing happens in a computer program you
have you list out the various things

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149
have you list out the various things
 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.160
have you list out the various things
that you're going to be dealing with

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170
that you're going to be dealing with
 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.380
that you're going to be dealing with
typically and then you have some

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390
typically and then you have some
 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.899
typically and then you have some
instructions that say what to do with

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909
instructions that say what to do with
 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.569
instructions that say what to do with
those ingredients so if you can

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579
those ingredients so if you can
 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.040
those ingredients so if you can
understand a recipe and follow it in in

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050
understand a recipe and follow it in in
 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.669
understand a recipe and follow it in in
your kitchen then you could program on

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679
your kitchen then you could program on
 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.149
your kitchen then you could program on
that level but you can take it a lot

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159
that level but you can take it a lot
 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.029
that level but you can take it a lot
farther than that you know many of you

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039
farther than that you know many of you
 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.889
farther than that you know many of you
I'm sure have seen the the Iron Chef

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899
I'm sure have seen the the Iron Chef
 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.180
I'm sure have seen the the Iron Chef
show I love to watch that especially if

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190
show I love to watch that especially if
 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.980
show I love to watch that especially if
they are given strange ingredients and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
they are given strange ingredients and
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.090
they are given strange ingredients and
I'm not sure I would like trout ice

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm not sure I would like trout ice
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.520
I'm not sure I would like trout ice
cream either but one of the things that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530
cream either but one of the things that
 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.500
cream either but one of the things that
happens there if you if you follow along

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510
happens there if you if you follow along
 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.110
happens there if you if you follow along
is that the Iron Chef

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120
is that the Iron Chef
 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.930
is that the Iron Chef
or whoever the chef is doesn't actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940
or whoever the chef is doesn't actually
 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.900
or whoever the chef is doesn't actually
do all the work they have what are

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910
do all the work they have what are
 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.470
do all the work they have what are
called sous chefs that they farm out sub

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480
called sous chefs that they farm out sub
 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.930
called sous chefs that they farm out sub
subdivide the jobs to and they'll do the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940
subdivide the jobs to and they'll do the
 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.330
subdivide the jobs to and they'll do the
kind of busy work and programming is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340
kind of busy work and programming is
 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.690
kind of busy work and programming is
kind of like that - you are the the head

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700
kind of like that - you are the the head
 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.120
kind of like that - you are the the head
chef but there are bits and pieces of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130
chef but there are bits and pieces of
 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.740
chef but there are bits and pieces of
the computer out there that will do

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
the computer out there that will do
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.470
the computer out there that will do
things for you now it's not quite like

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480
things for you now it's not quite like
 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.590
things for you now it's not quite like
iron chef because iron chef you have

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600
iron chef because iron chef you have
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.270
iron chef because iron chef you have
some fairly intelligence to chefs who

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
some fairly intelligence to chefs who
 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.670
some fairly intelligence to chefs who
know how to coddle an egg or or chop up

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680
know how to coddle an egg or or chop up
 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.440
know how to coddle an egg or or chop up
a fish but your computer tends to be

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450
a fish but your computer tends to be
 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.360
a fish but your computer tends to be
more like a bunch of really efficient

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370
more like a bunch of really efficient
 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.810
more like a bunch of really efficient
robots but they're very stupid robots

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820
robots but they're very stupid robots
 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.390
robots but they're very stupid robots
and very literal-minded so you have to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400
and very literal-minded so you have to
 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.330
and very literal-minded so you have to
at some level you know tell them exactly

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340
at some level you know tell them exactly
 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.009
at some level you know tell them exactly
what to do and but once you've told them

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019
what to do and but once you've told them
 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.050
what to do and but once you've told them
that you can just point to the robot and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
that you can just point to the robot and
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.399
that you can just point to the robot and
it'll do the same thing over and over

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409
it'll do the same thing over and over
 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.979
it'll do the same thing over and over
and over again and do it exactly the

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989
and over again and do it exactly the
 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.140
and over again and do it exactly the
same and computers like that that's how

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
same and computers like that that's how
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.700
same and computers like that that's how
they are valuable it's sort of take

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
they are valuable it's sort of take
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.320
they are valuable it's sort of take
over all the boring bits of our thinking

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330
over all the boring bits of our thinking
 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.680
over all the boring bits of our thinking
and then you can kind of take it beyond

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
and then you can kind of take it beyond
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.910
and then you can kind of take it beyond
that instead of just thinking of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920
that instead of just thinking of
 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.440
that instead of just thinking of
yourself as the chef that's in control

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
yourself as the chef that's in control
 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.960
yourself as the chef that's in control
sometimes you want to program more like

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
sometimes you want to program more like
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.820
sometimes you want to program more like
you're thinking about how the food

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830
you're thinking about how the food
 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.470
you're thinking about how the food
actually goes through the process and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
actually goes through the process and
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.170
actually goes through the process and
maybe even take it up a notch and say

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
maybe even take it up a notch and say
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.150
maybe even take it up a notch and say
here's a factory that produces some food

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
here's a factory that produces some food
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.970
here's a factory that produces some food
item Twinkies or whatever and you have

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
item Twinkies or whatever and you have
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.610
item Twinkies or whatever and you have
raw ingredients coming in it's assuming

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
raw ingredients coming in it's assuming
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.950
raw ingredients coming in it's assuming
you think Twinkies or food you have raw

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960
you think Twinkies or food you have raw
 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.540
you think Twinkies or food you have raw
ingredients coming in and they go on

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
ingredients coming in and they go on
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.280
ingredients coming in and they go on
various conveyor belts and get chopped

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
various conveyor belts and get chopped
 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290
various conveyor belts and get chopped
up in various ways and they get

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300
up in various ways and they get
 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.550
up in various ways and they get
recombined and there's this flow of the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
recombined and there's this flow of the
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.140
recombined and there's this flow of the
materials through the factory and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150
materials through the factory and
 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.010
materials through the factory and
eventually comes back out with a some

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020
eventually comes back out with a some
 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.250
eventually comes back out with a some
sort of a product that we consider to be

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
sort of a product that we consider to be
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.690
sort of a product that we consider to be

so there's programming languages that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190
so there's programming languages that
 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.370
so there's programming languages that
work like that too that are more about

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
work like that too that are more about
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.230
work like that too that are more about
you just talk about how the data runs

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240
you just talk about how the data runs
 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.930
you just talk about how the data runs
around in the in the program for

instance your Excel spreadsheet you're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
instance your Excel spreadsheet you're
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.370
instance your Excel spreadsheet you're
putting data into little cells and you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
putting data into little cells and you
 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.830
putting data into little cells and you
have other cells that say well just take

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
have other cells that say well just take
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.420
have other cells that say well just take
take make a little conveyor belt of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
take make a little conveyor belt of
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.950
take make a little conveyor belt of
these cells and add them up in this cell

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960
these cells and add them up in this cell
 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960
these cells and add them up in this cell
you're really doing programming even if

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970
you're really doing programming even if
 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.100
you're really doing programming even if
you think you're just writing Excel

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110
you think you're just writing Excel
 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.760
you think you're just writing Excel
macros so that's like a little little

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770
macros so that's like a little little
 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.750
macros so that's like a little little
Factory on your on your desktop they're

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
Factory on your on your desktop they're
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.900
Factory on your on your desktop they're
now going beyond that there's various

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910
now going beyond that there's various
 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.200
now going beyond that there's various
ways that you can get into you know sort

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210
ways that you can get into you know sort
 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.090
ways that you can get into you know sort
of more highfalutin concepts that you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100
of more highfalutin concepts that you
 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.290
of more highfalutin concepts that you
would learn if you were taking a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300
would learn if you were taking a
 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.060
would learn if you were taking a
computer science degree so the whole

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
computer science degree so the whole
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.280
computer science degree so the whole
idea of programming on this level is

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
idea of programming on this level is
 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.740
idea of programming on this level is
you're saying one thing some abstract

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750
you're saying one thing some abstract
 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.690
you're saying one thing some abstract
thing and that controls a bunch of other

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
thing and that controls a bunch of other
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.540
thing and that controls a bunch of other
things and so the next step that happens

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550
things and so the next step that happens
 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.520
things and so the next step that happens
is that instead of just thinking about

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
is that instead of just thinking about
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.660
is that instead of just thinking about
data as the pieces of things you're

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670
data as the pieces of things you're
 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.470
data as the pieces of things you're
working with you know as strings decks

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480
working with you know as strings decks
 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.630
working with you know as strings decks
phone numbers whatever you start

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640
phone numbers whatever you start
 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.280
phone numbers whatever you start
thinking about those those bits of

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290
thinking about those those bits of
 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.070
thinking about those those bits of
recipe and those recipes can also be

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
recipe and those recipes can also be
 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.840
recipe and those recipes can also be
considered data and can be sent around

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850
considered data and can be sent around
 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.360
considered data and can be sent around
on the conveyor belt in your factory so

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370
on the conveyor belt in your factory so
 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.350
on the conveyor belt in your factory so
it's

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360
it's
 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.580
it's
like little little conveyor that you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590
like little little conveyor that you
 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.290
like little little conveyor that you
might have in your cafe you put put

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300
might have in your cafe you put put
 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.480
might have in your cafe you put put
little things up there that order things

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490
little things up there that order things
 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.980
little things up there that order things
up so when you start talking about

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
up so when you start talking about
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.499
up so when you start talking about
actions and abstracting them that you

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509
actions and abstracting them that you
 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:44.670
actions and abstracting them that you
can start talking about doing them

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
can start talking about doing them
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.279
can start talking about doing them
multiple times and looping and this

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289
multiple times and looping and this
 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.719
multiple times and looping and this
action may do this action which may do

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729
action may do this action which may do
 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.520
action may do this action which may do
the action which might come back and do

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
the action which might come back and do
 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.999
the action which might come back and do
the thing and you get a recursive sort

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009
the thing and you get a recursive sort
 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.550
the thing and you get a recursive sort
of fractal pattern and so this this is

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560
of fractal pattern and so this this is
 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.950
of fractal pattern and so this this is
these are the basis of the more

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960
these are the basis of the more
 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.070
these are the basis of the more
mathematical views of programming but

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080
 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.659
you know you don't have to do all that

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669
you know you don't have to do all that
 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.129
you know you don't have to do all that
at the beginning you can just start off

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139
at the beginning you can just start off
 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.679
at the beginning you can just start off
with a simple recipe ID and add things

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689
with a simple recipe ID and add things
 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.330
with a simple recipe ID and add things
on as you go and learn as you go and

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340
on as you go and learn as you go and
 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.819
on as you go and learn as you go and
then you'll do fine
