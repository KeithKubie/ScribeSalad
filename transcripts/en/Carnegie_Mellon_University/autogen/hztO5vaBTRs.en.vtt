00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.760
 
here we are in the hungry giraffe

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
here we are in the hungry giraffe
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.179
here we are in the hungry giraffe
exercise for this exercise it's all

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
exercise for this exercise it's all
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.670
exercise for this exercise it's all
based off of onmousemove so when I move

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680
based off of onmousemove so when I move
 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.010
based off of onmousemove so when I move
my mouse up and down the draft moves up

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020
my mouse up and down the draft moves up
 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.480
my mouse up and down the draft moves up
and down and when he gets to a certain

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
and down and when he gets to a certain
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.880
and down and when he gets to a certain
point on the screen his mouth opens up

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
point on the screen his mouth opens up
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.460
point on the screen his mouth opens up
and the leaf goes to his mouth so if I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
and the leaf goes to his mouth so if I
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.649
and the leaf goes to his mouth so if I
look at the code that I've been given

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:21.659
look at the code that I've been given
 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.779
look at the code that I've been given
the giraffes already been drawn for me

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
the giraffes already been drawn for me
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970
the giraffes already been drawn for me
and what I'm working on right now is the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
and what I'm working on right now is the
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.999
and what I'm working on right now is the
onmousemove function so if I run my code

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009
onmousemove function so if I run my code
 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.240
onmousemove function so if I run my code
when the giraffe goes up the leaf goes

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
when the giraffe goes up the leaf goes
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580
when the giraffe goes up the leaf goes
to his mouth but I'm not seeing his

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
to his mouth but I'm not seeing his
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950
to his mouth but I'm not seeing his
mouth appear so let's look at our code

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
mouth appear so let's look at our code
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.230
mouth appear so let's look at our code
and see what might be wrong here on line

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240
and see what might be wrong here on line
 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.740
and see what might be wrong here on line
65 there is a variable called giraffe

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
65 there is a variable called giraffe
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.860
65 there is a variable called giraffe
smile and it has a visibility property

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
smile and it has a visibility property
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.650
smile and it has a visibility property
and it's set to false if I change that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
and it's set to false if I change that
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.030
and it's set to false if I change that
to true and run my code again I should

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040
to true and run my code again I should
 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.640
to true and run my code again I should
see the mouth appear go to the top the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650
see the mouth appear go to the top the
 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.770
see the mouth appear go to the top the
mouth appears the leaf goes to the mouth

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
mouth appears the leaf goes to the mouth
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810
mouth appears the leaf goes to the mouth
in the solution screen same thing

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
in the solution screen same thing
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720
in the solution screen same thing
happens there so I'm going to run the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
happens there so I'm going to run the
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.369
happens there so I'm going to run the
auto graders check to make sure it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
auto graders check to make sure it's
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.420
auto graders check to make sure it's
right and my feedback is you got it so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
right and my feedback is you got it so
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.390
right and my feedback is you got it so
we were able to complete this exercise

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400
we were able to complete this exercise
 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.320
we were able to complete this exercise
successfully we can go back to the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
successfully we can go back to the
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.650
successfully we can go back to the
lesson screen and move forward
