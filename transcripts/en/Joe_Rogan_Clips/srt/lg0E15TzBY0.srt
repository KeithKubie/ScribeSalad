1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,560
The Joe Rogan experience. Well, I said,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,540
we were talking before and you were
trying to tell me that you were lazy.

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:09,150
I'm like, fuck you. I saw
that thing that you did,

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:13,620
that documentary where you ran a series
of marathons in a row with no training

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,250
at all.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,630
And I remember thinking before that I had
this opinion of you and the opinion of

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:23,110
you was your funny guy. You're
a funny comedian. Um, you,

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,010
you have good stand up.
You obviously work hard at it.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,740
But then I saw that and I was like,
oh, okay, there's something going on.

10
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,810
They're like, yeah, those are the
different kinds of human being,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,190
the kind of human being they could push
themselves into doing that day after day

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,191
after day.

13
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:41,280
And I looked at your feet where your
skin was literally falling off and you're

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,480
taping everything up and um,
that's a,

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,310
that's a person that's got,

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,340
you have an iron will like that's a very
unusual will for a comedian who doesn't

17
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,500
really exercise. Like when you
were doing, I mean you were,

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,010
I mean you may be exercised a little
bit, but you weren't in shape. Now,

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,250
and you decided to run, how many
marathons in a way was at the UK one?

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,180
Was it the first one? Yeah,
that was 43 and 51 days.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
43 marathons in a row in 51 days
with no training at a deaf way.

22
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,090
I did have training, six weeks
training. Yeah. Which is not a lot,

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,070
but they di they said that,
you know,

24
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,740
sometimes if you want a math and you
should train for nine months before that.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,860
Yeah. And I felt, well I fucking
got to do 43 that's going to be,

26
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:27,360
I haven't been training forever. I can't
be bothered with that. So I, but you know,

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,940
and it's happening in your civil,
in maybe an any will. Uh, I, I,

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,470
I'm kind of some somewhat encyclopedic
about you civil war and revolution motor,

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,600
but world we'll too, but try
on the spot training, you know,

30
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,400
training as you go along.
That's what I did.

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,000
The first 10 Madison's
trains you for the next 33.

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,130
What was it like when you go
over the first day though?

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:51,480
The first marathon you must've, okay.
Fuck. No. First Day is okay. Well,

34
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,060
it's all in your head. There's a, um,

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,610
more mental than it is physical.

36
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,430
And so the first math that I've heard
of people who are running managers run,

37
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,070
walk, staggered, not very
fast. Get it done. Boom.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,110
The second math in his weight cause you
go, I've done one, I'm on the second.

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,450
And you can't really rejoice.
You can punch the sky.

40
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,730
You can't put a metal right in your neck.
You're already,

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,390
you've got up at five or six
in the morning and you'll,
it's midday and you're,

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,790
you're going through your second one
and then let's do the third one and then

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,690
you'll do the fourth one.

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,640
And then it was raining and my feet was
shredding and I, the moisture it was,

45
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:28,050
yes, it may be too soft and they were
rubbing on the, on the running shoes.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,510
And I didn't know how to,

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,870
how do I fix it when I'm actually
wearing on it all the time.

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,160
So we started bathing and surgical spirit,
which you call something else. Um, it's,

49
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,840
it's a, it's a ethanol
methanethiol. Anyways,

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,890
it's some sort of alcoholic
spirits and it uh,

51
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,700
it takes the moisture
out of your feet and um,

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,400
so it became like stones. It's
kind of like we should, um, uh,

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,020
anyway,
if anyone does lift up surgical spare,

54
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,770
if you Google it now you'll see what
it's called in America, but it's,

55
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,580
it's some sort of alcoholic
thing that just removes moisture.

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,080
And so it made my feet, my toes,
like little stones and kind of tough.

57
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,830
And actually that got us through.
And then I started and also apparently,

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,270
cause I did 27 mountains in 27 days
in South Africa in 2016. And that was,

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,650
the temperatures were crazy on that,

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
but it seems that the body will switch
on a healing property that we've got

61
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,921
latent in ourselves that we don't
use and you will heal quicker at,

62
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,450
you will heal faster the more you get.

63
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,480
So I got you get stronger in both the
British one and the South African one.

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,290
I got stronger as I went on the
first 10 days of the other key thing.

65
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,830
And after that it's kind of easy to,
you're used to it.

66
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,120
Your body just adapts in the understands.
Yep.

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,330
This crazy ass hole is going to
do crazy also, and the brain goes,

68
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,560
what kind of math and shall we run today
as opposed to what the fuck are you

69
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,570
doing? What kind of marathon? Yeah. Well,

70
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,820
I think that's what the brain's
dead because the first day is going,

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,040
you're going to do what? This marathon,
but be okay. The second database guy,

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,700
now we're going to, we're doing another
one third day, fourth day, fifth day.

73
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,670
This is insane. And then the
data in the brain is going, okay,

74
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,540
you're on this kind of kick or
something. I understand. Let's,

75
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,470
let's try a better amount of this.
Don't push it too hard. You know, you,

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,770
the brain starts talking to the body
and somehow it levels out around about

77
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:16,771
Maine and then they get surreal math at
18 raft 23 I remember marathon 31 that

78
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,220
was a lovely man. It's just so
weird. Yeah, but it was fun.

79
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,160
And you own the road,
you know a woody Guthrie.

80
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:29,110
This land is our lands on his mind. Land.
The you become like, it's your land.

81
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,943
It's like,
oh,

82
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,820
it's everybody's land because you're
running on the roads of this country.

83
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:38,200
I grew up in and you feel that
the roads, the fields, the birds,

84
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:41,770
I didn't listen to any music. I want
it slightly a safety thing for traffic,

85
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:46,420
but also you could hear everything
that's going on. Birds a river's running.

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,390
There was,
I ran possibly his house.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,350
This isn't about day two and there was a
river running there and it went through

88
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,630
the back of this guy's garden and
he said, oh, hello, and I say,

89
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,330
can I went and visited him and I washed
my feet in the river and then I put the

90
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,720
socks back on and I carried on running.
I thought I can, you can do weird things.

91
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,190
I took blackberries out of the
bushes like I did when I was a kid.

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,350
It just became effective Pharell
this holistic or feral marathons.

93
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,170
That's what I was doing. It's not run.
It's not people shouting from the side.

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,930
No one cares really,
which is fine.

95
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:21,480
And I'm just wrapped up in that
this other place. Um, and it was,

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,040
it's beautiful. I mean,
it's really zen. Well,

97
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,480
it seems like it would change you like
accomplishing something like that.

98
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:32,470
Like on the last day, the last
run, when you crossed the line,

99
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,080
what was that feeling like? Wow, this is
a pitch you brought up that picture got,

100
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,190
they put up some flags and stuff.
That was beautiful.

101
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,590
I tried to do it a five hour marathon.

102
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,560
Now if you know the speeds is two hours
is what they're trying to break that.

103
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,650
So this is really slow.
But then having done 42 marathons,

104
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,940
it's maybe it's fair and uh, I,
I missed it by about 30 seconds,

105
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,300
but it was,
it was beautiful to finish it.

106
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,050
I was really quite strong all the way
through. I didn't at any time. That was,

107
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,790
that was good.
In South Africa though.

108
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,200
I did 27 and 27 days salute to
Nelson Mandela's 27 years in prison.

109
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,830
And Day five they put me in hospital
because they thought my kidneys were given

110
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,750
up. And you experiencing Rhabdo?
Is that what you know about? Yeah.

111
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,830
Yeah. Yeah. Your first book ever talked
to WHO's done it about rhabdomyolysis?

112
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,840
Yeah, I got Rhabdo in 2012.
Um, how'd you get that?

113
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,700
I was on a, uh, anti-cholesterol
drug just to sort of health drug.

114
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,780
Your cholesterol is a bit high tech.

115
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,940
The thing what's today and side
effect is rubbed my license,

116
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
which I couldn't spell being dyslexic
and I was peeing Brown p and,

117
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,480
and uh, did it. No real pain. Lot
of lethargy. I was really tired.

118
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,690
I thought this is a bit weird and this
is without exercise you were getting in,

119
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,970
uh, that was on marathon
three amount than four.

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,200
So I had trained,
I trained before that.

121
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,710
I had done some training before that one
a bit weird with my training, but yeah,

122
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,610
so there wasn't a huge amount of training
before that one, but a third mouth and,

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,500
and I started paying a bit of Brown.

124
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,310
But this was not through the whole
series of marathons or it was, no, well,

125
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,340
I tried to do South Africa twice in 2012
was my first one after day four on an

126
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,910
anti cholesterol drug,
uh,

127
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,240
trying to control my cholesterol and I
started bringing brown p and then they

128
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:20,480
said,

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,670
you've got to go to a hospital now the
guys that you got to put fluids through

130
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:25,280
you,
you have to go see a specialist.

131
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,840
Especially said you can't continue this
27 thing because you have to get all

132
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:33,050
this stuff out of your system. Otherwise
the kidneys, because the it shreds the,

133
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,020
you know, the shirts are muscles into
the bloodstream, clogs up kidneys,

134
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,760
kidney failure. Very dangerous. A lot
of fighters get it. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:45,050
I'm a fighter. Died from it. Um, recently
in Boston. In the Massachusetts area.

136
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,350
Yeah. It's, uh, it's apparently, um,

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,530
something that happens when
fighters overtrain as well.

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,340
Like sometimes they're not doing it
scientifically so they're not analyzing

139
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,510
their heart rate or heart rate variability
and they don't know that they haven't

140
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,200
really truly recovered and they continue
to push themselves because they want to

141
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,830
prepare harder.
Yes,

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,570
they have this sort of mental
mindset just train harder and you'll,

143
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,020
you'll be better off. But that's not
necessarily the case of your body.

144
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,010
Can't physically keep up with the
recovery and sometimes they'll go into a

145
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,460
flight overtrained and then they wind
up getting robbed dough from the fight.

146
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,870
It's happened several times and
it's caused a few deaths. Yeah.

147
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,770
Well they said this,

148
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,880
you said you carry on running it running
now in 2012 and you won't make it to

149
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,840
2016 did you get off that medication?
Yeah, I would think that all that running,

150
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,870
you wouldn't need that medication,
I would have thought. But you know,

151
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,170
they check you out and you say [inaudible]
just at the little China fuckers,

152
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,960
you be on this for the rest of your life.
That stuff's gives a shit out of me.

153
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:45,860
They'll statens right.
It's, it gets a scary place.

154
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,150
But 2016 day five bloods were
looking a bit weird day off.

155
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,500
So Day 27 I did devil Madison and
that was kind of an interesting day.

156
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,960
So you run one marathon
or you're lost Davey run,

157
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,990
you've only done 25 minutes in
and said it's the day 27 so,

158
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,710
and when you go through that finishing
the final flag where w either you should

159
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,800
be waving flags, you've got another
marathon to go and it's just, yeah,

160
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,300
I might Brian like, oh, this is
kinda good, but you've got to,

161
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,020
it's 90 k you're going to do
today. Ignore it, carry on.

162
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,490
And it was a rough, rough all day. That's
five hours. And then another five hours,

163
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,620
five hours plus five hours
plus in the end it was six. Uh,

164
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,110
I took 11 hours and 50
minutes to run 90 [inaudible].

165
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,770
So I did double marathon in 11
hours. 10 minutes. Damn good. Yeah,

166
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,240
it was good enough. And
this, they've got a,

167
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,920
they've got a comrades
marathon in South Africa,

168
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,250
which is 90 [inaudible] and they've
got a 12 hour cutoff. So I said,

169
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,050
I will do 90 K in 12 hours.

170
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,410
The double marathon was 84 and then I
did another six k after I'd finished that

171
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,350
last moment.
Must have been orgasmic when you finished.

172
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,580
It must have been incredible.

173
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,130
Finishing the 84 was beautiful year finish
at the steps of Nelson Mandela Statue.

174
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,540
Right.

175
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,540
He was made president and that
was a bit of an and rough,

176
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,880
I'd have to speed up in the last
hour because of complications.

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,290
So I actually got faster.
If you had,

178
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,860
have you ever done the thing where you're
knackered and neck and said now go,

179
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,890
why'd you have to speed up?
There was a wind,

180
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:14,800
it was a thing called sport relief is
doing it for, so it was raising money and,

181
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,280
and I wanted to finish
inside the camera window.

182
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,610
They had a window until three
15 South African time. Um,

183
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,890
police escorts would needed certain bits,

184
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,020
otherwise you'll get car jack things and,
and it's,

185
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,350
and you won't survive this big. So
I said, can't we just ignore that?

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,610
The car jacking thing? No,
you can't ignore it. So I
said, okay, stop the clock,

187
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,720
put me in the thing, drive
me tutorials, stopped me off.

188
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,080
And then I'll run there and
we'll just continue it on there.

189
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:37,831
So we had to do that.

190
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:41,280
So we got behind because I wasn't running
cause that'd be driven across this

191
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:45,020
dangerous period of part point of
road to be dropped to Pretoria.

192
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,560
And then I just had to run the kilometers
off. So they have like a car jack area.

193
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,080
Yeah, they have in there is
where this kind of out there.

194
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:56,070
There's no one really out there and
you just go along there and they'll,

195
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,700
you know, anything can happen. So, um, my,

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,620
my field producer fixer, he was
just saying, we don't do this, just,

197
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,240
you can't go there.
So I said,

198
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,010
well just get me closer to the finishing
line and then I'll just run them.

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,650
It doesn't really matter
where I'm running now.

200
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:14,040
We noticed Paratore now we'd need to
finish, I need to just run that distance.

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,160
So I ran the distance itself,
but the time had got behind.

202
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:22,161
So I had to speed up from 7.5 kilometers
an hour to 10 kilometers in now.

203
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,840
So an extra third, this boot,
which was kind of evil. Now.

204
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm owned a lot of that though. I
just, I was just a moaning, whining.

205
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,550
Oh dear God, I got through this, but I
was never considering not doing it. And,

206
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,880
and I got the um,
the live feed to,

207
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,680
to London finished at quarter past and
we got there about 30 minutes passed.

208
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,490
We had about two minutes and they just
caught it before they went off at,

209
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:49,680
it was like, you know, like in a film,
you know, it was perfectly designed.

210
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,980
I just knew if I got that
probably I get more money,

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,240
raise more money and extra grand
because we've seen this idiot finish.

212
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,360
He's actually doing it here
though. Um, so that was beautiful.

213
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,850
And then I talked to the, this very
interesting thing because you know,

214
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,490
if you're talking to PR, it was a
press. I talked to the press after that,

215
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,930
but it's a Sunday.
And so they kept talking.

216
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,470
Normally they say we can't talk anymore.

217
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,390
We've got two minutes and then we're
going to talk to important people go away.

218
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,330
That's what normally happens if you're
talking to live press and national press.

219
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
But I was on thing and they just kept
talking to me because obviously a slow

220
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,400
news day, nothing was
happening. And they'll say,

221
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:21,430
we've got this idiot who's just
run, you know, 27 marathons.

222
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,770
And they kept asking me other questions,

223
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,920
what favorite color do you have and
what, what, how, how big are your legs?

224
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,460
Legs? Yeah. I just, I don't know what
they were asking me, but in the end,

225
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,160
these two interviews I did that
with national prayer. I just said,

226
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm going to go away now. I'm going to
stop this. I had to stop my own interview,

227
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,670
which I've never done in my life and I
realize they've just got no one else to

228
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,590
talk to that desperate.

229
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,290
Did you notice a big change in public
perception of you once you completed those

230
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,110
marathons? Yeah, the um, yeah,

231
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,710
the certain community and if you're
transgender guy and you come out,

232
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,200
certain people go worry. But I,
I crossed into a line of, well,

233
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,680
if you're going to do that, and I
hate, I know you do some comedy,

234
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,670
you do the drama stuff, we think
you're a bit bonkers and out there.

235
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,990
But fair play. I've got this
sort of, I got to pass it.

236
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,350
Fair play to you if you're going to do
that. And I was trying to do selection,

237
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:15,550
you know, SAS, they have selection,
your Delta forces, Navy Seals,

238
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,420
they all have this thing that can you
just go on and on and on and it's the

239
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:20,990
stamina thing.
And,

240
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,660
and that was my civilian
selection for my own whatever,

241
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,710
several forces. Just to
understand yourself. Yeah. I uh,

242
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,240
you're out there running around.
I would have a,

243
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,070
there was a guy with a gun next to,
it'll be a good shot.

244
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,610
He said he knew how to shoot things
and the, um, I don't know. I,

245
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,680
I played my cards,
you know,

246
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,770
sometimes you play your cards well it
must have been kind of exhilarating to

247
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,670
others. Something about it. Right. Well
there, there was, I was talking to the um,

248
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,290
[inaudible] I just, I went out cause you
know, obviously they were not dangerous.

249
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,610
There's holiday non-dangerous ones.

250
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,850
It was actually the first day and the
battery's about marathon 10 or 11 or

251
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,600
something. And I felt, you know,

252
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,330
once you're over the 10 mark and
I've never got there, you know,

253
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,940
if you've done the whole South African
thing and failed and people were tweeting

254
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:11,710
about me, Eddie is, you know,
Africa kicked your ass. You
know, you just go with Tia.

255
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,600
This is Africa. Take us on where
huge fucking constantly, hey,

256
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,940
that's what I say.
[inaudible] no, Africa. Yeah,

257
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,910
it's a big African because Africa
is, did you tell them, hey man,

258
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,690
I was on medication.
My [inaudible] didn't really matter.

259
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:25,660
That was just in that whining.

260
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,610
So I just had to come back and I've
tried three times to come back and then I

261
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:34,420
came back and, uh, three times. Yeah,
I kept trying. Can we set the day that,

262
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,050
can we get back and do the thing?
But there's no,

263
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,840
we haven't got enough money
to be able to do that,

264
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,420
that won't be able to set up your
keywords and then suddenly it's on,

265
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,250
it's on it's own. And I didn't,
I couldn't train again. And uh,

266
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,630
so I thought, let's just go get it done.
And then day five was in the hospital.

267
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,100
Day Six was in the hospital as well.

268
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,610
For how after two thirds of the marathon
on day six, I had to go to hospital.

269
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:59,510
Say for what? Um, well, it kept
what happened? Uh, they, my,

270
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,090
my train, my doctor had gone
away, but my train of thought, um,

271
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,200
he thought I just didn't look good.
It was, you know, 35, 38 degrees,

272
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,950
whatever, you know, and I'm used to, what
does that took one? Oh, sorry. Fahrenheit.

273
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, I'd say one 10,
one 15, seven up there.

274
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,200
And um,

275
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,390
I was not used to that and so I was, I
would have made it, I feel, but he didn't,

276
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,210
he felt,
he wanted me to see an extra.

277
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,860
So I saw on the fraud logist I
didn't even know what the word meant,

278
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,000
but nephrologist is a kidney expert.
I thought that would be a renal expert,

279
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:34,910
but no, he's a nephrologist
and it's very cool. Black Dude.

280
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,060
And he was there in South
Africa and eastern East London.

281
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,390
It's called is the city. So it's the big
place and he's going, what are you doing?

282
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,250
Who are you? I'm running for Mandela.
What I want to do this thing and okay.

283
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,790
And uh, he said it's okay. We've checked
out your kidneys, your right, your bloods.

284
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,290
Uh, it's, it's a hydration.
Hydration is terrible.

285
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,670
So I'm going to put three liters into
you and you'll be paying like a horse all

286
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,900
night. And I didn't pee once. So,
ah, that's what you're saying.

287
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,420
You need some hydration and a,
and after that it got better with,

288
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,360
and so they 11, I got into
national, this national park,

289
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,750
so there's no one else there, just me
and animals and this, the, you know,

290
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:19,130
the security people and whatever with
me. And uh, it was kind of beautiful.

291
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,680
It was just beautiful and
that the sun was great,

292
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,760
a sunset going down and there was a
rainstorm as well in the middle of it.

293
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,090
There were wild animals out there.
I don't know, I just felt, okay,

294
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,930
this is n weird place of beauty. And,
and also knowing I'm getting stronger,

295
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm getting stronger. I've gone
through the barrier. Um, and I also,

296
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,640
because I'd read, I'd run four marathons,
then a day off. And then the fifth,

297
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,460
sixth day I ran two thirds or math.

298
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,960
So I'd run forward two
thirds marathons in six days,

299
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,400
which is not good numbers for your head.

300
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,400
You need five and five or
something in something.

301
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,970
But for to 2016 it just didn't work.
And then they run another marathon that,

302
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:53,804
and I said,
hang on,

303
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,780
I've got to run a marathon and a third
and get these numbers matching up.

304
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,050
So I caught up the third marathon and
then it was always day seven and I've run

305
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:05,810
six, eight marathons in nine days.
It was always one day behind.

306
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,810
So I thought last day I'll do a double
marathon and that'll be a good climactic

307
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,210
and of my South African thing.
What is,

308
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:18,770
what is going on with your mind when
you're doing this because you're not

309
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,480
listening to any music, you know, in your,

310
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:23,630
in this sort of meditative state where
you're just left foot, right foot,

311
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,080
left foot, right foot, breathe
in, breathe. Um, yeah, it's,

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,610
I'm saying it's kind of zen but it's not
in a kind of like I'm listening to my

313
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,830
heartbeat or anything. It's more like I,

314
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I just feel uh,
yeah,

315
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,710
just some sort of beautiful thing of
maybe cause that's what we used to be as

316
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:49,280
humans. So maybe I'm reaching
back into some pars memory.

317
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,580
We humans just used to be out on the
plains and we were looking for honey wild

318
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:58,070
honey or barriers, root stuff and, and if
we could trap something we'd see either,

319
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,330
I don't know what,
I can't quite work out what it is,

320
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:04,500
but I just find it beautiful and I do
know what you're getting vitamin D in your

321
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,550
getting stronger from that. Um,
somebody wants read my hand.

322
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,060
I never do the hand palm reading but I
was at a Halloween party and there was a

323
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:14,880
palm reader that there's, I'll
try, I'm in a good place, let's,

324
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,720
let's read my hand and I can't
remember what she said, et Cetera.

325
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,350
You need to get out more easily
outside more. And I thought, okay,

326
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,680
I always felt that I need to be out back
doing stuff. Cause when I was a kid,

327
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,510
I live for soccer, for football, I used
to run like a crazy, I love that game.

328
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,420
And then from the age of 12 I went to a
school that didn't play it and I never

329
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,570
played sports. This is one of
my gifts to myself. Accident.

330
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,150
I think from the age of 12 you know,
you're in your teenage years,

331
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,740
your bones really moving and setting.

332
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,390
And at that time I was hardly doing
anything. So I think my knees,

333
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,210
I've never gone. People say running
in the knees, my knees are not gone.

334
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,710
I run a whole theory about the, the
heel of the foot, which it should never,

335
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,560
you know, you should, you know,
sprinters are always on your toes.

336
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,890
All running should be on the toes.
And I think if the heel hits,

337
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,740
that's what causes the Neils just
needs a script. I'm, it could be wrong,

338
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,340
there's no, no, that's correct. That's
not how people were supposed to run.

339
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:06,900
That was actually changed by Nike.

340
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,380
They developed a running shoe with a
fat heal and they changed the way people

341
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:15,270
run. They changed the gate
and it's responsible for a
lot of injuries. I think so.

342
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,910
And I noticed on horses,
if you look for the heel of a horse,

343
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,330
it's right up by that bum cause
that that, that, that toes,

344
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:25,110
you know the hoof is the toes and then
you go all about that leg and right by

345
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:29,100
the bum is that's the heel that's just
an enormously long foot and you go,

346
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,840
well that's never going to hit the ground
and a dog's done at cats tender it.

347
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,680
We are the ones that use this heel thing
obviously to initially to for walking

348
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:41,970
to make us balanced when we went from the
chimpanzee. Good real estate into the,

349
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,450
you know, we need to. But even then, I
mean most people if you just give them,

350
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,780
if they're barefoot like children for
example, like one of the things that I,

351
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,310
I was reading this book about barefoot
running and how important it is to

352
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:57,090
develop this. And then Mo, most
people that have problems from that,

353
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,330
they're really having problems because
their feet don't have strong muscles in

354
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,920
them because of the atrophy.

355
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,310
And the way they were describing a regular
running shoes is essentially like a

356
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,320
cast and that you're,

357
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:10,710
you're so used to being protected in this
calf that everything sort of just gets

358
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,100
mushy inside of it. And then you're
also striking down on the hill,

359
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,220
which is a very unnatural thing.
And when I watch my kids run,

360
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,380
like my kids were run with me sometimes
and they naturally know to run on the

361
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,480
balls of their feet. That's
how they naturally run. Yeah.

362
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,970
And when people start running,
he'll first, that's where
all the problems come in.

363
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:31,290
It's just not a normal way
for people to run. Yeah.

364
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,810
And I was also in initiative in South
Africa running on certain roads services

365
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,000
where they'd just dropped instead of
doing a tar macadam kind of covering, uh,

366
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:43,050
they had just put rocks,
obviously some Lori had come along.

367
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,800
This truck had just dropped rocks out
of the back to sort of hold together the

368
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,940
in the rainy times and
very uneven surface,

369
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,670
very hard or the foot.
And I was uh,

370
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,450
I was doing these very thin soled
running very thin sole. The shoes.

371
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,130
What kind of shoes are you running with?
Um, well I kept changing them now, so I,

372
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,410
but with the vibrams or then
the of vive. Oh, barefoot ones.

373
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,470
And I'll see you running in barefoot,
running marathons and barefoot shoes.

374
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,790
Well initially I was, and then my train
it, I, it just got so hard that my turn,

375
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,190
I said, look, you got to wear these. And
then I left it to them to choose Mike,

376
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,790
my physio, and he was Olympic
level. So he said, right,

377
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,250
these are going to be better for that. I
prefer you not to be in this. So I said,

378
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,460
okay, you tell me what
she used to wear. I'll,

379
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,170
I'll take care of running the bathroom.

380
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,620
But I do remember seeing little South
African children running on the roads next

381
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,540
to me where they called,
Hey, we run with you.

382
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,750
And they had completely nothing on their
feet and they can deal with these sharp

383
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,260
rocks. Well I thought we already show
him. I was every few steps. Great. Whoa.

384
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,610
Oh Wow. And they would just, yeah,
and they would just, uh, they had,

385
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,190
they were laughing and running
along. Nope. Cause they,

386
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:49,080
their fee that built up like,
and it's very, this very,

387
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:51,730
how say I see South Africa.
Yeah. This is a weird,

388
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:55,600
watch this now it's kind of
fun because I go right back.

389
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,900
I ran with flags. That's,
that's a beautiful thing.

390
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,600
And I was running an Eastern Cape
and they are looking at white guy.

391
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,300
It was a white guy doing,
and this is very rural area.

392
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,350
So I would say more low molar.
That was in the African National Park.

393
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:13,270
That was the rain. That was
the um, the uh, they uh,

394
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,880
where the rhinestone happened cause
he thunder and lightning. That's the,

395
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,970
that's the truck there on the left.
You can see the thing.

396
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,990
And this guy just turned up out of the
blue to track me down. What did he give?

397
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:27,360
You know, just give me a letter saying
thank you for doing stuff, but I,

398
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,270
if I ran with the flag and I, and I
said Molo to people and like led to say,

399
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:35,080
how are you? And, and
in, in the Coosa Casa,

400
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,960
this guy seems like he's
wearing women's clothes as well.

401
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,550
He's wearing a skirt and I think he's a
transgender guy with less hair than me.

402
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:45,000
And yeah, he's bald, but
he's a transgender guy. Yeah.
