00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.700
For much of the time, the way we feel about
- and react to - events is founded on how

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.220
things are in the here and now. For example:

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.779
- I feel very scared because something very
scary is in front of me.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.100
- I feel I’m being judged harshly by the
person I’m speaking to - and I am.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.390
- I withhold my trust because someone I’m
with truly is untrustworthy

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.680
However, one of the momentous discoveries
of 20th century psychology has been that in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.329
certain cases, this isn’t what happens at
all. At points, our behaviour is driven not

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.409
by what is happening in front of us, but by
extremely formative experiences we’ve had

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:56.079
in childhood, which colour and influence how
we behave and think decades later - unless

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.940
and until we become aware of our tendencies,
as the technical term has it, to ‘project’

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.870
responses from the past onto the present,
where they don’t entirely belong.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.870
So:

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.470
- We feel very scared - even though there
is nothing around us to be terrified of.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.960
- We feel harshly judged by someone - who
in fact means very well.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.650
- We avoid intimacy with a person - who actually
deeply merits our trust

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.840
The reason we behave like is that we are generalising
on the basis of certain significant events

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.740
from childhood which have completely altered
our assumptions about the world and other

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
people.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.270
- In early childhood, we experienced the terrifying
volcanic temper of a violent parent. Now we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.500
see the threat of violence everywhere.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.659
- We were humiliated by our mother for the
first decade of life. Now a lot of people

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.909
seem out to humiliate us.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.090
- A father whom we loved and trusted left
the family and broke off contact suddenly.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.259
Now most relationships feel like they’re
about to end in disaster.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.519
When we’re involved in a projection, we
believe ourselves to be utterly justified

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.480
in responding as we do, and might take deep
offence if someone accused us of ‘projecting’

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.230
on the basis of forgotten past events.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.620
Because of this innate denial and ignorance
of our projections, psychologists have developed

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.481
special tests, known as projection tests,
to tease out our underlying assumptions, show

00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:41.069
us what is on our minds and enable us to see
reality more clearly.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.970
The most well-known of such tecsts was devised
in the 1930s by the Swiss psychologist Hermann

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.260
Rorschach, who created a group of ambiguous
images, then asked his patients to reflect

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.849
without inhibition on what they felt these
looked like, evoked and made them think of.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.519
Crucially, these images have no predetermined
meaning; they aren’t about anything in particular.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.209
They are suggestive in a huge variety of directions
- and so different people will see different

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.580
traits and atmospheres in them according to
what their past most readily predisposes them

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.989
to imagine.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.739
To one individual who has inherited from their
parents a rather kindly and forgiving conscience,

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.809
an image could be seen as a sweet mask, with
eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:41.669
and wide flaps extending from the cheeks.
Another, more traumatised by a domineering

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:48.420
father, might see it as a powerful figure
viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.300
legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward
as if poised for attack.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.799
With similar intent, the psychologists Henry
Murray and Christiana Morgan created a set

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.400
of drawings showing people whose moods and
actions were deliberately indeterminate. In

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.849
one example, two men are positioned close
to one another with their faces able to bear

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.489
a host of interpretations.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.950
‘It’s perhaps a father and son, mourning
together for a shared loss’, one respondent

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.880
who had inherited a close relationship with
his father might say. Or another, bearing

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.190
the burden of a punitive past, might assert:
‘It’s a manager in the process of sacking

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.290
a young employee who has failed at an important
task’. Or a third, wrestling with a legacy

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.470
of censured homosexuality, might venture:
‘I feel something obscene is going on out

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.030
of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the
older man is looking at the younger guy’s

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.910
penis and making him feel very embarrassed
but perhaps also somehow turned on....’

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.930
One thing we do really know about these ambiguous
images is that they are not precise, the elaboration

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.630
is coming from the person who looks at them,
and the way they elaborate, the kind of story

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.110
they tell, is saying far more about their
emotional inheritance than it does about the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.090
images themselves.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.220
Following this pattern, in the 1950s, the
American psychologist Saul Rosenzweig designed

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.550
tests to tease out our inherited ways of dealing
with humiliation and bad news. His Picture

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.630
Frustration Study (1955) showed a range of
situations to which our psychological histories

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.900
would give us very different templates of
responses.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.700
One kind of person, the bearer of a solid
emotional inheritance, will tend to be resilient

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.390
when someone has behaved badly towards them
or is causing a problem unnecessarily. Another

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.600
might be convinced that they they deserve
quite bad treatment from others, a legacy

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.030
of a difficult childhood.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.600
A fourth projection exercise asks us to say
the very first thing that comes to mind when

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.430
we try to finish particular sentences that
are fired at us. For example:

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.050
Men in authority are generally…

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.620
Young women are almost always…

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.650
When I am promoted, what’s bound to happen
is…

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.880
When someone is late, it must be because…

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.180
When I hear someone described as ‘very intellectual’,
I imagine them being…[d]

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.450
Being mature means accepting with good grace
that we might be involved in multiple projections

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:51.080
and so may be bringing exaggerated dynamics
and excess energy to a lot of situations.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.920
We aren’t of course responsible for the
events in childhood from which our projections

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.180
arose, but we do have a responsibility as
adults to try to understand the nature of

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.390
our projections - and to warn others, and
ourselves, of how they might be skewing our

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.320
behaviour 
in the here and now.
