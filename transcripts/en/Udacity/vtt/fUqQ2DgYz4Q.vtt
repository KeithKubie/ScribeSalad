00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.130
And finally, let's look at
the fully associative cache.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.720
If we have an eight entry cache,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.010
a fully associative cache is one where
any block can map to any of these lines.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.850
In this case the address breaks
down into the offset part.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.490
The number of index bits is
the number of bits we need

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.890
to tell us where in the cache we can be.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.830
But because we can be
anywhere in the cache,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.610
we don't need any bits to tell us that.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.720
So there are no index bits when
using a fully associative cache.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.310
All of the remaining
bits are simply the tag.
