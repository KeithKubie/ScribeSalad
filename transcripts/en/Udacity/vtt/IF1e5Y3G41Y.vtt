00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.250
All right. So let's make sure that we get this concept.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.730
So let's evaluate, tit-for-tat versus tit-for-tat, spy versus spy, and ask

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.620
whether or not they are subgame perfect, or in a subgame

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.970
perfect equilibrium with each other. And your choices are yes and no.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.820
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.290
&gt;&gt; But if you say no, I'd like you to give me a sequence to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.350
show that it is not subgame perfect. In other words, that if they were to take

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.380
this sequence of actions and this one was to take this sequence of actions,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.740
it would leave the machines in a position where they would not be willing to

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.480
follow through on their threat. That it would be better for them to do something

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.160
else in the long run, assuming that

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.130
they're still playing against the other tit-for-tat machine.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.110
&gt;&gt; From that point on.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.550
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.330
&gt;&gt; Just imagine that someone could go in and change one thing.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.680
Would you still want to follow tit-for-tat the next time step or not?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.360
if that has to be just one thing, but yeah. That's

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.520
right. Change, change the sequence leading up to this point and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.210
then say, okay, do you still want to do what tit-for-tat is

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.000
telling you to do, or would you rather do something else?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. I think I got it.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.500
&gt;&gt; Cool. All right. Go.
