00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:02.918
- [Voiceover] What I want
to talk about in this video

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:04.699
is the liter.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:07.724
The liter. Let me write this down.

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.706
The liter and the liter

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:12.929
is a unit for measuring fluid volumes,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.179
or how much space does a fluid take up.

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:19.955
So what does one liter look like?

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:22.131
Well one of these milk bottles

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:24.778
is a liter and your most typically

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:27.448
going to think about a
liter in your everyday life

00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:30.397
when your buying some type
of beverages, milk, or water.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.231
In fact next time you
go to the grocery store

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.995
see a lot of the bottles you get.

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:37.087
They might be exactly one
liter, some of the soda bottles

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.722
are two liters, but this
right over here is one.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:44.143
One liter, we write a capital
L for short, that's one liter

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.576
and so there's six liters in total

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:47.135
in this little carrying case

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:50.120
but each of these milk
bottles is one liter.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.122
So that's a liter but
what if we want to go

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.687
to really small volumes of water?

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.123
Well if we want to go to
really small volumes of water

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.615
we normally talk about milliliters.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.324
Milliliters, let me write this down.

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:03.882
Milli

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.499
Milli

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.414
Milliliters. Actually
let me write it this way.

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.898
Let me write milli in another color.

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:11.731
Milli

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.940
Milliliters.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:17.658
So it's a milli liter.

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.850
And a milliliter, a milli is a prefix

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.790
that you'll see a lot
when your using units

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.105
and that means one
one-thousandth of a liter.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:29.327
So this means one one-thousandth.

00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.077
One one-thousandth of

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
Of a

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.244
of a liter

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:36.702
and the notation for milliliter

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:40.571
is a lowercase m and and uppercase L.

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.584
Milli liter.

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:43.314
Another way to think
about it, it would take

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:47.064
one thousand milliliters
to get to one liter.

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:50.250
So what does a milliliter look like?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.152
Well if you imagine
these medicine droppers,

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:53.965
a milliliter would be about that high

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:55.105
on one of those medicine droppers

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:56.376
and a lot of these medicine droppers

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:57.926
actually will have a milliliter,

00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.654
actually they'll have
up to five milliliters

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:02.315
marked off but a milliliter
will be about that much

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.090
or if you were to take a teaspoon

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.529
from your cabinet in your kitchen

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.099
and you would scoop out
a teaspoon of water,

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.769
that, so this one over here
is going to be one milliliter

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.936
and a teaspoon of fluid,
that's going to be about five.

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:20.661
That's going to be about five milliliters.

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:21.973
So another way to think about it is

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:24.198
you would have to take a
thousand of these drops

00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:27.281
to fill one of these bottles of milk.

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:32.093
A thousand milliliters to get to one liter

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:34.632
or you would have to do, let's see, five,

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.156
you'd have to put five,

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.041
sorry, you'd have to do
two hundred teaspoons

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.434
of say milk, to fill up this entire thing

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:44.940
because each of them is five milliliters.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.544
Two hundred times five milliliters,

00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:48.164
you're going to have
a thousand milliliters

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:49.627
which is one liter.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.435
Let me write this down.

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:54.454
This right over here, this is one liter

00:02:54.454 --> 00:02:57.491
which is the same thing as one thousand,

00:02:57.491 --> 00:03:00.375
one thousand milliliters.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.036
Now what if we go to

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.863
things that are much larger.

00:03:03.863 --> 00:03:05.393
What if we go to things
that are much larger

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.951
than the scale

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:09.059
of a jar of milk.

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.311
Say a swimming pool and
this right over here,

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:14.075
this is a picture of a
olympic size swimming pool

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.443
which is, for the most
part, the largest pools,

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:18.762
well there some larger pools
in some fancy hotel and things,

00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:20.398
but they're very large pools.

00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:21.691
So what do you think would be

00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:23.966
if one milk bottle

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.042
has a, one like this,

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:28.006
has a fluid volume of one liter,

00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:30.305
what do you think about
a whole swimming pool?

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.546
Well actually a swimming like this,

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:36.758
if it is 25 meters wide and 50 meters long

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.199
and two meters deep,
it actually would have

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.567
a fluid volume, are you ready for this?

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:45.734
It would have a fluid volume
of 2.5 million liters.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.805
So if you filled this up with
milk, you can use that milk

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:56.430
to fill up 2.5 million of these bottles.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.304
So that's just an appreciation
for just how much fluid

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:00.396
it would take to fill up at least

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:01.577
a big swimming pool like this,

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:03.354
an olympic size swimming pool.

00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:05.544
A swimming pool that you
might more typically see

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:07.787
at someone's house, who isn't, you know,

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:09.316
that doesn't have an
olympic size swimming pool

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:11.474
so kinda of a house size swimming pool,

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:13.959
it's still going to be,
it's not usually to see

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.734
one that will be more than one hundred,

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:17.567
100,000

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:20.093
100,000 liters.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:23.544
So once again, are you
thinking about teaspoons

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:26.033
or drops from a dropper,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.937
your thinking in the milliliter range.

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:29.423
If you're thinking about the type of,

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:30.972
something that you might drink in a day

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:33.321
or that your family might
drink over, say a week,

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:35.320
you're thinking in,
really, the liter range.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.917
And if you're thinking about
how much fluid it would take

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.507
to fill a swimming
pool, now you're talking

00:04:40.507 --> 00:04:42.716
in the tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:45.383
or even millions of liter range.
