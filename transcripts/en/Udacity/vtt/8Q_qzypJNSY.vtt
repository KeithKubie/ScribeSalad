00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this challenge problem, imagine that we have three charges here

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and they're arrange in this equilateral triangle shape

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so the distance between any of the two charges is the same.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This also means that this angles here are all equal to 60 degrees.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All right--so it turns out that when you calculate the net force acting on each one of these charges,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you get the following results that for this particle the net force is straight down

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and for this particle the net force points at this angle 23.41 degrees with this horizontal line here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Using this information alone, can you tell me what the charges for this particle and this particle

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in terms of the charge on this particle q.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To clarify, if you think this particle here has a charge five times greater than this one,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but has the opposite sign, you'd say that this particle has a charge of -5q.

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
All right. Good luck solving this problem and please feel free to discuss it in the forum.
