00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.507
- Now I have never seen a man
get hit by a truck before,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.176
so I don't know if they
always hit the concrete

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.179
and then Bruce Lee back up
immediately ready to fight,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.247
but that is what he did.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.181
It was like, boom, boom,

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.483
let's fucking do it!

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.386
(techno music)

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.621
(growling)

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.514 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Welcome to This Is Not
Happening, everybody.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.815
(crowd cheering)

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:49.649
Thank you!

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.385
So, here's the show.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.686
Just a bunch of funny people

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we're all
telling true stories.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.323 align:start size:94% position:6%
Please, give it up for Mr.
Cy Amundson, everybody.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.158
Let him hear it!

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:58.992
Cy Amundson.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.994
(crowd cheering)

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.164 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I used to be
terrified of flying.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.665
Terrified.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.168
And a number of years ago, my
parents were going to adopt

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.037
three teenage girls from Texas.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.073
And before we adopted
them, the whole family

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.543
had to go down to Texas
to meet them, to prove

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.045
that we were an okay family
to be in charge of children.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I, I thought if I flew,
I would die, obviously.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
So instead, from
Minneapolis, Minnesota

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:30.023
to Dallas, Texas, I
rode a Greyhound bus.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start position:0%
And after you ride a
Greyhound, you realize dying...

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.361
Not that bad.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.729
(crowd laughs)

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.832
Use a pillow, you can
stretch your legs out,

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
you don't have to
worry about somebody

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.401
trying to finger
you in your sleep.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.435
(crowd laughs)

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.605
Comparatively, it's pretty nice.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.709
So, I dressed the part,
I wore hospital scrubs,

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.711 align:start size:97% position:3%
a Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt
that could not have

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.214
been intended for a man.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.049
And a camouflage vest.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.254
I loaded the bus
and I found a seat.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.755 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was one of the
first guys on the bus,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:03.990
and I found my seat.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.860
Right here are three,
Mexican, young Hispanic

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.528
Mexican type-y folk.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.964
Somewhere in that region.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.666 align:start size:94% position:6%
Behind me is a man, a
grown man, with a stutter.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.002
Now I only know he has a
stutter because every town

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.737
we came into on the entire trip,

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.074
he had to announce it out loud.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.043
(stuttering)

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:24.978
Topeka!

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.746
(crowd laughs)

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.515
Now I'm not gonna make fun
of somebody with a stutter

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.016
he can't help that.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.217 align:start size:94% position:6%
I just don't understand
why the fuck he's boasting

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.319
about it right now.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.754
You don't see people
without arms like,

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.891 align:start size:97% position:3%
Hey come watch me swim
laps at the pool (screams).

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.194
And then to Stutters
is an old Nigerian man.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.696
So we're cruising along,
and I'm trying to sleep,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.698 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I can't 'cause
Stutters is announcing

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.634 align:start size:84% position:16%
every town and
village we come into.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start size:97% position:3%
We pull into a McDonald's
slash gas station parking lot

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.407
in Oklahoma City at 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:58.044
The bus parks, everyone
gets off to smoke cigs.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you ride the
bus, you puff cigs.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.349
You a kid, on the bus?

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.617
Puff cigs.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.119
Everybody.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.520
The only three people who
stay on the bus are me,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.022
Stutters, and the Nigerian.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.758
Literally, everybody else
gets off to smoke cigs.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.526
They get out and they're
right in front of the bus

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.562 align:start size:84% position:16%
right here, in
their group smoking.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.031
And because it's the South,
at 2 o'clock in the morning,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.366
on the other side of the
parking lot is a group of

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.802 align:start size:88% position:13%
Good Old Boys, and their
significant others,

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.238
and their pickup trucks.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.072
Correct.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.675
(crowd laughs)

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:36.182 align:start size:97% position:3%
Within a matter of
moments, that devolved into

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.254
the Good Old Boys and
the bus people shouting

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
at each other across
the parking lot

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.192
like some long distance
episode of Maury Povich.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.026
Like, fuck you!

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.494
No, fuck you!

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.829
(screeching)

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
Just fucking, cackling,
white trash madness

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.034
at one another, right?

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.636
So they're going back and forth,

00:03:56.636 --> 00:04:00.640
and then the Good Old Boys
hop in their pickup trucks,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.141
they start hopping in
their pickup trucks,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.979
driving as fast as they can
at the group of bus people

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.649
and then at the last second
(car noise) they peel away

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.818
and circle to do it again.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.521 align:start size:97% position:3%
They are playing Human
Chicken with the bus people.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.990
(crowd laughs)

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.791
I'm sitting watching it unfold,

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.293
and then I see a truck coming

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.561
and I remember thinking,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.464
oh, well that one's
coming way too fast.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.833
And it was.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.301 align:start size:94% position:6%
And at the last minute
when it tried to peel away

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.637
it hit one of the bus dudes.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.941 align:start position:0%
The moment it hit the bus dude,
the old Nigerian behind me

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.909
goes, kaboom mother fuckers!

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.512
(crowd laughs)

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.349 align:start size:81% position:19%
He's the only hero
in this story.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.418
(crowd laughs)

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:49.022 align:start size:88% position:13%
He is the only champion
in this tale, okay?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.160
Now I had never seen a man
get hit by a truck before

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.863
so I don't know if they
always hit the concrete

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:01.034
and then Bruce Lee back up
immediately ready to fight.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.035
But that is what he did.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:02.869
It was like, boom, boom,

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.537
let's fucking do it!

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.409
The two sides rush each
other like a WWE event

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.277
to the middle of
the parking lot.

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, if you've never
seen bus people

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.281
fight parking lot people.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.752
It's a lot like the Civil War.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
If the South would've
fought itself.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.425
(crowd laughs)

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.027
The moment it starts getting
ugly, I had this thing in me.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.862
My dad, he taught me
to be a peacekeeper.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.864
So I'm thinking, I
have to do something,

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.900
and I stood up to go
help, but I shouldn't

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.335
have had that thought.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.303
I shouldn't have
gone to do this,

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:41.441
this here is natural
selection at its best.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
Okay, Darwin could write
a book about what's

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.711
gonna happen in
this parking lot.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.314 align:start size:88% position:13%
People need to die,
gene pools need to end.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.950
It has to end here.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.685
But I didn't think
that way, I was like,

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.120
I gotta help,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I got up, and to his
credit, Stutters came with me

00:05:56.022 --> 00:06:00.193
and the two of us got off
the bus, and by that point

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.896 align:start size:97% position:3%
the bus driver had come out
of the gas station McDonald's,

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.866
and it was the three of us
in the middle of this fight

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.801
trying to separate it.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.236
It actually went really well.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.838
It separated really easily.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.573
Everybody was pretty calm.

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:18.211
When the guy, the truck, who
did the hitting of the man

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.480
came pulling back up.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.014
In the truck was the man who

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
committed the attempted
vehicular homicide.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.418
(crowd laughs)

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
Next to him was his
cartoonishly obese wife.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.823
And in the back, well
not really in the back,

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.759
just more darting around the cab

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.494 align:start size:84% position:16%
was a nine-year-old
boy just like

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:38.631
Mountain Dew! Mountain Dew!
Mountain Dew! Mountain Dew!

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause fuck seat belts
and safety, right?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.136 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's two o'clock in
Oklahoma, he's not fucking

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.238
going to college, right?

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.407
We might as well get a
jump start on his organs

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.908
is what I'm saying.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.176
(woman groans)

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.512
Yeah, welcome to the show.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:55.114
(crowd laughs)

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, that truck doesn't
even stop rolling

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.321
when that obese woman
flings the door open

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.290 align:start size:84% position:16%
and starts storming
at the group of people

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.160
accusing the man who
got hit by the truck

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.994
of faking it.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.328
You're a fucking faker!

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.063
Fuck you you fucking faker!

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:15.301
You took a goddamn dive,
you're a fucking faker!

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.969
She's roaring up the fight.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.439
To his credit, the
man pulled the truck

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.740
the rest up of the
way up to the fight

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.008
and got out way calmer.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.543
He was like, yeah, I did that.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:26.813
And then his boy got
out, and because he's

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.848 align:start size:84% position:16%
a wonderful father,
he took his son

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.417 align:start size:84% position:16%
he put him up on the
hood of the truck

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:34.187
so he could watch
over the fight.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:38.191
Like it was some scene
from Hillbilly Lion King.

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:42.028
One day son, this
could all be yours.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start size:84% position:16%
♪ Ha svenya! Skitty
ski, red bull!

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:51.170
♪ Who Toby Keith, tattoos

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.574
(crowd laughs)

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.210
The dad steps in front of
the truck to the fight,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.213
by this point everything
has calmed back down again.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
Either because the woman
is no longer angry,

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:06.252
or b, she is winded
from the 11-step walk

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:09.755
from where she exited the
truck to the fight itself.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.758 align:start size:84% position:16%
Doesn't matter why,
she's no longer angry.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.227
Everything seems fine.

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
When one of the bus people
did the funniest thing

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:18.431
you could ever do
in that scenario.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start size:84% position:16%
They threw a Diet
Coke at the fat woman.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.070
(crowd laughs)

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.505
Now, I'm trying to
keep peace and I know

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:29.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's a fucking boss
move right there.

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:31.010
That's a winner's play.

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.613
He throws a Diet Coke.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:37.083
It hits the fat woman in
the neck-ish, chest-ish,

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.684
boob, you can't tell what it is,

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.052
but in this region.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:43.589
It explodes, she reacts
like it's Holy Water.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.558
(screams)

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.527
So fucking funny!

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.463
Oh my God, it was
so fucking funny.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.066
Her husband did not
feel the same way

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.035
about the humor that I did.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.737
He lost his damn mind.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:00.473
He started Tasmanian
deviling his arms.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.108
Trying to murder someone.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.610
And I'm right in front of him.

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.080
I'm not trying to punch him,
I'm not trying to hurt him,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.750 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm literally just trying
to stop a homicide.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.153
I just have my hands on his
chest, that's all I'm doing.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:15.655
This is it.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.623
I don't know if his son
thought that I was trying

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:20.526
to hurt his dad, but
that nine-year-old boy

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.962
shouted the words Hulk Hogan.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.401 align:start position:0%
Which isn't even a fucking
relevant wrestler at this time,

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.971
leapt off the hood of the truck,

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.373 align:start size:81% position:19%
and flying punched
me in the face.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:37.109
(crowd laughing)

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.847 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, I don't know if you've
ever had to opportunity

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.850 align:start size:97% position:3%
to be in an Oklahoma City
McDonald's slash gas station

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
parking lot at 2
o'clock in the morning

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:50.523
with 60 of the grossest
people on the earth,

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.559
just fucking Crocs, and
socks, and jean shorts

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.529
they cut themselves, and
sleeveless racing t-shirts,

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.864
and fucking Tweety Bird tattoos.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.434
(crowd laughs)

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.105 align:start size:94% position:6%
And been able to be the
worst out of those people.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.174 align:start size:94% position:6%
But I've lived that,
'cause I had a real moment

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:11.811
where I was like, I
am gonna fuck this

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.245
nine-year-old up!

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.181
(crowd laughs)

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.582
And I stepped to him.

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.284 align:start size:84% position:16%
I stepped to a
nine-year-old child.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.785
I did the what!

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.355 align:start position:0%
The
I'm-gonna-crush-your-face-child.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.589
That move.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.791
Literally 60 of the
worst people on earth

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:29.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
all at the same
time were like, no!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.529
Fight's over!

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
That is the exact
moment the police car

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.238
pulls into the parking lot.

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:42.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
They see 60 disgusting
adults going, no!

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:48.547
A child and a grown man in
a Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.219
welded back ready
to melt his nose.

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:57.790
Now, the good news
is I didn't get in

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.160
any legal trouble
for the incident.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
They believed me, I told
my side of the story,

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.296
there were other witnesses.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.799
I was exonerated in the process.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:10.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
The bad news is I
had to miss the bus.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.671
They left without it.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.139
Anybody who was involved in
the fight had to stay behind

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.573
and do statements.

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.742 align:start size:97% position:3%
We missed the bus so I missed
my bus, I have to sleep

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:19.378
in the Oklahoma
City bus station.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:22.181 align:start position:0%
And take a different bus in
the morning, because fast fact,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.117 align:start size:94% position:6%
the longest you can be
banned for a Greyhound bus

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:26.919
is until the bus shows up.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.522
(crowd laughs)

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.997
So I'm getting on the
bus in the morning,

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.332
it's been a long night,
and it hit me I was like,

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.368
oh shit, I have to call my dad.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.970
I'm not gonna be there when
he thinks I'm gonna be there.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.607 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I call my dad and he
answered in an incredible mood

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.142
'cause why wouldn't he?

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.411
This is one of the monumental
weekends in his entire life.

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.879
He goes, hey bud,
how's it going?

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.348 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was like, dad, hey
just real quick, I am not

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:59.251
gonna be there this morning.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.219 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was an
incident last night.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.754
I threatened to punch a child.

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.322
I didn't punch a child, he
punched me first actually.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's a fat woman
and Diet Coke,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.559
and I was actually
trying to keep peace.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.128
I wanted to fucking punch
the child, but I didn't.

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.764
The point is, I'm gonna be on
a different bus later today.

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.467
And my dad goes, all right,
well, I'm gonna take you

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.669
off speaker phone there, bud.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:19.238
(crowd laughs)

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:24.043 align:start size:88% position:13%
My dad was at breakfast
with my soon-to-be

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:27.213
three new sisters, two
of their foster parents,

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.749
and three social workers
from the state of Texas.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.350
(crowd laughs)

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.820
So I am still a little
bit scared of flying,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.922 align:start size:81% position:19%
but I'm definitely
far more scared

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:40.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
of all the disgusting
trash in between places.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.393
(crowd cheering)
(techno music)

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:43.329
Thank you guys so much!
