The use case diagram lays out the set of use cases.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.990
But, what's an individual use case?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.730
Well, it's a story,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.610
and the story can appear as unstructured text or in a tabular form.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.669
The unstructured text might tell the story about an individual user

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.742
named Foster who wants to buy something at Amazon.

00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:20.976
Foster goes to the Amazon web site,

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:25.071
Foster browses until he finds the particular item that he wants,

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:29.391
he adds it to the shopping cart, he then goes to the check-out page,

00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:34.624
he provides information about his billing, and then submits a purchase request.
