00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.610
PRESENTER 1: --at
Google and LCS.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.030
And I also am one of the--

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.300
I'm not exactly sure what
my role in this Women at

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.030
Google thing is.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.820
I just know that I've been asked
to help recruit women

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.400
leaders, both internally and
externally, to come talk to us

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.130
occasionally--

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.990
hi guys, come on in--

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.970
so we can get you into career
paths of great women leaders,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.800
leadership style, and just
get to expand our

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.640
network a little bit.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.940
And a special thanks
and welcome to the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.580
fellas who joined us.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.830
Woo hoo!

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.420
Because I think a lot of what
Daina will talk about today is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.890
not only relevant to women,
but for all of us.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.250
And I think we'll all be able
to learn through her

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.010
experience.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970
A little background on
how I know Daina.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.010
When I was ahoy and
running our HP

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.540
business, Daina was a client.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.120
And there was just something
about her that I think you'll

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.660
quickly relate to after
you get to talk with

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.500
her a little bit.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.580
That she's just someone that
people are drawn to.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.110
And you probably don't know
this, but mentors can take on

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.460
a lot of different forms.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.590
People who you run to
with your problems.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.770
But I think a mentor, for me,
is oftentimes people that I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.120
just kind of watch, and I learn
from and see how they

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.850
create relationships and
move things along.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.640
And I think one of the biggest
lessons in collaboration that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.030
I got was actually from Daina.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.920
We were working on a deal,
some kind of program--

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.820
I'm not exactly sure what the
details were-- years ago.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.430
And it was us and a creative
agency and a media agency.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.660
Was it Project Direct?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.410
Yeah, one of our first
engagement programs.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.270
Daina was actually
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.960
And oftentimes you get a lot
of the infighting, and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.210
everybody wants to
take control.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.699
And Daina was finally
like, just everybody

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.170
get around the table.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.040
I want Google.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.550
I want the agencies.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.740
You all are important.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.830
I love you all.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.600
We're all just going to make
this happen together.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.320
And we'll all celebrate
in the success.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.170
And people followed along,
because she set the tone.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.730
I think that that is a really
good lesson for us, whether

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.330
we're working with
external teams or

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.670
internal teams or whatever.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.290
It's like, if you can be more
inclusive, you gain the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.270
loyalties of the people
you're working with.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.400
And I think that's what
has set Daina as

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.510
such a great leader.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.470
So we met at HP.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.580
And now, of course, she's the
Global CEO of Performics.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.810
I'm super proud of her as I've
been able to watch that.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.460
And she's going to talk to us
today about that path and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.550
leadership lessons
along the way.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.400
And we'll be able to
take questions.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.843
So I hope you enjoy Daina
as much as I do.

00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:03.316
DAINA MIDDLETON: Thank you.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.210
Thank you [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.700
So I feel like I need to just
come over here, like a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.560
fireside chat type of thing.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.820
And Stephanie's running
my presentation.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.530
So thank you for having me.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.080
Actually, it's a real treat,
both to come to Google, as

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.840
well as actually to come
to San Francisco.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.180
I don't get to San Francisco
nearly often enough.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.770
I used to come when
I worked for HP.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.590
I worked for HP 16 years.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.670
So I used to come almost every
week for 16 years.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.930
And so I very much miss it.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.660
For a long time, Chica--

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.630
now, see I say Chicago now.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.420
San Francisco is like
my second home.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.770
But now it's Chicago.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.190
Chicago is really
my second home.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.950
So thank you for having me.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.690
I'll talk a little bit about
my view of the world.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.590
But I want to leave plenty of
time for questions, for you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.180
guys to ask me just anything.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.783
And I'm willing to answer
nearly anything.

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:57.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.520
Nearly.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.710
I am being taped, right?

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.150
OK.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.220
So we can go on.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.610
So I want to give you a little
bit of background, just a

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.990
refresher course on what
Performics is for those of you

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.230
who don't know.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.470
So Performics really was born
in 1998, as one of the first

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.480
affiliate companies.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.260
So really, it's been a
performance marketing company

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.370
its entire life and got into
both the paid search and the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.070
organic search business within
a couple of years.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.170
Because I think we recognized
right away that if you put all

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.320
of those pieces together, you
can better manage the holistic

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.950
performance.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.180
Because there's a lot of overlap
within those channels.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.700
And then very shortly after
that, we merged with a little

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.880
company called DoubleClick
and very much became

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.530
a technology company.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.440
And so if you look on this map,
where I show up here is

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.760
that we're on the 2004, 2005
time frame, I was a client and

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.770
hired Performics to be my
global search partner.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.700
Ironically, about that same
time, guess what happened?

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.990
DoubleClick became industry
standard and Google acquired

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.820
the company.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.970
And I think we always knew that
Google would spit out the

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.040
services component and keep
the technology components,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.310
because it would be a
conflict of interest

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.460
if that didn't happen.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.220
Little did I know, back during
that time, that I would end up

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.900
back at Performics.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.170
Had no idea at the time.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.070
So I could go on.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.930
So obviously, if you think
back to your history with

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.160
Performics, up until the
Motorola acquisition, the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.145
Performics DoubleClick
acquisition was the largest

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:29.510
that Google has ever acquired.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.670
But of course, now that
has been beaten.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.910
But then Publicis came in and
bought the company about three

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.895
years ago--

00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:40.610
no, four years ago --and really
housed the company at

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.940
its center for a while.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.750
And I think the company was
pretty lost for a while.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.560
And quite frankly, about that
time, if you think about the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.880
whole history of Performics, it
had been bought, sold, and

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.380
merged four times
in five years.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.620
That's a lot for a company
to endure.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.880
And so, you can move on
to the next slide.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.160
When I got the company, it
was in pretty bad shape.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.310
Revenues weren't huge.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.660
These are US numbers.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.755
But we were losing money,
about 10% a

00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:09.640
year, when I got it.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.780
So the great news is very much
a turnaround type of story.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.000
And if you look at Performics
today, we are in 19 markets.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.390
We'll end the year with 19
markets globally and around

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.960
700 employees.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840
So that's the company
that I manage today.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.560
Doing very well and, I think,
really turning the corner, in

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.520
terms of establishing itself
as a global performance

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.300
marketing company.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.630
And certainly a very key, good
partner for Google as well.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:47.700
So I want to talk less about
Performics and more about some

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.300
of the issues that we're facing
in the workplace today.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.100
And this is a topic that's near
and dear to my heart.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.240
We'll talk about the fact that
I have a book coming out on

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.010
marketing this month,
actually.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.100
In fact, I just got a note today
from one of the senior

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.420
editors at Audible.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.140
And I get to go read my book and
record it in audio format

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.190
in the next few weeks,
which was exciting.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.540
I always thought I would write
a historical novel.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.890
But no, I wrote a boring
business book.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.060
And once you learn to play this
book game, I'm actually

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.730
in the process of writing
a book about women

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.890
in leadership next.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.000
Because I think it's
really important.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.060
And there are some lessons
that I've learned in this

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.400
process that I can help maybe
translate, not just for women,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.100
but I think for all of us that
are really struggling with

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.890
that somewhat in our
roles today.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.710
And I wanted to talk
more about that.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.900
It's also near and dear to
my heart because I've

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.610
superimposed my daughter's
photograph onto this

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.260
graduation.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.670
She has 15 days of
school left.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.420
And she will graduate
from college.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.750
I have one son who is 25.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.550
She's 23.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.000
And then my youngest
son is 19.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.840
So they're all gone.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.900
But my daughter is out
to conquer the world.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.510
In fact, recently she came and
spent a week at Performics.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.400
She majored in psychology.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.740
I always thought that she would
be great in marketing.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.970
But she kind of poo-pooed that
all along, went and explored

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.590
physical therapy for awhile.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.990
Then she spent a week
at Performics and

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.380
decided she loved it.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.810
And she wanted to work for me.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.610
And I said no, you can't.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.390
And so my boss happened to be
there the week that she spent

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.200
the week at Performics.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.520
And he said, so, did you
get what you want?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.180
And she said, yes.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.170
And he said, well, what
are you going to do?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.260
And she said, I'm going to go
to work for a competitor and

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.309
kick my mom's ass.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.350
So she thinks everything's
great.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.990
And she has no issues.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.690
And she does not see that she
has any barriers, which I

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.789
think is fantastic.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.870
And she will be a
great success.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.430
But if you go on and look at
the numbers, they're not as

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.140
rosy as you might think.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.810
So since Performics is so much
of a data company and you guys

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.470
are so much of a data company,
I thought I would

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.450
start with the data.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.970
Which really, if you look at
some of these statistics, we

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.010
haven't moved a lot in the
last 40 years, honestly.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.560
We've been hugely responsible
women in the workforce for the

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.430
growth of the GDP in the US.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.550
It's a tremendous contribution
that women have made.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.970
But you look at the very top
50% of the workforce,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.340
obviously 52% is women.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.000
Graduate rates are fantastic.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240
But as you move up the food
chain-- and I certainly

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.390
experience this every day--

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.720
it's bleaker and bleaker.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.040
And there's a lot of
reasons for that.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.890
I think a lot of it is--

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.226
and many women are talking
about this--

00:09:39.226 --> 00:09:42.800
the struggle in managing your
family and all the different

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.390
roles that we make.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.870
We have a tough time balancing
all those things.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.570
In my industry--

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.630
advertising and marketing--

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.500
director level and above, the
average percentage of women

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.640
holding that is 4%.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.660
4%.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.500
In an industry where clearly
we're marketing to 85% of the

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.890
decision makers who happen to
be women today, which is

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.270
really pretty sad.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.880
On a very near and dear topic
to me, since I'm in the

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.290
process of marketing a book, I
had a great idea for a book

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.800
that I've been talking
about since 2007.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.960
I actually bought the URL
in 2007 for the concept.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.650
Had a hell of a time
selling it.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.510
And why did I have a hell
of a time selling it?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.880
Because I'm a woman author
in a B2B space.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.320
And why is that important?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.990
It's important because all
women read more than men.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.970
But they don't read
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.640
So I think what's really
important though, and more

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.230
important than probably the
numbers, is the story behind

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.970
the numbers.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.170
And that is what's
really happening

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.170
to these young women.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.720
And it's something that
I take an interest in.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.650
Because if you look at Publicis
group as a whole, we

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.250
have almost 70% of the entering
workforce in the

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.490
beginning of their careers, as
people are coming out of

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.890
college, are women.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.890
And then you get to the
top and that director

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.880
level, and it's 2%.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.590
And so, where we're really
losing those women are in

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.340
their mid 30s to early 40s
when they are really

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.570
struggling, I think,
with that balance.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.340
And I took a couple
of quotes here.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.190
I've done several panels with
Wendy Clark at Coke, who's

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.640
just a great woman
to work with.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.080
And she very much has a
passion around this

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.720
space for Coke, too.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.690
But her quote is "Middle- and
upper-middle-management levels

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.690
are rich with female talent,
but very thin at the top.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.220
The ready in a few years and
ready in five year buckets are

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.010
often rich with women, making
the company feel very good

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.450
about its prospects.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.870
But the 'ready now' bucket
is year after year."

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.520
So this is the great Romney,
I have tons of

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.900
women in binders, right?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.750
Great.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.440
Let's try to get the women out
of the binders, shall we?

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.600
That's the most important thing
that we can do to really

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.300
support women, is try to figure
out how to get them to

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.185
that next spot and
make that happen.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.050
So I brought a couple examples
to really talk about some of

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.530
the struggles, I think,
with women.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.470
And one of the struggles
is the style and

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.400
the leadership style.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.690
There's a lot of scientific
evidence and there's a great

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.470
study that McKinsey has done
in the last couple years

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.200
around what's going on in
women and leadership.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.260
And I think one of the biggest
things is that women just

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.290
naturally don't have the agentic
style that people

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.700
think in their heads
of leaders.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.450
So we're culturally trained to
think of a leader acting or

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.360
behaving in a certain way.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.060
And I think for women, it's
really tough to try to figure

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.590
out what that right style is.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.980
You have one style
here, whether you

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.070
agree with it or not.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.010
She had a very specific style.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.820
And I think a lot of people
criticized more for her style

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.050
than perhaps anything else.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.920
And then here's another one
very familiar to you.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.800
Another style that's being
somewhat criticized.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.670
If you think of what she's known
for in the public now,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.340
it's really the fact that
she didn't take time

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.860
off with her child.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.650
And so there's a big spectrum
there that we

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.990
are swinging between.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.040
And I think part of that's
reflective of the role change

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.190
that's happening not just for
women, but also for you guys.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.880
Even for guys here, right?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.390
So for example, I couldn't do
what I do at all without my

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.330
husband being willing
to do what he does.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.900
But somebody had to stay home.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.240
Because both parents can't
be gone all the time.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.050
And yet, that's a
difficult role.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.280
He'll go play golf during the
day, and the guys will say,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.800
well, why are you here?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.405
He's playing with 85-year-old
guys.

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:55.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.260
They're like, why
are you here?

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:01.510
It's a role that he's
grown into and

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.480
he's comfortable with.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.550
But clearly it's not necessarily
the social norm,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.800
if you will.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.840
As I moved into doing the
research for this next book, I

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.280
went back and started to read
some of my books that I read

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.100
when I was 18, when I was
19, and many of my

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.160
women's study books.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.340
And I reread "The Feminine
Mystique," which I think is

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.560
very relevant, given the fact
that I've also just wrote an

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.400
advertising book.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.820
And so the thought is to
put those together.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.590
Because I think now is the
time for us all to really

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.140
figure out how we participate
this.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.480
And not just for the advancement
of women, but also

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.890
for the changing roles that
we have in order to be

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.880
successful, to keep our families
intact, and to keep

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.380
all of us successful and happy
and content in the workplace.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.560
And part of this is, like I
mentioned, our changing roles.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.040
If you think about every single
day, I wear a whole

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.560
bunch of different hats.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.440
I could be a mom.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.350
I could be a daughter.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.120
I could be a wife.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.470
I could be a friend.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.820
I'm dealing with maybe one
of my horse issues.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.070
I have horses too.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.880
And so that's confusing
for people.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.700
It's confusing for
me sometimes.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.460
Which hat am I wearing?

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.600
And so if it's confusing for
me, it's probably confusing

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.750
for somebody who is
dealing with me.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.990
It's like, well, who's
that person?

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.370
Right?

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.020
Because I can remember my kids
telling me when they were very

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.530
little, my daughter would listen
to me on the phone and

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.360
she would say, you're very
interesting when

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.720
you're on a work call.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.440
That person is a different
person than she's used to.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.640
And that's true.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.680
I think all of us wear these
different hats multiple times

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.270
a day, all the time
during the day.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.050
And that's just the reality of
the world that we live in

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.830
today, in order for our
own survival, that

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.080
we have to do that.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.160
So as you can see this show up
in the McKinsey Study, 96% of

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.720
Fortune 1000 executives, women
executives, rated it critical

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.630
or fairly important to develop
a managing style with which

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.550
male managers are comfortable.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.320
And that isn't easy.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.450
And so Carol Bartz and Marissa
may be managing those.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.140
And it's hard.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.860
I would say I hate to judge
their decisions.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.750
Because I have empathy for them,
trying to figure out

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.850
what that balance was.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.940
I was telling Robin earlier that
my latest review that I

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.100
had with my boss, he had great
things to say about

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.940
me, which was great.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.430
Especially my business
results.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.060
He couldn't complain
about that.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.790
But he said that I could be very
smart and very articulate

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.450
at times, and that could be very
intimidating, and that I

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.020
could also be very charming and
I needed to be charming

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.760
more often.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.870
And so I was thinking,
OK, smart

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.560
and articulate, charming.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.750
Smart and articulate,
charming.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.300
Which one am I go to choose?

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.130
And it's hard to determine what
situation I choose, or

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.390
how I will be judged.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.740
And it's not being judged
just by men.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.950
It's being judged by women.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.060
And quite frankly, women are
probably my harsher critics,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.640
as a leader, than men are.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.020
Because they're judging
me for whatever.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.790
The higher I get, I could just
not say hello to someone or

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.730
look unhappy one day and someone
may take that and take

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.950
offense to it or make an
assumption that isn't true.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.020
I just have to understand that
that's an impression that, as

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.319
I become more important,
becomes more visible.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.760
And I need to be conscious
of that.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.790
And that's hard.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.830
It's hard as a woman, I think,
because we don't necessarily

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.910
fit the cultural style that
everyone expects us

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.160
to fit in the box.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.110
So my thesis for you-- and my
book is called Marketing in

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.830
the Participation Age-- and so
all of the people that I work

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.050
with know I have a passion
around this whole notion of

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.050
participation.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:01.110
And when I set about this thesis
was about the time that

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.383
Robin talked about when we did
Project Direct, in fact, where

00:18:05.383 --> 00:18:08.010
I talked about Project
Direct in my book.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.940
But also, it was about a time
when we did a big launch for

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.240
the printer group at HP.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.630
And I started to try to figure
out how to integrate a

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.500
marketing program.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.540
And by the time I invited all
the people that needed to be

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.270
involved in that integration,
there was about 60 people--

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.860
that was agencies and internal
HP people that needed to be

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.230
invited to the meeting to
actually plan an integrated

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.780
program for the US.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.100
And that was because
everything was so

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.880
interrelated suddenly.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.960
And I really also understood
the notion that, as a

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.370
marketer, I was not really
in charge of

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.810
integration any longer.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.620
The burden really was on what
we used to call "the

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.810
consumer," lovingly.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.190
And I always thought myself
as a consumer advocate.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.950
I still do, actually, because
I think it's great

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.200
to wear that hat.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.530
But sometimes a language change
prompts people to think

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.070
about a behavior change
that will follow.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.240
And so my thesis here is to ban
the word "consumer" and

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.160
replace it with the word
"participant." And if you

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.920
really want someone to
participate with you, which is

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.750
really about a relationship,
it's about a long term

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.780
exchange, then how you
motivate people to

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.800
participate, there is
a formula for that.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.380
And it's a human formula.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.860
It's something that's
never been applied

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.650
to marketing before.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.510
It's been applied
to education.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.350
It's been applied to
human resources.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.030
It's what keeps people
coming back to work.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.250
And so that's the thesis of the
book, is taking those core

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.690
three tenants of
self-determination theory,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.400
which is all sociology and
psychology, and applying it to

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.280
a marketing formula that's
relevant for today's era when

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.950
people really expect to have a
relationship with a brand.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.420
Not just be sent a one-way
message that suddenly will

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.070
persuade them to do something or
change their mindset, which

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.530
is not really relevant.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.540
But unfortunately, all of our
marketing principles have been

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.320
based upon that theory for
the last 60 years.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.830
Because that's the way marketing
used to work.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.830
And it just no longer
works that way.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.640
And what's great about how this
relates to women is that

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.630
we just naturally are
participation catalysts.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.980
So it's so ironic, because we
didn't talk about this.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.300
But you introduced me as a
participation catalyst, right?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.090
As someone who is talented for
bringing people together, to

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.430
collaborate with one another, to
try to figure out what that

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.010
vision is, to get people to
work with one another.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.770
And we just are naturally
wired.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:39.060
In fact, there's quite a few
books out there about women

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.900
who are good at collaborating.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.430
And in fact, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.070
But about a year ago, Hillary
Clinton came out and talked

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.810
about the fact that we're
entering the participation age

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:55.430
and how important women are
globally in that era.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:01.430
So the fact that we are all
wanting to be contributors,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.060
because we have technology
that has enabled us to be

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.930
contributors and to interact
and have relationships with

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.100
one another, as well
as with brands.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.480
And if you look at simple
things, like the four P's that

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.260
used to be so much dictated
by the brands,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.230
they just aren't anymore.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.230
They're very much
dictated by us.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.250
Because we're all
participants.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.580
And so as women, we have a
special opportunity for us to,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.940
in this age of participation,
to be really talented and

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.320
bring together people to deliver
great results on

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.650
whatever we're doing in the
workplace, as well as in the

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.750
community, as well as
with our families.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.915
The time now really is for us.

00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:48.170
You can go on to the next one.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.730
So I thought I'd leave
you with three

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.600
things to think about.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.020
And there could have
been a mini three.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.110
But I just thought, in terms
of the spirit of

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.670
participation, these are the
three that, as a woman, as a

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.180
leader, as a contributor, as a
participant, are things that I

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.530
try to keep in mind.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.790
So the first one is really the
gift of seeing opportunity.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.950
So not only are we great
collaborators, but we also, as

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:20.660
women, tend to see what
something could be versus what

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.580
it really is.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.260
And I think that's a gift.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.610
It's a gift in my horses that
I used to raise here.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.980
So this horse-- you see my
husband in the background with

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.310
his hands on his hips.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.980
And this horse, everyone in
the household called this

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.240
horse shithead.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.490
That was not his name.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.940
But that's what they saw is this
very obstinate creature.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.750
He was a young child, so he
needed some guidance.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.290
And what I saw was something
that was very

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.360
different than that.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.470
I saw the horse that he could
be with a little bit of care

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:02.330
and some guidance and some
nurturing, if you will.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.420
And I think that is something
that we're very good at.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.940
And in fact, there are some
studies that reflect that

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.440
boards tend to hire women
in turnarounds more

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.180
than they hire men.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.700
And part of that is, I think,
our ability to really see the

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.370
beauty in something and see what
it can become, and become

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.180
driven and motivated by getting
it to that point.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.560
And I can tell you, I didn't
know that about myself,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.100
really, until I took
Performics on.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.460
And I didn't know Performics was
in such bad shape until I

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.520
got it and I had the problem
that I had to deal with.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.730
But I loved it.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.270
And honestly, I would do
a turnaround again.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.880
There is something very
addictive and

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.590
satisfying about that.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.820
And then, once I recognized
that, I started to see how I

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.100
did that in so many other parts
of my life that I didn't

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.390
really recognize before.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.790
So that's one, the gift of
seeing the opportunity.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.330
The second one is negotiate--

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.850
knowing what you want
and speak up.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.870
So I always counsel this in
my young women leaders.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.670
Because they tend not to speak
up for themselves.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.680
I tend not to speak up
for myself, honestly.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.110
I tend not to necessarily
negotiate or

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.800
ask for what I want.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.040
And that's something I think
you all need to learn, that

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.410
that's the way the
world is played.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.390
And don't feel shy about that.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.650
And the other thing I would say
is if there is a position

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.800
that you want or that you're
looking at, if it doesn't

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.130
scare you, I wouldn't do it.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.970
Because that's when we really
grow the most is when we're

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.190
afraid and when we're a little
frightened by something.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.110
Because if it's not scaring you,
then it's probably not a

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.090
big enough opportunity
for you.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.500
And I learned that right out
of the gate when I left HP.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.780
Because I probably didn't
understand the full value of

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.250
contribution that
I could make.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.270
And I left HP first and went to
Moxie Interactive as an SVP

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.830
running three departments.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.720
And about three months into it,
I thought I way undershot.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.820
I could be doing a lot more.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.030
And so, it scared me, but
probably not enough.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.580
This role scared me a lot more.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.190
And I did fine, right?

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.970
So speak up for yourself.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.980
Negotiate.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.570
Ask for what you want.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.090
And don't be afraid
to be afraid.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.070
Don't be afraid to let something
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.500
Lastly is be an advocate
for other women.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.440
Like I say, my biggest critics
sometimes are other women.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.550
And part of that is a phenomenon
that's called

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.310
horizontal violence
that's well known.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.410
It's why more black men
kill other black men.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.860
If someone's in a one-down
position, then it's just

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.790
naturally culturally to try to
drag someone else down, if

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.930
you're not in that
leadership role.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.850
But if we can't be advocates for
ourselves, it's hard for

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.560
us to have others be
advocates for us.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.920
And so I say that, and I remind
myself of this a lot.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.560
Because I can look at a Carol
Bartz and criticize her

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.180
management style, because I
certainly can't relate to her

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.540
management style or leadership
style that she seemed to have.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.500
But who am I to judge?

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.470
Maybe that's what felt right
to her and worked for her.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.000
And so I am asking you all
to give each other a

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.390
break at any level.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.120
Try to support women around
you, below you, above you,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.280
beside you.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.870
And those women business authors
out there, I'm asking

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.040
for your help.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.480
Because we need to support
one another first.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.600
And I think it's hard for us to
ask for others to support

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.160
us if we're willing
not to do that.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.670
And that's it.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.990
This is how you can
get a hold of me.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.860
I will connect with any
and all of you.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.690
I will talk to any and
all of you any time.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.690
So don't be shy.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:50.870
Don't be afraid to do that.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.948
And I will answer any of your
questions, if you have them.

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:58.294
OK.

00:26:58.294 --> 00:26:58.772
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:58.772 --> 00:27:01.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.520
career [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.770
I fear [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.885 --> 00:27:13.304
sort of speak to that
[INAUDIBLE] career that's sort

00:27:13.304 --> 00:27:17.049
of like, I've got my 10 years
in, and I'm a few years in and

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:20.650
I'm looking [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.350
DAINA MIDDLETON: And I think
you're exactly right.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.520
This is part of the "speak up.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.960
But also don't be afraid to tell
your boss and others what

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.300
you have done.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.270
And I just don't think
we do that naturally.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.690
So we do naturally nurture our
teams and grow our teams.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.325
But you get to a point where you
have to manage down and up

00:27:36.325 --> 00:27:37.600
at the same time.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.680
And I honestly still
struggle with this.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.010
I will tell you I struggle
with this.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.710
Because I have created
at Performics a very

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.760
collaborative, transparent,
authentic, open, nurturing

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.830
environment.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.060
But when I turnaround and go
deal with either my peers or

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.560
my boss, I cannot
act that way.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.360
Because I will not
be successful.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.780
So I continually have to act in
a bipolar way, sometimes on

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.470
the same issue.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.040
I will be dealing with the same
issue below me, but then

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.210
have to go advocate up and an
act completely different.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.280
Because the one thing I think,
also, that women don't

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.540
understand is we problem
solve by

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.740
soundboarding with one another.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.030
Right?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.090
If you have a problem, you
go test your theory.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.010
And it's not because you can't
solve your problems.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.510
It's because you're looking
for that input.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.610
And that's how you
make a decision.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.630
If you do that with a man
though, they assume you don't

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.780
know how to solve
your problems.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.200
So I'll do this with
my husband.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.090
I'll tell him, sit on
your fix-it card.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.710
I don't need it today.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.380
I just want a soundboard
with you.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.310
And then, once I do that, he's
like, OK, phew, phew.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.160
Because otherwise, he's like,
OK, did you do this?

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.780
Did you that?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.390
Did you do this?

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.500
And I'm like, no.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.110
I don't want any of that.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.640
I just want you to listen.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.170
I've actually seen three women
lose their jobs, because their

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.650
bosses thought that they
couldn't solve problems.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.070
And it was purely the way they

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.020
approached the problem solving.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.230
And so you right.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.330
This is what is inspiring me to
write the book is that I do

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.310
think these little nuanced
things become really critical

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.980
at a certain point
in your career.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.270
And it means either success
or failure if you don't.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.500
And they're very small.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.810
And they're very subtle.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.060
But they're very important.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.870
PRESENTER 2: If you do have
questions, can you raise your

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.701
hand and pass the mic
around so we can

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:27.040
capture on the recording?

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.240
DAINA MIDDLETON: Somebody
else had a question.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.905
Who was it?

00:29:30.905 --> 00:29:32.390
OK.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:32.750
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.150
Thank you.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.130
This is really, really
interesting.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.490
So I have two little kids, as I
know a lot of people in the

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.330
room here do.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.080
And so I'm just curious, with
three little kids, that must

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.570
have been so hectic.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.730
Did you ever take a step
back in your career?

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.450
Or were you always pretty
focused on the end goal and

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.250
knowing where you
wanted to be?

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.890
DAINA MIDDLETON: If someone
would have asked me 10, 15

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.485
years ago, I never would have
said I wanted to be a CEO or I

00:29:57.485 --> 00:29:59.110
was going to lead a company.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.310
I couldn't have told
you that at all.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:06.890
I always was inspired by my
career and wanted to do that.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:12.435
But to tell you even more, my
oldest is my husband's.

00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:13.670
The younger two are mine.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.190
I lost my first husband.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:21.370
He died when they were
two and six.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.620
So I was the primary
breadwinner.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.610
So I didn't really
have a choice.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.670
Some women have a choice
of whether they want

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.220
to just step back.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.430
I didn't have that choice.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.440
And maybe that's what continued
to drive me.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.380
And I didn't have
family local.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.970
I can remember sometimes,
because I had to travel, my

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.455
friends kind of shopped out my
kids, and they would spend the

00:30:44.455 --> 00:30:44.660
night there.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.890
And I remember picking
them up one night.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.930
And my daughter said, OK, who
are we staying with tonight?

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.280
And I was like, me.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.020
And that was really hard.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.620
All those times were
really hard.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.690
And I don't know why I just kept
pushing forward and not

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.160
thinking about it.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.250
But I do think that something
that, as now a leader in an

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.410
organization, that we
need to give women

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.610
permission to do that.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.870
Because I think that's back to
Wendy Clark's comment of when

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.440
we're bucketizing people for
succession planning, and they

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.670
don't necessarily fit the
profile for the timing or

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.500
whatever that someone else
has in mind, that's OK.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.110
And we need to let that be OK.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.000
And that's actually not
just for women.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.402
That's for men too.

00:31:28.402 --> 00:31:32.440
We need to figure out how better
to allow people to take

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.560
detours or, perhaps even stay at
the same level for a while

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.700
and that be OK, not just
continually progress.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.330
But I will also tell you that I
think if I hadn't have left

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.690
HP, I never would
have progressed.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.350
Because I think there
are two things.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:53.560
One is, I had pigeonholed myself
in terms of what I

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.150
thought that I could do.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.920
And I think they had also
pigeonholed in their minds

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.340
what I thought I
was capable of.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.940
And that's a hard thing.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.240
And I couldn't see that until
I got out of there.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.290
So I think all those
things are factors.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.780
And I don't know that any
of them are easy.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.540
But, yeah, there were many times
where I thought, how am

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.680
I going to do all these
things that I'm doing?

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.720
And I just barely would make the
wire on every single thing

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.360
in your life.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.770
After a while, that gets
exhausting, right?

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:29.785
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:29.785 --> 00:32:31.510
I'm just going to piggyback
off that.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.030
Because your story is actually
really interesting to me.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.600
Because I love horses, too.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.310
And I'm young, but I do want
to have a family one day.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.360
And so I'm curious as to how you
balance things right now.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.910
Because I know that if I'm
really heavy into work, that

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.490
lasts for a month, and then
my energy is shot.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.530
And so if I force myself to
spend time with horses, then I

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.020
have more energy at work,
and the balance works.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:03.740
But at your level, what is an
average week look like in

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.090
terms of the time you've found
necessary to dedicate to work

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.950
in order to get done what
you want to get done?

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.600
DAINA MIDDLETON: I'm probably
not a good example of balance

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.720
right now, honestly.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.560
I'm very lucky that
I love what I do.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.340
So that's the first thing, is
that if work was what we

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.450
described it to be-- work--
it would be different.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.950
But I love what I do.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.670
I'm passionate about
what I do.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.090
I think about it all the time.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.610
My brain probably
never shuts off.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.020
But it is one reason I refuse
to live in New York-- and

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.190
Robin knows this very well--

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.510
or Chicago or San Francisco.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:44.020
I live in Alta, Wyoming.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.870
And part of that is because
there is a part of me that

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.770
needs that in order to
be the rest of me.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.920
And I've been pretty
successful at

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.440
drawing that line.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.670
I get a lot of criticism for
it, to a certain extent.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.660
Because they're like,
you live where?

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.380
But I have a global job.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.650
I could be anywhere.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:06.130
And actually, when I ran the US
operations, I was actually

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.570
flying to Chicago every
Monday and flying home

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:09.550
every Thursday night.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.900
And I had an apartment
in Chicago.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.120
And I spent a fair amount
of weekends there.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.060
And that was really hard.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.540
And there were things
that suffered as a

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.900
consequence of that.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.840
But it was what the business
needed at the time.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.480
And it was the choice that
I made at the time.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.360
But I will not lie to you that
my relationship suffered with

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.510
my husband, I would say.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.679
My kids were fine, because
they're old enough.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.170
They might tell you I may
have missed some things.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.500
But it's really hard to
continually balance.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.409
And I think it's constantly
making those decisions about

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.449
what's important to you.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:43.110
Because you're right.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.860
We're only human.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.610
I think technology has also made
us feel like we can do

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.670
more somehow.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.620
But we are, at the end of
the day, still human.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.590
And we can't do everything
at once.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.920
But when I get to go home-- and
right now, I'm trying to

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.550
run-walk four miles every
day with the dog.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.410
And I try to ride my horse
as much as I can.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.800
I have him boarded right
now, which I hate.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.630
But it's the right thing for
him and the right thing for

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.840
me, right now.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.440
And so I try not to let that
bother me as much as it

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.080
probably would normally
bother me.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.990
He's in the Taj Mahal,
basically.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.530
And he's kind of freaked
out about it.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.950
And I'm kind of freaked
out about it.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.760
And we don't necessarily mix
well with the other people

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.450
that are there.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.240
But it is what it is.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.330
And I try to go and enjoy the
time that I have with him and

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.210
not stress out about the fact
that it's not perfect.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:40.260
Because I think we're our
own worst enemy, right?

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.940
Same thing with my
husband at home.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.980
So I like to be involved in
every decision and every

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.930
detail, because that's
who I am.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:47.760
I can't do that.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.530
Because A, it's not
fair to him.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.460
And he might not do something
the way I would do it.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.960
But I have to just let them do
it, because that's only fair.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.590
Thanks for coming in.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.070
I have a couple questions.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.330
The first one, I'm curious to
hear about the jump that you

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.550
made, having been at
HP for so long.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.150
And you said you went
somewhere else.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.580
And then to become the
CEO of Performics.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.940
I'd love to hear more about
what that looked

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.170
like on your end.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:21.190
And then I'd also love to hear
about mentors and how that's

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.440
played a role in your career.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.010
DAINA MIDDLETON: Sure.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.150
So like I said, I was
at HP 16 years.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.220
I did play a number
of roles there.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.175
I think that's the nice
thing about tech.

00:36:32.175 --> 00:36:36.640
And I'm sure you experience
it, is that I was probably

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.960
never in any role longer
than two years.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.870
So I got a lot of change and a
lot of variety and a lot of

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.290
investment in me that I
probably, actually value way

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.210
more now than I did
at the time.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.200
I was lucky enough that that
was a time when HP, as a

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.760
company, was investing so
much in their people.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.240
I don't think that's
the case today.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.840
So I had all that.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.300
And the whole notion of this
book and this idea that I

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.430
had-- and I had many ideas
that I wanted to test--

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.320
and I felt like I could do that
better outside of HP than

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.090
I could inside.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.310
And so I happen to meet the CEO
and founder, another woman

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.180
actually, used to be
named Kris Zagoria.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.010
Her name's Pinto.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.370
She's recently changed
her name.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:24.990
But she agreed to allow me to
come experiment with some of

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.320
my ideas at Moxie, which was
a great opportunity.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.170
And I just decided
to take the leap.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.780
But I was afraid.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.050
And I was so loyal to HP,
because having been there so

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.680
long, and they'd really
been my family

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.590
through a lot of time.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.130
But I also recognized the
fact that I wasn't

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.850
going to get any higher.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.300
I just didn't see management
view me that way.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.060
And so that's when I left.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.470
Now, I was a Moxie two years.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:58.180
And I had kept saying, Google
is going to get rid of

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.760
Performics.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.470
Publicis should pick
up Performics--

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.630
great company.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.530
And everyone kept saying, no,
they bought Pole Nord.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.860
Not going to buy another
search company.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.110
Well, lo and behold,
it happened.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.500
And shortly after that, of
course, Zenith, we were

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.120
looking to align Performics
with more of the Zenith

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.990
family, which is where I fit
within the Publicis family.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.380
And my boss at the time said,
well, it's too bad you don't

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.420
want to run a search company.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.090
I said, well, what you mean it's
too bad I don't want to

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.960
run a search company?

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.890
He said, well, it's located
in Chicago.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.750
Well, my team was sitting
in Atlanta at the time.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.160
And I was living in
Boise, Idaho.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.850
And I said, well, Chicago's
a lot easier than Atlanta.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.820
It's a direct shot.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:43.080
And so I kind of threw my name
in that hat at that point.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.610
And there was another candidate
that was being

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.750
considered within the family.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.070
But ultimately, I was chosen.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.050
I think I went through two
interview processes.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.220
And there were people that
actually had worked on my

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.090
account at HP that still
work for the company.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:03.520
And I ran into two of them in
my two visits, which I was

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.070
trying to keep it nice.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:07.960
And I said, oh, hi, I'm
in the family now.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.490
But that's how I got there.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.730
And then, when the global role
came about as well, so I

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.090
managed the US operation
for again, two years.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.540
And so I've been doing the
global role for about a year

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.790
now-- a year in January.

00:39:26.002 --> 00:39:32.640
PRESENTER 1: So while you were
running the US operation, you

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.760
really transformed the culture
of Performics.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.650
And I think it was rated as the
number one place to work

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.650
in Chicago.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.930
DAINA MIDDLETON: Number four for
all women, number eight in

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.900
advertising for "AdAge"
overall.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.900
We have about seven awards now
for best places to work.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.690
Yes.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.570
PRESENTER 1: So what
did you do?

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.670
DAINA MIDDLETON: Well, that's
back to the transparent,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.890
authentic, open.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.740
So one of the things I learned
really quickly, even with my

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:05.870
own management team, is it was
a very hierarchical, almost

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.200
militaristic culture.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.570
And I didn't realize that
when I came in.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.020
In fact, the first staff meeting
I had with my team, I

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.320
think I talked through things.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.350
And then, the second staff
meeting I said, OK, I'm going

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.020
to talk less.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.790
And I'll let you guys talk.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.190
And they all froze.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.670
And they're like, well,
we're not prepared.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.100
And I'm like, I don't want
you to prepare anything.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.140
We're smart people.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.020
We need to benefit
from one another.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.240
But that's an example of
there was this really

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.480
very damaging culture.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.730
There were the haves
and have-nots.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.450
So it took a long time
to transform that.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.680
You can't culture something.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.520
To me, that's more like
gardening than it is--

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.350
I just can't say, great
culture now.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.070
It's more like cultivate the
soil, spread the seeds, water,

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.410
fret over it a bit, continue
to nurture and grow that.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.850
And one of the things I did
right off the bat is started a

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.310
"to all employees" email
every other week.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.980
And they named it Daina's
Download, just telling people

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.960
what was going on.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.380
Because that was the problem is
there was all this secrecy.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.310
We were losing people.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.250
It's hard to keep people in
our industry, as you know.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.930
There's generally
at 30% turnover.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.470
We had higher than that
when I got there.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.520
I also did a survey of
all of my team and

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.170
asked them five questions.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:28.370
What was good?

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.000
What were the barriers?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.960
What was bad?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.180
What needed to be changed?

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.380
And so we consciously started
working on all of those

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.620
different things and then
establishing a vision.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.610
Because the company just
hadn't had a vision.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.980
Because basically, they had just
changed their logo five

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.030
times in four years.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.120
And they didn't really
know what they

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.650
stood for in that process.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.950
And so it took a while
to turn that around.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:54.890
Now it's paying off.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.710
I think our attrition rate is
about 11% the last two years,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.200
which is probably
pretty healthy.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.160
And yes, the workplace awards
are all employee survey.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.260
We applied to be on the list.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.450
And then, I think a certain
number of employees have to

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.500
respond back to get you
on the short list.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.070
And then once you're on the
short list, you get a bunch of

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.440
questionnaires.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.400
I think Google is on the list,
and Chicago as well, actually.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.500
So it takes time.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.770
It takes work.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.590
It takes constant effort.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.250
It's constant care
and feeding.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.250
It is like having a garden
all the time.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.140
AUDIENCE: I had one more
question on mentorship.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.260
If there have been any mentors
that have been really

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:39.955
impactful to you.

00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:41.300
DAINA MIDDLETON: You asked
me about that.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.200
AUDIENCE: If you could
share that.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.110
DAINA MIDDLETON: My mom was
a huge inspiration.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.890
I think she was the only person
in the family that had

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.700
ever gotten a college
degree at all.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.570
And she's one credit away
from a doctorate.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.790
She was an educator.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.880
So she was my teacher
in the eighth grade.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.680
She would not let me call her
"mom." I had to call her

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:08.220
"Mrs." And she constantly
pushed me and basically

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.730
instilled in me that I could
do whatever I wanted to.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.090
So I think that laid
the foundation.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.300
And then what I have found is
there have been many women,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.840
along the way.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.380
It's kind of like what
Robin was saying.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.530
There have been women
that I watched and

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.410
learned from by watching.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.820
And I've seen this over
and over again.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.530
Well, I'll be enchanted by that
person and kind of watch

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.420
and learn from.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.900
And then it's like a cycle.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.040
And then you get to the point
where it's like, ooh, I'm also

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.410
learning what not to do
from them as well.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.700
And then you go on
to the next one.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.960
And I think that's OK, in your
career, to have multiple

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.900
leaders, both men and women,
that inspire you in different

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.420
ways and motivate you
in different ways.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:59.545
I've never really had a formal
mentor, if you will, or coach.

00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:00.802
AUDIENCE: Follow and watch.

00:44:00.802 --> 00:44:02.690
What does that mean?

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.010
DAINA MIDDLETON: Either people
you work for you.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.990
You watch them in meetings.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:06.030
You watch them interact.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.410
You watch how they interact
with you and employees.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:11.972
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:13.780
DAINA MIDDLETON: Yeah.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:14.990
The results of the drive.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.986
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:18.782
we were going to watch
or follow [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.020
DAINA MIDDLETON: Yeah.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.680
All the women that I've
had are women or

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.030
other leaders, actually--

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.970
they haven't all been women--

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:31.580
who I've worked alongside
with.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.490
I think it's really hard.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.810
There have been people like
Katharine Graham, I think, was

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.530
a huge inspiration to me growing
up, because I have a

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.410
journalism degree.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.340
And just what she did,
in her time period.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.740
For those of you don't know, she
was the one who led "The

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.880
Washington Post" during
Watergate.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.330
And one of the most delightful
things was the fact that I got

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.550
to meet her daughter, who is
also named Katharine, who's

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.050
now running "The Washington
Post"-- her granddaughter

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.750
actually, which was great.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.810
And so there have been people
from afar, but not a lot.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:08.220
Because I think it's hard
to take those cues.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:08.890
And it's hard.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.000
I've had people ask me.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.450
In fact, I just got a request
this week for someone to ask

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:14.430
for me to be a mentor.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.710
And I'm happy to do that.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.930
I think it's hard if that person
is not interacting with

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.590
you on a regular basis though.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.240
Is there somebody else.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:29.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.305
Thanks for being here
today with us.

00:45:31.305 --> 00:45:33.070
It's really great.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.020
I'm just curious, as you've
grown in your career and gone

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.740
into higher level roles, have
you ever found yourself in a

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.580
position where, especially as
a woman, people are maybe

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.350
doubting you or making
it difficult for

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:44.150
you in your new role?

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.810
And what did you do
to combat that?

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.990
DAINA MIDDLETON: Every
single day.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.930
Every single day I may doubt
myself about something.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.690
Maybe I just am obsessed
sometimes about some of the

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:58.300
decisions that I make.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.880
I was saying this actually,
about Obama to my

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.180
husband this weekend.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:13.270
I think early on in my
leadership, it was hard to

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.320
figure out when to compromise
and when to just say, no,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.410
these are the things that are.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:22.390
And I knew probably
instinctually or some way what

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.540
were the right decisions.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:27.050
And I maybe hesitated sometimes
on which ones to

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.680
really be tough on.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.710
Now, to be fair, my team now--

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.330
I haven't lost a single team
member since I took the reins

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:39.170
of leadership, which is
kind of amazing--

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.250
they will joke with me
about, when did you

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.380
know what you wanted?

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.490
And how come you were
so patient with us?

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.320
So part of it was,
it was probably

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.390
good that I was patient.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.240
And I did probably

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.410
second-guess some of my questions.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.110
Because I think I brought them
along in the change management

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.170
in a healthy way.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.830
Whereas, if I would have said
tough, get over it, sometimes

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.530
that can actually reverse the
change management process.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.250
But I definitely think I'm more
comfortable now, knowing

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:10.530
what to maybe spend more time
on and to kind of explore.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.370
Because I think I may
want to go a certain

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:14.750
way and it may not.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.950
I may not have all the
information versus I just say

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:22.470
no or yes on some things, and
this is what we're doing.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:28.090
But that's just experience and
knowing yourself and knowing

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:31.350
your team and knowing whatever
you're working on.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:35.210
And all those things get more
comfortable over time.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.500
I'm probably way more
comfortable about that now

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.750
than I used to be.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.420
AUDIENCE: Hey, this
has been great.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.195
Thank you so much.

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:46.380
DAINA MIDDLETON: Oh,
you're welcome.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.410
AUDIENCE: Finding the what you
love-- you mentioned what you

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.390
do every day doesn't
feel like work.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.660
This may be going back to
before you were at HP.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.000
But how did you narrow down or
figure out, this is what I

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.990
really love doing?

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.018
DAINA MIDDLETON: I have
no idea, honestly.

00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:04.140
I honestly, probably stumbled
into a variety of things that

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.860
just one led to another
led to another.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.190
And I will tell you that
about every two to

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.010
three years I get restless.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:16.060
So I've never really been in a
role longer than three years,

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.070
I think, ever.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.212
And I almost always change
roles in the spring.

00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:21.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.980
You can look at my resume,
and it's weird.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.175
Because it's like, April,
April, April, April.

00:48:27.175 --> 00:48:29.990
And that was even at HP.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.120
I don't know what that is.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.675
But I definitely have a cycle
of restlessness in April.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.110
And I think, just like going
into digital, it was purely an

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:46.180
instinctual thing, that I
thought, this is cool.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:51.130
I stumbled into something that
I really, really enjoyed and

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.720
didn't think about
it too much.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.030
I just headed for it.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.600
In fact, Maurice Levy was
in our office yesterday.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.670
He came to visit and
spent an hour.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.480
And he spent about 10 minutes
with the entire organization.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.760
And someone asked him
that question.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.780
And this is a man who has been
at Publicis since he was 19

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.550
years old, and is close
to 80 now, I believe.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:14.440
And incredibly sharp,
witty, chic.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.290
I told him he looked chic
yesterday, if a

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.580
man nearly 80 could.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.750
And he asked me, just
today I look chic?

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.530
But he said two things.

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.000
He said, have fun.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.570
He said, if you aren't having
fun, you're not

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.520
in the right place.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.360
And he said, be relentless.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.860
Just continually aspire
to do better.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.990
So that was it.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.770
That was all.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.070
He said he had also never
mapped his career.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.350
Never knew where he was going.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.910
He was having a good time.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:51.050
And he was relentlessly
pursuing to be better.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.935
And I think that's probably not
too bad advice, honestly.

00:49:54.935 --> 00:49:58.920
It seemed to have
worked for him.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.120
PRESENTER 1: Any questions
from the fellas?

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.240
DAINA MIDDLETON: I know, you
guys have been quiet.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.420
AUDIENCE: I have three
daughters.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.340
So this is great.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.030
How do I continue to--

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.980
DAINA MIDDLETON: Heaven
help you.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.180
AUDIENCE: --learn from
your experience.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.130
DAINA MIDDLETON: I
only have one.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:16.520
And I will tell you,
one was enough.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.460
AUDIENCE: I guess, what, as
a man, clearly, and a male

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:27.800
manager, what things should we
ensure that we instill to the

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.030
up-and-coming women leaders?

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.940
What are some qualities that
we want to make sure that

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.050
we're reinforcing?

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:38.240
DAINA MIDDLETON: I think making
them aware where these

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.420
male and female stereotypes
get in the way.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.390
It's like I say, this
decision-making thing is a

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.060
great example.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.740
And there's probably others.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.130
And neither understands it.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.250
So I think as you--

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.230
and you're a very approachable
male manager--

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.180
can say, do you realize how
you're coming across?

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.560
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:54.940
Yeah.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.460
DAINA MIDDLETON: And be honest
and open with that.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.410
It's not in a mean way.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:00.520
But we just can't see it.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.150
We can't see that.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.310
And the only reason I learned
some of this is HP had this

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:09.390
fantastic full-week, into
evening, multicultural

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:13.240
training program that I went
through that was fantastic.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:18.790
And it went the gamut of every
cultural stereotype and some

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.180
of the kinks in different
cultures working with one

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.560
another that was amazing.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.080
But nobody gets that anymore.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.790
Nobody gets that level
of training.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.640
So we all just stumble around.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.230
So I think that's
the key thing.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.210
And you already do
this so well.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.430
Because you guys all
know, right?

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.500
He listens really well
without judging.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.410
AUDIENCE: She's my client too.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:45.230
DAINA MIDDLETON: Right?

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:49.420
And that's what most, I think,
women need more than anything,

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.250
is someone who can listen and
provide them with feedback.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:56.880
[? Taka ?]

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.335
[? Ko. ?]

00:51:58.335 --> 00:51:59.585
Hi.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.390
All these people from
different lives.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.680
AUDIENCE: Well, thank
you so much.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.590
Good to see you here.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.080
DAINA MIDDLETON: Good
to see you too.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.270
AUDIENCE: So just kind
of a random question.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.840
But what would you
be really looking

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.850
forward to in the morning?

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:13.370
Like, waking up, like,
wow, this is going

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:14.180
to be so much fun.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.480
What really excites you now?

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.440
DAINA MIDDLETON: The biggest
thing that excites me is

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.660
there's a certain part
obvious [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.450
packed and so that are known,
that I know that

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:24.280
are going to happen.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.870
But it's the unknowns
that excite me.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.540
It's the things that I
absolutely know that something

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.190
will happen during the day that
I did not anticipate,

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.630
have no idea.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.741
It's the complete unknowns.

00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:37.991
Yeah.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.790
AUDIENCE: I totally could
look this up.

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:46.500
So I apologize.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.560
But I'm about to get my MBA.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.450
And so I'm curious what
your opinion is on

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:52.520
graduate degree use.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.640
Now I graduated from
undergrad in 2008.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.420
And so a lot of my cohort went
back to school, because the

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.685
economy was horrible.

00:53:00.685 --> 00:53:04.230
So part of my instinct is
telling me that by the time,

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:08.760
hopefully, I get to where your
level is, that's going to

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.625
become necessary in
a lot of ways--

00:53:11.625 --> 00:53:13.650
like a deal breaker--

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.490
especially as a woman,
if you don't have it.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.480
So I'm curious what your
thoughts are on that.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.470
DAINA MIDDLETON: First of
all, congratulations.

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.230
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.280
DAINA MIDDLETON: Because looking
back, it was probably

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.880
something I should have
investigated more and didn't

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.350
at the time.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.540
I don't have a graduate
degree.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.560
But it's certainly giving you
that rounded [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.345
always valuable.

00:53:33.345 --> 00:53:37.810
And you have that business
practicality that I didn't

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:39.850
necessarily have from an
education standpoint.

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.110
I just had to learn it from
on-the-ground standpoint.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.850
I hope it benefits you.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.250
I don't think it's something
that we value in our career.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.520
I just don't think we're
necessarily looking for it.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.600
We probably value experience
more than we

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.190
value education now.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.780
And that's not necessarily
a good thing.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.770
But it is just a reality
of where we are.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.230
AUDIENCE: So you haven't seen,
at least in where you're at

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:09.390
right now, that being a blockade
for people moving up?

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.700
DAINA MIDDLETON: Nope.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:13.490
DAINA MIDDLETON: Nope,
not at all.

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.210
But like I say, that business
management component that you

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.730
have, the finance in particular
probably, it will

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.640
benefit you.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.610
Because ultimately, that's how
you're going to have to put

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:27.570
your results is into
that frame.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.240
And I had to learn that.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.013
I had to learn to put my bar
chart in my resume, right?

00:54:34.013 --> 00:54:35.263
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.420
DAINA MIDDLETON: When I left HP,
probably, I had a resume

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:44.690
that was not a results-based
resume.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:46.910
It was a skills-based
resume, I would say.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:50.180
It basically described
the roles that I had.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.240
It didn't describe the results
that I delivered.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.365
And I can tell you, my resume
today is 100% results driven.

00:54:56.365 --> 00:54:59.270
Of course, I am in a company
called Performics, so.

00:55:01.801 --> 00:55:03.870
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
one more question?

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.250
DAINA MIDDLETON: Sure.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:07.620
AUDIENCE: So what would you say
was your biggest hurdle

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.100
that you had to overcome?

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.000
DAINA MIDDLETON: My own
confidence in myself.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.922
Yeah.

00:55:15.922 --> 00:55:18.588
AUDIENCE: I guess, on that
note, [INAUDIBLE] talk a

00:55:18.588 --> 00:55:21.356
little bit about [INAUDIBLE]
yourself, in times past.

00:55:21.356 --> 00:55:22.890
Do you get intimidated?

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.840
Do you feel like you get
intimidated still in

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.450
situations?

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:30.160
Or do you recall times in which
you were intimidated?

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.070
And how did you blow past it?

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.350
DAINA MIDDLETON: I don't
know if intimidate

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.600
is the right word.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.260
Certainly I experienced
that in the a past.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.980
Today, I'm probably less
intimidated, but still

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.300
probably question sometimes my
decisions, especially if

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.455
they're hard people decisions.

00:55:48.455 --> 00:55:53.130
If I have to fire somebody,
those are the hardest

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.080
decisions for me.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:57.410
Because they really impact
a human's life in

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:58.715
a meaningful way.

00:55:58.715 --> 00:56:02.390
And so you better believe that
I'm going to second guess

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:06.330
that, think twice about
it, feel bad about it.

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.440
But honestly, the day that I
don't, I need to just go home.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.520
Because I should feel
those things about

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.060
those types of decisions.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.310
Right?

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:28.320
Obviously, there are moments
where I will feel frustrated.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.280
About three weeks ago, I
was working from home.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.110
I had just about three
or four situations.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.390
And my husband, he works
in the office over.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.630
And he was like, are you
throwing things in there?

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:37.450
I said, yes.

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.620
And I'm going to take pictures
of the Tetons now.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.290
I'll be back in two hours.

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.770
Right?

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.200
But that's why, again,
I live where I live.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.450
And I need that perspective.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:53.570
But we all do that.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.800
We're all humans.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.910
That's what we have
to remember.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:59.140
I don't care who you are, how
famous you are, how renowned

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:04.620
you are, how smart you think
someone is, we're all humans.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.715
PRESENTER 1: Ask the question
and we'll--

00:57:10.715 --> 00:57:11.190
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.665
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:11.665 --> 00:57:12.140
DAINA MIDDLETON: Sure.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:18.749
AUDIENCE: I'm having more on
how a male could be better

00:57:18.749 --> 00:57:21.400
leader, from the female
perspective, especially with

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.810
your experience at the top.

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:27.400
What would you like to see your
male bosses do better?

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.324
Or do you have any thoughts
on how someone

00:57:30.324 --> 00:57:33.440
could be a better leader?

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:33.800
DAINA MIDDLETON: Sure.

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.660
So my key partner in crime in
the US is the president.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.540
And he is a guy.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.465
Actually, almost all of my team
are guys, unfortunately.

00:57:42.465 --> 00:57:45.880
I have a few key
woman leaders.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:51.270
But probably the thing I
constantly remind him of is,

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:57.090
where I am probably more of an
inspirational leader who's

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.680
constantly driving that vision,
and I think if you

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:05.170
were to talk to my team-- in
fact, in these surveys, they

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.330
call me a mom in it.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:10.060
And like a friend's mom, is what
they will say, in a nice

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.490
kind of way.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:16.710
He is more about, let's
just get this done--

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.330
goals and objectives,
operational efficiency,

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:20.580
operational effectiveness.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.630
And together we probably make
a whole human being.

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:27.180
So I think whatever you are,
balancing those things.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.210
So I'm ever conscious that
my weaknesses are in the

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:35.790
operational side of making sure
that we have documented

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:40.330
and we're tracking goals and all
of those things that are

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:42.690
important and key.

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:44.570
But I don't want to lose
the other piece.

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:47.720
Because that also is
really important.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.680
And you have to figure out
what's your strengths and

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.510
weaknesses.

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.380
Those tend to be male
characteristics.

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.800
But that's not always
the case.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.810
So for example, recently
he got relentless

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:00.960
about this goal thing.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.615
And every single staff meeting
that's all it was, was

00:59:03.615 --> 00:59:06.583
tracking these objectives.

00:59:06.583 --> 00:59:07.076
AUDIENCE: Eventually.

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:08.555 --> 00:59:11.020
Eventually he handled
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.090
DAINA MIDDLETON: And so I told
him, I said, OK, Eric.

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:15.340
Because he's really into this.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.520
And he wants to drive it home.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.810
And everyone said
they wanted it.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:20.710
But the last time it got to
OK, so now we've done

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:21.340
individual goals.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.410
We're going to do
cross-departmental goals.

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:25.880
And you could just feel the
oxygen leave the room.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.110
But he was kind of impervious
to that.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.470
Because he was on his mission.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:32.860
And so I gently said,
I have a suggestion.

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.860
I said, for the next meeting,
let's bring

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:38.280
Tequila into the room.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.200
I keep Tequila in my office--
nice Tequila actually.

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.680
Good Tequila.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.930
Not US Tequila.

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:47.760
And so he did.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.260
He listened.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.940
We brought Tequila in.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.990
We had a drink.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:56.720
And everyone kind of bleh, let
it all out, to what their

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.220
frustration.

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.690
Because they had been
afraid to really

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.800
talk about their needs.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.500
And afterwards he said, that
was a really good call.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.320
Because he was totally
driven to his goal,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.260
without taking the time.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.750
Because not just women
in the room.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:16.050
There were men the room, too,
that were so frustrated.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.930
But he hadn't taken the time to
really step back and say,

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:24.350
OK, I'm leading, but is anyone
still following?

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.850
And I think that's a classic
male trait, is

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.100
to just bowl ahead.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.290
And that's great.

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:35.040
But you've got to look behind
you every once in a while, and

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.430
then be sensitive to
what's going on.

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:44.090
And then I think that listening
component, too, I

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:46.920
think, is really important.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.490
And being really open.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.140
If you are going to say, I'm
willing to listen, be willing

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.860
to take the good and the bad.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.570
Because some people,
like my boss,

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.830
will say, he's a listener.

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:58.770
But he really doesn't want to
hear anything that you're

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:03.490
going to say to him that
is a criticism.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:05.165
He's not really interested
in that.

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.610
PRESENTER 1: Thank
you [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:12.120
DAINA MIDDLETON:
You're welcome.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.760
Thank you.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.360
Again, this was fun.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.540
