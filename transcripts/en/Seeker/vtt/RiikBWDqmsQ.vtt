00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.211
The creators of the movie Jurassic Park used
sounds from a baby elephant, alligator, and

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:07.540
tiger combined to bring the dinosaur roar
to life.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.830
Audiences loved it, but scientists… yeah…

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.789
Not so much.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.279
terror lizards
Dinosaurs have been gone for 65 million years,

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.320
so, no human has ever heard one roar.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Never.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.750
In the movies dinosaurs had sustained echoing
howls, but in real life?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.750
Nah, bro.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.470
A paper from 2009's Historical Biology attempted
to reveal exactly what some of these animals

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.660
may have sounded like, and lemme tell you,
T-Rex prolly didn't roar… instead the king

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.950
of the dinosaurs may have… said, "hisssssss."

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.800
Or maybe nothing at all.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.970
First, there is no fossilized evidence of
dinosaur voice boxes; voice boxes are made

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.590
of flesh so they don't fossilize, and thus
we'll probably never know without a shadow

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.200
of a doubt what these animals really sounded
like.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.810
But paleontologist Phil Senter researched
the vocalizations of living dinosaurian relatives

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.920
to try and make an educated guess.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.260
66 million years ago, at the end of the Mesozoic
era, most dinosaurs went extinct in the K/T

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Extinction event.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.010
95 percent of the birds we have today, according
to their DNA, evolved from any small dinosaurs

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.820
not killed by the K/T event.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.660
10 million years after that, the first shared
ancestor of all living modern crocodiles evolved,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.950
and they've remained relatively unchanged
ever since.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.700
So by looking at birds and crocodiles, scientists
figure, we might find some hint at what dinosaurs

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.710
sounded like.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.480
To roar, animals have to have a voice box,
and in the case of crocs and birds they come

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480
in different types.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.300
Crocs use a larynx the same kind of organ
as you and me.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.100
Birds use a little different organ called
a syrinx which generates birdsong.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.800
Dr. Julia Clarke of the University of Texas
at Austin, told me in an email, "[the syrinx]

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.060
had no precursor organ," it evolved with birds;
AFTER dinosaur extinction, and from fossil

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.479
evidence we know the larynx did the same.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.270
So because birds and crocs AND their voice
boxes evolved after the mass extinction of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.230
dinosaurs, researchers posit their commonly
shared ancestor dinosaur, probably couldn't

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.520
vocalize at all.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.350
Essentially, we KNOW dinosaurs didn't roar
because they didn't evolve voice boxes until

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.550
later.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.060
But just because they didn't roar doesn't
mean they didn't make noise.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.150
A paper in Anatomical Record points out, many
dinosaurs had nasal cavities, mouths and connected

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.150
noses.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.330
This connection inside the skull created resonance
chambers, which allows animals to create all

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.780
sorts of sounds even without a larynx or syrinx.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.740
And literally on top of that, the lambeosaurus
and hadrosaurus had massive resonating crests

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.959
connected to their breathing tracks, which
researchers think could amplify those noises

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.030
even further.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.520
We've found fossils of these crests so we
can prove it!

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.470
Some researchers blew air through them to
show they could have produced low-frequency

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.570
sounds -- just like modern crocs and some
elephants.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.990
So even though they didn't roar, dinosaurs
could have drummed, groaned, hissed, gurgled,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.630
clicked, rattled, chirped and chirruped, just
like their modern relatives…

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.630
Calling out that you're the best at hunting
or mating is super important in the animal

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.209
world, but calling out your portfolio of photos,
books or Kanye gifs/gifs is super important

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.270
in the INTERNET world.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.430

science show and podcast, TestTube Plus.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.090
On TTP we dive deep into the controversy of
the earliest dino discoveries, how some dinosaurs

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.430
you know might not be real, the black market
of dinosaur fossils and how we might be able

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:58.319
to bring them back.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.130
Does it bother you when hollywood makes up
dinosaur stuff?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.150
Like, why didn't the velociraptors have feathers?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.230
Dinosaurs had feathers.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.230
They did.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.230
It's fact.
