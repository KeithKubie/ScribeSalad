the answer and that's too bad not okay

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
the answer and that's too bad not okay

we need to do

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
we need to do
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.410
we need to do
so how much more do we need to do in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
so how much more do we need to do in
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720
so how much more do we need to do in
order to ensure the fact that we've got

solid evidence that raising food indoors

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
solid evidence that raising food indoors
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.680
solid evidence that raising food indoors
is a good idea yet the best evidence is

Phoenix doesn't consume all those
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.950
Phoenix doesn't consume all those
tomatoes neither does Tucson so so the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960
tomatoes neither does Tucson so so the
 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.420
tomatoes neither does Tucson so so the
fact is that you're still shipping food

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
fact is that you're still shipping food
 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550

animal rights people would object to
 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.100
animal rights people would object to
that so we've eliminated that as a

animals too but apparently the feeling

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910
animals too but apparently the feeling
 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.969
animals too but apparently the feeling
is that they're there modern dinosaurs

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979
is that they're there modern dinosaurs
 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.490
is that they're there modern dinosaurs
right birds are modern dinosaurs so

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
right birds are modern dinosaurs so
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.150
right birds are modern dinosaurs so
therefore you can kill them because

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160
therefore you can kill them because

those figures what they would have to do

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940
those figures what they would have to do
 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.640
those figures what they would have to do
is explain it a little bit more and so

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650
is explain it a little bit more and so
 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.500
is explain it a little bit more and so
they did they said well you can layer

it starts to make sense to me too

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490
it starts to make sense to me too
 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.530
it starts to make sense to me too
because once you

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540
because once you
 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.630
because once you
you see the ratio of indoor versus

outdoor crops now that's just land that
means you only get one crop a year but

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960
means you only get one crop a year but
 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.410
means you only get one crop a year but
indoors you can get how many crops a

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420
indoors you can get how many crops a

long does it take to grow tomatoes and
 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.370
long does it take to grow tomatoes and
you add up those lengths some time and

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380
you add up those lengths some time and
 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.380
you add up those lengths some time and
that doesn't mean anything to indoor

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390
that doesn't mean anything to indoor
 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.840
that doesn't mean anything to indoor
farming anymore now you can get three or

does it this country so you've got 10

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760
does it this country so you've got 10
 

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.570
does it this country so you've got 10
miles of a green belt and so from outer

you know there they are those like

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:02.810
you know there they are those like

spelled out for you

00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:04.339
spelled out for you
 

00:09:04.339 --> 00:09:07.629
spelled out for you
in green all right this basically is

00:09:07.629 --> 00:09:07.639
in green all right this basically is
 

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:08.889
in green all right this basically is
nothing wrong with that in every country

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:08.899
nothing wrong with that in every country

could afford at least that much but

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:10.430
could afford at least that much but
 

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.829
could afford at least that much but
that's not what I'm actually suggesting

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839
that's not what I'm actually suggesting
 

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:15.309
that's not what I'm actually suggesting
that was just a mind game thing what I'm

00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:15.319
that was just a mind game thing what I'm
 

00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:18.129
that was just a mind game thing what I'm
really suggesting is that if you think

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:18.139
really suggesting is that if you think
 

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:20.639
really suggesting is that if you think
that there's no solution to a

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:20.649
that there's no solution to a
 

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:24.569
that there's no solution to a
urbanization the population increase and

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:24.579
urbanization the population increase and
 

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:28.119
urbanization the population increase and
ABC the decrease in food production if

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:28.129
ABC the decrease in food production if
 

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:29.319
ABC the decrease in food production if
you think there's no solution to that

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:29.329
you think there's no solution to that
 

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:31.689
you think there's no solution to that
then you can just turn this off right

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:31.699
then you can just turn this off right
 

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:34.629
then you can just turn this off right
now but if you think that by applying

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:34.639
now but if you think that by applying
 

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:37.439
now but if you think that by applying
what we already know to a new situation

00:09:37.439 --> 00:09:37.449
what we already know to a new situation
 

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:39.819
what we already know to a new situation
then you can create the next Green

00:09:39.819 --> 00:09:39.829
then you can create the next Green
 

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.009
then you can create the next Green
Revolution and that's exactly what I'm

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:42.019
Revolution and that's exactly what I'm
 

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:44.230
Revolution and that's exactly what I'm
suggesting
