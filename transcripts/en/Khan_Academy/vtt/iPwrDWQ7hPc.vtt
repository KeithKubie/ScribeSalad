00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.500
Voiceover:It doesn't take long to realize

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.166
that taking higher and
higher powers of binomials

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.501
can get painful,

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:07.634
but let's just work through a few

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.500
just to realize how
quickly they get painful.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.633
If we take the binomial a plus b,

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.500
it's a binomial because it
has two terms right over here,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
let's take that to the 0 power.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.500
Anything that's non-zero to the 0 power,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.168
that's just going to be equal to 1.

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:24.300
That wasn't too bad.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.766
Now what about a plus b to the 1st power?

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.766
That's just going to be a plus b.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:36.900
Now what about a plus b squared?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.169
Now, if you haven't been practicing

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:41.633
taking powers of binomials,

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.033
you might have been tempted to say

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.833
a squared plus b squared,

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.034
but that would be incorrect.

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:48.300
If you did that, you should give yourself

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.766
a very gentle but not overly discouraging

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.900
slap on the wrist or
the brain or something.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.033
a plus b squared is not
a squared plus b squared.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:01.967
It is a plus b times a plus b.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:04.566
Then if you do this, it will be a times a,

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.034
which is a squared,

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:09.166
plus a times b, which is ab,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.233
plus b times a, which is another ab,

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.633
plus b times b, which is b squared.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:17.902
You have two ab's here, so
you could add them together,

00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:24.068
so it's equal to a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:28.433
Now things are going to get a
little bit more interesting.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:32.921
What is a plus b to the 3rd
power going to be equal to?

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:34.033
I encourage you to pause this video

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.813
and try to figure that out on your own.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.366
Well, we know that a
plus b to the 3rd power

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:43.902
is just a plus b to the 2nd
power times another a plus b.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:45.693
Let's just multiply this times a plus b

00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:47.569
to figure out what it is.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.068
I'll do this.

00:01:48.068 --> 00:01:48.706
Let's see.

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:52.733
Let's multiply that times a plus b.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.366
I'm just going to multiply it this way.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.386
First, I'll multiply b
times all of these things.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.566
I'll do it in this green color.

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.966
b times b squared is b to the 3rd power.

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.767
b times 2ab is 2a squared,

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:11.367
so 2ab squared,

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.501
and then b times a squared is ba squared,

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.033
or a squared b,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.501
a squared b.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.167
I'll multiply b times all of this stuff.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.367
Now let's multiply a times all this stuff.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:28.633
a times b squared is ab squared,

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:30.433
ab squared.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.700
a times 2ab is 2a squared b,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.033
2a squared b,

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:40.200
and then a times a squared
is a to the 3rd power.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.567
Now when we add all of
these things together,

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:44.833
we get,

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:49.236
we get a to the 3rd power plus, let's see,

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:52.233
we have 1 a squared b plus another,

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.766
plus 2 more a squared b's.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:56.901
That's going to be 3a squared b

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.007
plus 3ab squared.

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.566
2ab squared plus another ab squared

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:04.766
is going to be 3ab squared

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:08.434
plus b to the 3rd power.

00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:09.889
Just taking some of the 3rd power,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.566
this already took us a little
reasonable amount of time,

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:16.027
and so you can imagine
how painful it might get

00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:20.002
to do something like a
plus b to the 4th power,

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:21.167
or even worse,

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:25.367
if you're trying to find a
plus b to the 10th power,

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:26.978
or to the 20th power.

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.700
This would take you all day

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.012
or maybe even longer than that.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:32.966
It would be incredibly,
incredibly painful.

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:37.672
That's where the binomial
theorem becomes useful.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.833
What is the binomial theorem?

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.976
The binomial theorem tells us,

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:46.239
let me write this down,

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.167
binomial theorem.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.913
Binomial theorem,

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.433
it tells us that if we have a binomial,

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.700
and I'll just stick with
the a plus b for now,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.234
if I have, and I'm going to try

00:03:58.234 --> 00:03:59.566
to color code this a little bit,

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:03.834
if I have the binomial a plus b,

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:05.166
a plus b,

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.900
and I'm going to raise it the nth power,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.233
I'm going to raise this to the nth power,

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.303
the binomial theorem tells us

00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:13.966
that this is going to be equal to,

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:14.966
and the notation is going to look

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:16.500
a little bit complicated at first,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.838
but then we'll work
through an actual example,

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:25.233
is going to be equal to
the sum from k equals 0,

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:29.615
k equals 0 to n,

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.501
this n and this n are the same number,

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:33.866
of ...

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:36.167
I don't want to ...

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.301
that's kind of a garish color ...

00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:42.104
of n choose k,

00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:43.301
n choose k,

00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.969
and we'll review that in a second;

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.900
this comes straight out of combinatorics;

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.833
n choose k times a to the n minus k,

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.933
n minus k,

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.834
times b,

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:04.372
times b to the k,

00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.500
b to the k power.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.366
Now this seems a little bit unwieldy.

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:10.034
Let's just review, remind ourselves

00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:12.700
what n choose k actually means.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.566
If we say n choose k,

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:16.167
I'll do the same colors,

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:18.900
n choose k,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.166
we remember from combinatorics
this would be equal to

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:23.900
n factorial,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.500
n factorial over k factorial,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.299
over k factorial times
n minus k factorial,

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.634
n minus k factorial,

00:05:37.634 --> 00:05:42.767
so n minus k minus k factorial,

00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:44.100
let me color code this,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.633
n minus k factorial.

00:05:46.633 --> 00:05:48.367
Let's try to apply this.

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:50.235
Let's just start applying it to the thing

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:51.766
that started to intimidate us,

00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:54.897
say, a plus b to the 4th power.

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:56.694
Let's figure out what that's going to be.

00:05:56.694 --> 00:05:57.515
Let's try this.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.166
So a, and I'm going to
try to keep it color-coded

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.834
so you know what's going on,

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:02.238
a plus b,

00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:03.540
although it takes me
a little bit more time

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.772
to keep switching colors,

00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:06.003
but hopefully it's worth it,

00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:07.033
a plus b.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.900
Let's take that to the 4th power.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.501
The binomial theorem tells us

00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:13.033
this is going to be equal to,

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:14.967
and I'm just going to
use this exact notation,

00:06:14.967 --> 00:06:19.433
this is going to be the
sum from k equals 0,

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:22.100
k equals 0 to 4,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.834
to 4 of 4 choose k,

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:30.433
4 choose k,

00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:32.240
4 choose ...

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.311
let me do that k in that purple color,

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:42.900
4 choose k of a to the 4 minus k power,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.900
4 minus k power

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.300
times b to the k power,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.233
b to the k power.

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:51.900
Now what is that going to be equal to?

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:54.167
Well, let's just actually just do the sum.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:56.236
This is going to be equal to,

00:06:56.236 --> 00:06:58.834
so we're going to start at k equals 0,

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:03.634
so when k equals 0, it's
going to be 4 choose 0,

00:07:03.634 --> 00:07:07.234
4 choose 0,

00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:12.100
times a to the 4 minus 0 power,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.234
well, that's just going
to be a to the 4th power,

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.436
times b to the 0 power.

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.720
b to the 0 power is just
going to be equal to 1,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.048
so we could just put a
1 here if we want to,

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:22.367
or we could just leave it like that.

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.899
This is what we get when k equals 0.

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:28.166
Then to that, we're going
to add when k equals 1.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.568
k equals 1 is going to be,

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:35.966
the coefficient is going to be 4 choose 1,

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:41.700
and it's going to be times
a to the 4 minus 1 power,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.100
so a to the 3rd power,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.766
and I'll just stick with that color,

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:48.300
times b to the k power.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.300
Well, now, k is 1b to the 1st power.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.168
Then to that, we're going to add,

00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:57.433
we're going to add 4 choose 2,

00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:03.500
4 choose 2 times a to the ...

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.700
well, now k is 2.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.167
4 minus 2 is 2.

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:06.965
a squared.

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:07.859
I think you see a pattern here.

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:09.985
a to the 4th, a to the 3rd, a squared,

00:08:09.985 --> 00:08:11.566
and then times b to the k.

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:13.907
Well, k is 2 now, so b squared,

00:08:13.907 --> 00:08:15.539
and you see a pattern again.

00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:18.966
You could say b to the
0, b to the 1, b squared,

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:22.033
and we only have two
more terms to add here,

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:25.566
plus 4 choose 3,

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:32.433
4 choose 3 times 4 minus 3 is 1,

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:35.700
times a, or a to the 1st,
I guess we could say,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.434
and then b to the 3rd power,

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.500
times a to the 1st b to the third,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.433
and then only one more term,

00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:46.170
plus 4 choose,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.766
4 choose 4.

00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:50.033
k is now 4.

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:52.166
This is going to be our
last term right now.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.372
We're getting k goes
from 0 all the way to 4,

00:08:54.372 --> 00:08:55.633
4 choose 4.

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:58.766
a to the 4 minus 4,
that's just going to be 1,

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:00.233
a to the 0, that's just 1,

00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:03.108
so we're going to be left
with just b to the k power,

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:05.380
and b is 4 right over here.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.566
We're almost done.

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:07.967
We've expanded it out.

00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:09.566
We just need it figure
out what 4 choose 0,

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.902
4 choose 1, 4 choose 2,
et cetera, et cetera are,

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:13.340
so let's figure that out.

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:17.033
We could just apply this
over and over again.

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:19.366
So 4 choose 0,

00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:26.766
4 choose 0 is equal to 4
factorial over 0 factorial

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.917
times 4 minus 0 factorial.

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:31.113
That's just going to be 4 factorial again.

00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.238
0 factorial, at least for these purposes,

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:35.233
we are defining to be equal to 1,

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:38.501
so this whole thing is
going to be equal to 1,

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:41.233
so this coefficient is 1.

00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:41.701
Let's see.

00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:42.636
Let's keep going here.

00:09:42.636 --> 00:09:50.501
So 4 choose 1 is going to be
4 factorial over 1 factorial

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:55.100
times 4 minus 1 factorial,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.176
4 minus 1 factorial, so 3 factorial.

00:09:58.176 --> 00:09:59.167
What's this going to be?

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:01.567
1 factorial is just going to be 1.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.233
4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:10:04.233 --> 00:10:06.304
3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:06.966
Let me make that clear.

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:09.633
4 times 3 times 2 times 1

00:10:09.633 --> 00:10:12.033
over 3 times 2 times 1

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:14.500
is just going to leave us with 4.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.124
This right over here
is just going to be 4.

00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:20.101
Then we need to figure
out what 4 choose 2 is.

00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:26.700
4 choose 2 is going to be 4
factorial over 2 factorial

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.853
times what's 4 minus ...

00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:29.967
this is going to be n minus k,

00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:32.234
4 minus 2 over 2 factorial.

00:10:32.234 --> 00:10:34.100
So what is this going to be?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.433
Let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:40.567
This is going to be 4
times 3 times 2 times 1

00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:42.718
over 2 factorial is 2,

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:44.676
over 2 times 2.

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:46.500
This is 2, this is 2,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.104
so 2 times 2 is same thing as 4.

00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:49.643
We're left with 3 times 2 times 1,

00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:51.974
which is equal to 6.

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:53.966
That's equal to 6.

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:56.700
Then what is 4 choose 3?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.833
I'll use some space down here.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.633
So 4 choose 3,

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:08.104
4 choose 3 is equal to 4 factorial over,

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:12.033
over 3 factorial times
4 minus 3 factorial,

00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:14.311
so that's just going to be 1 factorial.

00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:15.844
Well, we already figured out what that is.

00:11:15.844 --> 00:11:17.367
That's the same thing
as this right over here.

00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:19.900
You just swap the 1 factorial
and the 3 factorial.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.566
We already figured out that
this is going to be equal to 4.

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:25.500
That is equal to 4.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.366
4 choose 4?

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.508
Well, this is just going to be,

00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:30.576
let me just do it over here,

00:11:30.576 --> 00:11:36.709
4 choose 4 is 4 factorial over 4 factorial

00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:39.300
times 0 factorial,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.833
which is the exact thing we had here,

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.166
which we figured out was 1.

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.700
Just like that, we're done.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.100
We were able to figure out

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.700
what a plus b to the 4th power is.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.369
It's 1a to the 4th plus
4a to the 3rd b to the 1st

00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:56.766
plus 6a squared b squared plus 4ab cubed

00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:57.680
plus b to the 4th.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.766
Actually, let me just write that down,

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:00.525
since we did all that work.

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:04.300
This is equal to a to the 4th plus,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.999
plus 4,

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:10.167
plus 4a to the 3rd,

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:14.817
a to the 3rd b plus,

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.321
plus 6,

00:12:17.721 --> 00:12:22.300
plus 6a squared b squared,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.033
a squared b squared,

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:26.027
plus,

00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:28.089
plus,

00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:31.566
plus 4, I think you see a pattern here,

00:12:31.566 --> 00:12:36.904
plus 4a times b to the 3rd power

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:39.586
plus b to the 4th power,

00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:41.710
plus b to the 4th power.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.767
There is an interesting pattern here.

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:45.359
There is a symmetry where
you have the coefficient,

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:47.952
you go 1, 4, 6 for the middle term,

00:12:47.952 --> 00:12:48.936
and then you go back to 4,

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:51.500
and then you go back to 1.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.548
Then you also see that pattern,

00:12:52.548 --> 00:12:54.515
is that you start at a
to the 4th, a to the 3rd,

00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:55.515
a squared, a,

00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:57.966
and then you could say
there is an a to the 0 here,

00:12:57.966 --> 00:12:59.567
and then you started b to the 0,

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:01.253
which we didn't write
it, but that's just 1,

00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:03.647
then b to the 1st, b
squared, b to the 3rd,

00:13:03.647 --> 00:13:05.067
b to the 4th.

00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:08.100
This is just one
application or one example.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.501
In future videos, we'll do more examples

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:10.500
of the binomial theorem

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.934
and also try to understand why it works.
