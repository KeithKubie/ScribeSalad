00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.630 align:start position:0%
and then it was no and then the third
answer<00:10:46.810><c> was</c><00:10:46.960><c> I</c><00:10:47.170><c> think</c><00:10:47.350><c> maybe</c><00:10:47.530><c> no</c><00:10:47.800><c> a</c><00:10:47.830><c> third</c><00:10:48.370><c> time</c>

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
answer was I think maybe no a third time
 

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.190 align:start position:0%
answer was I think maybe no a third time
and<00:10:48.850><c> then</c><00:10:48.940><c> you</c><00:10:49.390><c> work</c><00:10:49.750><c> through</c><00:10:50.050><c> it</c><00:10:50.080><c> and</c>

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
and then you work through it and
 

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.450 align:start position:0%
and then you work through it and
eventually<00:10:50.560><c> things</c><00:10:50.740><c> happen</c><00:10:51.160><c> and</c><00:10:51.220><c> you</c><00:10:51.280><c> have</c><00:10:51.340><c> a</c>

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:51.460 align:start position:0%
eventually things happen and you have a
 

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
eventually things happen and you have a
