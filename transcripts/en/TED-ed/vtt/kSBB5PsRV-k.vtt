00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:08.468
Sunken relics,

00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:09.828
ghostly shipwrecks,

00:00:09.828 --> 00:00:11.478
and lost cities.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.808
These aren't just wonders found
in fictional adventures.

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:16.488
Beneath the ocean's surface,

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:19.087
there are ruins where people
once roamed

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:23.258
and shipwrecks loaded with artifacts
from another time.

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:26.449
This is the domain 
of underwater archaeology,

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.370
where researchers discover and study
human artifacts that slipped into the sea.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.988
They're not on a treasure hunt.

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:36.909
Underwater archaeology 
reveals important information

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.779
about ancient climates and coastlines,

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:42.149
it tells us how humans sailed the seas,

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.757
and what life was like millennia ago.

00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:47.777
So what exactly can we find?

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.800
At shallow depths mingled in with
modern-day items,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.159
we've discovered all sorts 
of ancient artifacts.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.480
This zone contains evidence of how
our ancestors fished,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210
how they repaired their ships,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.720
disposed of their trash,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.720
and even their convicted pirates,
who were buried below the tide line.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.710
And it's not just our recent history.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.660
800,000-year old footprints were found
along the shore in Norfolk, Britain.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.121
In these shallow depths,

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:20.188
the remains of sunken cities also loom
up from the sea floor,

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:21.831
deposited there by earthquakes,

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:22.939
tsunamis,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.999
and Earth's sinking plates.

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.990
Almost every sunken city can be found
at these shallow depths

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.759
because the sea level has changed little
in the several thousand years

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.240
that city-building civilizations 
have existed.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.829
For instance, in shallow waters off
the coast of Italy lies Baia,

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.933
a Roman seaside town 
over 2,000 years old.

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:49.299
There, it's possible to swim among
the ruins of structures

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.688
built by Rome's great families,
senators, and emperors.

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:55.531
And then there are shipwrecks.

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.833
As ships grow too old for use,
they're usually abandoned near shore

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:04.640
in out-of-the-way places like estuaries,
rivers, and shallow bays.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.952
Archaeologists use these like a timeline
to map a harbor's peaks and declines,

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:13.701
and to get clues about the historic art
of shipbuiding.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:18.170
At Roskilde in Denmark, for example,
five purposefully sunken vessels

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.083
reveal how Vikings crafted their fearsome
long ships 1,000 years ago.

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.741
When we descend a bit further,

00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:29.105
we reach the zone where the deepest
human structures lie,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:32.073
like ancient harbor walls and quays.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:37.012
We also see more shipwrecks
sunk by storms, war, and collisions.

00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:39.802
We're still excavating many 
of these wrecks today,

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:41.293
like Blackbeard's ship,

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:45.893
which is revealing secrets about life
as an 18th century pirate.

00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:50.562
But past 50 feet, there are even deeper,
better preserved shipwrecks,

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.792
like the wreck at Antikythera,

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:56.313
which sank during the 1st century BC.

00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:58.390
When it was discovered, 
it contained statues,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.443
trade cargo,

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.482
and also the earliest known computer,

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.363
a mysterious device called
the Antikythera mechanism

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:09.623
that kept track of astronomical changes
and eclipses.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.452
Today, it gives archaeologists vital
information

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:15.593
about the knowledge possessed
by the Ancient Greeks.

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:20.205
It is in this zone that we also begin
to find aircraft and submarines,

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:23.472
such as those from the World Wars.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:25.642
Plunging as deep as 200 feet,

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:30.993
we can find some of the earliest
and rarest signs of human history.

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:34.313
Prior to 5,000 years ago, 
there was a lot more dry land

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:39.063
because glaciers trapped much
of the water that now forms the sea.

00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:41.602
Our ancestors spread across these lands,

00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:44.284
and so on the sea floor, 
we find their camps,

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:45.523
stone tools,

00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:48.343
and the bones of animals they hunted.

00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:52.605
These sites give us invaluable knowledge
about our ancestor's migration patterns,

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:54.255
hunting methods,

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:57.575
and technologies.

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.374
In the deepest zone, 
no human has ever walked.

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:04.965
This area has been submerged since
well before mankind evolved.

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:09.304
The only artifacts we find are those
that have drifted down from above,

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:14.325
like NASA's Saturn V rocket engines
at 14,000 feet,

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:17.406
and the deepest shipwrecks.

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:20.085
The ocean is like a huge 
underwater museum

00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:23.643
that constantly adds to our knowledge
about humanity.

00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:25.535
With only a fraction of it explored,

00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:29.145
discoveries are sure to continue
long into the future.
