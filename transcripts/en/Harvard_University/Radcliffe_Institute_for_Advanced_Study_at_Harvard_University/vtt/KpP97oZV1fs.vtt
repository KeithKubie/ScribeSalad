00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.490
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.209
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.500
I'm Dean of The Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.310
and I am delighted to welcome
you to today's lecture

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.900
by Nora Volkow entitled The
Sleep-Deprived Human Brain.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.650
And hopefully we don't have too
many of those in the audience

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.970
today.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.030
Here at Radcliffe we are
dedicated to fostering

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.050
and to sharing path breaking
work across disciplines.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.830
And we do this by convening
leaning scholars, scientists,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.190
and artists, and by
organizing a full calendar

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.070
of public programming,
including conferences,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.790
lectures like the one you're
at today, and exhibitions.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.910
Our program today is
part of the Davis Lecture

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.880
Series established
by Kim and Judy Davis

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.700
to bring leading
thinkers in all fields

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.550
to the Radcliffe Institute
to give public talks.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.700
I'm very glad to see Kim
in the audience here today

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.300
and I am thrilled to have Nora
Volkow as our Davis lecturer

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.440
this afternoon.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760
Now it's very rare to find
Nora's formidable combination

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.060
of talents in a
single individual.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.510
Nora is an intrepid
and prolific scientist,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.170
having published over
600 journal articles.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.550
But she is also a tireless
and compelling advocate.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.450
Nora shares her research with
the public and the policymakers

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
helping to shape our national
debate on crucial health

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.600
issues in critical ways.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.090
And as if that
weren't enough, Nora

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.750
is also a committed and
distinguished administrator,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
having served since 2003
as Director of the National

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.980
Institute on Drug
Abuse, and before that,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.770
in senior roles at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.720
Nora is renowned for her
pioneering use of brain imaging

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.190
to study the toxic effects and
addictive properties of drugs

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.570
of abuse.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.410
Nora's research was instrumental
in showing that addiction

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.950
is a chronic disease of
the brain, an insight

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720
with major implications both
for psychiatry and for policy.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.290
This body of work has been
critical to identifying

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.720
the neurochemical
mechanisms of the brain that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.330
play a role in
individual vulnerability

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.270
to substance use disorders.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.330
It would be hard to
overstate the importance

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.190
of this research.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.980
The brain disease
model of addiction

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.120
represented a fundamental change
from the previously widespread

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.210
view that substance
abuse disorders

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.290
reflect weak willpower
or moral failing.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.900
Among the outcomes of
this paradigm shift

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.960
was the passage of the Mental
Health Parity and Addiction

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.370
Act of 2008, which required
health insurance providers

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.640
to offer the same types of
coverage for mental health,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.890
including addiction, that they
provide for other diseases.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.190
Nora's work has also been
central to our understanding

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.950
of the neurobiology of
obesity, of ADHD, and of aging.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.610
In her lecture today Nora will
discuss brain imaging studies

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.450
in investigating the effects of
sleep deprivation highlighting

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.900
important links between
sleep, and addiction,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.520
and other diseases.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.720
Now the story of how Nora came
to do this kind of research

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.370
is unusual.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.460
Nora grew up in Mexico
City in the house

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.820
where her great
grandfather, Leon Trotsky,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.440
lived in exile until his
assassination in 1940.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.650
After graduating at the top
of her class in medicine

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.990
at the National
University of Mexico,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.950
Nora became fascinated by
a brain imaging technology

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.540
called positron emission
tomography, or PET for short.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.000
So Nora traveled to New York
University School of Medicine

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.210
where researchers were doing
PET imaging in collaboration

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.700
with the Brookhaven
National Laboratory.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.920
Nora was already impressive
by her mid-twenties,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.430
and these scientists seized
the opportunity to hire her.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.800
Nora then enrolled in NYU'S
residency program in psychiatry

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.269
and used PET imaging to study
brain tumors and schizophrenia.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.790
She soon earned the
Laughlin Fellowship Award

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.860
from the American
College of Psychiatrists,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.860
which is given annually
to outstanding psychiatric

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.860
residents deemed likely to
make a significant contribution

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.380
to the field.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.010
Nora next joined the faculty of
the University of Texas Health

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.980
Science Center at
Houston intending

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.310
to continue her research
into schizophrenia.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.400
When she discovered a shortage
of appropriate patients

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.700
at the University Hospital,
she had a novel idea

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.620
to use the same
imaging technique

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.890
to study patients admitted
for psychosis from having

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.870
taken cocaine.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.930
This investigation led to
the breakthrough discovery

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.080
that cocaine, which was
generally considered safe

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.170
at the time, is in
fact toxic and damages

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.720
the brain by
decreasing blood flow.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.940
Her findings went
so against the grain

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.650
that no science journal would
publish them for three years.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.300
Nora's commitment to
gather data and follow them

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.510
where they ever they lead,
even when her results challenge

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.850
the public and
scientific consensus,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.830
has remained the
keystone to what

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.170
makes her work so compelling.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.750
After moving on to Brookhaven
National Laboratory

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.390
in the State University of
New York at Stony Brook,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.940
Nora served in a number
of leadership roles

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.930
while continuing her ambitious
research program on addiction.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.970
In her current
position as director

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.260
of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.490
Nora's advocacy for new
policies and treatments

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.590
based on sound science
has been vital.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.930
But she is also an
inspiring model of someone

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.230
who effectively combines
scientific research,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.070
institutional leadership,
and policy advocacy.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.940
So now please join me in giving
a warm welcome to Nora Volkov.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.395
- Thanks very much
that was very kind.

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:11.740
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.630
It's actually a
pleasure to be here.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.510
I'm just sort of humbled by
the very nice introduction

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.010
and the point that
says, well I hope

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.260
that there are not many
people who are sleep-deprived

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.220
deprived here.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.000
I sort of said I am one of them.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.070
My life is very, very crazy.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.030
It's very unusual for
me to come into a forum

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.250
right now amidst
the opiate crises

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.700
and speak of something that's
not specifically, directly

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.760
related to drugs.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.970
And this is related
to drugs, because I

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.010
was basically was being told
almost everything that we

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.200
know about how the brain
works is negatively

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.740
influenced by drugs.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.650
But this will dwell much more
into the process of sleep.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.500
It reflects studies that we
have been doing in my laboratory

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.020
to try to address the
important question about why

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.450
is it that we sleep.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.700
We spend at least 30% to
40% of our time sleeping.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.120
During sleep we are
extraordinary vulnerable.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.780
And yet despite this
vulnerability, biologically,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.150
we cannot forego sleep, which
clearly highlights that it must

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.840
play an extraordinary,
fundamental role.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.780
Why did I start to get
engaged with sleep?

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.390
I started to get involved
with sleep interested

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.150
in the concept of sleep in my
brain from two perspectives.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.330
One of them, the
recognization that patients

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.300
that were basically
addicted to drugs

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.330
have very severe disruption
of the sleep patterns.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.380
And that was something that was
very salient, and at that time

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.890
I was very much engaged
in studying cocaine.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.160
Cocaine in animal
models produce something

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.460
that actually no other
drug can produce,

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.770
very few drugs can produce.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:10.110
If you give an animal free
availability of the drug,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.770
ultimately the only drug where
animals will forego sleep

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.940
is cocaine.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.310
And as a result of
foregoing this sleep,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.800
these animals will be
dead within three weeks

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.440
of free availability to drugs.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.260
And it is recognized also
in animal experiments

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.890
that animals do not
survive sleep deprivation.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.729
But to me it was very telling
in terms of how profoundly

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:36.900
a drug can remove the basic
instincts for survival,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.710
that it could lead an animal
to stop sleeping in order

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.940
to get the drug.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.650
And that was one of the
first things when I said,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.080
well, there is
something in there.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.040
The other aspect that I was
very intrigued about sleep about

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.920
will lead me to the
first part of my talk

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.970
which has two components.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.980
One of the studies of sleep
that very specifically addresses

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.640
the question, does sleep
influence the brain dopamine

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.960
system?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.840
The brain dopamine system
is the main mechanism

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.150
by which drugs are requiring.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.040
All of the drugs that
produce addiction

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.395
activate the dopamine system.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.180
And this activation ultimately
results, in those people

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.840
that take it regularly and that
have vulnerability, in changes

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.920
that produce addiction.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.960
But it is that dopamine
that leads us there.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.570
The dopamine system is what
assigns saliency to values,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.850
to reinforcers.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.670
It is what motivates our action.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.650
And I've always been very
curious and intrigued

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.230
about why is it that in
general, drug taking behavior

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.880
tends to acquire much more
towards the end of the day.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.590
Why do you see that most
people tend to actually binge

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.520
at that period of time?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.350
And you could put up two
questions, two answers to that.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.910
It says, well, it's social
systems that lead to it.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:07.340
In the morning we work, and in
the evening we play and party.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.890
But then if you're
more critical and say,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.900
is this just an
aleatory phenomena?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.810
I would say it's very unlikely
to be an aleatory phenomena.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.160
It's likely to reflect the
biology of all of our circadian

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.177
rhythms.

00:10:20.177 --> 00:10:22.010
So I became very intrigued
about the concept

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.350
of what happens to the
circadian variability,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.520
to the differences in function
of our dopamine system

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.720
in the morning versus the
evening that could make drugs

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.671
more rewarding towards the end
of the day than in the morning.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.210
That's what led me
to think of very

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.300
much of the first part of the
talk, which is the one related

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.770
to the dopamine system.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.090
The second one is a new
space that we've gone in,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.790
also extraordinarily
important, that

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:55.010
relates to the role
of sleep in basically

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:01.130
being able to detoxify our brain
from proteins and molecules

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.340
such beta amyloid that
are of course implicated

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.890
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.010
The first part of the
talk is our studies

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.830
that we have been doing
for many years now.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.700
The last part of the talk is
new studies that have not yet

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.440
been published.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.790
They are in press.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.220
So we know that
sleep is fundamental

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.520
and we recognize it from
the perspective of all of us

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.570
that when we are
badly sleep deprived,

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.680
our cognitive
performance goes down.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.130
And one of the processes that's
most disrupted, certainly

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.850
in my brain, is of memory.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.480
So when I have to
fly abroad and I

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.740
have to give a talk in
a different language

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.220
it becomes very
awkward because I

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.250
am afraid that I will forget
the words when I'm speaking.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.970
So it does interfere with
cognitive performance, sleep.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.300
We also know that it
interferes with alertness.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.670
And part of our impairments
in cognitive performance

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.710
may be that our alertness
and arousal goes down.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.490
So we cannot sustain effort,
we cannot sustained attention.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.770
And that is one of
the main mechanisms

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.960
that results in accidents.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.080
If you look at it in terms of
the statistics of accidents

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.930
in the United States, as it
is the case in other areas

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.020
of the world too, there are
more people and more fatalities

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.710
associated with car
accidents leading

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.250
with sleep impairments and
improper sleep behavior

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.640
than they are with alcohol.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.980
So it's as important as that.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.400
We don't explain or
express it like that,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.870
but it does play a
very significant role

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.410
in public health.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.570
And the third element more
and more we're recognizing,

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.510
that impaired sleep
behavior is associated

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.680
with a variety of diseases,
including a much higher risk

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080
of obesity.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.320
This is very elegantly
studied and investigated

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.510
with respect to what are
the endocrine signals that

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.730
are changed by
sleep deprivation,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.860
as well as studies
that now are starting

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.970
to emerge to show that impaired
sleep is also associated

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.370
with higher risk for dementia.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.455
At the end of my talk
with present data

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:07.360
I will show you
our newest findings

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.770
with imaging in this respect.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.380
So let's start with the brain
and the dopamine system.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.730
What is the role of dopamine?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.580
Is it recognized as important
to the sleep wake cycle?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.750
And there has been a lot
of fire of controversy

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.180
in this space with some
saying, no, dopamine

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.790
is not important to
the sleep wake cycle.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.030
And that tended to
be older literature.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.130
As more sophisticated
technologies are emerging

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.770
it has become clear that the
dopamine system is fundamental

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.526
for arousal,
fundamental for arousal.

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:42.900
In fact, when you
have anesthesia

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.900
and you want to actually bring
someone out of the anesthesia,

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.030
one of the classical
drugs that you give

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.120
is a stimulant drug
that increases dopamine.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.690
And if you want to awaken an
animal that is anesthetized,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.720
you can specifically
stimulate the dopamine cells

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.310
and they arouse.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.640
So this recognized that
the dopamine cells that

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.030
are located in the midbrain
ventral tegmental area,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.430
and to a lesser extent
the substantia nigra,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.980
are very important
in the arousal.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.860
In the middle you see data that
has been shown and replicated

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.230
independently by
various laboratories.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.280
When you measure
dopamine in the brain,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.480
and actually also
when you measure it

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.230
in reward regions of the
brain that receive these very

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.220
strong, strong projections,
terminals of dopamine,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.410
you see our
circadian variability

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.290
where the levels of dopamine
vary as a function of time.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.800
Now for those of you that
are not very familiar

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.270
with rats in the laboratory,
rats, when it's dark

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.290
are very active.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.430
That's when their dopamine
system is more activated

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.230
and as they become quiescent
in sleep, that's where

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.150
the dopamine system goes down.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.260
So there is clear cut evidence
of this circadian variability.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.390
And it's got to the point
that researchers now

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.450
have identified the
protein in the brain that

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.170
is responsible for the circadian
variability of dopamine.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.650
That is a molecule that we
call dopamine transporter

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.110
whose function is to recycle.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.020
It brings dopamine back
into the cell, removing it.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.300
So when you don't have
that protein, which

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.240
is a very elegant way of
regulating how much dopamine

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.070
is outside, these animals lose
their circadian variability.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.170
Then if you wanted
and you needed

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.560
more evidence of how important
the dopamine system is,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.770
recognize that the most potent
medications that we have

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.610
to actually promote arousal to
keep people awake when they are

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.020
in conditions of
sleep deprivation,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.130
such as for example,
pilots or soldiers that

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.470
have to perform under
tremendous amounts of stress

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.520
over 24 or 48 hours, those are
the stimulant drugs or drugs

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.720
like modafinil.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.090
All of them increase dopamine.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.820
And their arousing
effect is basically

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.920
mediated by their dopaminergic
actions, predominantly.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.480
Also we all recognize
that in diseases

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.410
that affect the dopamine system,
the most notably recognized

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.370
is Parkinson's disease because
your dopamine cells get

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.650
damaged, you lose 90%
of the dopamine cells,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.930
there is profound disruption
of the sleep wake cycle.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.120
So in light of that we
said, OK all of these

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.700
are animal studies,
let's then study

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.960
the very specific question.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.760
If indeed you are saying
that there may be,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.400
in certain patterns
of social behavior,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.010
that over all the
possibility people

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.010
may be more sensitive to
reinforcers like drugs

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.820
or like excessive
food consumption

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.700
towards the end of the day.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.870
Also when people
are sleep deprived,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.430
they are much less likely to
regulate their own desires

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.260
and much more likely to
engage in impulsive behaviors.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.940
So we wanted to know, well,
how does that translate

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.880
from the perspective of
the signaling mechanism

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.500
in the human brain.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.340
And we use positron
emission tomography,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.810
which is an imaging technology
that allows us specifically

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.450
to look at targets
that are involved

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.150
in signaling between neurons.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.020
In this case our target
was dopamine cells.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.180
The way that we actually
can look at them

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.369
is by measuring
the concentration

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.880
of different proteins.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.020
So one of them is that
dopamine transporter.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.069
This is the protein that if
you remove it in animals,

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.120
you remove the
circadian variability.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.370
So we know from
animal experiments.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.170
This is a key protein in
regulating levels of dopamine.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.670
We also focus on the
dopamine D2 receptor

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.800
because the D2
receptor's system is

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.840
one of there's some
main mechanisms that

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.600
signals activation,
that ultimately

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.480
may be responsible
for motivation

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.350
for reinforcement for arousal.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.900
And we do know
that when you give

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.050
drugs that block the
dopamine D2 receptors,

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.080
you actually interfere
with arousal.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.290
So this produces sedation.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.170
So we decided to
do a study to ask

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.950
if we sleep deprive normal,
healthy people over one

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:17.050
night of sleep deprivation,
how much are there changes

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.360
in these molecules
that are the very

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.830
important ones in basically
modulating dopamine signaling.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.040
So we studied subjects
in which we measured

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.700
dopamine transporters and we
measured dopamine D2 receptors,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.860
under two very
different conditions,

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.100
after they have slept all night
and we monitor their sleep

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.680
to secure that they
were sleeping properly.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.730
That was one condition.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.720
And the condition
is we basically

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.270
had someone with
them all night long

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.360
to ensure that they were awake.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.260
And we of course
regulated that so

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.530
that they were not taking any
substances that could directly

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.345
impact dopaminergic
signaling, such as in the case

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:57.845
of caffeine.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.260
And then what did we observe?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.600
So this is the design.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.670
We did a positron
emission study.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.480
And at the end they were
studied on two different days--

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.180
one after rested sleep--

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.460
the one after sleep
deprivation that's what we call

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.530
sd, and the other is
the rested wakefulness

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.750
after a good night's sleep.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.440
We do the PET scans,
and then we do an MRI.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.780
And an MRI is another
imaging technique,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.340
different from PET which
looks at biochemistry,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.940
that allows us to see how
the brain is activated.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.120
That reactivity of the
neuronal systems in the brain.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.340
So combining both of them gives
us a biochemical perspective

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.330
and a functional neuronal one.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.930
So what did we observe in
terms of dopamine transporters?

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.870
So these are the average
images of all of the subjects

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.530
to measure the
peak concentration

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.770
of dopamine transporters
after rested wakefulness.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.650
And you see that the
transporters are predominantly

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.080
located in the striatum.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.380
This is the same subjects, the
average image for all of them

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.910
after sleep deprivation.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.820
You can just actually
visually see basically

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.840
there no difference.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.250
And when you quantify them,
this was very surprising.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.120
I was expecting that
with sleep deprivation

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.610
you would actually
observe a decrease

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.220
in the dopamine transporters.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.700
That's what I had predicted
because if you decrease

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.990
dopamine transporters
that would amplify

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.000
the dopaminergic
signal, and that

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.990
will help sustain arousal since
these subjects actually were

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.100
not allowed to fall asleep.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.100
But we didn't observe that.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.800
Now what about
dopamine D2 receptors?

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.540
They're what we all
observed was actually

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.890
a significant difference.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.850
And I'll go into
what it basically

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.320
may mean with this technology.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.470
So what you are
observing is that these

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.540
are the levels of
dopamine D2 receptors,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.450
again in the same areas
because they are basically

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.375
continuous cells where
we measure transporters

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:57.460
and receptors.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.060
Both of them, of course,
are located in the striatum.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.990
This actually is the averaging
math for sleep deprivation.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.940
When you quantified
whether it is

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.130
in the caudate or
the putamen, which

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.570
are parts of the
dorsal striatum,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.640
you see a significant
reduction in the binding

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.250
of the ligand of
this compound that

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.830
binds to dopamine D2 receptors.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.970
Which actually was very
interesting at that time.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.970
And I hope I have a
slide to basically

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.430
explain to you more specifically
why we interpreted it that way.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.400
But at that time the
way that we interpreted

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.410
it is that this ligand
binds to the receptors,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.537
but it can only bind to those
receptors that are empty.

00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:46.120
It's like when you
go to an auditorium

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.210
and you can only
sit on the chairs

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.190
when they are no one
is sitting there.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.590
These ligand behaves
exactly like that.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.430
So if there's a lot of
dopamine those receptors

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.590
are going to be
occupied by dopamine,

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.430
and then you will see a decrease
in the binding of the ligand.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.040
And so this is a strategy
that a lot of researchers

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.340
are using to directly
measure different stimuli,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.310
different drug
effects, and whether it

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.330
changes dopamine
concentration in the brain.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.900
And we have been one of
the first laboratories

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.620
to use it that way.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.830
In fact, we were the
first laboratory.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.600
We interpret this to indicate

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.210
this decrease in the
dopamine D2 receptors

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.340
that we observed here.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.150
We interpreted it state that
when people are sleep deprived

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.780
and they have to stay
awake the next day,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.320
there is a compensation in
order to maintain alertness

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.390
that leads to increases
some dopamine.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.230
That's the way that we actually
reported on that journal

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:50.430
and the science paper in 2008.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.590
It was not completely
in my brain.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.769
My brain was hurting.

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:56.560
I mean my brain hurts
me, I have to confess

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.910
to do all of these things.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.460
It was hurting me because
we have consistently

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.570
been studying effects of the
stimulant drugs on alertness

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.790
and arousal, and we
have consistently

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.670
shown that the more you
increase dopamine the greater

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.130
the arousal.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.500
So here I'm going
to show you what

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.230
we observe when
dopamine supposedly

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.390
was increased by
sleep deprivation

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.770
and it's relation to arousal.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.890
We're observing
exactly the opposite.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:31.150
So we had in the past said,
the more you change dopamine,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.500
the less tired you are.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.120
Here, what we are
observing, this

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.250
is the measure of
changes in dopamine.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:43.100
Our interpretation is a decrease
in the binding of our ligand.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.840
That basically the more you
change, the more tired you are.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.000
It was completely
antithetical to everything

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.970
that we had ever reported,
and of course my brain

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.110
was hurting me.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.140
I mean, you cannot have two
things in the same place,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.330
there was no space.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.070
And then what about cognition?

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.500
And this was very
important because when

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.830
we've done the studies on
stimulant medications that

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.770
increase arousal, we
also have observed

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.470
that the extent to which
they increase dopamine,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.620
if you are sleep deprived,
they improve your arousal

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.240
and your cognitive performance.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.730
One of the tests
that we have been

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.190
using for many, many
years, in many laboratories

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.090
is very standardized, is
a visual attention task.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.950
Basically what you
are asked to do

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.030
is to pay attention initially
and it goes increasingly more

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.340
complicated, but you
start with a simple one.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.720
I said, OK, pay attention
to these blue dots here

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.280
and these blue dots there.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.055
And then the blue
dots start to move

00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:43.850
and I asked you where they are.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:50.180
So you have to focus attention
to basically remember where

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.490
they were located at the end.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.040
Then you go into three of
them, and then four of them,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.170
and then you can actually
monitor accuracy.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.100
We were doing this all these in
these rested or sleep deprived

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.910
people while they're
were the magnet.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.800
As you may imagine
these are the results

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.950
that correspond to the rested
verses the sleep deprivation.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.160
And as you may very,
very much predict,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.070
performance went down for the
sleep deprived because you

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.770
cannot sustain attention.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:23.550
The harder it is, the task, the
worse the performance becomes.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.540
So then we ask the
question, is this in any way

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.130
related to the changes in
dopamine that we observe?

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.800
And again, we had been
consistently observing

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.910
that the greater the
increases in dopamine,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.760
the greater the improvement
of performance when you did it

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.040
as a stimulant medication.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.510
And here we actually observe
exactly the opposite too.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.520
That greater the changes
in the binding, the greater

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.120
the decreases in the
binding of the ligand,

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.380
we interpreted to actually
mean that there was increases

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.450
in dopamine that worsened the
performance in those two areas.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.720
First of all, these
document that these changes

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.260
in the binding of the
ligand were important,

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.100
both for behavior as it relates
to the perception of arousal

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.080
and tiredness.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.680
But they were also important
for cognitive performance.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.500
When we go on and look
at the imaging studies

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:28.900
themselves with fMRI, we also
observe that indeed very much

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.200
the D2 receptor changes were
modulating their responses

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.890
on activation.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.280
But I don't want to
go into that because I

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.230
don't want to not
to be able to get

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.160
into that last part of my talk.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.690
So what we had
reported was there

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.440
you have this technique
that I was explaining.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.380
This is the raclopride when
the receptors are empty,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.990
it binds and you see
an image like this.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.170
When dopamine is occupied,
basically raclopride cannot

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.570
bind and it goes down.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.970
So that's when you
interpret it to suggest

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.730
there's a lot of dopamine
and it occupies the receptor.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.950
And that has been the main
hypothesis interpretation.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:14.310
But we did put, however,
we cannot actually rule out

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:18.480
the possibility that in sleep
deprivation decreases were due

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.670
to the fact that we have a
decrease a downregulation

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.540
of the levels of
dopamine D2 receptors.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.700
- Now, why we did
not postulate these

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.010
as the main
interpretation, which

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.440
of course, when you look
at things retrospectively,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.080
you say of course.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.720
It's of course, because
it's actuallr-- it

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.480
was the relationship with
behavior and cognition

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.510
was opposite to everything
else that we've seen.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.300
But the reason why I
say was not evident

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.250
is that as we look,
and we continue

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:57.690
to look at the modifications
of the signaling system

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.360
throughout the day,
or by drugs, we

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.590
tend to focus very much on
the effects of these stimuli

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.240
on the content of
the neurotransmitter.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.080
And we don't dwell
very much on the fact

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.740
that the expression pattern of
these receptors in the membrane

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.750
are very dynamic.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.550
And in fact, much more
that we tend to actually

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:26.200
identify as relevant, and
that is exactly why we mean,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.940
what I think is
the main reason why

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:34.180
we observe the particular
decrease in sleep deprivation

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.540
of the binding of the ligand.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.080
My brain is very obsessive.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.920
And it was [? scaring ?]
me, so I said, OK,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.310
let me try to disentangle
it because I couldn't--

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.770
I mean, this was something
I could not rule out.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.530
So we designed a
second study in which

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.670
we said, let's try to
differentiate that--

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.240
if sleep deprivation is
either increasing dopamine

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.740
or down regulating
dopamine D2 receptors.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.580
But how can you disentangle?

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.500
Because with these ligands, the
binding cannot differentiate

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.890
whether the receptors are
occupied or whether you have

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.020
less receptors.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.640
So we basically took advantage
also of methodologies

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.970
that we had developed
for other purposes.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.060
In our laboratory, we have
been extensively studying

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.830
methylphenidate.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.210
And actually, some of this work
was very much inspired by work

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.530
that [? Bertha Madras ?] and
[INAUDIBLE] [? Cadon ?] here

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.440
in Boston working with another
dopamine transporter blocker,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.040
which is cocaine.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.090
And what is interesting
about both cocaine

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.690
and methylphenidate is that they
block the dopamine transporter,

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.780
and since this is the main
mechanism for recycling

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.920
dopamine that is liberated
from that terminal

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.380
back again, dopamine
accumulates, and that basically

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.940
amplifies the signal.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.220
And hear me say it,
amplifies the signal.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.120
Cocaine and methylphenidate
are not stimulating it directly

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.480
the receptors.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.350
They're basically amplifying
that our own dopaminergic

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.090
signaling, by interfering
with that recycling.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.700
So we can use that
methodologically

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.850
as an experimental
strategy for past studies,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.990
where we wanted to
actually document

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.540
whether with this methodology
we could see changes

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.950
in dopamine produced by salient
stimuli that were not drugs.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.340
And so in 2002, for
example, we did a study

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.480
to try to determine if we could
see changes in raclopride when

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.140
we exposed people that
were food deprived

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.500
to visual stimuli of
very appealing food.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.810
And we observed that--

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.810
And that's what we call salient,
that we observed that they were

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.040
basically what appeared
to be a decrease,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.110
but this was not significant.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.200
So in order to
amplify the effect,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.230
we gave them methylphenidate,
and what you observe

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.510
is that methylphenidate
by itself

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.910
will decrease the binding,
but of course because it's

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.460
increasing dopamine,
or amplifying.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.680
But when you combine
methylphenidate

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.070
with a salient stimuli, the
visual stimuli for someone

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.470
that is food deprived,
you can actually

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.960
observe a significant effect.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.230
And this has been used also by
laboratory animal experiments,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.300
and we've used it
in other settings

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.830
to actually use the
methylphenidate to amplify

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.830
the [INAUDIBLE] signaling.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:34.600
So we then hypothesized
that if in fact, we

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.245
said if in sleep
deprivation, you

00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:39.880
are increasing
dopamine release, then

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.710
if you give
methylphenidate, you should

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.560
be able to see an
amplified response,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.470
because there's more dopamine
that's going to be released,

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.180
and this is going to be blocked.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.270
So you should be able
to see a greater signal.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.100
So we design,
again, an experiment

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.920
where subjects were brought
into the laboratory on two

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.300
different occasions.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.670
One of them, we kept
them in the laboratory

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.970
and ensure that they sleep
properly, and on another day,

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.130
we brought them also
the night before,

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.800
and ensure that they
did not fall asleep.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.860
The next day we test
them with raclopride

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.400
again, but this time twice,
first after a placebo

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.870
to see just the placebo effect,
and then 60 minutes later, we

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:24.610
gave them methylphenidate
and did another raclopride.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.350
And with that, ask the question,
under those conditions,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.360
are the increases
in dopamine produced

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.050
by methylphenidate larger
if you're sleep deprived?

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.420
Because you're amplifying
a greater signal or not.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.410
What are the results?

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.430
Well, let me first go to what
is the behavioral effects

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.590
of methylphenidate
and sleep deprivation,

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.830
because they are actually
quite interesting by itself.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.280
And again, we're seeing here
the measurements of sleepiness

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.800
or alertness, different types
for the rested waking state,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.690
and this is placebo
and in blue is

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:03.160
methylphenidate different
times after the administration.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.040
And again, I'll touch
bases on that, because this

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.300
is very consistent.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.540
When you are rested, and you
are given methylphenidate,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.110
it does not further
improve your alertness.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.490
You're already pretty
alerts so you just basically

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.380
have a ceiling effect.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.010
And also, if your
sleeping is very low,

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.390
methylphenidate doesn't do much.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.600
However, if you give
methylphenidate to someone that

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.580
is sleep deprived,
you can clearly

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.450
see a significant effect it
basically improves alertness,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:35.370
and it significantly
decreases sleepiness.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.620
And this is, again, one
of the concepts that

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.860
has led to that description
of the effects of stimulant

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.010
medications, like
methylphenidate or amphetamine

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.750
of being state dependent.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.570
Its effects are going to be
affected by the mental state

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.370
at which you are giving them.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.860
But what about the
changes in dopamine?

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.850
So these are the results,
and I'm showing them here

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.620
in a different format in a
format where I'm identifying

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.070
in the color scale
here, the areas where

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.960
raclopride binding was
decreased by that intervention.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.469
And again, our intervention
that we're comparing

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.989
is placebo versus
methylphenidate,

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.710
when you have slept very
nicely all night long,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.670
and placebo versus
methylphenidate, when

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.010
you have been sleep deprived.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:24.449
And here is when you have
been rested all night long,

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.545
and you see the changes in
all of the striatal areas.

00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:28.920
And that's where
you see and this

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.340
is the magnitude of the
change in the model parameter

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.750
that we used to quantify the
specific binding of our ligand.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.980
And this is where you have
it in sleep deprivation.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.570
Just visually you cannot
see any difference,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.330
and when you do statistical
tests to compare is there any

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.679
difference between the delta,
the changes in the restive

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.650
condition, versus the changes
proposed by methylphenidate

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.360
in the sleeping condition, none
of the effects are significant.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.170
So we were unable to
see any differences

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.380
in the magnitude of
the changes in dopamine

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.050
as a function of
sleep deprivation,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.880
and when we went
back and say OK,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.970
how does that then relate
to the changes in behavior

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.000
that we had previously
observed, in the case of sleep

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.810
deprivation before, again we're
documenting this completely

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.140
different response and
relationship to that behavior,

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.930
as well as a cognitive
actions, depending

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.860
on whether you are evaluating
the changes with sleep

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.940
deprivation, versus when you are
evaluating the changes produced

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.890
by methylphenidate.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.050
When you are evaluating
the changes produced

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.670
by sleep deprivation, that
larger the changes you produce,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.410
that lower the alertness.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.710
The larger the
changes you produce,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.810
the higher the sleepiness.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.860
In contrast, when you
give methylphenidate,

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.380
you are also dramatically
changing the raclopride

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.985
binding, but in this case
the higher that decrease

00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:03.640
is in the raclopride binding,
the greater the alertness.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.700
The higher that
decrease is in that

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:11.190
you have the raclopride binding,
the lower the sleepiness.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.220
It's basically two
opposite patterns,

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.910
which indicated to us that
it is likely to be reflecting

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.410
different physiological
processes.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.580
And that is ultimately the
way that we reported it.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.790
Now this is our studies
that we're doing in humans,

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:31.140
and as I very explicitly state,
the design of the experiment

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:36.060
was to actually determine if
we could detect differences.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.090
But we are always
have the constraint

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.900
of not being at the end of
the day, able to differentiate

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.540
directly with either
raclopride measure,

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.340
whether it is
changes on dopamine

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.580
or down regulation
of the receptors.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.200
So in parallel to
the studies, we

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.560
conducted microdialysis
experiments in rats,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.710
where you can actually
put microdialysis probe

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.220
into the striatal and monitor
the changes in dopamine.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.530
And in these animals,
we had two groups,

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.710
and we follow exactly the
same experimental paradigm.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.800
One group of animals was
sleep deprived, and the way

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.420
that you sleep deprive animals.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.630
It's extremely difficult to
make animals forgo sleep.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.500
So you have to put them in a
tiny little platform surrounded

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.050
by water, so that they
when they fall asleep,

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.960
they lose their reflexes,
and they actually immediately

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.360
wake up, because
otherwise they drown.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.030
So that is the way
that you sleep deprive.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.990
And the control
was the same setup,

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.970
but the platform
was much larger,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.290
so if the animals lose their
reflexes from the sleep,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.260
they can fall asleep, and then
we gave them methylphenidate,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.970
and we monitor the
changes in dopamine.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.910
And so we had the
controls in black.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.570
They are black.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.530
And we have the sleep
deprived animals in gray.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.460
And these are the
changes in dopamine

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.950
when we gave the
methylphenidate injection.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.280
And you can clearly see they
are basically identical.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.340
We were unable to see any
significant differences

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.250
in the magnitude of the
changes of dopamine produced

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.790
by methylphenidate indicating
that under sleep deprivation

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.800
conditions, it does
not look that there

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.480
is an increase in
dopamine release.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.650
And that is what
basically led us

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.280
to stay against that
traditional mode of thinking.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.740
And again, this is not
traditional mode of thinking.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.640
That sleep deprivation
appears to down regulate

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.370
the number of dopamine
D2 receptors, the levels

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.560
of receptors, dopamine
D2 receptors that

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.790
are in your brain.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.240
It decreases them.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.801
Now how does it do that?

00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:40.050
And that's where we are after.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.950
It's a very intriguing,
extremely interesting question.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.580
Is it just a normal process that
through circadian variability,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.610
those receptors
are internalized?

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.980
Or is there an active
effect of sleep

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.040
deprivation on bringing
those receptors down?

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.710
And again, it's something
that we have a protocol.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.690
I don't have data yet on that.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.900
But from the animal literature,
where of course, you

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.110
can learn an enormous
amount, studies

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:10.620
have shown something that
also has obsessed me now

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.930
for many, many years.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.580
When we are awake,
and the longer

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.920
we are awake, because our
neurons are very, very active.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.700
We want them to be active.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.080
You're actually
producing adenosine

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.780
as a function of
activation patterns.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.660
And the longer you are
awake, the higher the content

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.860
of adenosine in your brain.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.460
Adenosine then acts as
a neurotransmitter that

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.410
binds to adenosine receptors.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.350
We have three different
types of adenosine receptors

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:37.950
in the brain.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:43.110
The most notable are
adenosine A1 and adenosine A2.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:46.310
Extraordinarily important for
multiple things, and by the way

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.050
caffeine, the one
that I know, basically

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.480
blocks those receptors
and interferes

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.910
with the effects of adenosine.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.670
Adenosine in animal
models makes you sleepy.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.890
And in animal models
where you can genetically

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.740
remove one specific receptor,
adenosine one versus two,

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.240
it has been shown
that it is that it

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.910
is the removal of
the adenosine A2

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:10.750
receptor that is responsible for
the waking effects of caffeine.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.400
And what's interesting
about adenosine A2 receptors

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.380
is they are located exactly
in the same cells that

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.050
express dopamine D2 receptors.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.510
Not only that,
these two receptors

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.760
form what we call
our [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.190
They link with one another.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:32.340
And as they link, they influence
the affects of one another.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.930
When adenosine,
and this is again

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.710
[INAUDIBLE] in
animals, when adenosine

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:40.470
binds to this [INAUDIBLE],,
it binds to its adenosine A2

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.430
receptor.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.100
That promotes the
internalization

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.370
of the receptor.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.460
And this has been
reported in animals,

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.420
maybe one of the mechanisms by
which adenosine accumulation

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:57.200
may result in a down regulation
of dopamine D2 receptors.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:03.000
But this is again theoretical,
and my brain likes ideas.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.400
I mean, you come
up with an idea,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.110
you come up with an
explanation, and it

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:11.000
just keeps on bothering
me and sort of says

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.030
how do you test these
hypothesis of the raclopride

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.140
that in fact, with
sleep deprivation,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.880
you're actually down regulating
the levels of dopamine D2

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.270
receptors.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:24.200
And if these literature
in animals is correct,

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.710
then it follows the big
question that we all have.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.290
Why is caffeine
in general overall

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:33.480
quite effective in
improving alertness?

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.940
For many, many
years, investigators

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:40.050
were saying OK, caffeine
increases dopamine just

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:43.100
like other drugs of abuse.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.640
Well, the literature
didn't really show that.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.490
Most studies show that different
from cocaine, nicotine,

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.020
alcohol, marijuana, caffeine
does not increase dopamine

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.574
in the nucleus accumbens.

00:41:54.574 --> 00:41:56.740
There was one paper by
[? Sergie ?] [? Fered ?] that

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.740
said, yes, maybe,
no, I don't know,

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:05.370
but consistently it
doesn't show that.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.770
So then the question
is what does it do?

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.950
And so of course, my
brain was saying could it

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:14.210
be that it is actually
acting, caffeine

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.560
acts by interfering
with the down regulation

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.280
of that dopamine D2 receptors
with the sleep deprivation?

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.760
I said, OK let's do this study.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.590
Let's try to test it.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.470
So we perform a
study again using,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.640
the C11 raclopride
but in this case,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.320
instead of actually being
a, working with just two

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.160
people that were
rested wakefulness,

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.350
studied them with rock upright
with and without caffeine

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.710
and determine, well
why is it that caffeine

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.050
is going to be doing
to the availability

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:46.470
of those dopamine D2 receptors.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.830
And what we observe,
which was actually

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.360
very different from anything--

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.180
Oh my god, this has jumped
or is my imagination.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.670
Very different from
anything that we have ever

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.280
observed because when
we give methylphenidate,

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.200
we observe that it
increases dopamine,

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.540
and that's associated
with alertness.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.850
When we gave caffeine,
what we observe

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.430
was not that like
with methylphenidate,

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.050
raclopride went down.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.540
When we gave caffeine,
raclopride binding

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.200
went out throughout the dorsal
and the ventral striatal.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.660
And you have here the
individual data for all.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.040
It's quite significant.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.760
So what we are
observing it is actually

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.780
very likely that caffeine
is improving arousal,

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.940
is not increasing dopamine,
because otherwise we

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.480
would have observed a decrease
in the binding of the ligand.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.190
But on the other
hand, it seems to be

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.580
interfering with that down
regulation of the dopamine D2

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.670
receptors.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.510
Now with science, I think that
one of the interesting things

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.490
that I've learned
with science is

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.840
that I feel very strongly
that this is the explanation.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.700
But at the same time,
my brain, which never

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.400
stops saying well what about.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.230
I think that there is
another what about,

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:00.130
which is the possibility that,
when you form these [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.730
and you stimulate it, you
may not just internalize

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.980
that receptor, but
you also appear

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:11.060
to maybe affecting the binding
affinity of that receptor.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.650
So we cannot completely rule out
the possibility that it's not

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:18.160
just interfering with that down
regulation of the receptors,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:26.830
but also it may increased the
affinity of the D2 receptors

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.850
for raclopride.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:30.140
I don't think that's
the explanation,

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.660
but I have to basically
put it forward.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.900
Because there are
some that think

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.270
that this may be the case.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:40.380
And so throughout
all of these studies

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.960
that we have been doing
within the whole process

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.390
of understanding
the effects of sleep

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.150
in the dopaminergic system,
what we've come to realize

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.480
is that sleep deprivation
has a very profound effect

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.750
in down regulating levels
of dopamine D2 receptors.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.800
And for those in the
substance abuse field,

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.430
this is fundamental, because one
of the most consistent findings

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.430
that we observe in addiction
is that down regulation

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.810
of those dopamine D2 receptors.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.770
And in all animal models that
have been developed, whether it

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.790
is cocaine, alcohol, or
heroin, or even nicotine,

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.730
any intervention that
you do to decrease

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.010
the levels of
dopamine D2 receptors

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.610
makes those animals
much more vulnerable

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.980
for the rewarding
effects of the drugs.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.810
It makes them much
more vulnerable

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.680
for impulsive behaviors.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.890
And it makes them much more
vulnerable to compulsiveness.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:39.710
And again, highlighting that
intricate involvement of sleep

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.650
and its disruption
in addiction as part

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:46.590
of a fundamental component of
the pathology of addiction.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.270
And this data, of course,
is forcing us into looking

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.780
backward now into our
own resource and trying

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.060
to determine the extent
to which we have in many,

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.630
many independent studies,
in animals and in humans,

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:04.460
and so have others, consistently
documented that in addiction,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.280
there is a down regulation
of the dopamine D2 receptors,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.390
which we know, you can produce
in animals by giving them

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.500
repeatedly the drug, but what
we cannot rule out is that some

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.850
of those effects of down
regulation may be also driven

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:22.910
by the profound disruption
on sleep patterns in these

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.420
individuals.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.990
And again,
highlighting about why

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.840
focus on this area of
research is something

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.850
that we need to do
because it may also

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.550
be very relevant in
helping us design better

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.140
therapeutic interventions.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.530
But I don't want to
dwell anymore on this,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:43.310
and I want to go into the next
set of stories that we've done.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:45.880
Again, we haven't
published this data.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.070
It is now in press.

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:54.180
But it is something that
has started to obsess me

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.630
four years ago, and it
was motivated actually

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.890
by this paper that was published
by [? Niedergarde, ?] I think

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.410
it was 2014.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.120
This cartoon came
later, in which

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.790
they actually, this
investigator from Denmark

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:13.720
reported that what appeared
to be a new understanding

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.910
about the role of sleep.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.460
And the brain, what's
intriguing about the brain,

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.190
among many other things that
are intriguing about the brain

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:23.560
is that it doesn't have
a lymphatic system.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.310
Every single organ in our
body has a lymphatic system,

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:29.770
and it's a very important
system of blood vessels,

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.660
not blood vessels of
vessels, lymphatic vessels.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.110
What am I saying blood, they
are going to get offended.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:38.680
Lymphatic vessels that
allow you to get rid

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.320
of toxic substances that
are very, very important

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.690
for proper immune function.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.430
The brain doesn't have that.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.220
And this has of course
intrigued enormously research,

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.120
because this is--

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.710
we have the brain is the most
energetically demanding organ.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.440
So how is it getting rid
of all of those waste

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.300
material, toxic products?

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.110
So this paper for
[? Nedergaard ?]

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.600
documented a mechanism
by which they actually

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.890
are proposing that the brain
gets rid of some of these waste

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:09.850
problems.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.440
And they determined
that glymphatic system,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.670
lymphatic from the
lymphatic, but glymph,

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:18.840
because it's related
to glial cells.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.100
And what they
showed in rodents is

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:26.290
that during sleep or also
produce during anesthesia,

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:30.820
basically what happens is
that the space that surrounds

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.080
arteries is full of
cerebrospinal fluid,

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.520
and during sleep, cerebral
spinal fluid passes

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.200
from this very vascular space
into the interstitial space

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:52.030
in the brain through the glial,
which is facilitated and made

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.870
possible by the expression of
these transporters of water

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.410
that we refer to as aquaporins,
and specifically aquaporin

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:05.190
four, which is express on the
glial cells that basically

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.940
surround these blood vessels.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.840
And this allows for
cerebrospinal fluid

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.830
to go into the interstitial
space, and through convection,

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.920
flow, remove these
toxic materials that

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.300
end up back into the
perivascular space of veins,

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.350
and that ultimately drains
into the lymphatic system.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.170
And they also
pointed out something

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.830
that was to me also
incredibly intriguing.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:36.090
Using optical imaging, they
were able to document the fact

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.920
that when you are
asleep or in anesthesia,

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.600
that interstitial space, the
space outside of the cells,

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.600
is increased by 40% to
60%, as if the cells

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.740
themselves become smaller,
allowing for the extracellular

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.060
space to grow.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.650
And that facilitates the
flow of cerebral spinal

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.370
flowing and the clearance.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.080
And this completely
obsessed my mind.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.550
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.360
And I said oh my god
this is fascinating.

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.550
It's fascinating.

00:50:08.719 --> 00:50:10.260
And it was an
interesting phenomenon,

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.104
because I said, how do we
demonstrate this in humans,

00:50:13.104 --> 00:50:14.770
because no one has
shown this in humans.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.680
Was there any data to indicate
that something was out there?

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.170
We knew from studies that
have been done actually

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:29.970
in animals and humans
that the clearance of some

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:32.400
of these waste products, and
in particular a lot of work

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.300
has been done on beta
amyloid, because beta amyloid

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.720
is the precursor that
actually results in plaques.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.350
The amyloid plaques that
are basically responsible,

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.040
believed to be responsible
for Alzheimer's dementia.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.790
And it had been shown as for
some of these studies that

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:54.650
I'm looking at these, that
indeed when you, for example,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.850
sleep deprive animals, and this
is a fantastic study that was

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:03.560
published in 2009 in science,
and in this study that was done

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.580
in mice, they actually
demonstrate not only that

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:12.560
acute, but also chronic
sleep disturbances,

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.370
disruption in these mice,
significantly increases

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.200
the content of beta amyloid .

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.920
In this case, that we're
looking at the hippocampus.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.520
Very much, if you get
the animals to sleep,

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.340
you basically can
clear that beta amyloid

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.340
that occurs with a single
night of sleep deprivation.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:37.550
This is the data with
chronic sleep deprivation.

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.520
Human studies have looked at
the cerebral spinal fluid,

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.550
and then you can actually
measure the content of beta

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.970
amyloid, and in these studies,
they have also shown that

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.475
if you take a person-- this is
a study in 2014 at the same time

00:51:50.475 --> 00:51:52.266
that the paper for
[? Nedergaard ?] came up

00:51:52.266 --> 00:51:55.910
in science, that if you take
a person and you sleep deprive

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.650
them, you can actually--

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:00.290
Or even not sleep deprive them.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.540
If I measure your
cerebral spinal fluid,

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.900
I can do a lumbar puncture here,
extract cerebral spinal fluid,

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.570
and I measure your
beta amyloid content,

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.450
say at 6:00 PM,
7:00 PM, and then

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.825
I measure it in the
morning say at 9:00,

00:52:13.825 --> 00:52:17.750
10:00 AM, the content of
the cerebral spinal fluid

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.110
is going to be six percent
lower in the morning than

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:21.470
in the evening.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:24.980
Again, consistent with the
concept that during sleep, you

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.650
are clearing the beta
amyloid, and that

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:31.940
leads to then a lower reduction
in the content of CSF.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.400
And also a series
of imaging studies

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:39.590
have been done retrospectively,
using PET ligands that

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.920
are used predominantly for
the diagnosis of Alzheimer's

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.890
disease, on the basis that
these PET ligands bind

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.520
to beta amyloid.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.880
So you can use them
to actually quantify

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.837
amyloid burden in the brain.

00:52:51.837 --> 00:52:53.420
And of course, in
Alzheimer's disease,

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.490
you see a significant increase.

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:58.700
But if you take normal healthy
people of different ages,

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.030
studies predominantly done
in an elderly population

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.990
of healthy individuals has shown
that those individuals that

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.770
have inadequate sleep
patterns tended to have

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.350
higher content of beta amyloid.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.710
And again, there is now I think
four of these studies that

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:19.670
have been able to replicate
it retrospectively to indicate

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.300
to us that in animals, yes,
one night of sleep deprivation

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.139
did raise beta amyloid in
the brain of these mice

00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:27.930
in the hippocampus.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.300
It was something like 16 or 20%.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.580
It was a fairly large effect.

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.060
In the cerebral spinal
fluid, the effect of

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:38.550
sleep of decreasing
it by six percent.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.220
And this thought
then occurred to me,

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.659
and I was drinking
a glass of wine.

00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:43.700
I wasn't drinking coffee.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.830
I was drinking a
glass of wine, and I

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.250
was in one of my exuberant
moods, and I said aha,

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.180
now I know how to test it.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.840
I said in my brain,
I said, of course,

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.040
if the glymphatic system
operates in the human brain,

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.700
then it would follow that if
I take advantage of these PET

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.750
ligands that are being used to
measure beta amyloid in brain,

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:09.860
I should be able to document
that if I sleep deprive someone

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.990
just like the animal
experiments have shown,

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.990
I should be able to see an
increase of beta amyloid

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.040
in the human brain.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.390
And I was very excited,
and said oh, I have

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.392
a great idea blah, blah, blah.

00:54:21.392 --> 00:54:23.850
And I started then of course,
you do the literature search.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.394
You speak with the
experts that have

00:54:25.394 --> 00:54:26.560
developed these [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.460
And I said, Nora, it
is not going to work,

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.720
because the beta
amyloid PET ligands are

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.130
binding to insoluble
fiber, insoluble one.

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.030
That's plaque.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.160
And so I gave the idea.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.460
I was very depressed, and so
this 10 months, 12 months.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.579
And then I started to go
back to the literature

00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:47.120
and actually look
at the studies that

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.800
have looked at
people prospectively,

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.040
and something started to
bother me, started to bother me

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.800
because there was not
perfect reproducibility.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.310
And it's not that if you were
study six months apart or one

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.080
year apart, you always saw
an increase in the binding

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.980
of these ligands.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.810
In some instances, they
were going down, and I said,

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.640
could it be that they
are not as insoluble

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.200
as everybody is saying?

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.250
And sometimes, you just
have to bite the bullet,

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.780
and say I'm going
to take a risk.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.360
I said, OK.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.485
I'm going to take the risk.

00:55:13.485 --> 00:55:17.600
We put the protocol, and
through the IRB got approved,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.310
and we finally
finished the study.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.870
And I'm going to
show you the results.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.020
So our hypothesis were two.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:28.190
One of them is we use the
PET ligand, florbetaben,

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:29.780
which is one that
you can actually,

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.690
if you don't have a cyclotron
and the fancy laboratory,

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:36.200
you can actually order it
because it's used clinically

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.752
for diagnosing patients
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:55:38.752 --> 00:55:40.960
And so we said, we're going
to do a study which we're

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.390
going to measure florbetaben
binding in the human brain

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.430
under two conditions,
rested sleep

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.700
versus 24 hours of sleep
deprivation, all night sleep

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.020
deprivation, and see if
we're increasing the binding.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.520
And because the animal studies
had seen the largest effects,

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.270
we apriori predicted
that on the basis of what

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:02.850
we know from animal studies
that increases should be greater

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.270
in the hippocampus, and
also the hippocampus

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:08.390
is the area of the brain, one
of the most sensitive areas

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:11.080
of pathology of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.850
But we also wanted to see
if in our sample, which

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.490
was of younger individuals,
we could replicate

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.240
the prior findings that if
you have impaired sleep,

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.370
chronic impaired
patterns of sleep,

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:24.290
that will be associated
under baseline,

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:27.500
no sleep deprivation, just
baseline condition, higher

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.740
levels of beta amyloid.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.660
And so we recruited 20
healthy participants.

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.880
Each of them tested twice.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.340
After more or less 31
hours of sleep deprivation,

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.870
which again, we bring them
to the clinical center,

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.330
ensure that they sleep properly.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.610
We have polysomnography to
be sure that they are asleep.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.300
We wake them up in the morning
at the same time of the day,

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.000
and we do the florbetaben scan.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.050
We also measure their genes for
genotyping them for the APOE

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:59.400
genotype, because there's clear
data in [INAUDIBLE] controls

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.080
and in Alzheimer's patients,
that that genotype risk that

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.930
confers greater
vulnerability for Alzheimer's

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:10.220
also associated with a greater
vulnerability for accumulation

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.300
of beta amyloid in
the human brain,

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.620
particularly in
older individuals.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.240
And of course we monitor, we
record the patterns of sleep

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.230
and the effects of sleep
deprivation on their alertness

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.750
and mood.

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.420
The one what we observe, and
these are the data, is actually

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.880
speaks for itself,
and Dr. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.560
a fellow in my
laboratory was the one

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.080
that actually did these
very elegant analyses

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.230
and deserves all of the credit
for having develops over

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:45.560
such a sophisticated
pattern of analysis.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:50.460
And what he showed applying
a [INAUDIBLE] wide analysis

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.390
to the whole brain to try to
determine where there were

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.120
changes between
rested versus sleep

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.535
deprivation on the
accumulation of these ligand

00:57:58.535 --> 00:58:01.580
that binds to beta amyloid,
which showed basically

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.550
there were significant
increases in this cluster

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:09.100
of area of subcortical regions
that actually part of it

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.450
is encompassed within
the hippocampus.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:13.610
Not just in the
hippocampus, we also

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.425
see accumulation in the thalamus
and parahippocampal areas.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:22.820
Basically, I asked,
Ehsan, and I said Ehsan,

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.620
we're seeing it is
significant, and this

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:28.550
is significant of [INAUDIBLE]
for multiple comparisons,

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.000
but is it significant, is it
driven by a couple of subjects,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.550
or how consistent
is this findings?

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:38.210
So then he extracted
regions in the hippocampus,

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.790
and for each one
of them monitored

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.000
the values of the beta
amyloid PET ligand,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.250
at rested versus
sleep deprivation.

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:49.160
And you can basically
see consistently

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.420
for almost all
subjects there was

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.120
an increase in the binding
of the beta amyloid,

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.810
and this is one night
of sleep deprivation.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.580
And of course,
there was a couple

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.110
of people, where
you didn't see it,

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.970
but basically
consistently varies.

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:04.300
That's why it's so significant.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:08.270
And interestingly, in
the hippocampus that

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:11.420
changes the accumulation of
the beta amyloid with the sleep

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.460
deprivation,
[INAUDIBLE] hippocampus

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.380
was not associated
with sleepiness,

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.470
or decreased alertness,
or tiredness.

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:20.420
It was associated with
a decrease in mood.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.840
The greater the accumulation
of these beta amyloid

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:27.110
in the hippocampus, the
more irritable and dysphoric

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.040
the subjects felt.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.520
Something that I did not, and
we did not apriori expect,

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:39.940
and I'm putting it forward,
because we did observe,

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.150
was that it was only
significant in the right,

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.400
but not in the left hippocampus.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.680
I can give you an
explanation about why

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.540
that could be plausible, but
we didn't apriori propose that.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.150
That was an unexpected finding.

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:58.690
Now what about the effects,
not on sleep deprivation,

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.310
but the scans where
you are actually

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.400
at baseline for the
accumulation of beta amyloid

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:08.970
in the brain versus the hours of
sleep reported by the subjects.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:11.270
And what we observe
here, as well as

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:19.130
what are the effects of the
genetic risk based on the APOE

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.140
polymorphism, there
are two polymorphisms

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.710
there have been widely
investigated and associated

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:24.990
with that risk.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:28.460
So you can put weight on
those two polymorphisms

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.200
and based on that,
determine how do

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.010
they influence the
accumulation of beta amyloid?

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.340
And this actually
summarizes the findings.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.770
So these are the
areas in red where

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.020
there is an association
between higher

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:48.830
levels of beta amyloid binding
ligand, and less hours of sleep

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.320
reported by the subjects.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.920
So subjects that had
lower amounts of sleep

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.430
had higher accumulation
are beta amyloid,

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.250
in this area of the brain that
is called the precuneus, that

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.200
is very important,
extraordinarily

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.910
important for alertness.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:07.140
[INAUDIBLE] one of the areas
that is probably actually,

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.940
is not the area that shows
that's the first evidence

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.950
of dysfunction in
Alzheimer's disease.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.950
It's an area that's constantly
active all the time.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.480
It's basically one of the
main hubs of the brain,

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.790
and that's where you see
a higher accumulation.

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.480
You also see higher accumulation
in areas of the hippocampus,

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.310
and it's not exactly
the same region.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.610
There's some overlap with the
areas that we observe in acute

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:36.600
sleep deprivation, but you
cannot say it's the same,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.180
they are distinct areas.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.370
This pattern is
much more widespread

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.870
than what we observe with
acute sleep deprivation.

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:48.080
And it's also clearly
distinct for the pattern

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.386
that we observe an
association between the gene,

01:01:51.386 --> 01:01:52.760
risk allele, and
the accumulation

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.760
of beta amyloid, which
tends to involve much more

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.370
prefrontal cortical areas.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.620
And this just shows
that a shorter

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.020
the amount of sleep
hours that you reported,

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.540
the greater the accumulation.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.180
So what is it that we
conclude from this, that we

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.802
conclude for the first time.

01:02:10.802 --> 01:02:13.010
And I think that is something
that cannot be ignored.

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.490
One single night of
sleep deprivation

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:18.050
produces significant
increase on beta

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.950
amyloid in the human brain.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:23.640
Now, certainly,
what I would predict

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.550
that these would be the
follow up by experiment,

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.520
is that I predict that if you
allow these individuals to fall

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.900
asleep, you will be able
to clear the beta amyloid.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.970
In other words, it is not
irreversible harmful effect.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:44.380
That question emerges if you
chronically are sleep deprived,

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.440
is there a point that
constant accumulation

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.950
of the beta amyloid
starts to harm your brain?

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:52.930
And I think that
is the issue that

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:56.710
is most relevant as it
relates to prevention

01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:02.800
messages towards prevention
of Alzheimer's disease

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.160
and dementia.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.920
The importance of healthy
sleep habits in order

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.760
to preclude the accumulation
of beta amyloid.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.990
And I'm standing here
four years later,

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:21.700
when I basically was in
one of my flamboyant moods,

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.540
trying to figure out if we could
figure out a way of imaging

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.700
that glymphatic system.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.210
I cannot say that this reflects
that glymphatic system.

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:34.141
We postulate that the
accumulation is due to the fact

01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:36.640
that that glymphatic system may
have not worked because they

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.050
were sleep deprived.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:40.690
But from animal experiments,
we cannot neither rule

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:43.960
the possibility that there are
other mechanisms by which beta

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.870
amyloid is clear, number one,
and the other very important

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.210
factor is that when
you are sleep deprived,

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:53.380
you also have greater production
of neuronal toxic material,

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.720
so that may have led to
a greater accumulation.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.210
And we cannot
differentiate that.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:02.180
So we are still going
on, trying to figure out

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.390
a measure, an emerging
methodology, that

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:10.120
will allow us and enable us to
unequivocally say, yes, this

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.520
is evidence that there
is glymphatic function

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.120
in the human brain.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.090
But what I can tell
you from these studies

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:20.050
is this is clear evidence that
sleep plays an extraordinarily

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:22.810
important role, not
just on regulating

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:26.360
dopaminergic signaling, and that
driving motivation and reward.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.400
And we enforcement
but also very,

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.770
very importantly, in terms
of the capacity of the brain

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:40.420
to clear and renew itself after
a period of continued arousal,

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:44.770
and highlighting, again
why in many perspectives,

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:49.600
sleep has been a major
neglected subject of research,

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.160
but also major neglected aspect
of clinical interventions

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.760
or behavioral interventions
that could result in very

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.310
profound salutary effects.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:05.020
And with that, I do want to
thank, this is my group at NIH

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.450
and our imaging
group, who actually

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:11.720
were very, very creative
and does all of the work.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.850
This is Ehsan Shokri that
did all of the analyses.

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.900
We have been colleagues in
Brookhaven National Laboratory.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.630
He's fantastic.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:23.590
He can get things done that
nobody else in the world can,

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:26.140
and he has the capacity of
managing extraordinarily

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:26.860
difficult things.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.630
He's a nuclear
medicine physician.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:32.560
Dardo Tomasi is the physicist
of our group, and a lot of this

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.310
is related to instrumentation.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.440
Sunny Kim is our
radio chemist, also

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.920
can label things
that nobody can.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:48.880
And Baris Sukru, who's actually
from [INAUDIBLE] Turkish.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.170
And he also is a physicist.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:54.180
Ehsan is a bioengineering.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.510
Corinde Wiers,
which is phenomenal.

01:05:56.510 --> 01:06:00.730
She's just a dynamo, and
she's a neuropsychologist.

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:03.812
And this is our
extraordinary nurse

01:06:03.812 --> 01:06:05.770
that comes in the middle
of the night to ensure

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:08.950
that people are staying awake.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:13.120
And this is Peter Manza,
our newest post doc,

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.580
and just keep an eye on
them because they are really

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.820
extraordinary stars, and you
will be hearing more and more

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.690
on them.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:22.600
So I'm very, very lucky to
have such a fantastic team,

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.313
and I want to thank you
all for your attention.

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:43.740
- What a wonderful talk.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.090
My name is Bob Tockgold.

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:48.030
I'm director of the Center
for Sleep and Cognition

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:52.440
at Harvard Med, and I just
am so delighted that you're

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.830
working to increase
awareness and knowledge

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:58.626
about sleep and sleep
deprivation, try

01:06:58.626 --> 01:07:00.000
to get us past
that point of view

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.090
that sleep is just
to cure sleepiness.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:07.100
But I had a couple of
questions, which I wrote down,

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.850
so I'd remember.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:14.260
So our D2 receptors go down
with sleep deprivation.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:19.920
And then you take caffeine,
and that stops it, right?

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.530
You do this.

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:21.430
I don't drink coffee.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.730
But you get a cup of
coffee, and in a half hour,

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.590
you feel better,
and in a half hour,

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:28.915
you're not having any effect
on that internalization

01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:31.080
rate, right?

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.350
- Well to me, the
effects of caffeine last

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.330
like eight or 10 hours.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:39.120
So as a result of that,
as much as I love coffee,

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.848
I cannot drink anything
after 10:00 AM.

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:47.090
In fact, sometimes if I
drink a lot of coffee,

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:49.350
it interferes with my
sleep during the night.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:51.330
I wake up very, very early.

01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:53.190
So I don't know that it is--

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:55.920
I mean, certainly
such a short effect.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.320
I think that nobody has
studied, and it's likely

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.790
that there's
tremendous variability

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:03.890
because there are people to whom
caffeine doesn't do anything.

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:05.910
And the duration of
those effects also vary.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:08.820
And as you know, the other
aspect that is very relevant

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.980
is you become tolerant to
the effects of caffeine

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.162
very rapidly.

01:08:12.162 --> 01:08:14.120
And so the question when
you are discussing it,

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.460
you become tolerant to it,
what does it really mean?

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.620
Do you actually interfere
with the formation

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.370
of those [INAUDIBLE],, so
that you no longer can

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:25.702
interfere with the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:26.660
It hasn't been studied.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:31.569
Because we just
did one time point,

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:35.510
and I cannot tell you
how long it would be.

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:37.020
It would be actually
very intriguing

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.020
to look at how long it
takes to get back to that.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.479
No one has looked at that.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:44.859
There is a group in Europe
that actually also show

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.399
exactly the same thing,
adenosine caffeine,

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.770
bringing up those
receptors, both like us,

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:54.263
they didn't follow it up
to see how long that lasts.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:54.941
- Thank you.

01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:56.399
And then the second
question I just

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:01.990
have to ask you is [INAUDIBLE]
stimulation and glial affects

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:04.020
the relationship to Alzheimer.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.741
Do you know this story?

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:06.240
- I'm sorry.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.850
I didn't catch that question.

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:08.350
- Sorry.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:14.580
There's data now that if you do
40 Hertz transcranial electric,

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.640
that you can affect
the levels of A beta?

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.120
- There is an enormous
amount of interest of course

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:26.310
to try to use different
strategies to on the one hand

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:30.930
get rid of beta amyloid, and
then the other one to stimulate

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:33.380
neuronal systems, so
that, because that's

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:39.270
another proactive, protective
effect towards dementia.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:43.260
Another one is to improve
blood vessels and circulation

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.590
to also help it.

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:51.210
So all of these are
interesting strategies.

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:56.220
As of now, the evidence
has not been strong enough

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.020
to say this is something
that we should move forward

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.400
that will get an indication.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.510
What I would move
forward, though,

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:07.830
based on these data and
the data from others,

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.950
is that probably one of the
most important prevention

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.500
interventions that you can
do against Alzheimer's is

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.293
to try to ensure that
you sleep properly.

01:10:16.293 --> 01:10:16.793
- Thank you.

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:22.530
- Hi, my name's Scott
[? Becket. ?] I'm

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:24.720
a registered polysonographic
graphic technician

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.480
at the Brigham Young
Women's Hospital Division

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.340
of Sleep Medicine.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.890
And I also have done a
lot of volunteer work

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:34.750
with alcoholics and addicts
over the past five years.

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:40.890
And I think that your studies
on the reward system of drugs

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:44.310
of abuse is
interesting, but it just

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.020
brought out the
first question, which

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.350
is why is it then that when
people are removed from drugs

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:52.720
for an extremely long period
of time, decades even,

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.440
they'll still want to
go back to those drugs

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.010
and be addicted to them just
as bad as they were decades

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.780
before?

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:06.190
- That element which is
basically called conditioning

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:11.980
has been widely investigated
very elegantly in animals, also

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.440
in humans, but in
animals you can actually

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.590
be able to discern which
are the proteins that

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:20.380
are responsible for these
long lasting effects,

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.000
and this entails when
you stimulate with drugs

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.940
or any stimulation
that is very powerful,

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.660
you actually create an
activation of the D1 receptor

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.690
system that creates a memory.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:37.180
And the way that that
memory is created basically

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.110
strengthens the connectivity
between synapses,

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.390
and the synapses that
have been most studied

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:46.210
where this is strengthened
is glutamatergic excitatory

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:47.380
synapses.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:51.700
And that strengthening
involves on the one hand,

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.760
expression of different
type of receptors,

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.010
and degradation of others.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:59.860
So you change the composition
of those receptors,

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:03.010
and the complexity of
those synapses also

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.060
morphologically changes.

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.420
And that is quite long lasting.

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.340
So those phenomena
persist way after you've

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.460
stopped taking the
drug, and by themselves,

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.460
when you get exposed to
an environment where you,

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.220
in the past or an
emotion that in the past

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.550
had led you to
associate with drugs,

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.650
immediately create a memory.

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.930
So you stimulate
the system, and that

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.850
foregoes the frontal cortex.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:32.959
It's like when you touch
something that is hot

01:12:32.959 --> 01:12:34.250
that you immediately remove it.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.580
It's an automatic response.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.440
That's one of the most
challenging aspects

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.150
that we see in addiction
that you have these modified

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:46.000
learning pathways
that can trigger

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.870
the behavior on
the conditions that

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:53.690
emulate the prior experiences.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:57.050
And because a lot of people that
are taking drugs cannot control

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.260
necessarily when they are
going to be exposed to a very

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.350
stressful environment, that
puts them at a tremendous amount

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:05.960
of risk of relapse, or
they cannot really escape

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.820
their environments.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.240
So that initially is
mediated by dopamine,

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.720
but it is consolidated by
glutamatergic system as well

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.550
as other neurotransmitters.

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:19.624
- Well, that actually leads
me to my second question.

01:13:19.624 --> 01:13:22.040
You were talking about how
they can control their exposure

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.350
to stressful environments.

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:29.590
And I found your second
topic on the beta amyloid

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:31.690
and the glymphatic
system, I thought

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:33.190
you were going to
tie them together,

01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:35.398
because in my experience
with alcoholics and addicts,

01:13:35.398 --> 01:13:39.580
there's a lot of caffeine
abuse, nicotine abuse, long term

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:44.470
poor sleep hygiene, and kind
of destructive behaviors,

01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:45.400
even without drugs.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.740
They persist long
into their life,

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:52.660
even after they've
been sober for years.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.810
Could that long term
poor sleep hygiene

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:59.180
and all these other things
I just described lead

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:03.440
to some sort of build up of
beta amyloid chronically, which

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.540
causes a chronic decrement in
mood and then leads to relapse?

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.800
- And that same question has
started to emerge in my brain.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.000
I mean, and if you
look at the literature,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.840
though, there's
very little there.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.070
There is an association
of higher risk of dementia

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:22.220
with alcohol, but if you
look at the carefully,

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.440
the problem with all of
these studies on drugs

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.930
is these drugs are profoundly
damage blood vessels.

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:30.330
And it depends on which one,
and certainly for example,

01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:31.940
in the case of the
stimulant drugs

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:35.680
like methamphetamine or
cocaine or even cannabis,

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.960
and that they also have
inflammatory processes.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.770
So you could be producing
cognitive damage and dementia

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.630
through this
vascular phenomenon.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:47.030
You could also, by
disrupting sleep,

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:49.340
put them at greater
risk of accumulation,

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.200
but it hasn't really
been studied at all.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.220
And I do think it's
an important question.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.650
Because I don't have
any data, I don't

01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:01.530
feel in any way to say I mean
this could be a risk factor.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:04.490
I think that we need to
conceive that it could be,

01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:07.190
because it is having
multiple effects that

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:09.890
are harmful to the brain,
including sleep disruption,

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:13.850
but also markedly damaging
perfusion into the brain, which

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:16.820
is another factor that increases
your risk for dementia.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.070
- I just want to clarify.

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:21.440
I wasn't talking about the
build up of beta amyloid

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.000
from long term drug use.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.980
I was talking about
when they were

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:29.150
off of the drugs in question
for a long period of time,

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.360
they continued to with
unhealthy sleep behaviors,

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.783
and that led to the build up.

01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:33.510
- I follow.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:37.880
I do, but the bottom line is
we don't have any studies that

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.550
have looked at it.

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:42.740
- Thank you.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.610
I'm just wondering
whether or not

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:47.510
sleep deprivation with
psycho simulations,

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:51.350
such as cocaine,
amphetamines, would give rise

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:56.480
to theoretically a higher level
of accumulation of beta amyloid

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.610
compared to other
addictive drugs,

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:03.490
such as benzodiazepines
or even heroin,

01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:08.549
which are more sedating, as
well as partially euphoriant?

01:16:08.549 --> 01:16:10.340
- [INAUDIBLE],, which
can also be sedating.

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:10.670
- Yes.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:11.000
- Yeah.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.480
- Yes.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.146
- I think it is an
interesting question,

01:16:13.146 --> 01:16:15.890
and you know, and again,
one of the concepts

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:18.720
that I was in my flamboyant
mood, I was sort of basically,

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.291
this happened at
an ACMP meeting.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.040
that's why I was
drinking a glass of wine.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.330
I remember very clearly.

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:24.860
It's interesting
how you remember

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.100
certain moments, when I
thought about this experiment.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.370
And then I said,
well, ha, ha, what

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:33.050
we should do for
the helping treat

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:35.240
patients with
Alzheimer's dementia

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.860
is we put them in a coma.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.830
We put them to sleep
for five days, right?

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:41.100
Let them clear their brain.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:46.280
And I was saying it of course
under alcohol intoxication,

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.020
because one glass
will do it for me.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.810
But I think that
this is actually,

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:53.250
I do think it is
a valid concept,

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:58.070
and if we understand it
better, could we then

01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.490
actually design
interventions, and again

01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:03.380
you have to be cautious,
because if you put someone

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.950
on anesthesia to try to,
because in the animals, they

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:09.050
lymphatic system
works with anesthesia.

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:11.930
But we also know that
anesthetics themselves may have

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:14.400
cognitively impairing effects.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.250
So we need to understand
what are the drugs,

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.830
and there are multiple
process and darkness

01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:22.550
that we don't really know
very well before we come up

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:26.110
with an intervention.

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:28.510
- Hi.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:32.350
I was noticing that when you
talked about sleep deprivation,

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:33.970
and being able to
clear the brain,

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:36.870
you were basing it on
number of hours of sleep.

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:39.760
And I was wondering
what work had been done,

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.340
looking at sleep
apnea and its effect.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:50.060
- Yeah, no, and I think
that there would be data.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.841
Sleep apnea is one of the
factors that puts you--

01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:55.090
It's considered, I think,
it's one of the factors that

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:58.780
is consider at put you at
higher risk of dementia,

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.980
but I mean this is the first--

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:07.510
The stories that have reported
on chronic sleep restriction,

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:10.000
the first one was the
group in Baltimore

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.820
the premier program at
the Aging Institute,

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:16.810
which was something
like three years ago,

01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:20.980
have been done on prospective
studies that are following

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.950
these individuals.

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:26.050
But no one that I
know, not on the paper

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.780
that certainly that
has specifically

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:32.807
studied that severity
of the sleep apnea

01:18:32.807 --> 01:18:35.140
under those conditions with
respect to the beta amyloid.

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:39.730
But I'm going to check and do a
Pub Med, because there may be,

01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:41.664
and I just don't know.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.076
- Good morning somewhere.

01:18:48.076 --> 01:18:48.950
I have two questions.

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:51.620
My first is a yes/no question.

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.420
Is there any data
that meditation

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:57.050
may provide a
close approximation

01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:03.670
to sleep when it comes to
detoxification of the brain?

01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:06.900
I know the glymphatic
model is relatively new,

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.490
but that's just
my first question.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:11.600
- No data.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.520
- OK.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.310
- You said yes/no.

01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:14.300
No data.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.350
Two words.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:20.700
- Number two, so I guess there's
been 30 or 40 years in Europe

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.790
with the clinical
use of racetams

01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:26.300
to address age associated
memory impairment

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.860
and neurodegeneration.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:31.200
I'm wondering what
your take is on that.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.420
Although it is certainly not
an FDA approved approach.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.630
- Yeah, I mean this is
one of the mechanism,

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:42.980
and we do know that the
cholinergic system is also

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.200
extraordinarily
important in sustaining

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.560
sleep and arousal, and one of
the diagrams that I have there,

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.450
you have the
monoaminergic system,

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:53.400
and then you have the
cholinergic system.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.960
And they do regulate, and they
basically modulate alertness,

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.990
but they also modulate memory.

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:03.440
So the extent to which we
can try to explain everything

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.400
under one particular model,
I think it's very simplistic,

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.000
and I would be surprised
if there are not

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.350
other interventions.

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:15.170
And again, I haven't
spoken either

01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:16.910
about the adrenergic
system, which

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:18.960
is also very important
for giving you

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.930
a sense of overall alertness.

01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:28.100
So we identified in
this very specific case

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.310
the role of sleep
deprivation and sleep

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:35.390
as it relates to the
clearance of beta amyloid.

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:37.580
We know that
noradrenergic system

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:40.560
is crucial for enabling sleep.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.670
So if you stimulate
the local [INAUDIBLE],,

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:46.180
those animals are
not going to sleep.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.160
And in fact, one of the
anesthetic agents they use,

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:53.084
the [INAUDIBLE],, is
basically interfering--

01:20:53.084 --> 01:20:54.542
it's one of its
mechanism of action

01:20:54.542 --> 01:20:57.950
is it blocks
noradrenergic signaling,

01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:01.460
and it actually promotes very
nicely that lymphatic system.

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.460
And you can interfere
with some of these effects

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:07.020
by blocking the
adrenergic receptors.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:10.390
And I'm just bringing it up
because the cholinergic system,

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:13.420
the [INAUDIBLE] system,
which is highly loaded

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.870
in the thalamus and other very
important alerting systems.

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:19.900
So I don't want in
any way to just say

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.970
this explains all this,
this explains clearly.

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.120
It documents that
sleep deprivation

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.050
can lead to beta amyloid
accumulation, which basically

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.510
in my brain, suggests that
one of the roles of sleep

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:33.170
is clearance.

01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:35.410
It also shows from
our first studies

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:40.930
that another role of sleep
is to basically modulate,

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:44.710
in this case, dopaminergic
neurotransmission

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.950
throughout the day,
to ensure that there's

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:50.700
an optimal range of activity.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.700
So those are two things
that we've demonstrated,

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.380
but I would be surprised that
there's not many more things

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.930
to discover in the sleep space.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.270
- Please join me in thanking Dr.
Volkow for a wonderful lecture.

01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:15.735
Now, I know you can't wait
to go home and go to sleep.
