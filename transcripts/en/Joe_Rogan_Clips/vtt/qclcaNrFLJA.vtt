1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
From who's done a lot of music publishing.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.570
And then when I start talking about topics,

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.720
have a black woman and Jennifer Farmer who's a great publicist,

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.810
but she's also a publicist for like former senator of Ohio,
Nina,

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.820
Nina Turner in Mega Church pastors.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.630
So she knows she's helping me keep my image clean.
But you know,

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.680
she doesn't want me getting on television,

8
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.730
talking about doing cocaine and smoking joints and I don't do cocaine.

9
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:22.740
But it's like if I go to Columbia,
I do coat and she's just,

10
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.220
you could just see her face st behind.
She's going,
oh my God.
And you know,

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.460
churches are calling.
They're like,
this guy supports ar 15 so,

12
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.520
so I thank you Jennifer for you for tolerating.
He should put,

13
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.820
she's got to understand that.
That's also a part of why people like you.
Yeah,

14
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:39.630
she does it,
you know,
it's just,
it's just something to deal like that at work.

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.930
I get it.
I wouldn't want to be here,

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
but you have to do what you do.
Like that's probably what makes you fun.

17
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.510
Absolutely.
You know,
know what they're going to get,
what the,
what it is.

18
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.130
No filter.
Yeah,
you got it,
man.
You got somebody has to,

19
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.770
somebody has to shake the box a little bit.

20
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.070
Somebody has to be the kid that's willing to poke the Hornet's nest just to see

21
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:05.070
how many are flowers.
You know,
my two of my greatest heroes,

22
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.490
when black people usually talk about heroes,
right?
We talk about Martin,

23
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.900
Malcolm [inaudible],
Elijah Muhammad,
Mario,
Marcus Garvey,
then,

24
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.610
but two of my biggest heroes coming up,

25
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.990
we're Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt,

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.140
right?
Because in my lifetime I saw Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt fight the

27
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.680
government on behalf of the American people's right to say whatever they want it

28
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.290
to say.
So at the same time,
in my formative years,

29
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.080
I was learning to love the bill of rights,
the preamble,

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.540
and you had to say its constitution,
constitution.

31
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.020
I got a chance to see people fight for my right.

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.830
And I couldn't wait to be a rapper,
just soccer curse and by my own titty books.

33
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.240
And those people have shaped my life in terms of love,

34
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.360
of freedom and liberties as much as the Thurgood Marshall,
you know,

35
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:55.440
as as much as,
uh,
as much as a Barbara Jordan as much as a,
as a Shirley Chisholm.

36
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.920
So for me,
who I am as needed,
you know,
it's an,
I remember one of my friends say,

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.080
Mike,
I like the fact you're talking on social issues.
Um,

38
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.870
but why do you always feel necessarily talk about smoking Weed and Strip clubs?

39
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.310
I say,
because that's what I really do.

40
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.820
And I never want someone to be able to from the other side to say,

41
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.310
don't like this guy because he smokes marijuana,
goes to strip clubs.

42
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.260
I want whoever they say that to to say,
yeah,

43
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.910
and he goes with his wife and they smoked together.

44
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.580
I don't want it to be some secret I keep,

45
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.950
I want people to understand that when I want you to be free,

46
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.760
I don't want you to be free to agree to see the world the way I do.

47
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.040
I want you to be free to live as you would like to live.

48
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.310
So long as it doesn't infringe on me and others that's supposed to be with this

49
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:35.100
is all bout that.
Yeah.
It's supposed to what this country's all about.

50
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.580
That's what Miss Ellen said.
Told him.
Yeah.
In high school.
Well,

51
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:42.150
the Luther Campbell thing was so strange because it was at one area in Florida,

52
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:45.390
right where they had brown strick brass blasphemy laws.
Yeah.

53
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.320
They've tried porn stars there before.
Yeah.

54
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.870
He tried some male porn stars doing some really fucked up videos.

55
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:55.700
They tried him down there for,
for obscenity and they had them locked up.
They,

56
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.620
they,
you know,

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.340
it's very conservative and they had just decided that the two live crew was just

58
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.070
too much.
They are willing,
they were drawing a line in the sand.
Huge.
But it was,

59
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.510
it's a crazy thing to do when something's very popular,
you know,
like,
yeah,

60
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.770
if you're not,
but you know,
they,
they also make examples out of the popular.
Yeah.

61
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.130
I just found out what the what the monkey on a stick thing,
man.

62
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.160
With what apparently monkeys an idiot while out.

63
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.580
So farmers will kill unlucky and put his head on six other markets and all,
hey,

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.870
this is dangerous to do.
Right?

65
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.460
So essentially famous people you meet you Luther Campbell,
Lenny Bruce,

66
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.230
you know Rodney Dangerfield,
Andrew Dice,
clay,
Richard Pryor,
anymore.

67
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
What you become is something to symbolize what will happen if you dare step out

68
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.650
of line of social order.
So you,
your head being on a stick is,

69
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.540
it's less about actually charging you for crimes and more about keeping the rest

70
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.890
of the public and fierce and lynching.

71
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.890
And a lot of times we don't want to say that,
but it really is.

72
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:51.370
You know what I mean?

73
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.590
So do you think they see something like two live crew come up?

74
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:56.860
They never had a rap band like a nanny kind of band like two live crew right

75
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.240
there.
Word what's next?
So exact the shit in the bud.
Let's nip it in the bud.

76
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.170
Put the head in the stuck.

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.560
Put their head on the stick right there in the yard and thank God Luke fault.

78
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.390
I can remember a channel two or five ABC or CBS.
And they were,
they were,

79
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.620
they were getting off the plane and my town,

80
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:17.590
and I'm a kid watching this white up 1213 years old and the news reporters just

81
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.070
went timmsy style.
Just put it in their face and I can remember brother mark,

82
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:25.000
he's just pulling up a playboy magazine and the titties being right there on the

83
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:29.380
screen.
I'm like,
yes,
because it's lot of ta and report aldols dropped the camera,

84
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.570
you know,
trying to get it out.
But that's what,

85
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.150
that's what made me love the United States constitution when it matters the

86
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.910
freedom of speech because I got a chance to see it fought for an exercised right

87
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.210
there before me as I was learning about it isn't an interesting that really what

88
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.070
we're concerned with too is visuals.

89
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.700
We're not concerned with what people write down,
what we're concerned with,

90
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.250
what people say,
but we're not like he,

91
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.190
you could write that in a book and no one what?

92
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.040
You could write his lyrics in a book and no one would get mad at that,

93
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.340
at that book.
Something about them singing it and people singing along to it.

94
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.750
Yeah.
People are like,
this is it.

95
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.750
We gotta we gotta stop civilizations falling apart.
We've got to stop this.
Yeah.

96
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:09.460
Well I mean,
you know,
songs,
vibrations,
humming,
you know,
meditation,
your Hump,

97
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.410
you know,
that rhythm changes things,
you know,
it opens your mind.
It clears you.

98
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.420
You know what I mean?
It had it not,
you know,

99
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.280
had it not been for an artist like little Kim,

100
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.040
would you have feminism and the way you have now,

101
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.760
would you have women gladly celebrating their sexuality and bodies if it wasn't

102
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:26.290
for her?
She never gets the credit.

103
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.970
Do you think people know how extravagant she was and her time?

104
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.490
I think she doesn't get the credit she deserved.

105
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:38.170
I think women know that it became safe for them to be sexually aggressive and

106
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.920
free because of her,
the women that you know were coming of age yet in our time.

107
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.720
But I don't think in retrospect,
because wraps young,
you know,

108
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.510
it's only 45 46 years old.
I don't think that,

109
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.990
I just think it's getting to the point where we appreciate what we've,

110
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.200
what we've accomplished.

111
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.130
So a little Kim is going to become more celebrated as the years go on her.

112
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.020
You know,
Kaia choice.

113
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.800
He boss like so many hip hop has been a very fair game.

114
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.030
The women are very long time.
You know what,

115
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.510
whether people want to know it or not,
you know,
you have,

116
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.700
you've always had to call her response records in hip hop.

117
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.400
I get on there and the baddest mother fucker in the world and then a girl pops

118
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.890
up behind you now mother fucker on battery.
You know what I mean?

119
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.500
Those records have been around forever,
so they've,

120
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.940
we've always promoted equality within because it made money.
It made sense.

121
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.710
And women with the audience too.
