when we think about Android apps running

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680
when we think about Android apps running
 

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.000
when we think about Android apps running
on the desktop Chrome OS is is what we

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.010
on the desktop Chrome OS is is what we
 

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.800
on the desktop Chrome OS is is what we
do but also we work very closely with

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:58.810
do but also we work very closely with

built into that product so expecting to
 

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.830
built into that product so expecting to
see more and more of that desktop

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:04.840

and that is very very similar

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:10.570

essentially Android apps running inside
 

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.990
essentially Android apps running inside
a desktop environment so that's some of

a desktop environment so that's some of
 

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.980
a desktop environment so that's some of
the reasons why we think this is

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:16.990
the reasons why we think this is
 

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.720
the reasons why we think this is
important for developers the types of

apps though can be different so for me
 

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.000

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.890
phone I tend to use it in short bursts
and when I pay for apps on mobile I tend

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:31.900
and when I pay for apps on mobile I tend
 

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.960
and when I pay for apps on mobile I tend
to spend just a few dollars but on

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:33.970
to spend just a few dollars but on
 

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.600

hours at a time and I'm happy to spend
 

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.690
hours at a time and I'm happy to spend
up to a few hundred dollars because

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:42.700
up to a few hundred dollars because
 

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.310
up to a few hundred dollars because
often the usage is professional in

some apps don't use real estate like
they should on a wider screen so this is

windowing

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:49.190
windowing
 

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:53.980
windowing
so Chrome OS like most desktop operating

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:53.990
so Chrome OS like most desktop operating
 

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.170

window size equals the display size
 

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.110
window size equals the display size
which makes complete sense on a regular

desktop is multitasking and in this case

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:23.140
desktop is multitasking and in this case

the window size probably doesn't equal

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:26.630
the window size probably doesn't equal
 

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:30.850
the window size probably doesn't equal
the display size so apps need to

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:30.860
the display size so apps need to
 

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.970
the display size so apps need to
understand that so when an input is

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:33.980
understand that so when an input is
 

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.150
understand that so when an input is
coming into the app if the input is

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160
coming into the app if the input is
 

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.800
coming into the app if the input is
being read with respect to the display

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:38.810
being read with respect to the display
 

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.900
being read with respect to the display
size and the output is being pushed out

with respect to the apps position that
can create input offset errors so that's

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:45.980
can create input offset errors so that's
 

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.310
can create input offset errors so that's
just an example of some of the kinds of

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:48.320
just an example of some of the kinds of
 

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.100
just an example of some of the kinds of
things to watch out for because of the

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.110
things to watch out for because of the
 

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.810
things to watch out for because of the
windowing system so just being careful

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:52.820
windowing system so just being careful
 

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.830
windowing system so just being careful
to to read and ensure that input and

with respect to the same artifacts that
will help eliminate those kinds of

will help eliminate those kinds of
 

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:11.290
will help eliminate those kinds of
errors so finally a keyboard pointer and

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:11.300
errors so finally a keyboard pointer and
 

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.160

lots of common States here that are kind
 

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.040
lots of common States here that are kind
of uncommon on mobile so for example

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:24.050
of uncommon on mobile so for example
 

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.320
of uncommon on mobile so for example
hover States I see your tooltip within

an app it's an sorry I see an icon
 

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:29.830
an app it's an sorry I see an icon
within an app and I want to know what

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:29.840
within an app and I want to know what
 

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.290
within an app and I want to know what
that does I can hover over it and get a

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:32.300
that does I can hover over it and get a
 

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.820
that does I can hover over it and get a
tooltip on desktop which helps me

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:33.830

swiping to dismiss that's really common

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920
swiping to dismiss that's really common
 

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.830
swiping to dismiss that's really common
on mobile and very natural so your an

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:44.840
on mobile and very natural so your an
 

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.740
on mobile and very natural so your an
email app or a reminder that for example

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:47.750
email app or a reminder that for example
 

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.260
email app or a reminder that for example
and I swipe away to dismiss on desktop

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:50.270
and I swipe away to dismiss on desktop
 

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.240
and I swipe away to dismiss on desktop
that's kind of weird because you have to

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:52.250
that's kind of weird because you have to
 

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.130
that's kind of weird because you have to
select it and drag it to the side with a

select it and drag it to the side with a
 

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.330
select it and drag it to the side with a
mouse or a touchpad so understanding how

the usage patterns change as you go from

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:00.890
the usage patterns change as you go from
 

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:03.600
the usage patterns change as you go from
one form factor to another will help

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:03.610
one form factor to another will help
 

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.800

developers build an app will help you

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:05.810
developers build an app will help you
 

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.510
developers build an app will help you
build an app that works in both of these

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520
build an app that works in both of these
 

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.320
build an app that works in both of these
cases and those updates can be really

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.330
cases and those updates can be really
 

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.990
cases and those updates can be really
simple so this is flack when we worked

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000
simple so this is flack when we worked
 

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.640
simple so this is flack when we worked
closely with the slack team on ensuring

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:15.650
closely with the slack team on ensuring
 

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.190
closely with the slack team on ensuring
that app works really well on Chrome OS

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200
that app works really well on Chrome OS
 

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.780
that app works really well on Chrome OS
so if you're in slack and you want to

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:19.790
so if you're in slack and you want to
 

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.890
so if you're in slack and you want to
send a message originally before we went

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:23.900
send a message originally before we went
 

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.600
send a message originally before we went
down the path of working with them you

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:25.610
down the path of working with them you
 

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.980
down the path of working with them you
would enter a message inside the app

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:26.990
would enter a message inside the app
 

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.950
would enter a message inside the app
running on Chrome OS and hit enter here

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960
running on Chrome OS and hit enter here
 

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.980
running on Chrome OS and hit enter here
and it would give you a carriage return

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:31.990
and it would give you a carriage return
 

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:35.500
and it would give you a carriage return
so simple change hitting enter here now

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:35.510
so simple change hitting enter here now
 

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.440
so simple change hitting enter here now
sends the message it just helps that app

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:38.450
sends the message it just helps that app
 

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.000
sends the message it just helps that app
behave a little bit more like what you

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.010
behave a little bit more like what you
 

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.070
behave a little bit more like what you
would expect a desktop app to do and

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:42.080
would expect a desktop app to do and
 

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.830
would expect a desktop app to do and
lots of simple changes can add up to a

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:44.840
lots of simple changes can add up to a
 

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:50.200
lots of simple changes can add up to a
much better user experience so as I

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:50.210
much better user experience so as I
 

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.700
much better user experience so as I
mentioned and you've seen a couple of

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:51.710
mentioned and you've seen a couple of
 

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.350
mentioned and you've seen a couple of
examples many we've been working with

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:53.360
examples many we've been working with
 

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.440
