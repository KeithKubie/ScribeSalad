00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.070
So how would you use explanation based learning to implement an agent to

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.850
can solve Raven,s progressive matrices? The first question you're asking here is

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.450
what exactly are you explaining? Are you explaining the answer to the problem,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.810
or are you explaining the transformations between figures in the earlier stages

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.970
of the problem? Given that, what new connections are you learning,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.650
Is it learning performed within the problem or

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.410
old connections an justify the figure to fill in the blank, or

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.070
to perform the cross problems, where new transmissions and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.980
types of problems can be learned and connected together.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.852
For example you might imagine that you've encountered two problems before,

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:34.770
one are rotation and one are reflection. A new problem might involve both,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
how do you use those earlier problems to explain the answer to this new problem?
