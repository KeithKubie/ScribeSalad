goal-setting is fascinating because it's

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
goal-setting is fascinating because it's
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.230
goal-setting is fascinating because it's
sort of a broken process in many

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
sort of a broken process in many
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180
sort of a broken process in many
respects this is the way a goal works

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
respects this is the way a goal works
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.100
respects this is the way a goal works
you say to yourself when I achieve

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
you say to yourself when I achieve
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499
you say to yourself when I achieve
whatever the thing is that's how I'll

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
whatever the thing is that's how I'll
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.150
whatever the thing is that's how I'll
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.740
know I'll have this I'll have succeeded
and I'm going to do everything I can to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
and I'm going to do everything I can to
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330
and I'm going to do everything I can to
get to that point as quickly as possible

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
get to that point as quickly as possible
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279
get to that point as quickly as possible
what that means is you exist in a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
what that means is you exist in a
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200
what that means is you exist in a
failure state for a long time until you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
failure state for a long time until you
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.490
failure state for a long time until you
reach that goal if it's a long-range

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
reach that goal if it's a long-range
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.820
reach that goal if it's a long-range
goal and so as you evaluate your process

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
goal and so as you evaluate your process
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.980
goal and so as you evaluate your process
all you get is the negative feedback of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
all you get is the negative feedback of
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.139
all you get is the negative feedback of
not having achieved that goal perhaps as

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
not having achieved that goal perhaps as
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.490
not having achieved that goal perhaps as
you move closer to it there's some

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
you move closer to it there's some
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920
you move closer to it there's some
positive feedback but if the goal is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
positive feedback but if the goal is
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330
positive feedback but if the goal is
really the end state that you're seeking

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
really the end state that you're seeking
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459
really the end state that you're seeking
out there's a lot of failure before you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
out there's a lot of failure before you
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139
out there's a lot of failure before you
get there and now here's the thing when

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
get there and now here's the thing when
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.490
get there and now here's the thing when
you do get there it's a massive

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
you do get there it's a massive
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350
you do get there it's a massive
anticlimax so there are people who

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
anticlimax so there are people who
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.110
anticlimax so there are people who
achieve the highest highs people who

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
achieve the highest highs people who
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549
achieve the highest highs people who
achieve the highest highs in athletics

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
achieve the highest highs in athletics
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040
achieve the highest highs in athletics
in business and if you talk to them and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
in business and if you talk to them and
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.180
in business and if you talk to them and
you destroy it you ask them to describe

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
you destroy it you ask them to describe
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889
you destroy it you ask them to describe
what it's like to reach their goals they

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
what it's like to reach their goals they
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650
what it's like to reach their goals they
say things like I got there and it was

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
say things like I got there and it was
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529
say things like I got there and it was
an incredible anticlimax i minute I got

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
an incredible anticlimax i minute I got
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209
an incredible anticlimax i minute I got
there I had to start something new I had

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
there I had to start something new I had
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130
there I had to start something new I had
to find a new goal and that's partly

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
to find a new goal and that's partly
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.969
to find a new goal and that's partly
because there's something really

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
because there's something really
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469
because there's something really
unsatisfying about the moment of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
unsatisfying about the moment of
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390
unsatisfying about the moment of
reaching the goal unless it has its own

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
reaching the goal unless it has its own
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100
reaching the goal unless it has its own
benefits that come from reaching the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
benefits that come from reaching the
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170
benefits that come from reaching the
goal if it's just a sort of signpost

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
goal if it's just a sort of signpost
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969
goal if it's just a sort of signpost
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890
that doesn't do much for us it doesn't
nourish us psychologically and what that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
nourish us psychologically and what that
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450
nourish us psychologically and what that
ends up meaning is that we have to try

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
ends up meaning is that we have to try
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520
ends up meaning is that we have to try
and find something new so really if you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
and find something new so really if you
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410
and find something new so really if you
look at life as a series of goals which

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
look at life as a series of goals which
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.960
look at life as a series of goals which
for many of us it is it's a period of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
for many of us it is it's a period of
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999
for many of us it is it's a period of
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.730
being unsuccessful in achieving the goal
then hitting the goal then feeling like

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740
then hitting the goal then feeling like
 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.080
then hitting the goal then feeling like
you haven't really got much from that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
you haven't really got much from that
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539
you haven't really got much from that
goal going to the next one and it's a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
goal going to the next one and it's a
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340
goal going to the next one and it's a
sort of series of escalating goals a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
sort of series of escalating goals a
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130
sort of series of escalating goals a
really good example of this is say smart

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
really good example of this is say smart
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.240
really good example of this is say smart
watches or fitbit's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
watches or fitbit's
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.690
watches or fitbit's
or exercise watches people when they get

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
or exercise watches people when they get
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219
or exercise watches people when they get
those watches a lot of them hit on the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
those watches a lot of them hit on the
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499
those watches a lot of them hit on the
number 10,000 I want to walk 10,000

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
number 10,000 I want to walk 10,000
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.280
number 10,000 I want to walk 10,000
steps when you do that the thing will

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
steps when you do that the thing will
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.719
steps when you do that the thing will
beep you'll feel pretty good about it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
beep you'll feel pretty good about it
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.340
beep you'll feel pretty good about it
for a minute but then that feels a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
for a minute but then that feels a
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.200
for a minute but then that feels a
little hollow and the goal escalates

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
little hollow and the goal escalates
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969
little hollow and the goal escalates
over time people will describe going

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
over time people will describe going
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700
over time people will describe going
from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand steps

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand steps
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319
from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14 thousand steps
to the point where they're moving

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
to the point where they're moving
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.120
to the point where they're moving
through injuries through stress-related

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
through injuries through stress-related
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.330
through injuries through stress-related
injuries because the goal is there they

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
injuries because the goal is there they
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190
injuries because the goal is there they
respond to the goal more than they do to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
respond to the goal more than they do to
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.940
respond to the goal more than they do to
their internal click cues and and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950
their internal click cues and and
 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.809
their internal click cues and and
basically there's something really

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
basically there's something really
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.350
basically there's something really
unfulfilling about that the reason

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
unfulfilling about that the reason
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.970
unfulfilling about that the reason
all keeps escalating and becoming more

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
all keeps escalating and becoming more
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.620
all keeps escalating and becoming more
and more intense is because when they

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
and more intense is because when they
 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.850
and more intense is because when they
achieve the goal they don't actually get

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
achieve the goal they don't actually get
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.130
achieve the goal they don't actually get
anything for that achievement and so

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140
anything for that achievement and so
 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.470
anything for that achievement and so
goals generally I think are in many ways

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
goals generally I think are in many ways
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960
goals generally I think are in many ways
broken processes I think part of the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970
broken processes I think part of the
 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.820
broken processes I think part of the
problem with goals is that they don't

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
problem with goals is that they don't
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.050
problem with goals is that they don't
tell you how to get to where you're

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
tell you how to get to where you're
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360
tell you how to get to where you're
going a better thing to do is to use a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
going a better thing to do is to use a
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.700
going a better thing to do is to use a
system so the idea behind a system

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
system so the idea behind a system
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.200
system so the idea behind a system
rather than a goal is that a system is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210
rather than a goal is that a system is
 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.020
rather than a goal is that a system is
saying things like I'm a writer my goal

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
saying things like I'm a writer my goal
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460
saying things like I'm a writer my goal
is to finish writing this book but I'm

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
is to finish writing this book but I'm
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.810
is to finish writing this book but I'm
not going to think about it that way

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820
not going to think about it that way
 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.880
not going to think about it that way
eventually I'll have a hundred thousand

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890
eventually I'll have a hundred thousand
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.800
eventually I'll have a hundred thousand
words but what my system will be that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
words but what my system will be that
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.540
words but what my system will be that
for an hour every morning I will sit in

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
for an hour every morning I will sit in
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.250
for an hour every morning I will sit in
front of my computer screen and I will

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
front of my computer screen and I will
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020
front of my computer screen and I will
type it doesn't matter what that looks

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030
type it doesn't matter what that looks
 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.470
type it doesn't matter what that looks
like

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
like
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.760
like
I'm not going to evaluate the number of

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770
I'm not going to evaluate the number of
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.650
I'm not going to evaluate the number of
words I'm not going to set some

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
words I'm not going to set some
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.540
words I'm not going to set some
benchmarks some artificial number or

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550
benchmarks some artificial number or
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.430
benchmarks some artificial number or
benchmark that I should reach what I'm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440
benchmark that I should reach what I'm
 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080
benchmark that I should reach what I'm
