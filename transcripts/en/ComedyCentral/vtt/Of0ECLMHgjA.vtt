All of our friends had
left us

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.538
and we
were both stuck there.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.573
I mean, Napa Valley of
all places,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.743
but that's
basically how Carlos and I met.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.179
I am very happy to
meet you.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:16.116
Also, I'm finished.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.887
Oh my God, Grandma,
no, Carlos is not a busboy.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.488
He's my boyfriend.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:22.990
I'm so sorry.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.758
Amy, it's okay, she grew up
during a different time.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.629
Tell him to start mowing
the lawn by the pool

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.964
so it'll be
quiet for my nap.

Drug mule.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.989
A gardener?

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.124
No.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.460
Latino.

We'll show them hard evidence
defying stereotypes.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.182
Okay, everybody,
now watch very closely.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.857
Somebody help him!

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.658
I'm perfectly fine!

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.162
( applauding )

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.797
Thank you
for your concern.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.498
He's so
articulate.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.467

Never-say.

Here at Generations, through
repetition, patience,

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.554
so much patience,

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:04.057
hand-holding, gentle cajoling
and coupon reinforcement,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.794
we prove that you
can teach an old dog new tricks.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.597
Here's my new class now.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:11.698
Bitch, I'm
trying to help you.
