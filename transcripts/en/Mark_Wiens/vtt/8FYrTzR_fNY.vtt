00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.803
- Blue, we have pink, yellow.

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:06.248
- As-salamu alaykum.

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:09.449
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.510
- What's the name of
the area of town again?

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.860
- It's called Lyari.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.693
- Lyari.

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:16.050
And this is, you can also
call it mini Balochistan

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.020
because so many people so many
our Baloch friends live here

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.880
and this is a very vibrant area.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.980
People from this area are very hospitable,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.930
very great people, yeah.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.300
- And Balochistan is the
province of Pakistan which is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.590
just North of Sindh,
North of Karachi, right?

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.230
Along the coast line and
then on the border of Iran.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.540
It's a province that we weren't
able to visit on this trip

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.130
because we ran out of time
but that's why we wanted

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.330
to visit this area.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.600
This is like mini
Balochistan, within Karachi.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.590
And so we're just going to
walk around a little bit.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.564
There's one famous street
which is very colorful.

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:55.610
It's called Kiran Gali,
it's very colorful it's very

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.100
picturesque and so that's
what we're gonna walk down

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.370
and just kind of see what happens here.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.570
Lyari Town is one of the 18
constituent towns of Karachi,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330
known as little Balochistan.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.780
Just a few years ago,
Lyari was a war zone.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.190
Ruled by gangs and known for
its brutal violence and unrest,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.260
but recently things have changed.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.810
We wanted to visit Lyari for
one, because I didn't have

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.570
a chance to visit Balochistan
on my trip to Pakistan.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.000
And for two, in our very
short visit, to share a story

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.363
of people, hope, and
those making a difference.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.220
(car honks)

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.610
I believe the old name is
called Baghdadi street but now,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.130
it's called Kiran Gali street.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.130
And it's a colorful alley, only
walking and motorcycle lane.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.050
But you just see the buildings.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.560
They've taken an initiative to take pride

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.250
in their neighborhood, to color,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.080
to paint beautiful bright colors.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.370
It's very colorful, very
vibrant and beautiful actually.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.074
So we're just going to
walk down the street.

00:01:54.074 --> 00:01:56.657
(upbeat music)

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.103
(horn honk)

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.670
And he has this bicycle
pump attached to a horn.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.400
He pumps the bicycle pump
and that just blows the horn.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.140
So that lets the entire
community here know

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.763
that he's selling bread for the day.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.900
Okay we're jumping into a rickshaw.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.240
We're on our way to this food street

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.519
which I think is called Mombasa street.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.863
Rickshaw is the best way to get there.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.490
Oh he came with us too.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.020
I think we met him in
the colorful neighborhood

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.970
and he's joined.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.043
How are you guys back there?

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.209
- We are the Lyari boys today.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.943
- [Host] The Lyari boys.

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:42.443
(upbeat electronic music)

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:49.424
(car honk)

00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:52.257
(cars driving by)

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.900
It's great when we just
casually drive down the wrong

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.130
side of the road, intentionally.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.380
(laughs)

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.590
You just gotta be careful
you don't hang out too far.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.454
Or you're, whoa.

00:03:06.454 --> 00:03:09.621
(upbeat techno music)

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
Hello!

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:14.817
- Hi

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.650
- Yes, just on their way to school.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.372
Oh man this is an amazing little ride

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:22.333
through mini Balochistan.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.470
Okay, rickshaw rides are
always fun and entertaining.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.410
We got off in a more
busy area of this region

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.610
or of this district and we're gonna,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.830
there's a busy food stall
that we're gonna check out.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.404
Whoa look at these pomegranate seeds.

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:46.737
(cars honk)

00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:53.563
(cards sputtering)

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:56.146
(upbeat music)

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:00.396
- [Host] As-salamu alaykum

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:03.250
- Salaam (speaks foreign language)

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.800
- [Host] Yeah this is the spot.

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:09.658
- (speaks foreign language)

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:20.652
(kitchen utensils clanking)

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.878
(yelling)

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.960
(car engines sputtering)

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.300
- We stopped at a stall,
a little restaurant

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.920
on the side of the road and
this is a very popular spot.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.538
Lots of people are eating breakfast here.

00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:41.205
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.820
- He's serving a local breakfast

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.980
but in this area of mini Balochistan.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.260
So he has channa which is the chickpeas.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.510
And then he also has
Paya which is a cow foot

00:04:53.563 --> 00:04:55.790
in this version it's cow foot stew.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.140
And he's about to serve us.

00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:02.322
(upbeat music)

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:05.322
(utensils clanking)

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:14.578
Nice, they put it on top.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:26.121
(cars honking and driving past)

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.334
- (speaking foreign language)

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.188
All the best!

00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:56.293
Nice, nalli.

00:05:57.165 --> 00:05:57.998
Nalli Paya.

00:05:57.998 --> 00:05:58.831
- [Host] Nalli Paya.

00:05:58.831 --> 00:05:59.914
- Nalli Paya,

00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:01.874
all the best.

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:05.791
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.441
(laughing)

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.646
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.258
- [Host] Rubber band.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.781
(laughing)

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:27.524
Too fast, too fast man.

00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:29.774
(laughing)

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.393
So much style.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:37.353
He's so fast, he has so
much style, so much skill.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.787
What a friendly amazing man.

00:06:40.787 --> 00:06:43.610
Yes man, wow, very good.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.738
And I think he just hooked
us up with a special.

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:48.363
The very special, the very special.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.680
And he's like singing.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.930
Wow.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.253
What a master, another
just ultimate, skillful,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.650
wow

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.160
that looks awesome.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.410
He made us three different dishes

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.690
and they're like special dishes.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.684
One is the egg with the
channa, with the chickpeas.

00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:08.540
One is the Nalli which is the bone marrow.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.024
Which he took that bone
and I didn't even know

00:07:10.024 --> 00:07:11.760
what he was gonna do
and he just, he hit it.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.220
He punched out the marrow into the plate.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.053
And then one kind of daal.

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:16.610
And this is something
I haven't had so far,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.310
just a loaf of bread, whoa,
very crusty loaf of bread.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.530
I'm gonna try the Paya
first and I don't even know

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.323
what that, oh that looks like tendon.

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:27.460
That looks like tendon and that looks like

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.370
a lump of skin and then

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:34.050
the marrow should just be
floating around all in here.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.720
I should grab whatever that chunk is.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.553
Oh wow,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.263
that's oily and meaty.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.510
Oh and there's a little
bit of channa in here too.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.490
Whatever I picked up
looks pretty gelatinous.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.073
(upbeat music)

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.890
Gelatinous would be the
way to describe that,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.960
and I got a little like
toe bone in that bite.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.450
That's good though, you can
taste the bread just absorbs

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.350
all that Desi ghee and that flavor.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.610
You can taste the chilis
in there, it's mild

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.460
but it's like a very
warming, very kind of oily,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.800
very heavy, very rich.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.020
And you can really taste the ghee in that.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.800
Okay, next I'm gonna try
the chickpeas and the egg.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.020
Break into it, oh here's a nice little,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.690
oh there's a chili in there too.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.740
Okay, grab that chili, whole chili

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.040
with the egg with some
of that chickpea stew.

00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:39.235
I just removed that stem.

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:42.310
That's a good combination because
you've got the creamy yolk

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.240
plus the creaminess of the chickpeas.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.440
And again, the ghee wrapping it up.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.063
That one is like a classic breakfast.

00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:51.970
It's just like warm and comforting.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.620
Okay, the final dish we
got is a type of daal.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.230
And again you can see that ghee.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.540
And I'm gonna dip this
into the chutney provided.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.220
It looks like a kind of a
watery, kind of yogurty, chutney

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.820
with a little bit of herb in it.

00:09:06.652 --> 00:09:07.970
The chutney kind of brightens it up.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.680
Kind of refreshes the mouth.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.913
Along with the richer stew.

00:09:12.913 --> 00:09:15.496
(upbeat music)

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.603
Good?

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.040
- This is very crispy bread.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.933
- [Host] Yeah, the bread
is nice and crispy.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:27.133
- Nice, nice and crispy.

00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:33.163
- One shot from far.

00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:38.882
Shukriya, shukriya.

00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:39.715
- All the best.

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:40.548
- [Host] Thank you man,

00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:44.820
shukriya.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.130
That was a delicious breakfast.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.140
He's such a friendly man.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.490
Again he did not want to
charge us for breakfast.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.940
And that just shows his
kindness, his hospitality.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.980
But yeah.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.570
What an amazing place, a little stall.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.773
And that's a heavy and
rich, rich breakfast.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.400
This area, especially formerly,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.370
was known as not a very safe area.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.380
Actually quite a
dangerous area in Karachi.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.470
It's an area that's very friendly.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.460
It's an area that has a lot of character.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.120
And it represents
Balochistan, which is a region

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.110
of Pakistan that's very less
traveled, very less visited.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.080
And so a part of the reason
that Ali and I wanted

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.590
to come check this neighborhood
out and just explore it

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.767
a little bit is just
to show that the people

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.490
are so welcoming, so friendly.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.390
And that things are really
improving in this neighborhood,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.180
in this community, within Karachi.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.000
The city within a city in Karachi.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.597
And just being able to
see the colorful street.

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:50.260
People taking initiative to take pride

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.380
in their neighborhood.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.370
And then the amazing man who we met

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.040
who just served us breakfast.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.373
Thanks Ali and Farouk.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.747
- Even for me it was first time to Lyari

00:11:01.747 --> 00:11:03.190
and I think it's amazing.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.490
This place has a very rich
and distinctive character.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.150
And I think everybody,
especially people from Karachi

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.500
