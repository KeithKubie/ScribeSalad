00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.450
 HIV / AIDS has taken the lives of more than 39 million people around the world, despite our efforts to prevent 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.139
 Better treatment and understanding. But with 35 million people currently infected, exactly what 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.190
 Is it, and are we approaching a cure? 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.810
 To capture HIV, the virus must enter the bloodstream - and often have been transferred 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.240
 Of infected body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids or breast milk. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.119
 Just enter the bloodstream, for a disease targeting a variety of cells, but more specifically 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 T cell helper (CD4), which is a type of white blood cell that plays a fundamental role 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.550
 In our immune system and fight infections. The outer envelope of HIV is covered by sugary proteins 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.780
 Which mutates frequently and ultimately fools the T-cell into not recognizing 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.960
 The virus, just attacking specific proteins on the T-cell begin to remove the membrane 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.649
 Together, the cell eventually enters where 2 RNA viruses are excreted and 3 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.070
 Basic replication enzymes 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.109
 Because HIV is a reverse virus, RNA transcribes to DNA, represented here from the clouds 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.210
 Two RNA lines are converted to DNA and then this DNA has been combined 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 And add it to the cell genome, this makes the T cells treat the virus as its own, which causes 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.869
 Which makes them make more copies of the virus and then leave the host cell full growth, and ultimately 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.130
 To get more T-Cell, the virus is difficult to treat because of the change 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.650
 Very high, and comprehensively the replication process creates more than 10 billion new viruses each 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.210
 day 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.750
 During these initial stages of replication, the stage of latency is called, the infected person may not appear 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.700
 No symptoms for 8 years, if not eventually treated HIV HIV kills them 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.950
 When T cells are less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.229
 Of the blood, becomes infected with AIDS or AIDS. 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.040
 After this progress, the immune system becomes less and much more vulnerable 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.320
 To cancer and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. A person does not die of AIDS 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.460
 In fact they die from any disease the body can not repel 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.060
 At present there are medicines that help to combat opportunistic infections, such as Daraprim 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.560
 Which was recently in the news when pharmacist Martin Shkreli decided to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.430
 Raising the price of $ 13.50 to $ 750 per pill medicine, there are also antiviral drugs that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.030
 Slow the virus by blocking certain enzymes that are required for the virus to multiply 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.830
 Similarly, those without HIV but at higher risk of HIV infection may take pre-exposure 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.250
 Prevention or PrEP. This works along the lines of antiviral drugs by blocking the enzyme 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.610
 Reverse transducer. 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.410
 Fortunately there is hope for treatment, there are few people who have immunity from HIV (AIDS) 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 Virus due to mutation associated with T cells. In one case, and on a positive HIV theme 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.980
 For the bone marrow transplant, this means they have been given new stem cells that generate 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.200
 T cells were different, and within 20 months there was no evidence of the virus being present in the bloodstream. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.879
 Although this drug is very unique, it certainly opens up possibilities 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.909
 Generation of HIV-resistant cells, combining this with other treatments and preventive measures 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.099
 Such as condoms, clean needle programs, safe blood transfusions, and perhaps one day HIV / AIDS 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.519
 Be something of the past 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.739
 Your video sharing is greatly appreciated, try to help know the spread and 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.860
 Awareness. 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.140
 Special thanks to the audio player to support this episode to give you a free trial version for 30 days at

 audible.com/asap. This week we wanted to recommend a redefined book reality, which explores 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.690
 What is real and what is imaginary of both scientific and philosophical perspective, 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.190
 Through a series of really awesome lectures. You can get a free 30-day trial at audible.com/asap 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.799
 The choice is among the wide range! We love them because they are great when you're on 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.370
