Dallas Cowboys playing
the Philadelphia

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:06.039
Eagles this Sunday in Dallas.
What should the bet be?

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:08.975
What should Black Lou win?
What should Jay win?

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.478
I mean, give people examples.
This is very open-ended.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.113
Right? Could be
Jay eats a pile of-

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.581
No jerseys.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.617
Hardcore gay stuff on the table?
I'd say-

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.952
That's awesome.
It's very progressive.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:22.822
Things where we have to go away
for several days to do it?

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.192
I would say some sort
of mountain climbing activity.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.027
Possibly a sun dance in Asia-

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.262
Some sort of wife swap.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.763
Oh, a wife swap would be good.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.598
A wife swap.
I say don't underestimate-

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.200
Which is pretty cool.
I'm not with my wife anymore so-

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.701
... an old-fashioned pie
to the face.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.336
But like, you take pie crusts
and you fill it

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.206
with maybe a mustard
or a horrible cheese.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:44.844
It's the Bonfire.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.946
Comedy Central radio series
XM 95. I'm Dan

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.183
Soder, that's Big Jay Oakerson
coming in studio right now.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.919
New special coming out now,
January 4th at 11:00 p.m.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.855
Eastern on Comedy Central.
Part of stand-up month.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:01:00.426
Ron Funches. Giggle Fit.
January 4th. Hi, Ron.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.961
Hi.
How're you doing, dude?

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.729
Good. How're you guys doing?
Doing all right.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.098
You got headphones on
headphones. I respect that.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.499
Yeah.
You got your dual-

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.900
It's like 2 Chainz
of headphones.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.135
Yeah, you're dual-wielding.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.603
Yeah.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.738
Yeah. Before we get
into talking to Ron,

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.074
I want to thank Isaac Harris,
who came out in Boston

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.977
and gave us that duster
and that Marlboro jean jacket.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.545
Marlboro Miles.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:22.548
Marlboro Miles. A legit Marlboro
Miles jean jacket,

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.517
which is pretty
fuckin' hard to get.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.085
I got a Marlboro Miles watch.
You did?

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.286
It's old Swiss Army, yeah.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.688
Wait, that's a Marlboro Miles?

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.889
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.824
From smoking?
Or you just buy it online?

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.459
Make up your own answer.
Whatever's more fun.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.961
Ron-
You bought it online.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.329
I bought it online.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.730
... did you ever
smoke cigarettes?

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.799
I tried once, you know,
just to see.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.200
People were like,
"Hey, try this."

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.335
And you just didn't see-

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.870
What all the hubbub was about?

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.538
Yeah. And a lot of times,
people were like,

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.340
you know,
if you're getting hi-

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.041
smoking pot, they were like,
"It helps you."

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.643
Yeah. I've heard it like that-
well, I mean,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.145
I smoked cigarettes
for a long time,

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.446
and that was the thing.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.780
I remember my friends
being like,

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.015
"It's better after
you get high."

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.517
Yeah.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.451
And I believed it
because of the smoking-

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.119
Smoking cigarettes?

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:01.320
Yeah. I was like, "It is,"
but it's really not.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.156
It's no difference.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.891
Yeah. I didn't like it, didn't
like the head rush, you know,

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.492
so I never liked spliffs,
or anything like that.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.094
Do you turn down spliffs now?
Like, if-

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.062
Now, yeah, because I have weed
and that's great.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.231
Yeah, but I'm saying, even if-
I kind of like when someone,

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.601
as a former cigarette smoker,
when someone has a spliff,

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.403
I'll be like, "Oh,
I'll fucking get into it,"

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.938 align:start size:69% position:31% line:92%
(everyone agreeing)

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.241
like I'm being
a little naughtier with my weed.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.810
The tickle's back.
Oh hey old friend.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.613
I'm getting a rush.
I'm like "Ha."

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.981
So yeah, so you never-
it was one cigarette,

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.816
then you're like "Fuck this.
I'm never smoking."

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.318
Yeah. No. Never.

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:34.520
What kind of cigarette was it?
Was it a menthol cigarette?

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:35.855
My first, that sounded
more racial.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.557
My first was
a menthol cigarette-

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.491
Your first one?
Mine was a Marlboro light.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:39.659
And it was very harsh.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.060
Yeah, I think it was a Marlboro.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.728
Marlboro?
Yeah.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.063
I think Marlboro's usually
the first cigarettes

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.498
for a lot of kids.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.166
Oh yeah, crushing
with a Marlboro Red

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.768
you just dig right into
like the harshest cigarette.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.403
That's too much.
Cowboy killer?

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.038
That's what my dad smoked.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.639
So that's who I was
stealin' 'em from.

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:55.074
Oh, in that case,
mine was a Merit.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.676
A Merit cigarette?

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.780
Mine was my step-father's
full strength Newport.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:04.150
It is funny again,
my parents, from a time,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.386
even I now make
the menthol cigarettes

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.189
being a black thing joke.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.791
It's a great thing
that everyone gets

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:15.428
but I tell you
my father smoked Kools,

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.997
my mom smoked Kools
filter kings

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.367
and my step-father
smoked Newports.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.002
You wanna know a
real underappreciated

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.838
menthol cigarette?
Salems. They're out there.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.940
That's what I started smoking.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:29.775
My friend would steal
cigarettes from his mom

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:33.045
and his step-dad before the bus
arrived in 7th grade.

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:35.681
It was always a Marlboro Light
and a Salem Light

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.416
and you had to fuckin'
pick which one

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.052
and if you got the Marlboro
Light, you were like "Yeah!

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.221
I don't have to smoke
fuckin' glass."

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:46.726
I won that comedy contest Salem
cigarettes sponsored years ago,

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.895
Salem or B contest,
and when I won they sent me

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:55.534
a case of cartons
of Salem Lights

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.437
and the box was so cool.

00:03:58.203 --> 00:04:00.806
It was so cool,
the box opened sideways.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.708
Oh it was the sliding out?

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.511
The slide out box and I'd never
smoked cigarettes before.

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:07.780
I tried a Newport
when I was younger.

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.349
I never smoked as an adult.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:13.619
And at 22 years old
or something,

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:15.721
Is when you started, I forget
that you started smoking.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:18.491
My girlfriend and me broke up,
I was like, "I wanna look cool",

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.159
hanging outside of comedy clubs.

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.828
I don't perform anywhere really,
or get up very much,

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.566
so I'm gonna sit outside the
comics and be cool and smoke.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.069
In the beginning, it's hard
to think that I was smoking,

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.705
I was actively smoking
to make sure that I was,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:35.141
I had to get a few in,
like I was practicing.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.709
That's what drinking is.

00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:38.411
But I was practicing for,
then it comes time,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.846
you have to stop yourself
from just chaining it non-stop.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.784
But there was a time I was like
"4 exits from here

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.519
I'll smoke another cigarette".

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.120
That what'll get me
used to smoking.

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.655
So that was your training?

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.457
Ron, how old were you
when you started smoking weed?

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.025
I was 16.
You were 16.

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.694
Did you do training,
because that's what,

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.929
weed is the thing
you need to train on,

00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:59.365
it's the thing that you smoke
and you get too high

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.701
and you're like "I can do
that better next time."

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.270
No, I just- the first time
I smoked

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:06.339
I went to my friend's trailer

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.641
and they had
a little wizard bong

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.010
and they had a bunch
of Red Vines,

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:15.848
which became very delicious
and then whatever we were

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.883
watching became the best show
I'd ever seen.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.086
So, then, the next day
I was like

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.954
"Yeah, I wanna do that again."

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:24.724
I remember Pizza Hut,
the first time I really,

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.258
really high
when I was a teenager.

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.693
I went home and all I wanted

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:30.296
was a Pizza Hut pizza
at 10 in the morning

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:34.266
and my mom's boyfriend was like
"Why are you pushing this?"

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:36.535
And I was like "Come on,
let's get a fucking pizza!"

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:38.137
I want a Big Foot.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.441
I was hopin' the guy
fuckin' my mom wasn't a pussy.

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:44.377
I dunno maybe, I thought I could
respect you as a man,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.247
but I guess I can't if you won't
do 10 am pizza from Pizza Hut.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.882
Yeah, that seems like a thing

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.651
that your mom's boyfriend
would be down with.

00:05:52.684 --> 00:05:55.087
That's the allyoop,
I'm fuckin' settin' him up.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.089
I want him to be like
eh!

00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:59.325
What an easy way to make him
the cool guy to you.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.761
I was handin' Joe a pass
to be the fuckin'-

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.329
Yeah, if I was fuckin' your mom
and you're like

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.865
"let's get half a pizza
and play Sega Genesis"

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.602
I'd be like
I'm never leavin' this place.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.604
Hey kid, do you want
my last name?

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:13.873
I feel a kinship with him.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.441
I'm gonna adopt him.
I'm gonna adopt him.

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.376
Cuz he's really chill
about this.

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.445
I go, "Hey dude, do you wanna
watch old wrestling

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.582
and eat pizza and play Sega?"
I go, "I don't know, son."

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:25.050
Did we just become
best friends?

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.053
Yeah, oh my god, am I
banging your mom too loud?

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.221
You let me know.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.823
Nah, you do you, it's great.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.125
Opposite of that.
I had a guy that was like

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:35.461
"Children should be seen
and not heard."

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:37.063
You're like, "I'm 16."

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:41.467
I didn't smoke any weed
when I was young at all.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.302
When was the first time
you got high?

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.405
The first time I smoked weed,
I was probably 18 or so.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.274
Okay, that's not... Terribly...

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.543
But not even that though,
I also didn't...

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.512
Everything the first time I try,
it doesn't do very much for me.

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:54.914
Mushrooms...

You just did DMT-

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.650
DMT? Nothing, it didn't work.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.218
Have you done DMT at all?

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:01.053
No, I'm, I haven't
done many things.

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:04.089
I'm mostly pot and mushrooms
are my things.

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.892
I'm allergic to alcohol,
so I don't drink that.

00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:10.963
And then I have addiction
in my family from my dad

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:14.733
and so I was always "I'm not
gonna do coke and stuff,

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.402
because I'm like
I'm gonna love it."

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
(laughs)

00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:19.371
That's the same reason
that I don't do coke.

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.006
That's what I always said too.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.077
My thing was what if I,
the two lines I ever did,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.649
two lines total, one per time,
two different times,

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.185
didn't really do anything to me
and then I was like...

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:34.954
People were like "no,
you gotta try it like this"

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.755
You're like, "you know what?

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:38.891
Let me just never find out
that it's great."

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:40.426
If it's great, the next
weekend you'll be like

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.328
"I can do it once
in a while on a weekend."

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.629 size:72% position:36%
Then it's every weekend
and then-

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.397
That's what addiction is,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.700
it's just like convincing
yourself to do it one more time.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.268
I already do that
with cheese sticks.

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.836
Talk about crushing a menthol,

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.206
couple of fat lines
in you with that menthol.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.241 size:88% position:44%
Andy is the guy who-

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.443
Andy looks like the guy
to get you on coke,

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:00.613
like it's harmless
and innocent from the 70s.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.214
He's the guy who hangs out -

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:04.350
Just so we can drink
a little longer, that's all.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.118
Yeah dude, I'm tellin' ya man,
it's gonna help you study.

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.020 line:92%
You have a college coke face.

00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:09.922
Andy's the guy who has a party
at his mom's mansion,

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.458
but he never leaves his mom's
bedroom the whole time.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.393
She's out, but he just
like holds camp in there

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.362
with a couple of chicks.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:17.630
He';s like, "yeah, we're just
hangin' out on my mom's

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.265
gold lame bed."

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.867
No, tell them to go away.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.470
So, anyway, Tiffany, Molly,
you guys ever kissed before?

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:29.108
Coke was a thing that I do this,
if I do the training,

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.010
like you said
with smoking cigarettes,

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.778
where you were like one more
cigarette before the exit.

00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.280
For me, cigarettes,

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:39.151
I had my first cigarette
behind a dollar store,

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:41.921
it was called McFrugal's.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:45.324
It was on Chambers
and Hampton in Aurora.

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:47.493
We laugh, but that
is a great name.

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.461
That is a great name.

00:08:49.494 --> 00:08:51.163
That is a solid name,

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:53.933
do you know how hard it is
to come up with business names?

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.734
McFrugal's was right there.

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:56.969
And it was a dollar store.

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:58.971
Just shy of calling it Cheapies.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.342
McFrugal's -
Do you think they name it

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.979
that thinking these rubes
aren't gonna get it,

00:09:07.012 --> 00:09:08.681
they're gonna think it's a name.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.482
No, totally. Me and my -

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:13.586
I swear to god, I wish I was
shopping more at McFrugal's.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.254
McBrokestein's?

00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:18.324
Why did Walmart make it
and McFrugal's didn't?

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.992
I'll say this, for the amount
of times

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:22.328
that I've said
Walmart in my life,

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:24.396
I wish I would have said
McFrugal's more.

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:27.600
I wish it would have been like,
"I'm going to McFrugal's."

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.635
McFrugal's is a billion
dollar industry.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:35.574
We were behind a McFrugal's
and we smoked a cigarette

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:38.010
and I remember the first
couple drags were,

00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:40.212
I was 12,
and I was like this sucks.

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:42.181
And then after the next couple,
I was like,

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.582
"yeah, I do this now."

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.518
It was just like in my brain,
I do this now.

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:47.920
And my friend Jason Poyle

00:09:47.953 --> 00:09:49.855
would steal cigarettes
from his parents.

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:51.624
We've said it a bunch
on this show,

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.225
but I'm just tryin'
to think of like-

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.294
I remember believing
I was too old to play with-

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.463
we had this conversation
before, to play with toys.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.631
Yeah, action figures.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.366
And having to stop myself,

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.403
I went after probably months
to a year of not playing with GI

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:06.439
Joes, I went and bought two

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:09.742
and they changed the design
a little bit even in that year

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.043
and I didn't really
like it anyway,

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:12.978
which was the excuse
why I was like

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.348
"I'm done getting these,
no more of these at all."

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:19.518
But it's crazy for me to think
that in the same time

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:21.253
Dan was playing with GI Joes-

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:23.522
Not GI Joes, WWF Hasbro figures

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:24.857
Whatever it was,
you play with those

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.291
I just bought some more.

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:27.860
Yeah dude, they're great

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.194
and they did the re-issues
with new superstars.

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:30.796
Yeah, I got some of those.

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:32.531
Yeah, at the Retro,
but what he's saying is

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:34.166
when I was in 7th grade,

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:37.202
I used to have my ring out
and all of my wrestlers

00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:39.738
and then on commercial breaks of
Wings or Doogie Houser,

00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:42.207
I would go outside
and smoke a Marlboro Red.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.743
And come back in
and play with toys.

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:46.578
You can't smoke
and play with toys.

00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:48.313 align:start size:91% position:9% line:92%
That's such a-

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:51.250
I'd go out and fuckin' rip a Red

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.786
and be like Tatonka
is on fire in this

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.187
King of the Ring tournament.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.456
You can smoke
and go be a child soldier,

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.024
but you can't smoke and go play.

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:01.293
Trauma
Like Dan's out there,

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.228
smokin' a cigarette
and lookin' at his watch,

00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:04.963
"I better get back in there."

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:07.666
Ah shit, mom's about to come
home and start bustin'

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:09.301
my chops about chores.

00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:11.136
So we're gonna get this cage
match out of the way.

00:11:11.169 --> 00:11:16.542
The second level
isn't gonna clear itself.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.044
Flick. Fuck it.
Flick

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:22.081
Ah dude,
Alright, I gotta get outta here.

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.949
I gotta go through
the back yard,

00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:26.819
I'm
gonna do the side brew through-

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.055
I gotta go make sure
I play those tails.

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:32.458
You go - off the vent, aw,

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.293
I couldn't do it
a thousand times if I tried.

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.995
I'm not lying if I say
you're kind of accurate,

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.064
because I used to have to hid
my cigarette butts

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:40.265
because I was 12.

00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:41.433
Over the fence.

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:42.901
I didn't want my mom to know.

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:44.403
I used to get really bad
head rushes

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:46.338
because I was fuckin' a child
so, I was -

00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:48.907
Because you're head
wasn't done developing yet?

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.609
Oh yeah, and I remember smoking-

00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:53.813
And you're body's screaming
at you not to do this.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.348
Man, go back in and lay down.

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.584
I don't know what it was but
I'd get all woozy and nauseous.

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.219
That's exactly what it was,

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:04.189
I was like, this is bad,
but then, I loved smoking.

00:12:04.222 --> 00:12:05.424
I want another one.

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:07.292
I was so bad.

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:08.927
How old were you when you're mom
found out you were smokin'?

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.498
I rode my bike home,
so I was like 14.

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:13.699
And she was like whatever?

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:15.734
No, fuck no. She was furious.

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.169
So how long did you hide it
from her?

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:18.804
About two years,
but I wasn't smoking-

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:20.539
So when you were 16?

00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:25.377
No, I quit smoking from when
I was about 14 and a half to 16,

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.414
I just stopped smoking, but then
I got caught when I was 14.

00:12:29.447 --> 00:12:31.416
Because I came home,
we used to hang out,

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:34.319
I've told stories about this
before, at this town house.

00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:35.854
You were the lawless society?

00:12:35.887 --> 00:12:37.656
It was just lawless.
This girl's mom was,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.228 align:start position:0%
I think she was a prostitute,
but she was a massage therapist,

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:48.033
so I was in there bustin' nuts.
We were down in the basement

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.868
and it was all these kids
drinkin' 40s

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.504
and smokin' weed
and smokin' cigarettes.

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:56.308
I was one of the nerdier ones,

00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:58.844
so I was just smokin' cigarettes
and occasionally smokin' weed.

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:01.280
But I went home
and my mom came downstairs,

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:03.048
I didn't know she was
going to come downstairs,

00:13:03.081 --> 00:13:04.850
and I was getting a glass
of juice in the kitchen

00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:07.085
and she's like
"you smell like cigarettes".

00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:10.989
And I like "Oh yeah,
we were over at Laura's house."

00:13:11.022 --> 00:13:13.358
And she goes "Come here."
I was like "huh?"

00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:22.734
And she's goes
"breath into my mouth"

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.070
and I was like "fuck"
and I did the thing,

00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:29.208
where I breathed in,
and she goes "breath out"

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:33.579
Keep sucking in.

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:36.014
She was like "you fuckin',
you were smokin' cigarettes."

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:37.683
And then she woke up
her boyfriend, Joe,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:43.088
who was clearly drunk and
he escalated the whole thing.

00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:46.091
"You fuckin' disrespect
your mom like that."

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:48.160
I was like "aw,
this fuckin' guy."

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:50.896
So, then they went to bed,
and I smoked weed to calm down.

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:52.564
I went out in the backyard

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:54.299
and fuckin' had
a fuckin' little tin bowl.

00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:56.368
I didn't have a house at all
where I could,

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:57.970
my parents smoked,

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.504
my mom and step-pop smoked,
but I couldn't.

00:13:59.537 --> 00:14:01.306
Did you have a household
that was permissive?

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:05.277
Oh no, no. It seems like you
either gotta be

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:09.715
really poor or well off in a way
where you could be unsupervised.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:13.085
And my mom and I, my family,
we were right on that bubble,

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:17.189 align:start position:0%
we didn't live like in a ghetto,
but we were real close to it.

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:20.759
So, we were always,
my mom would take us to museums

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:23.528
and take us to school,
after school programs

00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:26.198
and really tried to keep us away
from doing stuff like that.

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:28.500
That's what it is man,
it's the fuckin' boredom

00:14:28.533 --> 00:14:30.535
We were broke
and unsupervised for sure,

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:34.172
but I didn't roll
with many pack of people

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:36.809
that were gonna get it
to the real trouble at all.

00:14:37.442 --> 00:14:39.611
My choice of friends
was not very,

00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:41.480
there were kids that smoked, but

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:45.551
I was just very naïve,
I shit you not, one time I went-

00:14:46.284 --> 00:14:49.288
I lived in south side Chicago,
so it's not a very safe area

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.223
and this park that my mom
would drop us off

00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:52.824
in sometimes
wouldn't be that safe,

00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:54.893
sometimes gangs
would meet up there,

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:57.062
so I'm going in the library
to go get

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.864
a new choose-your-adventure

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:04.136
and then there was a gang
having a meeting in there.

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.570
In the library?
In the library.

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:08.807
Which is like get your shit
together.

00:15:10.008 --> 00:15:11.576
Resourceful
Smart move,

00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:13.145
because nobody can yell out,

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.646
nobody can blurt out,
you have to stay quiet in there.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:17.282
Dude, that is almost a way
to bring order,

00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:20.519
the gang member that thought
of that was ahead of the curve.

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:23.755
Guys, I've looked into it,
if we don't bring weapons,

00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:25.357
we can meet at the library.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.126
That's great, I like yell
whispering though

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:30.229
like a "god damn it,
we showin'-"

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:34.366
In the middle of a reading room,
going "wrap your set"

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:43.208
and the guys like "I agree"
and then he goes (snaps fingers)

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:45.277
That's what they were like,
they were in there

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.113
and I interrupted their meeting
and they asked

00:15:48.613 --> 00:15:50.582
"what set do you claim?"
And I didn't even-

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:51.783
In the library?

00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:53.218
In the library!

00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:55.053
I'm just looking
for a periodical.

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:56.355
I have my card somewhere.

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.223
Encyclopedia Brown
I told them

00:15:58.256 --> 00:16:01.126
Sega, because I thought
it was a console war thing.

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:04.963
Ah, that's great,
what set you rep?

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.966
He goes Jaguar.

00:16:10.902 --> 00:16:12.704
ColecoVision

00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:14.840
And they go, I don't want
this guy coming' sideways at me,

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.475
this guy's fuckin' nuts.

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:17.743
Dude, that is hilarious
to walk into the library,

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:19.544
but the moment-

00:16:19.577 --> 00:16:21.279
What's the realization
where you're like "What's this?

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:23.549
Oh my god, this is a gang
having a meeting."

00:16:24.082 --> 00:16:26.718
I mean, yeah,
I'm just really oblivious,

00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:28.920
I'm just reaching for a book
and then I'm like,

00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:32.624
"oh, you guys,
don't seem like you got books

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:36.395
and you don't seem happy
to be here or that I'm here."

00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:39.898
Yeah, just walk into one of
those meetings and you're like

00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:42.034
"Everyone's not happy that
I'm standing here right now.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.268
I am so sorry."

00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:45.137
I asked Ronald during the break

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.472
who his favorite football team
was Bears, the Chicago Bears.

00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:49.408
That Khalil Mack trade.
Unbelievable.

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:50.942
Big deal.

00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:52.711
I think the Bears, they're
a playoff team this year.

00:16:52.744 --> 00:16:54.479
I really hope that we can beat
the Rams this week.

00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:55.981
Me too.

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:57.849
I would put money on it,
if I knew how to.

00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:00.886
I don't know how.
I've never done it before,

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.921
but if someone
could reach out to me?

00:17:02.954 --> 00:17:04.656
You need bookies to contact you.

00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:06.691
He'll just tell you
all these crazy things, yeah

00:17:06.724 --> 00:17:09.861
I just take a 35% cut.

00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:11.596
Ron says, that's sensible.

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:13.799
Yeah, I don't know,
I don't know anything about it.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.534
That's standard.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.602
Basically, how it goes,
he says "You give me $50,

00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:19.337
but you're only betting
25 of it.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.274
So, if you want to bet 50,
you give me $100."

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:23.975
Sounds like square biz.

00:17:24.008 --> 00:17:26.445
And he goes, "this is how
those casinos are so rich."

00:17:27.011 --> 00:17:28.713
Yeah, betting gets
a slippery slope.

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:31.316
Have you ever watched anyone
get too into sports betting?

00:17:31.349 --> 00:17:32.984
Because it's very uncomfortable.

00:17:33.017 --> 00:17:34.753
I've watched a lot of friends
get too into,

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:42.327
but I've also never seen myself
collected money from a bookie.

00:17:42.994 --> 00:17:44.529
Oh like an actual bookie.

00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:46.231
I've never ever

00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:49.034
I've had a friend become
and then not become a bookie,

00:17:49.467 --> 00:17:51.336
because he couldn't keep up.
He ran out of money.

00:17:51.369 --> 00:17:52.838
Really?

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:55.540
Dude, I mean, I watched this guy
lose his hair over games.

00:17:55.573 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
Dude, man, I was with a buddy
at a bar when RG3 was at Baylor.

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:04.116
We were at a bar
watching his Bowl game

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:07.786
with RG3's Heisman season,

00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:11.423
my buddy is super into the game
and he's from Colorado.

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:13.325
I'm like "Why the fuck do you
care about this Baylor game?"

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:14.759
He's like "I have $5,000 on it."

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:16.628
And you're like
"What the fuck!?"

00:18:16.661 --> 00:18:18.130
And he's like "Yeah,
I took the spread."

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.564
We're at this bar and I'm like

00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:21.666
"You put $5,000
on this fuckin'?"

00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:23.502
He's not a rich guy. I'm like,
"Why are you doin' this?"

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:25.670
He's like "I dunno,
I'm just into it now.

00:18:25.703 --> 00:18:27.606
I'm in deep.
I'm betting a lot."

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:32.010
You're like 5 grand
on a fucking football game.

00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:34.546
That is crazy, I wanna do that.

00:18:35.613 --> 00:18:39.217
You wanna do that? This keeps
getting so Ron geeked up.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.153
He's like fuck yeah.

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.055
He goes "what's
your buddy's number?"

00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:46.791
My buddy, Little J,
his ex-girlfriend's step-father,

00:18:46.824 --> 00:18:49.461
looked like Kenny Rogers
and worked for a bookie

00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:51.563
or was a bookie,
I don't remember,

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:54.633
but whatever it is,
all of our buddies, not me,

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.301
because I didn't gamble
like that,

00:18:56.334 --> 00:18:58.036
but they all got way into it.

00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:00.805
I'm talking about like having
to pawn shit, sell stuff,

00:19:00.838 --> 00:19:04.075
sometimes have a ton of money,
like buy a used car,

00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:06.778
you know, we're teenagers,
so you'd buy a used car

00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:08.747
with a couple grand
you won one week

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.717
and then you'd go buy a system
to put in in, a sound system,

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.820
then the next week you have
to sell the sound system.

00:19:15.853 --> 00:19:17.422
No exaggeration,

00:19:17.455 --> 00:19:20.959
but it was all like
in the realm of 5 grand or less,

00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:23.361
but to teenagers, you might
as well say a million dollars.

00:19:23.394 --> 00:19:24.729
That's a lot of money.

00:19:24.762 --> 00:19:26.097
I mean $5,000

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.766
That's a lot of money
to an adult.

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.968
I swear to you the first time
my bank account hit $5,000

00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:31.603
was a memorable moment
in my life

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:33.338
and it was way too late
in life to feel that way.

00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:36.107
One of those moments
where you were like "Uh,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.109
I probably should have felt
this about 10, 15 years ago.

00:19:38.142 --> 00:19:39.878
Yeah, you're like man, if I
could have only been about this,

00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:41.279
but then he goes,
but I shouldn't though.

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:42.647
Have you ever hung out-

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.949
Four digits baby!

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:45.383
I remember when I was really
broke,

00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:46.785
hanging out with one
of my married friends

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.620
who wasn't as broke,
he was married

00:19:48.653 --> 00:19:51.022
and they both kinda
had stable lives

00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:56.127
and he left his ATM receipt
in the ATM and we were leaving.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.562
I was like, "Oh your receipt"

00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.264
and I looked at it
and there was like,

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.935
he had like $3,200 in savings,
I was like Whoa!

00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:05.003
Oh you're dealing
with a rich guy.

00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:08.406
I was gonna say, the Kenny
Rogers guy, though,

00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:11.776
when everybody got
into him deep started,

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:15.080
he would try to do drive
by intimidation.

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.581
Like roll his window
down slowly?

00:20:16.614 --> 00:20:18.717
Yes, he'd pull up next to us
in a car,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.552
like I'd be in a car
with a buddy

00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:23.722
and it's a guy that looks like
Kenny Rogers, be like,

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:26.524
"Boys, I notice you're doin'
a lot of drivin' around

00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:28.426
and not comin' by
to give me my money."

00:20:28.459 --> 00:20:31.796 align:start position:0%
And once he realized that he had
nothing more than that to do,

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:34.432
they would just start bein' like
"Fuck you Gus"

00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:36.167
or whatever his name was.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.936
And the window
slowly goes back up.

00:20:37.969 --> 00:20:40.839
They literally eventually just,
by the way my buddy,

00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:44.175 size:88% position:44%
actually two of my buddies
banged the step-daughter,

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:46.211
and but they just
kept disrespectfully

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:48.013
not paying him back

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:50.048
and then they found out that
there's nothing he could do,

00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:52.917
he's not affiliated, he was just
doing it for a bigger money guy.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.620
He had to murder one person
just so he could,

00:20:55.653 --> 00:20:57.088
so you guys
wouldn't mess with him.

00:20:57.121 --> 00:20:58.857
Yeah, you gotta spill some blood

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.126
The problem was, you could see
this guy wasn't a blood spiller.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.894
It's Kenny Rogers man.

00:21:03.494 --> 00:21:04.896
He starts every sentence
with "How you doin'?"

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.132
Yeah, that's what
he looked like.

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:08.867
That's my dad right there.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.502
Kenny Rogers

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.070
I got a real Kenny Rogers
thing goin' right now.

00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:13.571
Yeah, it seemed like he goes

00:21:13.604 --> 00:21:15.607
"You guys are really
lettin' me down."

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.375
That's what he says,
that's his intimidation,

00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:18.843
he emotionally intimidates you?

00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:20.245
Yeah

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.680
He goes,
"You guys, I expected more."

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:24.115
Come on boys, a fair man's game.

00:21:24.148 --> 00:21:25.483
I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.

00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:27.452
I thought you were a man
of your word.

00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:31.056
Apparently a man's word
means diddly-squat around here.

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:34.226
Apparently the money
means more to you, keep it.

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.862
Just remember, I don't forget
that you took the Panthers

00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:42.334
five and a half.
That was in New Orleans.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.636
When the gambling happened
online,

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:47.939
at one point,
my buddy had WebTV

00:21:47.972 --> 00:21:50.675
and figured out how to gamble
through that, but it was weird.

00:21:50.708 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
You were gambling through WebTV,
but it was still like a guy's

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:55.914
gonna come to your house
about this.

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.582
Really?

00:21:57.615 --> 00:21:59.284
It wasn't done through
credit cards stuff

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:00.719
right out of the gates.

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:02.821
It was like Craig's List
for gambling.

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.789
Is that a good way to put it,
do you know what I mean?

00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:07.058
Yeah, I never fucked
with gambling,

00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:11.930
it was like cocaine,
if I get into this I will get,

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:15.200
I will care about
a Pacers/Bucks game

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:17.802
at one in the morning
that I shouldn't care about.

00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:20.205
I've never gambled money
that would change my life.

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:22.507
I think I've definitely told
that story of that guy's

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.943
whose couch I lived on
when I moved to Hoboken,

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:26.978
was a buddy of mine.
He worked on Wall Street

00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:30.048
and he gambled in a way
that was very Wall Street-y.

00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:32.117
Because I knew him in college
and he was just like

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.352
"Yeah, you can stay
on my couch in Hoboken."

00:22:34.385 --> 00:22:37.355
And I would watch him,
it was the Florida-Ohio

00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:39.357
State National
Championship game,

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.594
he put 500 down on Florida
or on Ohio State,

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:44.295
they were losing,
he put a thousand down,

00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:47.532
and it just kept climbing
until that night he was betting

00:22:47.565 --> 00:22:52.003
$3,000 on a WNBA game.
And I was like "That's crazy,

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:53.805
that he's just like
I gotta make it back,

00:22:53.838 --> 00:22:56.841
I gotta make it back."
And it was all in one night.

00:22:56.874 --> 00:22:58.710
I went out to do open mics
and I came back

00:22:58.743 --> 00:23:01.613
and he's like
"I'm fucked, I'm fucked,

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:04.048
the Bucks fuckin' lost and like
all this shit happened".

00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:05.683 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Bird let me down.

00:23:05.716 --> 00:23:07.919
Yeah, he's like "Do you
understand Rebecca

00:23:07.952 --> 00:23:09.487 line:92%
Lobo went off?"

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.890
But I feel like the juice
only hits you

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.726
if you don't have
a lot of money,

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:17.695
you need money, you gamble
and you win money.

00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:21.266
What I don't understand
is high roller gambling.

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.867
Like Floyd Mayweather?

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.270
Sorta like that,
I don't understand the idea of,

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:28.173
I've heard, like
Cooming, and I'm not divulging,

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:30.776
he talked about it
on Legion of Skanks one time

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.278
and I'm making up
the number,

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.979
but it was something
astronomical and he'd be like

00:23:35.012 --> 00:23:39.617
I lost about 17 grand gambling
at the tables and so and so.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.619
And you're like
it's a blip on his radar,

00:23:41.652 --> 00:23:45.257 align:start position:0%
but it's also but the difference
is if you won 17 grand there.

00:23:46.123 --> 00:23:50.862
In your world, that's like
buying an amazing used car

00:23:50.895 --> 00:23:52.363
or a decent new car.

00:23:52.396 --> 00:23:54.265
I think the action
is still there,

00:23:54.298 --> 00:23:56.768
the action of the,
the adrenaline of

00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:58.169
"is it gonna win?"

00:23:58.202 --> 00:23:59.637
It just hurts a lot less
if you lose.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.872
But if you can lose it,
what's the-

00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:02.507
It just hurts a lot less,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.775
but I think the adrenaline
rush is still there.

00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:04.976
Do you gamble? Like at casinos?

00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:06.144
Oh, I never gamble, no.

00:24:06.177 --> 00:24:07.579
YOu've never played card games?

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.481
I never understood it.
I don't get it.

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:12.684
To me, it's like,
if I want more money, I'll work.

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:16.922
Yeah, for sure, not put on the
heels of someone else's talent.

00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:22.193
Not luck, if anything,
life has proven to me,

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:24.262
I don't really have
a lucky route.

00:24:24.295 --> 00:24:27.398
I'm just gonna try to work
and get money

00:24:27.431 --> 00:24:29.334
and also being a big video
game player,

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:31.035
especially from a child,

00:24:31.068 --> 00:24:32.670
I don't understand
slot machines,

00:24:32.703 --> 00:24:35.139
you put a quarter in it beeps,
maybe something happens.

00:24:35.172 --> 00:24:38.042
I can play a video game,
I know I'm gonna have fun,

00:24:38.075 --> 00:24:39.477
it's gonna be a great time,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.979
why would I,
it don't make sense.

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:43.314
Any time I do
any kind of lottery,

00:24:43.347 --> 00:24:45.116
like the scratch off lottery,

00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:48.386
I don't even understand when
people just have the give me

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:50.555
a win-for-life
and it's just you scratch it

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:53.258
and see if you have three
matching thing,

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:56.127
like I have only ever done
the bingo

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.395
or the crossword puzzle one...

00:24:57.428 --> 00:24:58.963
So you want a game?

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:01.666
For my two to five dollars,
I want to play a game.

00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:04.369
I wanna sit there and go "oh,
did I get it? Did I get Bingo?"

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:07.105
What if they mixed gambling
and video games?

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:08.506
They have
They have a bit.

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:10.308
What if I just made it up
right now

00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:11.910
and you guys are lying?

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:14.379
You better build a time machine
mother fucker.

00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:17.916
Turn off the goddamn cameras,
I just invented something.

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:19.551
Try to fucking undercut me.

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.352
Jacob, what are you
writing down?

00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:23.588
Are you writing down
my video game-gambling idea?
