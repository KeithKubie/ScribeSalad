00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.410
Let's think about one-fourth
plus 0.32 a different way.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.340
Previously, we turned one-fourth into
a decimal and added it that way.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.830
But we can also solve
it by adding fractions.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.230
That means we have to convert
a decimal into a fraction.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.160
But how do we do that?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
First let's think about how
we even read decimal numbers.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.570
What is the proper way
to state this decimal?

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.219
Is it 627 tenths?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.217
627 hundreths?

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:37.297
Or 627 thousandths?

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:38.610
Please select one.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.859
