00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.720
I've got the function y is
equal to x minus 3 squared

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.370
times x minus 1.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.390
And what I want to do is
think about rotating the part

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.480
of this function that
sits right over here

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.130
between x is equal
to 1 and x equals 3.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.400
And x equals 3 and x
equals 1 are clearly

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.530
the zeroes of this
function right over here.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.760
And I want to take this
region and rotate it

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.120
around the y-axis.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.460
And if I did that,
I'd get a shape

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.760
that looks something like that.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.880
And I want to figure out
the volume of that shape.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.480
And what we're going
to do is a new method

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.487
called the shell method.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:39.820
And the reason we're going
to use the shell method-- you

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.236
might say, hey,
in the past, we've

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:43.450
rotated things around
a vertical line before.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.550
We used the disk method.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.445
We wrote everything
as a function of y,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.320
et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.360
We created all of these disks.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.440
We figured out the volume
of each of those disks.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.710
But the problem here is
this is hard to express

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.980
as a function of y.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.830
How do you solve explicitly
for y right over here?

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.040
So instead, we're going to
keep things in terms of x

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.129
and have a different geometric
visualization for how

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.746
we can come up with the volume.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.620
What we're going to
imagine instead-- instead

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.820
of constructing disks, we're
going to construct shells.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.780
And what do I mean by a shell?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.770
So for each x at the interval,
on this kind of cut of it,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.400
we can construct a rectangle.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.010
And what happens if we were
to rotate this rectangle?

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.030
So this is the rectangle
right over here.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.460
What happens if we rotate this
rectangle around the y-axis

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.740
along with everything else?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.430
I'll try my best
attempt to draw it.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.480
It's going to look
something like this.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.130
This is challenging
my art skills,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.750
but I think I can handle it.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.260
So it's going to look
something not too

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.420
dissimilar to that
right over there.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.930
So it looks like a
hollowed-out cylinder.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.720
I guess that's why
we call it a shell.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.200
And it's going to
have some depth.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.525
The depth is going to be dx.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.669
And the height
right over here is

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.950
going to be the
value of my function.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.960
The height is f of x.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.030
In this case, f of x is x minus
3 squared times x minus 1.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.620
How do we figure out the
volume of a cylinder like this?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.570
Well, if we can figure out the
circumference of the cylinder,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.870
and then multiply that
circumference times the height

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.970
of the cylinder,
we'd essentially

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.890
figure out the area
of the outside surface

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.220
of our cylinder.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.730
And then if we multiply the
area of the outside surface

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.660
of our cylinder by that
infinitesimally small depth,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.080
then that'll give
us the volume--

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.714
I shouldn't say
cylinder-- of our shell.

00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:48.630
So let's try to do it.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.630
What is the
circumference of a shell?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.150
What is the circumference
of one shell going to be?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.950
Well, it's going to be 2 pi
times the radius of that shell.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.130
We need to express this
as a function of x.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.810
And so what is that going to be?

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.720
It's going to be 2 pi.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.210
So for a given x,
what is the radius?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.150
Well, the radius right over here
is just the horizontal distance

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.540
between the y-axis and that x.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.120
So that's just x.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.590
So the circumference,
in this case,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.560
is just going to
be 2 pi times x.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.580
Now, what is the height going to
be for any one of those shells?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.100
The height is
going to be f of x.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.710
This is right over here.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.920
And so what is going to be the
surface area of the outside?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.830
So let me put this in quotes--
"outside" surface area.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.007
I'm not worried about the
depth right now, the dx.

00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.340
I'm not worried about this
top part and the bottom part.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.237
I'm just worried about
the outside surface area.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.820
Well, the outside
surface area is just

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.778
going to be the circumference
times the height.

00:04:01.778 --> 00:04:07.670
It's going to be 2
pi x times f of x.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.516
And in this situation,
in the situation

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:10.890
we're looking at
right over here,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.920
that's going to be 2 pi x
times x minus 3 squared times x

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.630
minus 1.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.250
Now, what's going
to be the volume?

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.690
So the volume of the
shell-- shell volume--

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.680
is just going to be all
this business times dx.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.670
So it's going to be 2
pi x times f of x dx.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.850
And so now we're ready to
integrate over the interval.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.190
So the volume of
our entire shape

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.020
is going to be the
definite integral.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.436
We're going to integrate over
all the x's in the interval,

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:58.480
from x is equal to 1 to x
is equal to 3 of this thing.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.220
And we could take
the 2 pi out front.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.730
So we'll put 2 pi out front.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.970
And on the inside,
we have x times f

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.910
of x, which in our
situation, is this business.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.000
So it's going to be x times
x minus 3 squared times x

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.700
minus 1.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.715
And then, of course,
we have our dx.

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:23.590
So there you have it.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.740
Using the shell method, we have
set up our definite integral

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.320
for the volume of this
strange-looking shape right

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.020
over there.
