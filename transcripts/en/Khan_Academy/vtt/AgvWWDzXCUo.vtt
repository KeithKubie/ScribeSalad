00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.080
Suppose marketing experts have
determined the relationship

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.330
between the selling price of an
item and the quantity sold

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.670
of an item can be represented
by the linear equation q is

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.490
equal to negative
30s plus 800.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.260
Where q is the quantity sold
in a year, and s is the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.970
selling price.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.585
That makes sense.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:20.200
If our selling price is higher,
then this whole thing

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.580
is going to become more
negative, and we're

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.740
going to sell less.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.780
If we lower our price, we're
going to sell more.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.950
Fair enough.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.350
They tell us that if the cost of
to produce the item is $20,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.690
what is the selling price that
optimizes the yearly profit?

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's think a little bit about
what yearly profit means.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990
Let's think a little bit
about yearly profit.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.360
The profit is going to be equal
to the quantity that you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.040
sell times what?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.090
For each unit, what you care
about is the profit per unit,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.720
and the profit per unit is the
selling price per unit minus

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.210
the cost of producing
that unit.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.940
The cost of producing
the unit right there

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170
is $20-- minus $20.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.260
That makes sense.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.800
If you're selling something for
$30, and it costs you $20

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.910
to make it, every unit that
you sell, you'll make

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.200
$10-- 30 minus 20.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.240
If you sell two units, it's
going to be 2 times $10, and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.750
you're going to make $20.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.220
Nothing really groundbreaking
right here.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.570
Right now we have profit as a
function of q, of quantity and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.250
selling price, but we have
quantity as a function of

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.380
selling price right here, so we
could substitute this whole

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.400
expression right here
in for quantity.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.900
What happens to our profit
function then?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.610
Then we can rewrite our profit
function as being equal to--

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.340
instead of writing q, we could
say it as the same thing as

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:02.090
negative 30s plus 800
times s minus 20.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.130
Let's multiply this out so we
have a nice, clean trinomial.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.160
Our profit is going to be equal
to negative 30s times s

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.550
and that's negative
30s squared.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.000
Negative 30s times negative 20
is positive 600s, and 800

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.030
times s is 800s.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.530
Then, 800 times negative 20
times negative 2 would be

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.640
negative 1,600, so it's going
to be negative 16,000, if I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.890
did it right.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.770
This right here is our profit
function, and we can merge

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.400
these middle two terms
right here.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.800
We have our profit is equal to
negative 30s squared plus

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.170
1,400s-- just merging
these middle two

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.300
terms-- minus 16,000.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.450
Now, we have a negative
coefficient on the s squared

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.410
term, which tells us this will
be a downward opening

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.500
parabola, and so let's think
a little bit about it.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.300
If this is our profit axis,
and this right here is our

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.910
selling price axis, this
parabola is going to look

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.750
something like this-- I don't
know exactly what it will look

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.280
like, but it will look
something like this.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.150
It will be downward opening.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.250
We're asked to find the selling
price that optimizes

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.130
the yearly profit.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.880
It's optimal if it's as high as
possible, so we're going to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.730
look for a maximum point.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.660
We're going to look for that
maximum point right there,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.130
find the selling point that
gives us that maximum point.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.650
we've seen.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.360
This before.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.840
That's the selling point, or
the s coordinate of the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.490
vertex-- we need to find the
s coordinate of the vertex.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.020
The easiest way to think of
doing that is to put this

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.580
function into our vertex
form, so let's do that.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.860
The easiest way to do that I
can think of-- well, we're

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.650
going to come a little bit of
completing the square and all

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.590
that, but we've seen all of this
before, so let's take it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.230
step by step.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.120
First thing I like to do is
factor out the negative 30, so

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.180
we have a clean coefficient
on the s squared.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.600
We could write price is equal to
negative 30 times s squared

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.670
plus-- 1,400 hundred divided
by negative 30 is negative

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.520
140/3, and you can divide
both by 10 s.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.040
Then, 16,000 divided by negative
30 is positive 1,600

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.260
divided by 3-- you take a 0 off
of each of those, you have

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.810
a negative divided by a
negative, they cancel out.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.880
That's what we're left with--
actually, let me write this

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.180
positive 1,600/3 a little bit
further out, so plus 1,600/3.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.700
All I did so far is that I
just factored out this

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.850
negative 30.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.110
What we can do now is we can add
and subtract a term here

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.020
so that the first three
terms here become a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.390
perfect square trinomial.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.890
That way, we can get into
that vertex form.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.620
So what do we add
and subtract?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.120
Negative 140/3 can be rewritten
as 2 times negative

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.020
70 over 3, so what you want to
add and subtract is negative

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.030
70 over 3 squared, or half
of negative 140/3.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.740
You want to add that
squared, so plus

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.950
negative 70 over 3 squared.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.310
We can't just add it to one side
without doing anything

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.140
else, so let's also subtract it
from that same side-- so,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.630
minus negative 70
over 3 squared.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.240
We really haven't changed the
equation at all, but we're

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.220
just adding and subtracting the
same thing to both sides.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.510
What that allows us to do is
to make this into a perfect

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.520
square trinomial-- this is a
perfect square trinomial.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.430
We can rewrite our profit
function-- our profit function

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.410
is equal to negative 30 times
this thing right here, which

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.160
is a perfect square-- it is
s minus 70 over 3 squared.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.770
Then we have all of this
business over here: minus

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.220
minus negative 70 over
3 squared plus 1,600

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.365
hundred over 3.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.520
The next thing we can do is
redistribute this negative

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.300
30-- let me scroll down,
so we have some

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.310
space to do this with.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.670
We could say price is equal
to negative 30 times this

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.840
expression right here, which is
5 minus 70 over 3-- sorry,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.200
not 5 minus, that's an s, and
we have to be very careful.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.180
That's our selling price s minus
70 over 3 squared, and

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.500
then that's negative 3 times
its first term, and then we

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.230
have to multiply negative 30
times each of these terms.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.040
It's negative 30 times this,
and a negative times a

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.830
negative is a positive-- 30
divided by 3 is 10, so it's

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.360
going to be plus 10 times
negative 70 squared, which we

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.970
could evaluate if we want.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.870
Negative 30 times 1,600 over 3
will be negative 10 times 3--

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.550
it'll be negative 16,000.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.530
We can simplify this.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.490
Negative 70 squared is what?

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:29.030
It's positive 4,900 times 10,
and you get 49,000 minus

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.850
16,000, which is 33,000.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.920
We might as well do that, so
this whole thing simplifies to

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.530
our profit function-- our yearly
profit-- is negative 30

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.970
times s minus 70
over 3 squared.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.690
Let me make sure I did that
right: 7 times 7 is 49, and

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.550
then you have-- no, it's
4,900, so let me

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.020
be very clear here.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:00.880
It's 7 times 7 is 4,900, and
then times 10 is 49,000.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.860
Let me make sure I got it-- yes,
49,000 minus 16,000 is

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.792
33,000, so plus 33,000.

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:12.110
It's just like that.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.543
When is this thing maximized?

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.160
If you look right here, this
term right here-- this s minus

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.260
70 over 3 squared-- is always
going to be positive, or it's

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.040
always going to be non-negative,
it could be 0.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.840
So when you multiply times a
negative number, it's always

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.740
going to be a negative, so this
thing is always going to

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.080
be non-positive-- it could
be equal to 0.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.799
So, the profit is going to take
its highest value when

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.580
this whole expression is 0.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.159
And when is this whole
expression going to be 0?

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.145
The whole expression is going
to be 0 when s is

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:51.530
equal to 70 over 3.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.440
That's when it equals 0.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.300
Just so we have a better sense
of that, what is 70/3?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.680
That is-- 3 goes into 70, 3 goes
into 7 two times, 2 times

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.840
3 is 6, bring down it down and
get a 10, 3 goes into 10 three

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.670
times, 3 times 3 is
9, and subtract.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.770
You get another 10, so it's
23.3333333-- you can view it

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.980
that way, it just
keeps repeating.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.740
Or, you could say the ideal
selling price is $23.33.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.380
So, the ideal selling price, the
maximum selling price, the

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:36.190
selling price that optimizes
our profit is $23.33.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:41.110
When you do sell for $23.33,
this is going to be 0, that

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.865
whole thing is going to
be 0, and your profit

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.250
is going to be $33,000.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.510
At that point, your profit
is going to be

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.930
$33,000 for the year.
