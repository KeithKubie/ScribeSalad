00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.939
So the answer to this question is the combination that leaves the most Warfarin

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.859
around to have a maximum affect. VKORC1 is involved in

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:15.750
the pharmacodynamic response. So if we have less of it around.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.780
Then there's more Warfarin to VKORC1, so we can saturate our VKORC1

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.626
faster, with less VKROC1 around. CYP2C9 represents

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.866
the pharmacokinetic aspect of Warfarin, because it

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:33.220
metabolizes or breaks Warfarin down. Well if CYP2C9

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.990
is slow. Then that means we're going to end

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.550
up with more Warfarin around. And vitamin K

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.120
is downstream in the pathway, and since

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.800
vitamin K itself promotes blood clotting, which is

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.900
the opposite of what Warfarin is trying to do, if we have low to no vitamin

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.470
K, no leafy greens in this case, then we don't need as much Warfarin to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.290
block the effects of the vitamin K

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.740
recycling to promote blood clotting. So less VKORC1,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.090
a slow or reduced activity for CYP2C9. And low to no vitamin K supplemented in

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.280
other ways. Knowing your explanation that you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.820
tried to write out to justify your combination.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.830
Hopefully you recongize that the pharmacodynamic or PD pathway was with VKORC1.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.490
The pharmacokinetic pathway was with CYP2C9.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.510
And then a max toxicity, essentially is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.460
maximizing the pharmacodynamic pathway and minimizing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.320
the pharmacokinetic pathway. If we wanted an

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.340
optimum efficacy, minimum toxicity, we would have to be somewhere in the middle

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.630
that allows Warfarin to achieve its function of blocking some amount

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.990
of blood clotting. But not so much that it promotes bleeding. So

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.550
recognizing that this combination is not what we want is really one

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.660
of the first major steps to understanding what the right prescription is.
