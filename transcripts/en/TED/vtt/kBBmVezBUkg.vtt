00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.206
When my 91-year-old mother, Elia,
moved in with me,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.630
I thought I was doing her a service.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.071
In fact, it was the other way around.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:28.084
You see, Mom was having issues
with memory loss and accepting her age.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.016
She looked defeated.

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:35.329
I tried to make her
as comfortable as possible,

00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:37.749
but when I was at my easel, painting,

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:41.368
I would peek over
and see her just ... there.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:44.857
She'd be staring at nothing in particular.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.387
I'd watch her slowly climb the stairs,

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:51.662
and she wasn't the mom I grew up with.

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:55.418
I saw, instead, a frail,

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:59.109
tiny, old woman.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.875
A few weeks went by,
and I needed a break from my painting.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.557
I wanted to play with the new camera
I had just bought.

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:10.970
I was excited --
it had all sorts of dials,

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:13.319
buttons and settings I wanted to learn,

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:18.029
so I set up my tripod
facing this large mirror,

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:23.419
blocking the doorway
to the only bathroom in the house.

00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:24.593
(Laughter)

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:27.815
After a while, I hear,

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:31.736
(Imitating Italian accent)
"I need to use the washroom."

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.761
(Laughter)

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:35.793
"Five minutes, Mom. I need to do this."

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:41.101
15 minutes later, and I hear, again,

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.797
"I need to use the washroom."

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:47.046
"Five more minutes."

00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:49.180
Then this happened.

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:57.288
(Laughter)

00:01:57.312 --> 00:02:04.255
(Applause)

00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:06.786
And this.

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:14.585
(Laughter)

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.299
And then, this.

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:25.783
(Laughter)

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:28.848
I had my "aha!" moment.

00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:30.348
We connected.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.983
We had something tangible
we could do together.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.325
My mom was born in a small
mountain village in central Italy,

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.815
where her parents had land and sheep.

00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:47.537
At a young age,
her father died of pneumonia,

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:51.789
leaving his wife and two daughters alone
with all the heavy chores.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.696
They found that they couldn't cope.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.878
So a very hard decision was made.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.950
Mom, the oldest, at 13,

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:07.895
was married off to a complete
stranger twice her age.

00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:13.458
She went from being just a kid
and was pushed into adulthood.

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.518
Mom had her first child
when she was only 16.

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:23.720
Years later, and now living in Toronto,

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:26.030
Mom got work in a clothing factory

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:30.815
and soon became manager
of a very large sewing department.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.363
And because it was full
of immigrant workers,

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:38.395
Mom taught herself words
from translation books.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.768
She then practiced them in French,
Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish,

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:46.982
Polish, Russian, Romanian, Hungarian,
all around the house.

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:53.425
I was in awe of her focus
and determination to succeed

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.183
at whatever she loved to do.

00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:59.529
After that bathroom "aha!" moment,

00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:04.066
I practiced my newfound camera skills
with Mom as portrait model.

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:08.504
Through all of this,
she talked, and I listened.

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:13.177
She'd tell me about her early childhood
and how she was feeling now.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.952
We had each other's attention.

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:19.396
Mom was losing her short-term memory,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.353
but was better recalling
her younger years.

00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:25.521
I'd ask, and she would tell me stories.

00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:28.995
I listened, and I was her audience.

00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:31.353
I got ideas.

00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:34.433
I wrote them down,
and I sketched them out.

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:38.736
I showed her what to do
by acting out the scenarios myself.

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:41.672
We would then stage them.

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:47.173
So she posed, and I learned
more about photography.

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:53.156
Mom loved the process, the acting.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.347
She felt worthy again,
she felt wanted and needed.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.744
And she certainly wasn't camera-shy.

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:04.540
(Laughter)

00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:11.510
(Applause)

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:15.717
Mom laughed hysterically at this one.

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:19.069
(Laughter)

00:05:19.093 --> 00:05:23.547
The idea for this image
came from an old German film I'd seen,

00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:25.971
about a submarine, called "Das Boot."

00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:30.244
As you can see, what I got instead
looked more like "E.T."

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:32.149
(Laughter)

00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:35.839
So I put this image aside,
thinking it was a total failure,

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:38.728
because it didn't reach
my particular vision.

00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:41.140
But Mom laughed so hard,

00:05:41.164 --> 00:05:46.105
I eventually, for fun,
decided to post it online anyway.

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.065
It got an incredible amount of attention.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:56.022
Now, with any Alzheimer's, dementia,

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:59.799
there's a certain amount
of frustration and sadness

00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:01.290
for everyone involved.

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:05.196
This is Mom's silent scream.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.712
Her words to me one day were,

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:12.950
"Why is my head so full of things to say,

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:17.513
but before they reach my mouth,
I forget what they are?"

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:25.802
"Why is my head so full of things to say,

00:06:27.946 --> 00:06:32.119
but before they reach my mouth,
I forget what they are?"

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:40.833
(Applause)

00:06:44.564 --> 00:06:49.818
Now, as full-time care partner
and full-time painter,

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.000
I had my frustrations too.

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.969
(Laughter)

00:06:55.588 --> 00:06:58.842
But to balance off
all the difficulties, we played.

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:00.802
That was Mom's happy place.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.426
And I needed her to be there, too.

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.607
(Laughter)

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.585
(Laughter)

00:07:15.093 --> 00:07:19.172
(Laughter)

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.426
Now, Mom was also preoccupied with aging.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.402
She would say,
"How did I get so old, so fast?"

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.690
(Audience sighs)

00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:43.146
"So old."

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:49.945
"So fast."

00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:56.902
I also got Mom to model
for my oil paintings.

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.742
This painting is called "The Dressmaker."

00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.085
I remember, as a kid,

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.823
Mom sewing clothes for the whole family

00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:11.364
on this massive, heavy sewing machine

00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:14.161
that was bolted
to the floor in the basement.

00:08:15.173 --> 00:08:19.591
Many nights, I would go downstairs
and bring my schoolwork with me.

00:08:20.808 --> 00:08:24.560
I would sit behind her
in this overstuffed chair.

00:08:25.935 --> 00:08:30.760
The low hum of the huge motor
and the repetitive stitching sounds

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:32.250
were comforting to me.

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:35.445
When Mom moved into my house,

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:39.405
I saved this machine and stored it
in my studio for safekeeping.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.353
This painting brought me
back to my childhood.

00:08:44.284 --> 00:08:46.099
The interesting part

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:50.026
was that it was now Mom,
sitting behind me,

00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:53.427
watching me paint her

00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:56.078
working on that very same
machine she sewed at

00:08:57.276 --> 00:09:01.522
when I sat behind her, watching her sew,

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:03.886
50 years earlier.

00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:11.807
I also gave Mom a project to do,
to keep her busy and thinking.

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.998
I provided her with a small camera

00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:17.973
and asked her to take at least
10 pictures a day of anything she wanted.

00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:20.412
These are Mom's photographs.

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:24.877
She's never held a camera
in her life before this.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.156
She was 93.

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:56.481
We would sit down together
and talk about our work.

00:09:57.187 --> 00:09:58.862
I would try to explain

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.044
(Laughter)

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:02.990
how and why I did them,

00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:06.164
the meaning, the feeling,
why they were relevant.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.855
Mom, on the other hand,
would just bluntly say,

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.053
"sÃ¬,"

00:10:12.077 --> 00:10:13.561
"no,"

00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:15.720
"bella" or "bruta."

00:10:15.744 --> 00:10:17.323
(Laughter)

00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:19.547
I watched her facial expressions.

00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:26.554
She always had the last say,
with words or without.

00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:32.407
This voyage of discovery
hasn't ended with Mom.

00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:37.181
She is now in an assisted
living residence,

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:39.539
a 10-minute walk away from my home.

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:42.905
I visit her every other day.

00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:47.405
Her dementia had gotten to the point

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.780
where it was unsafe for her
to be in my house.

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:52.267
It has a lot of stairs.

00:10:54.546 --> 00:10:56.746
She doesn't know my name anymore.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.993
(Voice breaking)
But you know what? That's OK.

00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:05.314
She still recognizes my face

00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:09.187
and always has a big smile
when she sees me.

00:11:10.813 --> 00:11:17.574
(Applause)

00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:24.369
(Applause ends)

00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:27.544
I don't take pictures of her anymore.

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:31.077
That wouldn't be fair
or ethical on my part.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.457
And she wouldn't understand
the reasons for doing them.

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.544
My father,

00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:39.545
my brother,

00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:41.625
(Voice breaking) my nephew,

00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:49.354
my partner and my best friend,

00:11:49.378 --> 00:11:51.242
all passed away suddenly.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.998
And I didn't have the chance

00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:57.485
to tell them how much
I appreciated and loved them.

00:11:58.807 --> 00:12:02.740
With Mom, I need to be there

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:06.422
and make it a very long goodbye.

00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:15.500
(Applause)

00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:21.961
(Applause ends)

00:12:22.684 --> 00:12:26.783
For me, it's about being present
and really listening.

00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:30.549
Dependents want to feel
a part of something, anything.

00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:34.065
It doesn't need to be something
exceptionally profound that's shared --

00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.302
it could be as simple as walks together.

00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:40.658
Give them a voice

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:44.558
of interaction, participation,

00:12:44.582 --> 00:12:47.126
and a feeling of belonging.

00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:51.085
Make the time meaningful.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:56.117
Life, it's about wanting to live

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:58.648
and not waiting to die.

00:13:01.787 --> 00:13:08.751
(Applause)

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:12.489
(Applause ends)

00:13:14.776 --> 00:13:18.641
Can I get a wave and a smile
from everyone, please?

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.164
(Laughter)

00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:21.588
This is for you, Mom.

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:24.704
(Camera clicks)

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:31.253
(Applause)
