00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I can't tell if it's focused

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.289
Stay right there. Hey It's me Destin, Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. This is my wife, Tara. My better half.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.610
[laughs] Every year in December

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.660
I make a video about an orphanage in Peru called Not Forgotten. Tara went down and visited many many years ago and came home and said

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.700
'Hey, this is our thing now. We're gonna.. We're gonna help this orphanage', and so I went down

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.680
There's this guy named Tyler Fuqua and a buddy of mine named CJ. Jacobs. It was their vision

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.180
to build this thing and I got behind it.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.220
And, you got behind it. I did a 'Project for Awesome' video years ago and money started coming in.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.820
Now the thing with giving money to organizations is 'Sometimes helping can hurt'. I wanted to say that this has worked

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.820
and I'm super excited about this. Every year, we have taken our hand more and more off the tiller.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.020
This is a project that's being run by Peruvians, and it's working.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.620
It's a family-centered model, it's not like "hey, let's get a big house and let's shove it full of orphans and try to keep them alive until adulthood".

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.840
Way different than that. It's a family centered model which is very unique.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.860
Tyler and his wife, they came up with this model, and we got behind it in a big way

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
And you got behind it in a big way. Well usually I go down and I make a video and I make an appeal

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.300
every December for support for Not Forgotten in the form of Patreon donations. But this year, a guy named Jordan went down.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.380
The cool thing about this is Jordan is a videographer

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.760
and he's really really good at what he does. And he made a video about

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.900
just the fact that this thing is running on its own. There's no... I don't know. It's just running. By itself.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.300
It's sustainable and it's working and there's 25 kids with a home

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:51.280
and I want to play this video for you. The first time I saw it I cried.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.120
A lot of donation stuff is like "Oh, for the price of a cup of coffee a day you can have a blah blah blah, you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.900
can help a blah blah blah". No, we're not gonna do that to you.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.620
We're just gonna show you what's working and it's happening, and thanks for everybody that has been a part of it.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.160
And if you want to be a part of it, you can, we'll explain it after the video. There was nothing here when we started.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.120
And we've done this together.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.920
And it's really cool. So watch this.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.520
TYLER FUQUA: Iquitos is in the Amazon basin and it's really remote compared to anywhere else in Peru.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.720
It's not accessible by road, so the only way to get there is through flying on a plane or doing it by boat

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.360
It has created this isolated world where a lot of the problems that we deal with can live and fester without really being addressed

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.800
from a socially progressive mindset.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.540
It really has allowed all the problems to persist that we are addressing on a day to day basis

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.740
Las Lomas is the property and the home that we have in Iquitos. It really is a special place.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.460
It really creates a safe fun environment for kids to grow up in the childhood that's been in some ways robbed from them by their circumstances

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.680
A lot of our kids have different stories, but all of them have some similar themes.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.300
They've often been abused, abandoned, neglected,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.080
maybe just forgotten or uncared-for by their families or by their communities. When they come to Las Lomas,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.280
they are delayed physically and emotionally, educationally.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.440
At Not Forgotten, our goal is to provide a holistic and comprehensive care for these children

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.480
We want to meet their physical, educational, emotional, psychological and spiritual needs

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.380
We feel like it's very important this is balanced, otherwise they're not gonna have the skills or tools they need to really

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.580
be breakers of the cycles of abandonment, abuse, neglect, poverty, addiction that they came from.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500
GENE IOLETT: We have to recover the years

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
they did not receive quality attention

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.000
quality attention is not only providing material support

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.200
but also providing the spiritual support

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
and the emotional support

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.200
that a child should have

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.420
and that our children have never had.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.040
TYLER: One of the biggest problems that we face is the brokenness of families.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.260
Our goal at Not Forgotten is to try to recreate that family model.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.260
GENE: Normally, a children's home hires individuals

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.000
but they don't hire a family

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300
we hire families

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.600
to demonstrate a model of family to our children.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.980
TYLER: That cycle of mistrust is broken through providing food, a hug, helping with homework, helping them get dressed,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.340
helping them brush their teeth, welcoming them when they get home from school.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.940
All these things are small little things, but they add up to meeting these bigger needs of what a true mother and a true father

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.820
should be doing for these children, and that's something that they never had before.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.380
Not Forgotten is completely led by Peruvians,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.520
and I guess a really integral and key part of what we do.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.200
We recognize that the best and most important parts of our home is our staff.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.100
It's been really amazing to see the change to these kid's lives. To see them just blossom and grow is really really cool.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.800
GENE: What I want for the children of the Las Lomas is

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800
that they find healing for their wounds,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800
that they find healing for their souls.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.400
as a result we will have good professionals,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.400
good fathers, good citizens, good men.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.980
TARA: That's good.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.460
DESTIN: It's amazing what soft music can do. [laughs]

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.160
Alright, so that was the video.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.020
And we're excited that it's off the ground and running. Right? - Oh, absolutely.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.209
Yeah? - That's touching. - Yeah. Are you crying?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.140
I might have gotten a little too... - Okay, so here's the deal

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.120
Every year we do a Project for Awesome video in December and you can go vote at projectforawesome.com for Not Forgotten

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.040
But, the thing we're pushing towards nowadays is direct donations via Patreon and last year everyone who donated,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.790
we gave them this patch. It was a 2016 Not Forgotten patch

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.560
We're making 2017 Not Forgotten patches and 2018 Not Forgotten patches

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.380
And we would love to send those out to anybody who supports Not Forgotten on Patreon.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.490
That's really all there is to it:

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.900
There's two steps, if you want to help to do this really awesome thing that we've been working on since 2012.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.200
Number one: go vote for Not Forgotten at the Project for Awesome by clicking the first link in the video description

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.380
And number two is going to patreon.com/notforgotten

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.680
Going to Patreon and supporting is really the best thing you can do to get involved in this.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.920
We send you updates on the kids throughout the year,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.340
it's really an awesome thing.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.860
Thank you so much for considering doing this stuff with us. And for all you who've done it in the past,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.360
Man this is so cool to see this come together since 2012. Again there's two things to do,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.140
there's link 1 and link 2 immediately below this video.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.620
Please have at it and jump on board of this really cool thing.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.580
TARA: I'm excited for how a few years back it was

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.979
nothing but a piece of dirt, and now there's dozens of boys who have families

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.760
and that eventually they'll be... - Making mischief. [laughs]

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.060
And eventually it'll be dozens of men who are leaders in their society. So I'm excited.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.460
We're the Sandlins, you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one.
