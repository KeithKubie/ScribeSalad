00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.389
The Curious Case of Captain Robert Campbell

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.440
Captain Robert Campbell began his British
Army career in 1903 at the age of 18.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.340
Shortly after WWI started, in July of 1914
Campbell and the soldiers he was leading,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
the First Battalion East Surrey Regiment,
were sent to Mons-Condé canal in the north

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.470
west of France.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.410
One week later, after an attack by German
forces, Captain Campbell was seriously injured

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.099
and ultimately captured.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.230
He was then treated in a German military hospital
in Cologne, and, once healed up a bit, sent

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.690
to the prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Magdeburg,
Germany.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.699
None of this makes Captain Campbell particularly
unique in the “War to End All Wars.”

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.010
Between 1914 and 1918, approximately 10 million
civilians and servicemen were captured and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.510
interred at various detention camps.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.780
What makes Campbell’s story different is
something that happened two years after his

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
capture.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.149
Now in his early 30s, Captain Campbell received
word that his mother, Louise, was suffering

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.679
from terminal cancer.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.050
With nothing to lose, Campbell wrote directly
to Kaiser Wilhelm II, requesting compassionate

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.240
leave so that he might see her before she
passed.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.400
Surprisingly, the Kaiser agreed, granting
him two weeks leave provided he “gave his

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.240
word as a British Army officer that he would
return.”

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.200
After giving his word, Captain Campbell was
indeed released.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.650
Details of how he actually made it home have
been lost to history, but it is thought that

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
he traveled through the Netherlands and then
took a boat to Kent.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.670
Upon arriving home, he spent a week with his
mother before returning to the POW camp by

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.090
equally mysterious means.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.200
campbell-leave-of-absenceThere was no recorded
explanation in the British military archives

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.380
why no one in the army tried to block his
return, but presumably a British officer’s

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.820
honor being at stake had something to do with
it.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.980
Whatever the case, in February of 1917, Captain
Campbell’s mother died while he was still

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.980
a prisoner.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.360
Perhaps to keep himself occupied, and said
to be a matter of honor and duty, as soon

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.921
as Captain Campbell returned to the prison
camp, he and a group of other prisoners spent

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.420
the next nine months digging a tunnel out
of their camp.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.770
This tunnel project was partially successful
in that they were able to use it to escape

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.140
the camp, but were caught near the border
of the Netherlands and sent back.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.670
While you may think that Captain Campbell’s
story and the show of mercy and good faith

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.120
on Kaiser Wilhelm II’s part might have inspired
the British to do the same, this was not the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120
case.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.700
German POW Peter Gastreich was being held
at the Isle of Wight when he learned his father

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
was dying.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.569
He then asked for a leave of absence to go
seem him, but the British Prisoners of War

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.280
Department summarily ruled against this, stating,
they

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.430
“Cannot recognise the temporary release,
on parole, of Captain Campbell as a precedent

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.810
for such concessions.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.680
They were not consulted before leave was granted
to the Officer by the German Government and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.600
would not have consented to such a proposal
had it been put before them.”

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.579
At the war’s end, along with the other POWs,
Captain Campbell was released and remained

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.379
in the Army until he retired in 1925.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.239
When WWII began, Campbell rejoined the army
and served as the Chief Observer of the Royal

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.849
Observer Corps on the Isle of Wight.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.269
He lived to the ripe old age of 81.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:57.079
ultimately dying 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:19.260
in 1966.
