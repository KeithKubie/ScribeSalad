00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.620
The weather can change pretty quickly down here,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.420
and it can get extremely cold extremely quick.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.980
The minimum temperature with wind chill

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.300
is expected to be around -47 to -50 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.580
One of the main concerns is that we lose visibility quite frequently when the winds pick up.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.850
So every time we go out, we have survival
bags, so that we could survive for three days

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.120
if a really bad storm set in and we had to
stay out on the sea ice.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.740
I'm currently in the Crary Lab Research Facilities 
in McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.500
The very first time I came down here, I expected an environment that was just a flat sheet of ice.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.920
I was hit by the realization that Antarctica
is filled with mountains.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.340
The beauty of it really kind of surprised me.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.540
Research proposals that come in on an annual basis to do work down here, are probably up around

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.460
200 to 300 proposals a year, and they
may fund, on average, maybe 10 of those proposals.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.140
And so it's highly competitive.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.500
We're here looking at how the fish that are
adapted to subzero waters

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.380
are able to respond to changes in temperature.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.580
These fish typically see very little change
from year to year,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.220
but with climate change coming on, we expect that to be more variable.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.579
As well as changes in temperature, the ocean's also changing in pH.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.160
And so those combined effects may actually have some pretty negative impacts on the fish

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.060
as they try and adapt and respond.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.820
It is go, go, go, for us, seven days a week
for about three months.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.380
We have a relatively short season when the sea ice is stable enough for us to work on it,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.420
so we sometimes have even gone on three different fishing trips in a day.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.440
Typically we'll wake up and head over to the galley and grab a hot meal.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.040
Then we will head on over to the Crary Lab facilities where we do most of our research at.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.680
We'll gear up, get into a tractor vehicle
called a PistenBulley,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.120
and then we head out onto the sea ice 
to go fishing.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.840
Along the way, we may have to profile 
a few sea ice cracks

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.740
to make sure that the thickness of the ice 
 is safe enough to cross.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.960
"So right now we’re headed out towards Inaccessible Island,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.620
and we've just about reached
the Erebus Glacier Tongue.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.540
We’re getting close to a crack that sets
up here annually, in between

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.000
the Erebus Glacier Tongue and Tent Island, which is off to the left.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.120
So we’ll head up here and see if we can
find the crack, and then we’ll have to profile it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
to see if we can get across it today."

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.600
Once we get there, we'll drill some holes
in the sea ice using a machine called a jiffy drill.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.220
It’s basically a 10-inch auger that we can
use to drill into the ice.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.510
Once we've caught enough fish, we place them into aerated coolers with ambient seawater

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.610
and drive them back to the station, where we put them into aquariums.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.940
They actually make up about 90% of the fish biomass down here, and if they start to struggle,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.900
then the food chain that is reliant upon them is also going to start to struggle as well.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.320
It may help us get some sort of insight into how these populations are going to handle change,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.160
and whether or not we should be concerned about any of these fishery species,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.920
and start to manage them differently.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.480
Cell phones do not work down here.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.740
You don't have to cook for yourself.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.020
You don't shower every day, because we need to conserve on water.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.180
Those kind of daily activities that distract
you from your goals and your focus --

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.480
all of those are kind of removed from your everyday life

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.720
and it really simplifies things for you down here.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.380
It allows me to really pursue research, which is what I was trained to do, is to be a scientist.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.780
It allows me to come down here and actually go after questions that I can't ask

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.960
anywhere else in the world.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.620
In another episode of Science In The Extremes, a neurobiologist free-dives with great white sharks,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.140
to understand how fear works in the brain.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.000
