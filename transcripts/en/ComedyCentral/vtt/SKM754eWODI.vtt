00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:04.338
Opposers,
here's a fun fact about me

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.473
that's also my Tinder bio:

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:09.209
I always win at board games.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.347
I win at board games so much,
nobody will play with me.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.549
What can I say?
I guess people just hate to see

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.750
a guy like me succeed.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.753
Now, my strategy is simple:
I play smart.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.023
Some might call it "cheating,"
but that's-that's just a word

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.292
losers use to make themselves
feel better.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.161
So that's why I'm mad as hell
about a new edition

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.430
of my favorite board game
that just makes it harder

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.766
for winners to win.
Take a whiff.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.635
REPORTER:
Are you a Monopoly cheater?

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.571
Well, then this newest version
of the game is for you.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.439
Hasbro is releasing
a Cheaters Edition

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.908
of the game later this year.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.709
The idea came
after a survey revealed

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.444
that over half
of Monopoly players

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.113
try to cheat during the game.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.248
The new twist
on this beloved board game

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.450
comes complete with cheat cards,
free properties,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.386
and even handcuffs attached
to the board

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.388
to keep those cheaters
chained to jail.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.990
That's right.
They try to put you in cuffs

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.260
for a real estate crime.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.797
And they say this game
is based in reality.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.200
This new tabletop abomination
includes 15 cheat cards

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.736
that actually tell players
how to play smart.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.271
Look, these cards are real.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.441
There's Identity Theft that lets
you move another player's piece

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.777
instead of your own,
and Squatter's Rule

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.780
that lets you collect rent
from another player's property.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.583
Hasbro, stop giving away
my moves!

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.420
Next, you're gonna tell my son
Alito how I always destroy him

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.255
at Connect Four.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.656
It's easy.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.659
I never taught him how to count.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.396
But this new Cheaters Edition

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.599
is clearly trying to handicap
natural winners

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.336
by building our best sneaky
strategies into the game.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:43.470
There goes the neighborhood.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.405
In fact, there go
all the neighborhoods.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.341
Boardwalk, Park Place,

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.609
Luxury Tax, Question Mark Land--

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.278
all of 'em.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.480
Think about it:
if everybody's cheating,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.015
then nobody's cheating.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.951
And cheating is the entire
foundation of Monopoly.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.420
It's right there in the origin
story. You guys know this.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.291
 Monopoly was invented in 1903
by Elizabeth Magie,

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.427
pictured here
on a counterfeit dime. Now...

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.364
this proto-Elizabeth Warren
created the game

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.165
to expose the evils
of capitalism.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.101
But capitalism is flawless.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.703
Here's proof: 30 years later,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.573
an enterprising man stole
the idea for her game,

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:23.043
rebranded it,
and got rich off it.

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:26.046
And that's how you play
 Monopoly!

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.582
(cheering and applause)

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:31.952
Do not pass Go. Do not collect
any money for your idea.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:35.155
I get to be the car.
Yay, capitalism.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.491
This Cheaters Edition
will do whatever it takes

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.494
to hobble winners. It even has
a tattle-tale feature.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.162
REPORTER:
 You report the cheater,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.297
 who's on your left or right,
 to Mr. Monopoly

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.632
 via Facebook Messenger,

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.567
 and then he will chime in

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.569
 to settle disputes
 and crack down on rule-breaking

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.705
 by handing out consequences
 in real-time.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.306
That's right.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.177
 Monopoly has
a special prosecutor now.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.647
What's next, a district attorney
for Gumdrop Mountain?

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.316
A court stenographer
for Scrabble?

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.453
A building inspector for Jenga?

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:09.256
Sir, look, if you're gonna go
in there, don't go in there.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:13.326
But if you do, just tap on it
with your index finger first.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.929
I suspected
this Cheaters Monopoly was part

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.131
of a larger plot.
Some said I was paranoid.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.135
But "paranoid" is just a fancy
word for "always right."

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:23.603
So I did some digging.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.205
That's when I found an article,

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.875
and hidden below the headline
were dozens of smaller headlines

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.944
strung together
in sequential order.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.412
It was baffling.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:35.749
But I eventually found a quote
there from a Hasbro executive

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.086
admitting that the new version
will "level the playing field"

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:42.622
and make sure cheaters don't
have a "special advantage."

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.424
Level the playing field?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.093
No special advantage?

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.228
This is not a drill.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.696
-(siren wailing)
-MALE VOICE: Socialism alert!

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.833
Socialism alert!
Socialism alert!

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.768
-Socialism alert!
-Opposers,

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:57.771
it is time to focus up!

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.507
We cannot let socialism
invade Monopoly!

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.709
You can't run an electric
company from your spot

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.044
in the bread line!

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.713
This new Cheaters Edition
is simply un-American.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.449
In this country, we reward
people who play smart.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.184
It's why billionaires
get tax cuts

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.386
and why Republicans
control Congress

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.922
and why Merrick Garland
is currently bagging groceries

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.458
at a CVS somewhere.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.861
There's nothing wrong
with playing smart.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.329
Just listen to our president.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.731
He didn't pay
any federal income tax,

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.267
-so if he's paid...
-That makes me smart.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.602
Yeah.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.137
It makes him smart.

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.005
Do you know how high
your IQ needs to be

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.808
for your businesses to weather
six bankruptcies?

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:35.976
Smart.

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.377
But everywhere you look,

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:41.114
deep-state forces are making it
harder to win unfair and square.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.050
Check out Pennsylvania,
where the state supreme court

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.586
ruled against partisan
district maps.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:47.854
Screw you, Pennsylvania!

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.189
And we can't sleep on Florida,

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.057
where a devious federal judge
says

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.059
they can't bar ex-felons
from voting.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.196
That's gerrymandering
and voter suppression--

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.665
two of our smartest plays.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.133
And it's only getting worse.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.135
Last week,
I got maced in a Whole Foods

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.138
for sampling the grapes.
I mean, come on!

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:09.276
People, America
is all about playing smart.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.279
It's who we are. We can't let
some globalist board game

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.881
or state supreme court
take that away from us.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.483
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.151
I got to pass Go and collect,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.221
I don't know, let's say $700.
