00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.846
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can find the limit

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:04.932
as theta approaches zero
of one minus cosine theta

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:07.299
over two sine squared theta.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.673
And like always, pause
the video and see if you

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:10.646
could work through this.

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:12.516
Alright, well our first
temptation is to say,

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:14.449
"Well, this is going to be the same thing

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.699
"as the limit of one minus cosine theta

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:21.599
"as X approaches, or not X,

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.766
"as theta approaches zero.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.331
"of theta, as theta approaches zero,

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:28.664
"over the limit,

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.842
"as theta approaches zero

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:35.175
"of two sine squared theta."

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.275
Now, both of these expressions

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:41.761
which could be used to define a function,

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.436
that they'd be continuous
if you graph them.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.212
They'd be continuous at theta equals zero,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.717
so the limit is going
to be the same thing,

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:50.585
as just evaluating them
at theta equals zero

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:55.393
So this is going to be equal
to one minus cosine of zero

00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:57.893
over two sine squared of zero.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.487
Now, cosine of zero is one and
then one minus one is zero,

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:08.986
and sine of zero is
zero, and you square it,

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.605
You still got zero and
you multiply times two,

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:11.438
you still got zero.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.812
So you got zero over zero.

00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:16.910
So once again, we have
that indeterminate form.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.398
And once again, this indeterminate form

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:21.105
when you have zero over zero,
doesn't mean to give up,

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:22.863
it doesn't mean that
the limit doesn't exist.

00:01:22.863 --> 00:01:24.174
It just means, well maybe

00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:26.121
there's some other
approaches here to work on.

00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:28.909
If you got some non-zero
number divided by zero,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.731
then you say, okay that
limit doesn't exist

00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:33.011
and you would say, well you
just say it doesn't exist.

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:35.689
But let's see what we can
do to maybe, to maybe think

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.703
about this expression in a different way.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:39.870
So if we said,

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.558
so let's just say that this,

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:44.342
let me use some other colors here.

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.068
Let's say that this right over here

00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:46.901
is F of X.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:51.817
So, F of X is equal to
one minus cosine theta

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.985
over two sine squared theta,

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.305
and let's see if we can
rewrite it in some way

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:02.087
that at least the limit
as theta approaches zero

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:03.877
isn't going to, we're
not gonna get the same

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:05.814
zero over zero.

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:08.058
Well, we can, we got
some trig functions here,

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:09.779
so maybe we can use some
of our trig identities

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.249
to simplify this.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.848
And the one that jumps out at me

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:15.894
is that we have the sine squared of theta

00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:19.552
and we know from the
Pythagorean, Pythagorean Identity

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:21.392
in Trigonometry, it comes
straight out of the unit circle

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:22.988
definition of sine and cosine.

00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:26.957
We know that, we know
that sine squared theta

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:30.374
plus cosine squared theta is equal to one

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:34.045
or, we know that sine squared theta

00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:36.577
is one minus cosine squared theta.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:38.863
One minus cosine squared theta.

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.991
So we could rewrite this.

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:44.241
This is equal to one minus cosine theta

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.603
over two times one minus
cosine squared theta.

00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:56.014
Now, this is one minus cosine theta.

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:58.826
This is a one minus cosine squared theta,

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.753
so it's not completely obvious yet

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:02.588
of how you can simplify it,

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:04.164
until you realize that
this could be viewed

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:05.862
as a difference of squares.

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:07.798
If you view this as,

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:12.361
if you view this as A
squared minus B squared,

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:14.845
we know that this can
be factored as A plus B

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:16.485
times A minus B.

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:18.250
So I could rewrite this.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.938
This is equal to one minus cosine theta

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:23.188
over two times,

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:28.556
I could write this as
one plus cosine theta

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.598
times one minus cosine theta.

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:34.598
One plus cosine theta
times one minus, one minus

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:38.593
cosine theta.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.318
And now this is interesting.

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:41.703
I have one minus cosine theta

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.732
in the numerator and I have
a one minus cosine theta

00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:45.164
in the denominator.

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:46.415
Now we might be tempted to say,

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.045
"Oh, let's just cross that out with that

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:51.641
"and we would get, we would simplify it

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.641
"and get F of X is equal to one over

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.776
"and we could distribute this two now."

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:01.264
We could say, "Two plus two cosine theta."

00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:02.097
We could say,

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:03.338
"Well, aren't these the same thing?"

00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:05.151
And we would be almost right,

00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:07.852
because F of X, this one right over here,

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:10.218
this, this is defined

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:12.234
this right over here is defined

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:14.567
when theta is equal to zero,

00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:17.473
while this one is not defined when theta

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:18.306
is equal to zero.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:19.464
When theta is equal to zero,

00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:21.637
you have a zero in the denominator.

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:23.591
And so what we need to do in order

00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.435
for this F of X or in order

00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:27.715
to be, for this to be the same thing,

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:31.548
we have to say, theta
cannot be equal to zero.

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:34.602
But now let's think about the limit again.

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:37.216
Essentially, what we want
to do is we want to find

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:40.566
the limit as theta approaches zero

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:41.399
of F of X.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.707
And we can't just do direct substitution

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:49.521
into, if we do, if we
really take this seriously,

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.354
'cause we're gonna like,

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:51.887
"Oh well, if I try to put zero here,

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:53.177
"it says theta cannot be equal to zero

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.110
"F of X is not defined at zero."

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.644
This expression is defined at zero

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:57.477
but this tells me,

00:04:57.477 --> 00:05:00.091
"Well, I really shouldn't
apply zero to this function."

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.460
But we know that if we
can find another function

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.946
that is defined, that is
the exact same thing as

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:07.123
F of X except at zero,

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:09.805
and it is continuous at zero.

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:11.258
And so we could say,

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:14.675
"G of X is equal to one over two plus two

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.876
"cosine theta."

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.441
Well then we know this
limit is going to be the

00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:22.739
exact same thing as the limit

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.739
of G of X, as theta approaches zero.

00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:29.187
Once again, these two functions

00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:31.899
are identical except F of X is not defined

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.344
at theta equals zero,

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:35.031
while G of X is.

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:36.739
But the limits as theta approaches zero

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:38.962
are going to be the same.

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:41.423
And we've seen that in previous videos.

00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:42.758
And I know what a lot of you are thinking.

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:44.518
Sal, this seems like a very, you know,

00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:46.507
why don't I just, you
know, do this algebra here.

00:05:46.507 --> 00:05:47.988
Cross these things out of this.

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:50.051
Substitute zero for theta.

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:52.101
Well you could do that and
you would get the answer,

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.872
but you need to be clear
if, or it's important

00:05:54.872 --> 00:05:57.163
to be mathematically clear
of what you are doing.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:06:00.352
If you do that, if you
just crossed these two out

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:01.813
and all of a sudden you're expression

00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:03.813
becomes defined at zero,

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:07.217
you are now dealing with
a different expression

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:09.532
or a different function definition.

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:11.698
So to be clear, if you want
to say this is the function

00:06:11.698 --> 00:06:12.940
you're finding the limit of,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.527
you have to put this constraint in

00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:16.381
to make sure it has the exact same domain.

00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:18.504
But lucky for us, we can say,

00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:21.288
if we've had another, another
function that's continuous

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:24.203
at that point that doesn't
have that gap there,

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:26.385
that doesn't have that
point discontinuity out,

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.399
the limits are going to be equivalent.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.016
So the limit as theta
approaches zero of G of X,

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.306
well, that's just going to be

00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:34.594
since it's continuous at zero.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:35.913
We could say that's just going to be,

00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:36.915
we can just substitute.

00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:39.770
That's going to be equal to G of zero

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.147
which is equal to one over two plus

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:46.980
cosine two, one over two
plus two times cosine

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:49.096
of zero.

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.605
Cosine of zero is one,

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:52.364
so it's just one over two plus two,

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:54.561
which is equal to,

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:56.408
deserve a little bit of a drum roll here.

00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:58.759
Which is equal to one fourth.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.092
And we are done.
