Cameron, why did you name
this video One Weird Trick?

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.070
What were you thinking about?

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.930
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.640
Nothing.
I was just going to talk

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.500
about a weird trick where you can use a
device's location to speed up checkout.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.710
&gt;&gt; What did you think this was about?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.110
&gt;&gt; Nothing.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.810
&gt;&gt; Let's move on, then.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.530
What were you going to say?

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.300
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.650
Let's just cut to the next video.
