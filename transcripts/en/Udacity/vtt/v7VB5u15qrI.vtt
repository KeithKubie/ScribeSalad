00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.990
Well, okay.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.670
I got this.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.270
I got this.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.054
I got, oh, no.

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:05.447
[NOISE]
&gt;&gt; Hey, whatcha doing there?

00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:07.178
&gt;&gt; I'm building an awesome new app and

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:09.890
it's using a ton of
cool libraries I found.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, your libraries are in
these Java archives here?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.160
&gt;&gt; What? No. These are just jars.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.770
Anyway, a bunch of the libraries
I'm using are themselves using

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.450
even more libraries.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.540
&gt;&gt; Which gives you even
more jars to juggle, right?

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.670
&gt;&gt; What do my jars have
to do with anything?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.160
I'm making jam later.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.350
Anyway, I checked all my jars
into source control, but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.480
now it takes forever for
me to check anything out.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960
And anytime one of my libraries updates,
it's just a giant pain to sort out.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.300
&gt;&gt; You know that Gradle can take care
of this whole problem for you, right?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.390
&gt;&gt; Well, Gradle can do just
about everything, can't it?

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.450
&gt;&gt; It's true.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.170
Gradle makes using external
dependencies super simple.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.880
It can take care of downloading
your dependencies from repositories

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.580
either hosted by your organization or
publicly available out on the internet.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.000
It can also handle your
trends div dependencies.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.650
That is the dependencies
of your dependencies.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.420
It even makes sure that if you're using
the same dependency across multiple

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.560
projects you'll only ever
download dependency once.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.290
No more juggling jars.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.560
&gt;&gt; Hey Mark, you want any jam?
