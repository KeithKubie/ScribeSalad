00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:03.855
- [Voiceover] In the figure
above, the seven small circles,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:06.920
which have equal radii,
and the large circle

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.869
are tangent at the indicated points.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.282
If the area of the large circle is 36 pi,

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:16.556
so the area of the whole thing
right over here is 36 pi,

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:21.271
what is the area of one
of the small circles?

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.568
So let's think about how we could do this.

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.656
If we know the area of the large circle,

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:29.117
we could figure out the
radius of the large circle,

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:30.789
and if we know the radius
of the large circle,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.391
we should be able to figure out the radius

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:34.458
of one of these smaller circles.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:35.456
So let's do that.

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:40.355
So we know that area is
equal to pi r squared,

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:43.397
and so the area of the
larger circle is 36 pi.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:48.180
So we know that 36 pi is
equal to pi r squared.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.180
We could divide both sides by
pi, divide both sides by pi,

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:56.121
and we're left with the
radius of the larger circle,

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.770
I'll swap the two sides,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.624
the radius of the larger
circle squared is equal to 36.

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:03.133
Now if you were just solving an equation,

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.014
r squared is equal to 36, you would get

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.429
that r is equal to plus or minus 6,

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:08.645
but we're talking about a length here,

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:12.583
so we only want to think about
the principal root of 36.

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:16.716
So we get the radius of
the larger circle is six.

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:17.568
Or another way to think about it

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:20.657
is the diameter of the larger
circle is going to be 12.

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:22.869
Diameter is twice the radius.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.006
So if we were to start at
this point right over here

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:28.326
and go all the way across,
go all the way across,

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:31.414
that whole distance right there is 12.

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:32.900
So this distance right over here,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.220
the diameter of the larger circle is 12.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.426
Now the diameter of the
larger circle is 12,

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:39.726
what is going to be the diameter

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.445
of one of the smaller circles?

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:43.674
And they all have the same diameter.

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:47.180
Well, three of the diameters
of a smaller circle

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.966
are equal to the diameter
of the larger circle.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.824
So each of these smaller
circles are going to have

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:54.238
one-third of the diameter
of the larger one.

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:57.552
So they're each going to
have a diameter of four.

00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:01.066
Well, if they each have
a diameter of four,

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.849
that means that they each
have a radius of two.

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.962
So this distance right over here,

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:09.470
this distance right over here is two.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.488
So now what is the area of
one of the small circles?

00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:16.854
Well, the area is going to be
pi times its radius squared.

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.127
So pi times two squared,

00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:24.144
which is equal to pi
times four, or four pi.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.304
So the area of one of the smaller circles,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.780
or area of one of the
small circles, is four pi.
