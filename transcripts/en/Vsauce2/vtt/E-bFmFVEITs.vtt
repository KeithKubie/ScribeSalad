00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.300
Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA reveals that
a resourceful 5,300 year old Iceman wore a

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.219
sheepskin loincloth, cow leather shoelaces,
goat hide leggings, sheep and goat mixed coat,

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.990
a brown bear hat.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.560
Meanwhile, researchers at Stanford developed
a new fabric that, unlike cotton, allows infrared

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.430
radiation to pass through it.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.550
So you’ll feel four degrees cooler if you’re
wearing plastic clothes.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.550
Vsauce!

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.530
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.590
DuoSkin makes your arm an interface.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.410
Developed by the MIT Media Lab, a cheap, skin-safe
gold leaf material is attached in various

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.980
designs to the skin.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.730
The three interfaces include wireless communication,
touch-sensing input and displaying output.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.050
The metallic temporary tattoos can control
mobile devices like a trackpad, and also data

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.310
like movie tickets could be embedded in the
material.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.720
They believe on-skin electronics will become
less taboo over time and develop into user-friendly

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.240
body decoration.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.330
In science fiction becomes reality news, an
astronaut sequenced DNA in space.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.090
While aboard the International Space Station,
a Biomolecule Sequencer was used to identify

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.990
the DNA sequence of a mouse, virus and bacteria
while identical samples were sequenced at

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.690
the same time on Earth to control for differences
in results.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.549
Current practical applications include being
able to test the fungi growing on the ISS

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.750
without having to send it back to Earth and
future amazing applications include detecting

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.070
life on Mars.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.980
Virtual reality, brain-control and a robotic
exoskeleton combine to retrain people to walk.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.800
The system allows patients with spinal-cord
injuries to regain voluntary leg muscle movement

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.890
and feel touch and pain in their paralyzed
limbs.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.180
After 12 months of training, which involved
patients imagining walking through a virtual

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.970
scene, the EEG picked up signals for the lower
limbs that had been previously lost.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.939
The patients wore sleeves with haptic feedback
to react to each step, and even varied so

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.579
walking on sand would feel different than
walking on grass.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500
Eventually they could walk in the
real world with robotic training devices

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.719
and the research is ongoing.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.099
The oldest fossils ever found are 3.7 billion
years old.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.849
Australian geologists discovered a newly exposed
outcrop of sedimentary rocks and minerals

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.659
in Greenland that was previously covered in
snow.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.639
They found evidence of fossilized microbial
mats called stromatolites

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.200
which are shallow water microorganism communities.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.549
Due to the complexity of stromatolites they
believe life may have started much earlier

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.400
than when they appear in the fossil record
and this discovery increases interest in life

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.780
on other planets.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.430
There’s now a drone that drops ignition
spheres to start fires.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.210
The Unmanned Aerial System for Firefighting
was created to safely perform prescribed fires

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.100
that are used to combat the spread of wildfires

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.419
and benefit ecosystems by fighting off invasive species.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.530
Traditionally, helicopter-based ignition has
been used but its expensive and dangerous

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.189
- so this new system represents a major upgrade
in fire.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.450
EPFL built a robotic foosball table.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.180
A camera under the table tracks the ball and
linear and rotational motors control the players.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.430
The robot can already beat humans.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.299
The robot knows where the human player is
positioned and can react accordingly.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.370
And now they’re working on having a robot
play against another robot.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.959
3D Printing now enters 4D.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.499
Engineers are printing shape-changing polymers
that remember their original shape when heated

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.940
to specific temperatures.

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.209
They believe what they call 4-D printing could
be used for biomedical devices like medicine

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.309
that’s released when the patient has a fever
or used for solar cells that move in relation

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.239
to temperature to optimize performance.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.189
Really i just think this little soft polymer
claw thing looks cool.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.309
So yeah.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:07.370
Finally, DFKI in Germany unveiled a project
to search for extraterrestrial life in the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.080
deep oceans of Jupiter’s moon Europa.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:26.320
*SFX*

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.080
I’m gonna leave you with a virtual reality
robot arm,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.640
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:49.120
*SFX*

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.040
You are about to take a journey out of this
world,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.520
Into the world of the future.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.700
Forget the world around you.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.830
Forget the people around you.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.200
You are entering Futurama.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.540
It’s hard to believe there actually is an
oven that can cook a roast in minutes by electronics.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.880
Then bake you potatoes in less time than it takes
to carve the roast.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.260
A refrigerated cart ready for wheeling into
a game room or out on to the patio.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.960
Perfect for keeping foods and drinks cool
for informal entertaining.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.600
Yes, that’s a wonderful idea.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.940
And I’ll bet this washer will get anything clean,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.780
Even my most delicate things.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.920
Did you have fun?

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.500
I sure did.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.880
Everything I saw was out of this world.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.380
*SFX*

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.940
There’s a brand new episode of LÜT over

So click here to check that out.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.170
And while we’re working on the second box,
Curiosity Box number one is almost sold out.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.680
