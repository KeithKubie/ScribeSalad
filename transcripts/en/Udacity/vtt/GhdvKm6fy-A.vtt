00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's go through a possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Once again, the real trick is just coming up with a good regular expression,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so we can't have a space, a left angle, or a right angle,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but we can have 1 or more copies of anything else,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we'll just return the token unchanged

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because that's what we are asked to do.
