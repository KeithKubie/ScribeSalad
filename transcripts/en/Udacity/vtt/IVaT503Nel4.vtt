00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.680
Alright, Michael. So, you got it? Which line do you think is best?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.576
&gt;&gt; Alright, so if I choose one green and one red [CROSSTALK]

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.880
that means there's nine different possible

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.320
lines. But they all separate the points.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.740
&gt;&gt; That is correct.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.940
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure. I, you know, I think they're intended to

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.010
even if they don't quite. But I think they do, I think they

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.590
actually all separate the positives from

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.070
the negatives [CROSSTALK]. The positives on

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.440
the upper right side and the negatives on the lower left side. So,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.450
I mean the only one that seems further special

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.650
is the middle one. If I choose the middle green

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.860
and the middle red it's kind of, you know, ecstatically

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.570
pleasing, there's a lot of space on, on each side.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.700
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to go with that but it's not clear, you

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.310
know again, best if I was a photographer that might be the best.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.680
&gt;&gt; Hm, you are a photographer. So, let's pretend I can draw

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.830
a straight lines. That's pretty good. That's the line that you've chosen.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.880
&gt;&gt; And you think that's best. Well, I'm going to give you a

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.560
hint, Michael, and tell you that you were correct. That's a pretty good hint.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510
&gt;&gt; But now I want you to figure out

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.090
for me why that line is better than this line.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.880
&gt;&gt; Interesting. Alright, well so one thing that's, that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.710
second line. The. Orange line, as oppose to the orange

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.210
line, has against it, in some sense it seems

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.290
to get really, really close to that bottom minus point.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.890
Maybe it's a little too close. Like maybe that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.950
minus is near other minuses that we just can't see.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.540
And since we drew really really close, a line really

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.400
really close to it, it could be we ended chopping

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.190
of some of the minuses that. That we might

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.990
want to have kept on the other side. And so

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.880
maybe by drawing it in the middle it's sort of,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.230
we have the biggest, I don't know like demilitarized zone.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.340
&gt;&gt; No, I like that. So that is a very good explanation

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.210
for why you would prefer the middle line over the.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.350
Other line that isn't the middle line. And you can make

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.350
a similar argument for any other of the nine lines that,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.330
that or the other eight lines that you could possibly draw.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.350
Let me draw another line for you and you tell

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.110
me if you think this one is good or bad and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.240
why it might be better or worse than the middle one.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.500
See if you give me a different answer. I can take

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.830
one of the parallel lines which again we will pretend is a straight line and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.070
put it there. Or I can take in fact the other line that is meant to be parallel

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.670
to it and why aren't those lines better? Or just as good.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.950
&gt;&gt; I guess I'd use the same explanation as before

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.470
which is that these, the, the line that was, is really

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.710
close to the pluses maybe is a little too close

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.230
for comfort and it, it gets very close to that plus.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.210
The, kind of, I don't know. I could point to it, but maybe

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.490
you should point to it. The plus that's really close to the line.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.090
&gt;&gt; I'm pointing to it.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.980
&gt;&gt; Because Again if there's a just, you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860
know, other data points near there, it's going

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.170
to make this distinction between the positives and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.370
the negatives that isn't really warranted by the data.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.820
&gt;&gt; Right, so I could make the op the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.170
opposite argument with you, Michael, which is that listen, they

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.330
all separate the points. They completely explain the data

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.292
as we see them. So, all three of those lines

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.430
explain the data. In fact, all nine of those lines explain

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.530
the data. So, why aren't they warranted by the data. What's the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.100
problem that you might run into if you put one line very

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.610
close to the positives or one line very close to the minuses?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.080
&gt;&gt; Well, again...so, so...it may be that they fit

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.690
this data. But, this is just a sample from the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.630
population. And so... You know, we don't know what's

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.220
going to happen really close to that other plus is.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.120
So like in the nearest neighbor algorithm for

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.290
example which you always try to make me remember,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.370
it's going to want to, you know, if it's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.120
closer to the pluses, it should be a plus.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.150
&gt;&gt; Right. That makes sense and I think that's exactly right so your

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.660
intuition and I think the intuition that people should take with them is that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.300
lines that are too close to the positives. Or lines that are too close

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.970
to the negatives, sort of have this

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.290
feature where you're believing the training data

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.560
that you've got too much. You've decided that all of these

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.530
boundaries are fine because of the specific set of training data

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.460
that we've got. And while you want to believe the data, because

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.830
that's all you've got, you don't want to believe the data too much.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.550
&gt;&gt; That's overfitting.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.030
&gt;&gt; That's overfitting. So, the problem with those two

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.660
lines, or one way to think about the problem with

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.510
those two lines, is that these lines are more likely

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.530
to overfit. And why is that? It's because they're believing

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.730
the data too much. So, given that we're trying to avoid

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.410
overfitting, what could you say about the middle line? So, here's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.769
the argument that I would make, and you tell me if

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.270
you buy it, Michael. This line, or the line it's intended to

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.950
represent anyway, is the line that is consistent with the data

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.190
while commiting least to it. That seems like a good way

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.180
of saying what I was feeling, yeah. It is funny though

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.590
because like, overfitting up to this point, we you, we were generally

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.880
talking about overfitting as being something where there's

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.440
a great deal of model complexity in some sense.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.855
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:45.590
&gt;&gt; And it doesn't seem like those lines that are

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.220
closer to the pluses or closer to the minuses. Are

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.330
inherently more complex, they're still lines. It's interesting that they,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.020
they, they kind of maybe behave as if they are.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.320
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact they, they're,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.240
it's a more, sort of, literal interpretation

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.440
of the words over and fit, right? You, you have decided to fit the data,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.210
and you believe it too much, and what you really want to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.880
do is commit. The least that you can commit to the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.490
data while still being consistent with it right. So this basic

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.180
idea of, uh,uh, finding the line of least commitment in the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.750
linear separable set of data, is the basis behind support vector

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.040
machines. So what I want to do next is I want to

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.020
see if we can come up with some equation that would

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.600
help us define such a line. It's easy in this case

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.980
cause we're staring at it but if you imagine these points were in

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.510
700 and. Thirteen thousand dimension it would pretty difficult to find such a

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.830
plane just by staring at it so let's see if we can try

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.260
to work out how you go about finding this least commitment line okay

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.490
&gt;&gt; Cool.
