00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.600
Here, bear bile--
the digestive fluid

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.950
stored in a bear's gallbladder--
is being illegally extracted

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.570
from thousands of bears for
its supposed herbal medicinal

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.726
Because of demand, this is how
thousands of bears in Vietnam

are being kept.

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:33.850
So we're basically
going undercover here.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.224
We're not going to use the

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:37.750

medically speaking,

There's no studies

as a medication of any sort.
