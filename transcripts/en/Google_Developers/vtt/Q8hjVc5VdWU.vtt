00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
&gt;&gt; My name is Catalina Ruiz-Healy. I'm the
creator of Catalista for Android, which is

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
an application that helps you find local and
timely volunteer opportunities from your phone,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.110
and you can rate them, and once you've done
your good deed, you can share it with the

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.029
world.
&gt;&gt; MCFADDEN: My name is Wayne McFadden. And

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.259
I'm with Redroid Software and I assisted with
the development of the new product.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.759
&gt;&gt; RUIZ-HEALY: Android is a great platform
for an early-stage developer. The partner

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.130
that I co-founded the company with is the
Java developer and we're very excited about

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.970
experimenting and entering quickly on the
platform. We can--we could release to the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.510
market easily and make changes as we got customer
feedback. And we like working with Google.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.300
It's an exciting company. And, Wayne, would
you add to that?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt; MCFADDEN: Android provides a lot of the
features and functionality that our team wanted

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.100
from--everything from mapping of events to
the opportunities to work with charities to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.350
being able to integrate with back-end applications
such as Google Calendar--we'll talk a little

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.760
about it later--just a whole wealth of features
that can be used that really fit well with

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.680
where the product team wanted to take the
product.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.950
&gt;&gt; So, can you give us a little more detail
about your application?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.549
&gt;&gt; RUIZ-HEALY: Sure. So, the detail about
the application is that based on your physical

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.299
location, the GPS on your phone helps you
find volunteer opportunities in your area.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.090
You can search for them based on whether you're
interested in doing something over the weekend

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.700
or if you're interested in doing a beach cleanup.
You can save them to My Calista, which tracks

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.549
sort of what you're interested in. You can
schedule that event on your Google Calendar.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.130
You can sign up with the provider directly.
You can call the organization. And then once

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.900
you've done it, then you can actually talk
about what you've been able do. And so you're

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.799
able to say that I've walked 30 dogs for two
hours and I've rated my experience as a five-star,

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.019
and that then is broadcast over different
social media. There's also a very cool Cupcake

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.849
feature which is the Live Folder feature,
which is you can long-press on your screen

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.810
and you can have two options--one, is you
get a live feed from the Catalista database,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.549
but you can also see those events that you
have actually saved and that you're tracking.

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.969
And if you click on one of those opportunities,
you actually re-launch the application and

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.779
you can go ahead and call or schedule and,
again, rate your experience.

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:48.779
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MCFADDEN: Well, as a Java developer, the--you

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:54.819
rely on the Eclipse. I used that on projects
before, and just being able to plug and play

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.299
the Android development environment right
into that is great. So, it has all the wealth

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.939
of resources that come with Eclipse like the
[INDISTINCT] tools and things like that. We

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:14.480
found that the upgrade process from the 1.0
version of the application to the 1.5 app

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.290
version was really well done. I've worked
on many projects where when you're trying

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.449
to upgrade from one version of the underlying
software to the others is just a disaster.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.299
And this went totally smooth, so, that was
pretty cool. The feature that I think I had

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.939
most fun developing was the integration with
Google Calendar on the web where many people

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.370
use--utilize Google Calendar for scheduling
and things like that--we were able to integrate

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.269
our application with the web version of the
Google Calendar by passing data back to it.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.519
So, what that means is someone can find an
event that they want to attend, to volunteer

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.629
somewhere. Click a button and then to have
it appear in your--their web version of the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.209
Google Calendar as a reminder. That was a
lot of fun doing it.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.029
&gt;&gt; RUIZ-HEALY: I would add from a product
development perspective. I think getting feedback

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.939
from users right away was really important,
that you--we don't have to wait two weeks

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.529
to get approval from the market and that we
can iterate as quickly as we can, and we can

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:20.769
improve on the product as quickly as we can
do it. So, that's really, really valuable.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:36.070
&gt;&gt; And what features [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; I'd like to see notifications be easier,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.570
so, a way for us to really--I mean, the vision
would be that you're walking down the street

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.410
next to a food bank and that your phone can
pick up that you're next to this food bank

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.120
and let you know that there's a way for you
to help out tomorrow or next week, and really

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.630
encourage people to make a difference in their
community and schedule that and then show

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.720
up and make a difference.
&gt;&gt; MCFADDEN: I think, like I said, with the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.680
upgrade process, it was relatively smooth.
And that goes along with the documentation,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.760
too. I think they took great strides in improving
the documentation [INDISTINCT] different versions,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.420
which is great, because as a developer you
obviously need that. All in all, I think the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:27.840
project in general, despite the fact that
I think with the Live Folders, which is brand

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.870
new 1.5, and the calendar integration, which
is brand new 215, and the sophistication of

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.490
the mapping where you can get a hundred events
or so on, it will appear on the map. All in

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.900
all, it went really well. So, like I said
before, it was fun.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.610
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for talking to us. I hope
you enjoy [INDISTINCT].

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.890
&gt;&gt; RUIZ-HEALY: Thanks.
&gt;&gt; MCFADDEN: Thank you.
