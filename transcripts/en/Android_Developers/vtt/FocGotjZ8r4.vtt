ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
once again to "Android

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.100
Design in Action." I'm your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.320
ADAM KOCH: Hey guys.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.100
My name is Adam Koch.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.270
NICK BUTCHER: And hi, my
name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.700
ROMAN NURIK: And today, we
have an episode about the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.900
visual design.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.840
And specifically, I guess we'll
talk about the specs or

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.960
redlines for the Cricket app
that Reto put together, or the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.070
Cricket app design that Reto
put together at, I think it

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.600
was last Friday's App Clinic.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.710
Once we're done talking about
that, we're going to jump into

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.920
a couple of designing details
and recommendations on how to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.280
incorporate maps, specifically
Google Maps, into your app.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.600
We have a bunch of interesting
fun slides there and yeah,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.590
should be fun.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.650
So with that, let's get started
with the Cricket app

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.730
visual design.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.560
Nick, you want to
take it away?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.050
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.060
So for those of you who didn't
catch the App Clinic last

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.950
week, Reto Meier looked through
his ideal kind of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.320
design, both in terms of screen
design, as well as

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.730
architecture, so creating an
up-to-date sports results app.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.730
So if you missed it, I encourage
you to check it out.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.030
It was a really great episode.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.340
And here on the screen we see
what he put together.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.500
So while Reto spent a lot of
time thinking about the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.170
functionality of the
application--

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.360
and I think he's done
a pretty good job--

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.330
he didn't, and in fact, he
stated he wasn't going to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.620
focus very much on the
visual design.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.940
So we're going to pick up where
he left off, pass over

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.500
the banner, and have a look at
some of the visuals that we

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.520
can do here.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.420
So just quickly, the app on the
left is a cricket score

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.260
tracking application.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.695
It has a panel at the top for
tracking in progress or kind

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:49.350
of what's going on now games.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.260
And then it has a panel below
which gives you a summary of

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.760
the upcoming matches, which
are sorted by all kinds of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.280
intelligent signals, as to
whether they're going to be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.080
relevant to the user.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.290
I'm not going to lay on too
thick, sorry, Adam, about The

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.830
Ashes result because that just
wouldn't be sporting of me to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.200
just pile the shame onto my
poor Aussie colleagues.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.090
So we'll skip past that.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.240
So what we will look at, though,
is some of the steps

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.900
that we've taken to address
some of the visuals.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.150
And we're going to take it
step-by-step and build it up.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.460
So one of the first things I
looked at is the action bar.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.680
So one of my favorite
components, one of the key

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.350
navigational components in
the Android platform.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.520
And I'm not sure if it was a
conscious choice, but Reto

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.760
picked this blue color
for the action bar.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.450
And one my problems is this is
one of the stock Android

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.640
hollow colors.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.800
And I find if an application
goes with this stock kind of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.020
blue, it makes it feel almost
too stock, in a way.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.810
It's almost like no attention
has been paid to it or you're

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.490
just using an out-of-the-box
component.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.650
So what I decided to do is when
I think of cricket, I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.870
think of green fields with
players wearing white and a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.856
red ball, and that's the
kind of palette I

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:05.630
think to work with.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.970
So we, instead, reskinned it
using this kind of grass

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.300
green, I'm going to call it, as
our strong, single accent

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.680
color-- which we're going
to extend throughout

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.860
the app later on--

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.080
and went for a monochrome icon,
which works quite well.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.550
So again, picking up on that
white and green, as you've got

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.100
the cricket bat icon there.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.790
And one thing we've done is
we've actually themed the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.350
title text as well there.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.350
So picking up on the weight of
the icon we've used, we've

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.340
gone for a slightly
heavier weight.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.560
So here we have Roboto
Bold Condensed in a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.470
slightly larger font size.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.270
So again, pick up on the icon's
weight, as well as we

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.550
went with the metallic theme
there to give it some motion.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.760
As well as adding some of the
usual items you might find in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.380
the action bar.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.690
So Reto said he's going to use
a navigation drawer, so we

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.220
added the drawer affordance
there, as well as adding

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.660
search and overflowing
buttons.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.415
So step one, we had a look at
the action bar and showed it

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:06.400
some visual love.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.020
ROMAN NURIK: One of things that
I really like about this

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.620
is specifically when you look
at the way the icon is

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.930
juxtaposed with the title, the
weight of the glyphs and the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.750
font are actually not really
similar, but they balance well

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.490
with the thickness
of the icon.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.820
So it's not like the icon is
overpowering the title text or

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.500
vice versa.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.190
It's actually very
nicely balanced.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.880
So I think that Bold Condensed
works really well here.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.050
Moving on?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.500
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.710
Step two.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.220
So after we've picked an accent
color, we then took a

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.880
look at the rest of the palette
in the application.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.075
So we extended the accent color
throughout, so you can

00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:51.770
see it in the header and in the
page indicates that we've

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.690
picked up on that same color.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.550
But also, the original
used this quite

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.140
stark, contrasting palette.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.710
So we had like a near black
section at the top and then a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.110
white section below.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.440
Very, very highly contrasting,
and felt to me, a little bit

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.080
too visually contrasting.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.980
And as a side note, you want
to be quite careful in your

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.650
use of pure white, very,
very pure white colors.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.180
Just used to the technology,
most phones and tablets users

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.230
have in their hands have these
very, very bright screens.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.630
So using pure white can
actually be kind of

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.020
overpowering.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.150
So you want to reserve pure
white for something which you

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.200
want to draw attention to, you
want to have stark contrast,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.950
not so much for a background
panel.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.460
So what we've done here is we've
kind of muted the color

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.470
scheme down a little bit.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.940
So we've gone for these
off-whites and kind of gray

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.400
background.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.590
Just to make it a little easier
on the eye, a little

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.551
less contrasting.

00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:47.990
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.770
Perfect.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.340
Moving on.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.470
NICK BUTCHER: Yup.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.830
So next step, we took a little
look at the metrics.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.070
So there's a few things you can
do to your application to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.420
really easily make it easier to
both scan, and then to work

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.480
out what items that belong
together and

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.770
which items are separate.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.200
So we applied the standard kind
of 8 and 16 dp grid--

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.640
which we commonly talk about
here on this show--

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.340
to this screen here.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.300
So you can see here, we've just
moved some of the lines

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.080
around, changed the margins and
the spacings, just to line

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.060
up to this.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.780
It's majorly a 16 dp grid.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.410
And then for any minor,
inter-list item spacing, we've

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.870
gone for 8, or sometimes
even 4 dps.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.210
So basically, we're using this
kind of system ribbon.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.630
And it just makes it
feel much easier.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.710
So you work out what belongs
together, and see how things

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.060
should be spaced out.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.700
Not related to the metrics
here, but I

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.330
always swapped out--

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.270
I wanted to talk about--

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.750
I wanted to swap out the view
and the view page indicator

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.660
here as well.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.640
So instead of them--

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.915
I think before we had four
dots with one of

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:55.700
them colored in.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.790
Instead, I've gone for this
bar where they color in,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.150
almost like a scroll bar.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.680
It's a slightly more Android-y
design, like having these

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.080
angled, flatter kind of lines,
rather than these dots, which

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.190
is a bit of a hangover from
the iOS design guides.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.190
ROMAN NURIK: And you'll see this
view pager, or this pager

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.010
indicator, I guess, in apps like
the Launcher, obviously,

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.230
when you swipe between your
different home screens--

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.700
although it's a little
hard to see there--

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.050
as well as apps like
Google Currents.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.270
NICK BUTCHER: The Currents
is a good example.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.860
I like that because it keeps
the bar persistent, whereas

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.030
Launcher kind of fades it out.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.530
Which is kind of subtle and it's
right for a homescreen,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.430
but I think if it's something
where you actually want to

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.630
indicate that there's more
content, this present design

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.990
works very well.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.520
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.430
One of the things I wanted to
point out, as you mentioned,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.390
grouping, the ability for white
space and margins to

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.990
communicate relationships
between elements and group

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.890
things together.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.550
This is something that Alex
Faaborg talks about a lot in a

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.510
couple of his talks in Google
I/O this year, and I think

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.480
last year as well.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.450
But basically, I think
it's the Gestalt

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.430
principle for grouping.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.610
Placing items in
close proximity

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.230
naturally implies a grouping.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.260
So it helps here, I think, to
communicate that these are

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.240
individual elements.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.890
You almost can imagine what
would happen if you removed

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.140
all of the list item
separators, right?

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.300
Would the structure
still be apparent?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.050
And I think in this case, it
would, given that there are

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.400
ample margins.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.020
It also makes for a much better
reading experience.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.520
As you're scrolling down, your
eye can naturally land on an

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.690
individual item.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.560
And once you actually see
something interesting on an

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.010
individual item, then you can
spend a little more time to

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.840
explore it, rather than having
to parse out which are the

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.179
individual items in your list.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.760
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.470
Cool.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.620
And then I think the last step
that we took on this screen

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.750
here, is to then apply some
different type of graphical

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.830
treatments, to really tease out
the information hierarchy.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.600
So in the previous design, all
the information was there, but

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.150
it was a little bit overwhelming
to try and

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.740
understand what was the
most important.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.390
And nothing really jumped
out to you.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.600
It kind of came across as kind
of almost too dense, these

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.620
blocks of text.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.810
So what we've done here is we've
used things like color

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.980
and additionally, different
sizes and weights of the

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.760
different texts, to
really tease out

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.810
what is the most important.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.480
So I think the first thing
I look at is the score.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.970
Obviously, it jumps out
straight away at you--

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.230
as well as the team names
and the summary section.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.610
And then scanning down the
upcoming list, it's very, very

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.430
easy to quickly pass this
list and find a game.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.930
You're going to look at this
list and see, all right,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.520
that's the game I'm
looking for.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.720
And then you can deep dive
further down to find

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.220
subsequent information.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.660
So by using these different
text sizes, colors, and

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.600
weights, it really, I think,
helps tease out the

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.060
information hierarchy.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.280
So one of things we didn't want
to do is introduce too

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.920
much complexity.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.040
So there's actually only and
two different font sizes,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.130
three different font sizes, if
you include the score, on the

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.830
screen here.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.170
So it's not too busy.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.840
There's not too much going on.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.390
But by using these different
colors and weights, we can

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.920
really establish
the hierarchy.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.360
ADAM KOCH: I think it really
makes a huge difference.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.970
And I think we've mentioned this
before on the show, but I

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.620
was actually looking at the two
screens from a distance

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.830
because we've got a TV here
to view the slides.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.860
And when you take a step back,
you can really see what the

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.260
difference that it makes.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.590
When you look at it from that
distance, you can see the

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.310
titles very clearly.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.460
As opposed to the old
screenshot, where you just see

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.550
these blur sections of text,
which you can't really

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.800
understand or comprehend
very well.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.160
NICK BUTCHER: One thing I wanted
to pick up on is the

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.360
use of the all caps style, which
is fairly commonly used

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.910
in Android.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.290
It's actually sometimes used
for the less important

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:37.930
information.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.370
So it might seem
counterintuitive to when you

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.270
might use capitals.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.590
It might think that
it's shouting.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.670
But quite commonly in Android,
we'll use a smaller text

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.850
styles with a lighter font
color, best full value

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.850
perhaps, coupled with
the all caps style.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.530
And it really is this kind
of byline or strapline.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.960
Like the detailed information.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.950
I think this works quite well
here for making this

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.482
information seem like it is
secondary information.

00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:05.690
ROMAN NURIK: Yup.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.430
Just to give Reto some credit,
I will say that the amount of

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.340
information, I think, was
accurate, was correct.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.090
And I will say, that I will
caveat, that I know nothing

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.070
about cricket.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.120
But one of the things that you
should also think about in

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.100
terms of typography and what to
put on your screen is, are

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.750
you showing too much at once?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.210
Are you showing too little?

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.390
And I will say that I feel like
Reto, in the original

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.550
design, was actually showing
the right amount of detail,

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.000
the right amount
of information.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.800
Again, caveatting that I know
nothing about cricket.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.270
But I think that it's really,
once you decide what to show

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.340
and really kind of pick
and choose, and

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.190
again, you're on mobile.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.400
You don't want to cloud
the user's context

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.480
with too much stuff.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.170
You don't want to cloud their
vision with too much

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.575
unnecessary information.

00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:54.910
But once you decide what to show
you, you have to really

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.510
think about how to show it, how
to portray the hierarchy.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.380
And I think that's where
typography can really help.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.790
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.830
The one thing that I wasn't
quite sure about was, I think,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.740
the second flag, the second
England flag on the left

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.080
screen here.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.220
On the other one.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.720
I think it denotes the team
currently bowling next to the

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.600
number of overs bowl.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.960
And I found that kind of
repetition of the visual a

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.300
little bit jarring, a little
bit uninterrupted.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.480
So I swapped that out for a red
dot, which is supposed to

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.060
look a bit like a cricket
ball, right.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.620
So I thought that cleaned up the
visuals and also made it

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.900
feel a bit more balanced
as well.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.290
ROMAN NURIK: Got it.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.930
OK.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:34.240
Yeah.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.580
Actually, I remember making some
minor tweaks here, and I

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.450
wasn't quite sure what
was going on.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.416
Again, because I know nothing
about cricket.

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.840
I guess that's another lesson.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.640
Know your users, know what
you're designing,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.885
before you design it.

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:46.190
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.648
Let's crack on.

00:12:47.648 --> 00:12:50.310
So the other thing with this
exercise that I've been

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.220
cleaning up, it's showing how
easy it is to perform a few

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.820
tweaks on the information.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.100
Reto did the hard work.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.035
Like Roman says, the hard work
is deciding what to show on

00:12:59.035 --> 00:13:00.640
screen and how much information
to show.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.030
We've just provided a few
digital tweaks to make it

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.140
easier to scan and
easier to see.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.870
But another thing we wanted to
in this exercise is just

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.030
demonstrate how you would take
such a mock, and then

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.020
communicate that design
to a developer.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.930
So here's an example of the kind
of techniques we use in

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.670
our applications here, this kind
redlining technique where

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:26.066
we'll actually overlay the
document with these red boxes

00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:29.770
and annotations, I guess,
showing exactly what font

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.810
sizing, spacing, and going
through and just really

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.710
documenting everything,
including there's an example

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.090
of the touch highlight,
the opacity, the

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.430
color, and so forth.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.540
So this is really the interface
a designer has with

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.210
a developer, right.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.900
This is the information the
developer wants to know.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.960
They want to know--

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.070
It's no good just giving them
a PSD or things like that.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.495
They want to know things in dp
sizes and absolute colors, and

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:54.050
so on, so they don't to go
digging in to a PSD file to

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.270
find this information.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.930
ROMAN NURIK: One of the things
that I find really useful is

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.220
when you're creating a response
of design, or

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.430
something where you're targeting
multiple devices,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.460
rather than using--

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.770
potentially.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.330
I mean, I don't know if this
will actually work in

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.770
practice, but it's definitely
something that I've thought

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.940
about before.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.090
Rather than using 4 dp, or 8 dp,
or 16 dp here, you could

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.170
say small, or medium, or large,
and then have a lookup

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.180
table saying, on phone size
devices, small is this size,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.820
medium is the size, large
is this size.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.640
And then, on, let's say, seven
inch devices or once you have

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.830
600 dps of horizontal space,
let's say, you start

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.940
bumping those up.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.010
And having something like a
lookup table where basically

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.570
like, this is small, this
is normal, this is

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.260
large, and so forth--

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.690
that's actually really easy for
developers to then take

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.770
and map into dimensions files.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.780
So you can literally just take
that lookup table, and create

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.025
XML files to specify the
dimensions in those

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:50.440
configurations.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.620
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, you could
go and just do the

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.350
dimensions as well.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.720
Things like the text
size, like I've

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.710
specified here as 18 sp.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.390
But that maps to what we have
as this text appearance

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.030
medium, is this standard
text size.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.730
That's 18 sp on some devices,
but it could be larger on

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.530
other devices.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.350
A device which you're more
likely to hold further away,

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.260
that could actually
be a larger value.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.700
So rather than specifying
anything, any number, I guess

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.180
you could swap out for
some lookup value.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.640
ROMAN NURIK: Let's carry on
to the navigation drawer.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.850
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.745
So we didn't redo the whole
application, we just looked at

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:24.270
this one screen.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.000
But I did want to pick
up on something on

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.710
the navigation drawer.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.320
Reto's used it.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.310
He's done a good subdivision
of the different sections.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.820
But to me, there was a couple
problems with it.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.690
Firstly, the individual
navigation items felt a little

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.860
bit insubstantial to me.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.000
This is like your major
navigation within the

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.600
application, so I wanted it to
feel a little big weightier.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.630
And the other problem I felt was
that there was no idea of

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.360
selections.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.730
So if you're currently on one
of those screens, it should

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.950
echo back to you that yes, this
is where you are on the

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.830
application.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.430
So this is what we did, some
very, very easy visual tweaks.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.030
We just changed the screen.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.380
So the first one we did is we
changed the line height of

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.800
each item, to pick up on the
size of the action bar.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.305
So here on a phone-sized device,
it's going to be 48

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.730
dps, but on a larger device,
that icon might grow to like

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.200
56 dps, for example.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.480
But yeah, this echoes the height
of the action bar, so

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.260
it falls into the natural
rhythm of the screen and

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.400
echoing the system components.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.850
We then borrowed from the style
we picked up for the

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.200
screen title, and used
this bold italic.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.770
It's not the condensed version
here, just because I didn't

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.220
feel like it sat quite right.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.880
So this is just actually Roboto
Medium Italic here.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.330
But yeah, I think these items
feel a bit weightier.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.400
And we didn't actually go
through and create glyphs or

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.270
find glyphs for this, but I feel
like having some kind of

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.532
iconography would also help
with this sense of place.

00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:53.340
ROMAN NURIK: Yup.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.340
And then we have a spec for the
navigation drawer that you

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.350
put together here?

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.010
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.030
So I just wanted to call out a
few items here, so this is how

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.870
you might spec this.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.390
So one of the things that
we've done here is we've

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.030
followed our guidelines than a
navigation drawer should be

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.230
between 240 and 320 dps.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.890
So we called that out
explicitly, so it's not going

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.780
to grow too big.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.810
And we've called out things like
the drop shadow to use,

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.530
just to the right, the drawer
that has this very subtle free

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.630
dp drop shadow at 30% opacity.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.880
So just calling out this
documentation that your

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.920
developer is going
to want to see.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.030
And you can see they're
actually kind

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.730
of similar to how--

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.910
Roman, if you can zoom in on
the big square there over

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.090
Countries icon.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.410
Yeah, we specified the
icon frame area.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.040
We called it 48 by 48 dp.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.373
We've actually specified there
in brackets, these should be

00:17:40.373 --> 00:17:41.700
the same height as
the action bar.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.430
So a developer's going to see
that and they, oh, right, I

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.390
can see I should assign that
to the same height as the

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.930
action bar.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.863
So on a different device, it
might be a different size.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.060
ROMAN NURIK: Any parting
thoughts for this design?

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.810
NICK BUTCHER: Not really.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.290
Like you say, I think Reto did
a great job with doing the

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.870
hard work of actually working
out the information design.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.290
And we've just shown a few easy
techniques to communicate

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.373
that better.

00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:12.410
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.230
I think Reto started with basic
wire frames, like you

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.910
said, the information
architecture.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.320
And then the process of taking
that and creating medium to

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.890
high fidelity visual
design mocks.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.850
It's fairly simple.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.930
I think that you really
start with the grid.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.840
You then move on to things
like typography,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.940
color, and so on.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.250
But really, once you have the
wire frames, I think it

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.530
becomes pretty easy to
put together the

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.680
visual design part.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.120
Not to trivialize all the work
we need, Nick, but--

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.750
So let's move on to maps.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.010
So Adam, you want to
take away for maps?

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.320
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.290
So let's talk about Google
Maps for Android,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.630
the API version 2.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.990
So hopefully this doesn't need
too much of an introduction.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.270
It was released last year with
great fanfare, as an upgrade

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.010
to the original version
of Maps or MapView.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.560
It's a great API.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.090
If you have an app that takes
advantage or needs to display

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.410
content on a map, it's
definitely something you

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.450
should use.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.240
For those of you who aren't
familiar with it, it's a very

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.240
powerful API that lets you
display these vector-based map

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.930
components in your
application.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.350
And the advantage of that is
that well, first of all,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.990
there's technical advantage
to it, but from a visual

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.480
perspective, the user can
actually pan, tilt, rotate the

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.470
camera, as the user looks
at the map, very easily.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.070
And it's just a really
immersive, interactive

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.960
experience.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.930
ROMAN NURIK: And they can see 3D
building silhouettes, which

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.060
is actually really good for
providing extra context for if

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.920
you're looking for an apartment,
or looking for

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.542
pizza places or something, that
extra bit of context can

00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:47.060
really go a long way.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.500
ADAM KOCH: It's a really
neat feature.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.560
And I think it only happens
when you zoom to a certain

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.965
zoom level and in some cities,
but it's really cool

00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:56.790
when you see it.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.810
NICK BUTCHER: I think one of my
favorite changes in Maps v2

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.230
is that I think in the Maps v1,
there was some technical

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.475
limitations about how many maps
you could have in your

00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:04.700
application, and so
on, and so forth.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.510
So you had developers pushing
back about the designs about

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.460
where you can and can't
include a map.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.370
That's no longer the case.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.670
In v2, you can have as many map
projects, and as big or

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.680
small, and make them animate
and move as you like.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.640
So don't take that
for an answer.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.130
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.230
I think you're also referring
to MapFragment there, which

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.520
lets you use a map as a portion
of the screen, rather

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.560
taking up the entire screen.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.780
Definitely great updates
in the v2

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.150
version of the Maps API.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.990
So in terms of interacting
with Map, there's a few

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.860
standard controls that
come with the API.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.610
Pictured here, you see
the Zoom controls,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.560
Compass, and My Location.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.000
Those are fixed in various
corners of the map, if you

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.140
enable them.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.900
The Zoom controls is always
in the bottom right.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.700
The Compass is in
the top left.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.100
And it's actually not
always visible.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.850
It's only visible when the user
rotates or moves the map

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.280
away from the default
angle or rotation.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.150
And then there's the My Location
button, which is in

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.800
the top right corner,
normally.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.540
And of course, these can all
be toggled on and off.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.290
And you can also create
your own UI controls,

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.210
if you want as well.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.410
These are just the
standard ones.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.000
And then there's also some
standard map gestures

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.045
that you can use.

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:16.700
So zooming in.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.020
Obviously, pinch zoom is a
standard gesture for zooming

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.610
in on a map or zooming out.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.820
Scrolling or panning,
just by touching

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.480
the screen and dragging.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.760
Tilting is using two fingers
to drag up and down.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.350
Rotating--

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.610
two fingers to rotate around.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.900
These are pretty standard
things that you probably

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.515
already experienced
when using Maps.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.890
So in terms of customizing
the map, there's two main

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.160
components that you customize.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.400
Well, there's a few others,
but the main ones here are

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.310
markers and info windows.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.490
So the markers are the actual
little markers that drop down

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.540
on the map to indicate
a location.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.870
And info windows are those
little dialog boxes which pop

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.320
up, normally when you touch
one of those markers.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.560
So obviously, the default ones
are kind of plain and boring.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.135
You should almost always
customize these to fit your

00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:08.460
app appropriately.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.350
The info windows, they do
support layouts, but they're

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.840
very static.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.650
So for the developers out there,
you'll find that you

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.100
can't actually make
some dynamic

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.260
updates to those views.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.330
It really just draws it once
and then you're stuck with

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.750
that until you re-add
them again.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.780
And I think we've got some
more information.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.790
ROMAN NURIK: The one
thing I wanted to

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.150
mention was touch targets.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.010
So when we were designing the
Google I/O app, which you see

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.860
pictured here, we were actually
thinking, oh, can we

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.320
have an info window that has a
primary target, and then a

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.400
secondary, see more target?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.390
And unfortunately, the current
limitation is that no, the

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.400
entire info window is a single
touch target, and there's no

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.720
real way to customize that.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.350
So there's no way to have a
button to the top right or a

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.250
separate section in
that info window

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.440
that takes you elsewhere.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.860
So just plan for that and
keep things simple.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.080
It does help simplify the
interaction model for the map,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.500
but it is a current
limitation.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.060
ADAM KOCH: This is a good
example in the I/O app of

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.340
customizing the info window.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.710
So you can see here, the Android
track is selected, and

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.960
we've got this nice, green
highlight faded there with the

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.810
little Android icon
in the top right.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.410
ROMAN NURIK: And just for the
developers in the audience,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.200
what basically happens is you
can provide your own layout.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.650
But what the map component
will do is it'll take a

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.700
snapshot of that layout.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.760
It'll actually draw it,
lay it out, and so on.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.600
It'll take a snapshot, and then
use that bitmap snapshot

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.900
to render the info window.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.735
So it's not actually like a text
view, and another text

00:23:33.735 --> 00:23:34.660
view, and so on.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.515
It's really just a snapshot.

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.090
It's an image.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.615
ADAM KOCH: Basically,
it calls draw.

00:23:38.615 --> 00:23:40.030
And then whatever the output
is, it just displays that.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.500
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.558
ADAM KOCH: Cool.

00:23:42.558 --> 00:23:45.080
Did you want to talk a bit
about the visual design?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.820
So a couple of ideas for
marker visual design.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.590
There's really two types of
markers that you can have.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.420
And I guess you can use whatever
shapes you want.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.250
If you have, let's say, a person
on a map, obviously,

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.700
probably you want to use their
avatar in their somewhere, and

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.060
then that will guide
some of the shapes.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.110
But if it's just a very basic
marker that indicates

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.930
something, I guess a couple
of suggestions.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.890
The first is to try to use
your brand accent colors.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.950
So just as you would use your
accent color in the action bar

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.100
or for list section headers or
subtle accents throughout,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.010
definitely keep using that here
in your marker images.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.820
And I think that we'll probably
be able to share a

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.660
PSD template for this kind
of thing at some point.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.700
But here's an example
from the I/O app.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.620
We actually didn't use this
one on the right here.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.880
But we did use this where
basically the marker ends up

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.360
just being white, since
we know the

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.140
background is colored.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.310
And then we use the standard
Google I/O--

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.965
purple, or blue to red gradient,
as one of the items

00:24:44.965 --> 00:24:46.380
that was in the marker image.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.750
So it helps to further that
message of brand consistency

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.200
throughout the app.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.190
Another thing I wanted to
mention is around density.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.960
So if you have a lot
of markers--

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.890
this is one of the
things that--

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.240
one of my pet peeves, I guess.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.000
When you open up, let's say,
a real estate search app or

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.500
pizza search app or whatever,
and there's like hundreds of

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.100
results, and all you see
are just these--

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.980
ADAM KOCH: Sea of sea.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.380
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
sea of markers.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.370
It's not that useful, right?

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.750
You can no longer see the map.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.420
You lose the whole point
of having a map there.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.320
It's just like a whole bunch of
people standing in a crowd

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.280
and you can't really make
out any one of them.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.560
So for those cases, you may want
to use a smaller marker.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.110
The point here is not
to actually have a

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.130
smaller touch target.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.490
The touch target should still
really be the same size, maybe

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.860
a little smaller.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.080
Like this entire--

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.700
Or I guess, all around this one,
for example, this marker

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.130
should be a touch region, that
touching that actually

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.870
triggers it.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.100
But the idea here is that it
doesn't really matter if you

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.680
accidentally click
the wrong one.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.330
What the user would do is be
able to zoom in to see more

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.820
information about that area.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.530
And once the markers, these
smaller markers are

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.130
well-separated out, then there
will be no ambiguity in terms

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.380
of which one you clicks.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.860
So the idea is, use smaller
markers purely for the purpose

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.270
of seeing the map underneath.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.230
Because like we said before,
actually what was said in one

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.570
of the slides there,
was the map is--

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.950
Actually, no, later on.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.510
The map is the UI, right.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.430
The whole context, the
whole interface for

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.820
the user is the map.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.360
It's the geographic context.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.800
So you don't want obscure that
with too many markers.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.430
NICK BUTCHER: Speaking of that,
the map's not going to

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.050
provide the clustering algorithm
for you because we

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.480
leave that to you.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.340
You probably know more
about information and

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.450
how to cluster yourself.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.570
But if you want to have an
example of how we do

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.440
clustering, there's a great
blog post called "Too Many

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.070
Markers," from the Google Maps
team, describing how we do

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.590
clustering.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.890
So for developers out there who
want to implement that,

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.890
Google for "Too Many Markers."

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.816
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:26:51.816 --> 00:26:52.230
All right.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.570
Moving on.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.040
ADAM KOCH: So changing
the view.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.030
As I mentioned before, you've
got a lot of control around

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.530
how the user is viewing,
the perspective the

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.170
user's viewing the map.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.160
Basically, the camera angle
that the user's

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.510
viewing the map on.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.970
And actually, the Maps API makes
it really, really easy

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.640
to animate the camera
between locations.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.100
Basically, animate the location,
zoom, bearing, and

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.310
tilt, all these different
things.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.340
And it actually does it by just
sending an extra flag.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.430
It'll animate between
two locations.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.850
And this is really useful for
giving the user a way of

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.020
illustrating the difference
between two locations.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.490
So for example, if you're
viewing something in New York

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.170
and you want to jump across to
London, the map will very

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:40.210
quickly zoom out, swing across
the London, and give you this

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.820
very easy mental spatial idea
that you've moved a very long

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.460
distance across the map.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.780
And I guess one point to mention
is that you don't need

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.260
to always pan the map if there's
tons of different info

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.230
windows around.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.860
So that will mean that the
touch targets, where the

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.630
user's trying to touch the map
will keep shifting from

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.000
underneath them.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.400
So in those particular cases,
you may want to minimize the

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.770
amount that the map
moves around.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.150
But in most other cases, it can
be useful to show these

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.060
animations between locations.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.180
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.950
And I think with the
API, there's no

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.200
automatic panning behavior.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.920
So you can definitely customize
what happens when

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.880
you touch something.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.760
But really, at that point, I
can't mention it enough.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.520
It's one of my other pet peeves,
I'd say, is when you

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.120
touch a marker that's just
off-center, and then it

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.940
re-centers the whole thing,
and everything else shifts

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.620
around underneath you.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.390
And obviously, the animation
helps maintain that context.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.780
But it would still be much
better if you just kept things

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.090
in place, only moving the map
as much as you need just to

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:45.895
show the content.

00:28:45.895 --> 00:28:48.610
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.630
So if you tap the marker like
maybe the edge of the screen,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.570
then you may want to
pan that down.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.515
But as Roman's saying, if it's
just off-center, it may not

00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:55.626
make sense.

00:28:55.626 --> 00:28:56.110
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.950
Let's speed through, since
we're running low.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.040
ADAM KOCH: OK.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.070
The most important slides will
have no time anyway.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.430
So a full screen map or a large
map-- the reason why I

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.370
say large map here is just
because if you're on a larger

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.920
screen device, it may not
actually be a full screen map.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.310
It may be taking up the majority
of the screen, but

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.190
not all the screen.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.870
So in this particular case,
the map is really the

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.230
interface here.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.660
You should really
allow panning,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.890
tilting, zooming, rotating.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.590
Not allowing those is kind of
unexpected to the user.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.530
They'll be expecting to be able
to do all those things.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.860
And of course, you should be
minimizing UI distraction.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.960
Now one thing that we've
recommended in the past is

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.100
using the action bar overlay
mode, so adding some

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.590
transparency there to
the action bar.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.720
And this is actually from one
of our first episodes of

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.610
"Android Design in Action"
that we did a very

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.140
long while back now.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.580
I will note that it's a
great thing that you

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.680
can enable, if possible.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.460
There is a minor issue with
it from a technical spec

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.960
perspective, in that the Maps
API will actually show you the

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.760
UI controls underneath the
action bar-- potentially

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.500
because it doesn't actually
re-layout those UI controls in

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.420
some cases, when you engage
the overlay mode.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.420
So it's maybe not appropriate
at the moment for all

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.130
applications.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.220
Maybe if you're using custom
UI controls, it could work.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.950
But definitely if you can enable
it, it's a really neat

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.052
feature to make the map
feel more immersive.

00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:24.500
All right.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.463
Should we just zoom through?

00:30:25.463 --> 00:30:28.810
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, let's
fly through.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.110
ADAM KOCH: OK.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.700
So embedded map.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.610
So now the map is not
full screen anymore.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.210
And what's written
here, the map is

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.310
really the context here.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.110
So it's just trying to give
some context around the

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.150
information on the rest
of the screen.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.230
In this case, you should
really be removing or

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.700
minimizing the UI controls.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.090
You don't really need to
have the zoom buttons.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.120
The user's probably not going
to be doing two finger

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.340
gestures in that tiny
little space.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.470
This is an example from
Foursquare, by the way.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.270
The nice thing that Foursquare
actually does here is if you

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.410
tap on the map or single press,
it actually expands the

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.000
map out to the full screen and
switches back to that full

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.770
screen map mode that I was
talking about before.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.120
And the last thing is that there
you could potentially

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.450
switch using static maps, if
you're using embedded apps.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.790
So not really having any
interaction, or removing some

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.870
of that dynamic feel from the
maps until you tap on it, and

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.530
maybe be taken to a
full screen map.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.560
Anything else there, guys?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.890
I know we're zooming through
really quickly.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.460
ROMAN NURIK: No, I think you
covered it pretty well.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:27.930
Those are--

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:28.270
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.020
The only thing I would say is
yeah, also take a look at the

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.090
updates to the Google Maps
application because I think

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.350
that's a phenomenal job of doing
some of the things Roman

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.510
was talking about, like keeping
the interface stable,

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.720
but having easy interactions,
moving between

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.500
different pins and stuff.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.010
So I think that's a great
example as well.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.090
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.390
ROMAN NURIK: Design news.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.590
Let's try to do this
in a minute.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.780
First, if you are in the Bay
Area, San Francisco, Mountain

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.610
View, whatever, there's an
Android designers meeting

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.050
coming up, a meetup coming up.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.970
Check out this URL here to
meetup.com, and join.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.810
I think the first event is
happening next week, August 6.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.270
NICK BUTCHER: And if anybody
wants to do things together in

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.150
London, then ping me because
I wouldn't mind starting

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.300
something like this.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:10.780
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.560
And we have a similar New York
Android designers meetup.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.770
I don't think we have the next
one planned yet, but sometime

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.510
in August, hopefully.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.120
All right.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.390
Next.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.190
So one thing I really wanted
to point out is that we've

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.930
been posting a lot of protips
on the Android Developers

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.320
Google+ page.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.960
We have a bunch of Android
development protips, but also

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.110
a bunch of Android
design protips.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.960
So this one here is specifically
about the new

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.150
Nexus 7 that was launched
last week.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.950
And specifically, some
design details there.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.710
Basically, long story short, you
have already designed for

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:45.560
the new Nexus 7.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.570
There's no extra work to do.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:52.640
It's basically the same dp
resolution as the old Nexus 7,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.660
just with a higher density.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.350
So everything should
just work.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.750
NICK BUTCHER: And oh my
god, it's beautiful.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.950
Everything is so sharp.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.730
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.800
It is a gorgeous screen.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.740
And lastly, one of the things
that was new in Android 4.3 is

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.020
this new optical
bounds feature.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.920
So basically, if before your
nine-patches had extra spacing

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.270
around there to account for
things like drop shadows and

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.370
glows and such, and that caused
your UI elements to not

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.525
really visually line up.

00:33:20.525 --> 00:33:24.670
And Kirill Grouchnikov did a
fabulous blog post about this

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.050
specific problem and
how they address in

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.540
this Google Play Store.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.140
But if you are having this
problem, and you want to

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.900
address it, as of Android 4.3,
there's a new feature called

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.940
optical bounds in
nine-patches.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.900
So basically in your
nine-patches, you have these

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.600
extra red markings to indicate
that this should be the

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.340
negative margins that you should
shift the UI elements

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:51.720
to, so that the left visual edge
or the left optical edge

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.050
aligns with other items along
that line, along that edge.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.940
So it's new in Android 4.3.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.580
You go from a sloppy layout here
on the left, to something

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.960
a little more clean and
well-aligned on the right.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.710
And pretty easy to do.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.280
I think that's all the
time we have today.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.250
So thank you everybody
for tuning in.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.020
I don't know what we're doing
next week or when our next

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.235
show will be, but
see you soon.

00:34:18.235 --> 00:34:19.409
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.570
ADAM KOCH: See you
guys, Adam Koch.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.719
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.760
Nick Butcher.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.310
ROMAN NURIK: Adios, folks,
