00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.250
So right now I'm going
to bring to the stage

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.480
a young lady I
most recently met.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.330
Beautiful, beautiful songstress
living in Brooklyn as well.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.150
Another rising songbird.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.412
Give it up for Amma Whatt as
she makes her way to the stage.

00:00:14.412 --> 00:00:18.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.260
This is a song that I recorded
with a very good friend

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.050
of mine, Miss Ledisi.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.220
And it's called "To Love
Again," and it was a big hit.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.013
So if you know it,
please sing along, y'all.

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:38.436
[MUSIC - GORDON CHAMBERS,
"TO LOVE AGAIN"]

00:04:56.128 --> 00:05:01.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.590
Give it up for
Amma Whatt, y'all.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.432
[APPLAUSE]
