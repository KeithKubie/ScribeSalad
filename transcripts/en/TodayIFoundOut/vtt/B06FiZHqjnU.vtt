00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.120
Many hotels offer guests a free breakfast
consisting of muffin, coffee, cereal and milk,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.600
toast, juice, bagel, and, at some, even scrambled
eggs and make-your-own waffles.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.810
Born in the Gilded Age, today’s continental
breakfasts reflect the West’s transition

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.910
from a mostly agrarian culture to an industrial
(and today, service) society.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.720
Luckily, however, some of us have not forgotten
our culinary past.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.600
Breakfast in the Early 1800s
In the first part of the 19th century, as

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.260
many rural American families had greater wealth
and access to a larger variety of foods, a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.290
typical family breakfast would include a meat,
eggs, fish, a bread, a cereal, fruit and any

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.260
of a variety of condiments, including butter,
jam and maple syrup.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.920
Common meats throughout the states included
bacon, sausage and ham.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.790
Cereal grains such as grits and oats were
also popular, as were many different types

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.380
of breads, including pancakes and biscuits.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.530
A hefty intake of calories, these hearty breakfasts
were a necessity for the hard-working American

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.870
farm family of the first half of the 19th
century.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.571
Birth of the Continental Breakfast
Over the latter part of the 19th, and early

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:10.300
quarter of the 20th, centuries, the West (and
in particular) America increasingly became

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.390
urbanized.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.330
From 1870 to 1920, the population of American
cities grew from 10 million to 54 million,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.899
and many of these people were a part of the
growing middle class.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.039
While these shopkeepers, dentists, accountants
and merchants may have put in long hours,

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.599
they certainly weren’t exerting the same
physical energy as their agrarian forebears.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:34.630
Needing fewer calories, the traditional American
heavy breakfast eventually fell out of fashion.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.630
Also at this time, continental Europeans were
traveling the world and bringing their taste

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.259
preferences with them.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.149
This brings us to the British and the traditional
British fry up.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.710
Alternately known also as the “fry,” “full
English,” and even the “Full Monty,”

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.050
a traditional English breakfast has both sausage
and bacon, eggs, fried bread (literally, a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.649
slice of bread fried in either lard, butter
or bacon fat), sliced fresh tomato and baked

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.649
beans (yes, like Heinz’ baked beans).

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.679
In addition, many purveyors of this Matterhorn
of breakfasts also offer optional “pudding”

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.789
(not JELLO, but rather a sausage made from
oats and pork fat, with or without pig’s

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.500
blood), kidneys (beef or lamb), kippers (smoked
herring), sautéed mushrooms, and, of course,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
fried potatoes.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.186
Appalled by the heavy British breakfast, the
Europeans (think the French and their petit

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:21.150
déjeuner) helped the British create a modest
first meal, frequently consisting merely of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.930
coffee or tea, pastry and fruit.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.540
By 1855, this was being referred to as the
continental breakfast.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.400
Europeans were also touring America and staying
in her hotels.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.860
Frequently the primary (if not only) source
of meals for a tourist, American hotels soon

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.709
began adjusting their fare to meet the tastes
and expectations of their European customers.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.799
The American middle class (some of whom also
toured Europe and were exposed to the practice

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.280
over there, as well) soon also preferred the
smaller meal, and, thus, the continental breakfast

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.500
became an American staple.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.849
It’s Not Just the Food
The term “continental” referred to more

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.660
than just the dishes served, it also described
its pricing.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.459
Traditional American hotels were more like
boarding houses where meals were included

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.630
in the price of a room.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.459
On the other hand, European hotels offered
rooms and meals à la carte.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.099
As Europeans toured America, (and Americans
toured Europe), soon hotel patrons in the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.749
U.S. were opting out of most hotel meals,
although breakfast was still desired.

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.689
To accommodate these changing tastes, the
‘continental’ model of room pricing, where

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.319
breakfast was included with the cost of the
room, came about.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.000
Lamenting a Loss
Not every member of the Gilded Age was pleased

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.280
with the new fad.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.340
As one sad and hungry person noted in Harper’s
Weekly in 1896:

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.560
In old days a hungry man could get more things
to eat . . . . Hungry men have declined in

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.069
numbers and influence . . . . No one but the
“Autocrat” ever talked much at [the old-style

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.579
breakfast] for the viands were too tempting
– great beef steaks, hot rolls, buckwheat

00:03:44.579 --> 00:04:18.019
cakes, omelettes, potatoes, coffee, and 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.699
even . . . pie.
