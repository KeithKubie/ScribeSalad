00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.890
Over the course of six
weeks in the summer of 2014,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.200
Market Basket employees,
joined by their customers,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.980
protested against the
firing of their beloved CEO.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.340
They risked their jobs,
their livelihoods,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.840
and they brought the
business to a halt.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.290
At a time when we see so much
division between the CEOs who

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.260
represent the top 1% and
the workers, who represent

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.250
by the bottom 99%, this
level of support for a CEO

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.090
got the attention of
the entire country.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.740
Arthur Demoulas, he
stands for valuing people.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.250
He always says we are in
the people business first,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.620
grocery business second.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.831
And when the
ownership changed, you

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.580
started asking the
questions, what's going

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.600
to happen with our benefits?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.160
What's going to
happen with our pay?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.600
And when you start taking
away that factor of focusing

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.100
on people, the entire business
model starts to fall apart.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.030
The workers were
fighting for a business

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.310
model that works for everyone--

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.890
for them, for their customers,
and for their shareholders.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.840
We saw a number of
critical business lessons

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.920
that emerged from Market Basket.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.690
Let me share with you
three related lessons.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.710
The first lesson is around
creating customer and employee

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.090
loyalty in a pretty
unlikely setting.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.280
Local supermarkets
are not necessarily

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.950
known for treating their
employees or customers well.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.600
They are known for offering
bad jobs with poverty level

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.960
wages, unpredictable schedules,
and very few opportunities

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.760
for success and growth.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.620
They're also known to
frustrate their customers.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.640
The Market Basket
case shows us that it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.770
doesn't have to be that way.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.370
Here's a company that really
puts a focus on building

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.520
those relationships.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.269
It's easy to say treat
a customer as you

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:03.310
would like to be treated.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.834
It's a lot different
to say that you

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.250
would treat your
customers the way

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.083
you would treat your
family or your friends.

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:10.070
Because there's a
lot a loyalty there.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.340
The second lesson that
emerged from Market Basket

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.480
is the importance of
employees and what

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.260
they do for efficient,
low-cost operations.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.940
You see, Market Basket pays
its employees decent wages.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.450
It offers them
generous benefits.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.250
It treats them with
respect and dignity.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.480
Market Basket designs
the jobs in a way

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.510
that allows their employees
to be more motivated, that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.380
allows them to be
more productive,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.630
and that allows them
to contribute more

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.870
to the success of their company.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.534
It's not just working
for the paycheck;

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.700
it's working for what you're
getting out of the job.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.790
Getting that feeling that you're
providing something of value

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.100
that they appreciate, and
appreciating somebody else.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.724
That's a huge motivator for me.

00:02:56.724 --> 00:02:58.640
And carrying that through
the company to bring

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.580
value to the company.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.160
Who wouldn't want
to work for that?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.260
If you go to a
Market Basket store,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.520
you're going to see a
lot of employees around.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.610
A lot more than what you
see at a local supermarket .

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.100
Why is that?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.240
Well, Market Basket does
that so that its employees

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.780
can do their jobs
without making errors.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.330
So that they're not rushed.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.050
So that they can treat
their customers well,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.100
help them out when necessary.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.090
So that they have
enough time to engage

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.300
in continuous improvement,
come up with suggestions

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.940
to reduce cost and increase
customer service and sales.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.010
Appropriate staffing levels
is just one of the job design

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.260
decisions that
motivate employees,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.340
make their jobs better,
so make them happier,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.710
that lead to happy
customers, because they

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.090
receive better service.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.980
And that also lead
to happier investors

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.520
because now the costs are
lower, sales are higher,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.040
and profits are higher.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.990
And that brings me to the
third decision related

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.200
to Market Basket, which is
even in a low-cost supermarket

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.590
setting, it is not only
possible but highly profitable

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.820
to create a business
model that creates

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.940
value for customers, employees,
and investors at the same time.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.150
There's a lot of
focus on people.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.080
You have 8 owners
and shareholders,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.811
and then you have
25,000 employees.

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:29.310
And then you have
the further impact

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.750
of vendors and customers.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.540
That's a huge base.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.130
Now you're talking
millions of people.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.850
And here's a company that really
puts a focus on everyone who's

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.180
involved with our company.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.100
Now, you might wonder, is
Market Basket an exception?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.360
Is it unique?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.740
Well, certainly, what
Market Basket employees

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.060
did was pretty extraordinary.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.760
But Market Basket's business
model is hardly special.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.580
In fact, in my
own research, I've

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.100
studied four other
low-cost retailers

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.150
that do exactly the
same, ranging from Costco

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.570
to QuikTrip, a convenience store
chain with gas stations, that

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.860
has been in Fortune's
100 best companies

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.220
to work for 12 years
in a row and that

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.700
is extremely profitable.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.500
If good jobs are possible
at a setting like QuikTrip,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070
they are possible everywhere.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.880
We just need more companies to
follow the good job strategy.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.490
And everyone can do their part.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.780
You are customers.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.400
You can walk with your feet.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.830
You can decide the shop or dine
at places that offer good jobs.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.290
For those of you who
are employees, managers,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.990
or even investors
in organizations,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.670
then you could be advocates
for a good job strategy.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.710
Finally, I want to leave
you with one last thought.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.710
At some point in
your career, chances

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.370
are you'll be a manager.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.990
You might manage just a few
people or hundreds of people.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.520
Remember this, the types
of decisions that you make

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.040
are not just business decisions.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.330
They affect the lives of people,
so make those decisions wisely.
