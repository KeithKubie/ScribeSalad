ADRIAN BASCHUK:
Culiacan, Mexico--

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.130
long considered one of the most
dangerous cities in the world.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.200
Some of Mexico's most infamous
narcotraffickers dating back

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.810
to the '50s have come
from this region,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.550
including Mexico's most
wanted drug lord, El Chapo.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.255
Here, narcoculture thrives.

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:28.225
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.820
The Jesus Malverde shrine is a
popular attraction for tourists

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.340
and traffickers alike.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.506
Malverde is a local legend
and Robin Hood figure.

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:38.545
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.840
Traffickers are known to
visit the shrine to ask

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.450
for Malverde's blessing when it
comes to drug deals, shipments,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.800
even murder.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.660
A visit to the local
cemetery is probably

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.550
the most telling example of
how Mexico's narcowars have

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.180
played out in Culiacan.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.460
And it's the cemetery of
known narcotraffickers

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.860
where they construct these huge
mausoleums over the gravesite.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.770
The family takes proceeds
of the dealer, basically,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.060
and builds these structures
in honor of their death.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.330
These can cost as much
as apartments here.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.670
This one even has bars over
the windows and a central alarm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.110
system.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.250
Here, the dead are better
off than many are in life.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
This mausoleum boasts a leather
sofa, an homage to a girl

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.610
and his Camaro--
and even bottles

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.210
of Ace of Spades champagne.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.444
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.600
So many are so
young-- 18, 20, 21.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.030
It's a generation
lost to a drug war.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.358
And it seems to know no end.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.816

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.600

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810
different strains of
weed rather than wine,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.539
a new cannabis
culture is emerging.
