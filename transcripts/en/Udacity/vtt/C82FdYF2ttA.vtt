00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.276
The clinical document architecture,
or CDA, defined HL7,

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:08.850
version 3 rim based documents,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.380
assembled from administrative and
clinical data for particular purposes.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.420
After a period of use, a consolidation
effort removed inconsistencies,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.750
resulting in the current
consolidated CDA or CCDA standard.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.720
Here's a particular example of some
simple patient demographic data

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.890
we'll used to show how RIM
supports CCDA documents.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.370
While it's difficult to read,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.050
here's the same patient data
depicted in a RIM Roll.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.440
And we can see, for example.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
The phone number here is displayed here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.340
Here's the data incorporated
into a CCDA document.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.340
In this case it's the continuity
of care document or CCD.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330
A key electronic document for exchange
among providers at transitions of care.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.880
When, for example, patients are admitted
to or discharged from a hospital, or

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.940
referred by a primary care
physician to a specialist.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.540
Transitions of care
are a key risk point, so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.340
exchanging data at them is an important
means of assuring quality and safety.
