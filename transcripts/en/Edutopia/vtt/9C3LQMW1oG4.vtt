00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.636
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: All right,
good morning, everyone.

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:10.206
&gt;&gt;Teachers: Morning.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:13.956
&gt;&gt;First, there was a conflict between
the two students in item nine yesterday.

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:17.846
Kind of came out of nowhere,
got real heated real quick.

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.956
Jess and Jackie sequestered
them, they both talked with me.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:22.306
Megan?

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:26.956
&gt;&gt;Meghan Rosa: How about if
I meet with them every day

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.916
after school for like five minutes?

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.826
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: We don't have
kids falling through the cracks

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:35.046
because we meet every single
week and address what's going on.

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:38.226
There's nothing quite like
getting everyone in a room,

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.856
getting everyone's brains
on the same issue right now

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:43.266
and coming up with a solution.

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:54.376
&gt;&gt;We have a really diverse
urban population and the range

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.596
of issues we have to deal with,
whether it's in the classroom,

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.826
outside the classroom, is a wide range.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.866
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: We know
that these kids have a lot

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.376
of stuff going on in their lives.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.956
They're going to have
trouble not just academically,

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.526
but socially, emotionally, behaviorally.

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:12.316
They have a lot of issues, so
we need to figure out a way

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:15.776
that we can fix those problems
and not give up on them.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.186
So our culture is basically,
no problem is too big.

00:01:19.306 --> 00:01:21.636
&gt;&gt;Lauren Mills: So we have
a regular team meeting

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.856
on Wednesday mornings every week.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.666
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: When we
build the schedule every year,

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.386
we do whatever we need
to do to keep that time,

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:31.236
because we know how important it is.

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:34.126
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: It's a
chance to share information

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.426
about students in a problem solving way.

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:40.686
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: So that takes
care of items one through six.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.016
&gt;&gt;It is agenda driven so
that we can stay on track.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:49.526
There might be as few as ten agenda
items or as many as twenty some weeks,

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:51.436
just things that we need to address.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:54.286
&gt;&gt;To the final item on today's agenda,

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:56.226
could someone let me know
what exactly was going

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:59.476
on with some of this online drama?

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, in my journalism
class, I heard a couple of the girls

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:05.506
and guys talking about
how they are chatting

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:08.356
with people on an online dating site.

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:11.216
That was a bit of a warning for
me and I talked to some of them.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:14.976
Mainly talking to them, was more like,
"That's crazy, get off, don't do that."

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:16.906
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Right, stay away.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:17.826
They think they're just chatting?

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:18.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's what they think.

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:18.976
I mean, that's what they're saying.

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:22.376
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: All right, now what
are we going to do about the problem?

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:26.956
That's where somebody usually
steps up and comes up with a plan

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:29.736
or we establish a plan,
and then it's delegation.

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.706
Who's going to be responsible
for the follow through?

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:35.036
So for the issue of social
media, our faculty decided

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:38.946
that it might best be handled by our
students, actually, our peer mediators.

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:41.536
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: That's a good
message for the peer mediator group.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.356
Is this something that
we can pull off, Lauren?

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:46.726
&gt;&gt;Lauren Mills: I think that they
could easily get together a group

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:50.436
of the peer mediators to talk
about like social media safety.

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:51.546
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: Sometimes hearing it

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:55.276
from a student perspective
is better for our kids.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.746
&gt;&gt;Student: In such a small town, so
many people know each other and that's

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:01.066
when the gossip comes around.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.436
&gt;&gt;Student: When it goes out, even though
someone says, "Oh, it's only there

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:08.286
for five seconds to ten seconds," but
in reality, it stays there forever.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What about if
they make a racist joke

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:13.096
and they're just not
mature enough to recognize

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.456
that there's an audience that's much
bigger than them and their story?

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:18.526
&gt;&gt;Student: Before you
put it on the screen,

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.556
you've got to think about
what is the outcome?

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:23.426
&gt;&gt;Student: So that's one thing
we want to really attack is,

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:26.586
how it can affect their future
and how like, even the things

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.086
that they do now can last forever.

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:32.426
&gt;&gt;Lauren Mills: The problem
solving structure here really is,

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:34.246
I think, of mutual accountability.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:37.946
Everyone takes responsibility
for solving student problems.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:41.086
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Our kids see
themselves as problem solvers

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.486
and see themselves as
keepers of the culture.

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:48.226
So they're going to put together a
workshop for the middle schoolers

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:52.226
about what's going on online,
what's the kind of okay stuff to do,

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:53.526
where do you have to be careful?

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Vin and I
will be doing a Snapchat.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:04:00.006
When Vin and I present a Snapchat,
we'll say, "Who would like a volunteer."

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.496
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: And hopefully that
reaches them when it's someone closer

00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:04.116
to their own age saying it.

00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:05.926
&gt;&gt;Student: We are the peer mediators

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:08.906
and our topic is going
to be about social media.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:12.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Colleges look at your
Facebook, they look at your Twitter,

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:14.076
so it's really important to keep in mind

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.146
that it's not just your
friends looking at it.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.986
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Because we do
so much team problem solving,

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:21.456
our kids know that they're not alone.

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:26.666
They know that a team of smart
adults are on their side.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:29.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We tried to get to
the root of what was going on....

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:33.966
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: That no
problem is too big or too bad

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.566
to be addressed in some way.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.986
It doesn't mean that we can
fix everything tomorrow,

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:41.576
but nothing can't be addressed.

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:42.576
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's great news.

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:42.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's great news.
