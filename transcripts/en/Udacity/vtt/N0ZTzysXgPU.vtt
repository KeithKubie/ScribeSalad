00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So this is the model that we started with.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a compartment of susceptible persons, a compartment of infectious persons,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and a compartment of recovered persons.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Depending on the number of infectious persons, susceptible persons become infectious,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and infectious persons automatically recover after awhile.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, we're introducing another effect latency.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Persons who get infected should not immediately become infectious and we model this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
by introducing another compartment--exposed persons.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Depending on the number of infectious persons and susceptible persons,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
susceptible persons become exposed--that is infected and after awhile, become infectious.

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This should obviously be called the SEIR model.
