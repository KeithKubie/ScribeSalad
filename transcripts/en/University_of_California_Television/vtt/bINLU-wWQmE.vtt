00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.260
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.363
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:24.017
(gentle electronic keyboard music)

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.811
- I'm William Lester,
professor of chemistry

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:57.391
and Chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.830
We're pleased, along with the
Graduate Council to present

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.470
Dr. Sylvia Earle, this years speaker

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.479
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.520
As a condition of this bequest,
we're obligated and happy

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.680
to tell you how the endowment
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.431
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.421
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:22.223
and the Bay Area.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.616
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:28.360
came to San Francisco
during the gold rush,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.870
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.730
In 1895 Charles
established a professorship

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.866
here at Berkeley, as an expression

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.003
of his long held interest in education.

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.300
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.032
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.584
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:51.448
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:55.040
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.706
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.550
The Hitchcock Fund has become one

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.090
of the most cherished endowments

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.080
of the University of California,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.858
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.760
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.330
Thank you Lillie, Charles,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.253
and now a few words about Dr. Earle.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.350
World renowned marine
scientist, Dr. Sylvia Earle,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.921
is president of the Sea Alliance,

00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:23.868
a non-profit whose mission
is to create awareness

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:26.830
of the ocean's importance to all life,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.083
explore global waters, and
inspire conservative action.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.642
In 1992 she founded Deep
Ocean Exploration and Research

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:38.540
which pioneers technologies

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.623
for scientific ocean
research and exploration.

00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:44.500
The company presently
is owned and operated

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.320
by Elizabeth Taylor and Ian Griffith,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.314
who are working with Dr.
Earle to develop technologies

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:52.927
for working access to full ocean depth.

00:02:52.927 --> 00:02:57.927
Through Mission Blue,
Dr. Earle, Sea Alliance,

00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.410
and a growing number
of partners are working

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.150
to establish Hope Sports,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.774
regions rich in marine bio-diversity,

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:10.290
that with protection can
help restore areas damaged

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.273
by human activities and natural disasters.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Early in her career,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.330
Earle led the first
team of women aquanauts

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.430
during the Tektite Project.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.893
Among several diving records,

00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:26.080
she was the first person to dive solo

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.676
to a depth of 1,250 feet

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.363
without being connected
to a support vessel.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.250
Dr. Earle has authored
more than 80 publications,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.487
has led a hundred expeditions worldwide,

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:42.720
and logged over 7,000 hours underwater

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.060
in connection with her research.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.110
She is an explorer in residence

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.550
at the National Geographic Society

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.060
and was the US National Oceanic

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.537
and Atmospheric
Administrations chief scientist

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:58.160
from 1990 to 1992.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.310
Earle received her BS from
Florida State University in 1955,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.920
and her MA and PhD from Duke University

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.040
in 1956 and 1966 respectively.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.220
In addition, Dr. Earle

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.159
has been awarded 20 honorary degrees.

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.950
Dr. Earle has been awarded numerous honors

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.737
for her extensive and
illuminating work in oceanography.

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:24.920
She is a recipient of
the Netherlands Order

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.980
of the Golden Ark and is a member

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.290
of the National Women's Hall of Fame,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.450
and the American Academy of Achievement.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.170
In addition, Earle has received medals

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.453
from the Explorer's Club,
the Lindbergh Foundation,

00:04:37.453 --> 00:04:40.379
the National Wildlife Federation,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.370
and the National Parks
Conservation Association.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.900
She received the 2009 TED Prize

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.900
and the 2011 Royal Geographical
Society Patron's Medal.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.777
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Earle.

00:04:55.777 --> 00:04:58.944
(audience applauding)

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.050
- Thank you for the grand
introduction, very small edits.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.890
First it's conservation,
not conservative, (laughing)

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.460
although the roots are the much the same.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.053
If you want to be a conservationist,

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:24.053
you really want to take care
and protect the wild world,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.580
and keep things in good shape.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.300
Nothing wrong with that.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.300
The other was, Hope Sports,
which I think is a great idea,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.700
but it's really Hope Spots. (laughing)

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.700
And by that I mean places
like the Grand Canyon,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.130
like Yellowstone, like the
National Park System as a whole.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.019
But in the ocean, we have been lacking

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:55.420
the kind of protection that
over much of the 20th century

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.637
has grown into, globally
about 12% of the land

00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:03.310
invested in some way to protect nature.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.310
In the ocean we're lagging far behind

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.310
with a tiny fraction of 1%,
where even the fish are safe.

00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:15.606
About 1% overall that is
protected with some kind

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.040
of management regime,
such as here in California

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.050
with the new network of
protected areas along the coast

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.500
and the four marine sanctuaries,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.530
National Marine Sanctuaries,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.580
including the Farallones just offshore,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.060
Cordell Bank just up the coast a bit,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.230
and of course Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.820
that goes far beyond Monterey Bay.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.810
It's about 5,000 square miles of ocean.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.410
But sanctuary is perhaps
not the right term to use

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.229
for any of these or the Channel Islands

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.229
National Marine Sanctuary
because the squid aren't safe,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.386
the herring aren't safe,
the crabs aren't safe.

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:57.764
We exploit them inside
and outside the sanctuary

00:06:57.764 --> 00:07:01.665
with about the same degree of latitude

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:06.665
with overarching policies,
but it's time that we look

00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:12.516
at the ocean with new eyes, new respect.

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:15.193
That's primarily what
I'm going to focus on

00:07:15.193 --> 00:07:18.510
during this first of two opportunities

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.888
to sound off about a
number of things with you.

00:07:21.888 --> 00:07:25.075
Actually this is not my
first time on campus.

00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:30.075
My first time goes back to 1966,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.713
before most of you were born.

00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:36.370
I had a chance to work with people

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.330
in the Botany Department

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.672
here and from others who were interested

00:07:39.672 --> 00:07:42.707
in the marine plants, the algae,

00:07:42.707 --> 00:07:47.237
the macro-algae that
live in great abundance

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:49.763
along the rocky shores of California

00:07:49.763 --> 00:07:52.211
and off into deep water beyond.

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.530
We started up close to the northern edge

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.690
of the California border
and worked our way

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.610
over the coastline, down to pretty close

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.910
to the southern border of California.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.910
Camping along the way, gathering
samples of as many kinds

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.060
of creatures as we could
find by just snorkeling

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.160
and looking along the beach.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.500
We did not have diving equipment

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.143
available to us at that time.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.030
We've learned so much, so fast

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.444
during the decades that have followed.

00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:26.152
I actually spent some time on campus here,

00:08:26.152 --> 00:08:29.781
working on what was my dissertation,

00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:34.781
preparing it for publication
in (giggling) 1967, 1968.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.492
The publication actually came out in 1969.

00:08:39.492 --> 00:08:44.492
Some of you will perhaps
remember the state of the world

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:48.760
during that era, when,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.443
I remember driving onto campus.

00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:53.683
It would've been about 1968, 69,

00:08:55.753 --> 00:08:58.220
and there was tear gas all over the place,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.620
and I felt a little bit insulted

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.300
that they were stopping people,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.340
not letting them come on
campus, but they let me through.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.350
I mean, what was it about
me that made me okay,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.500
when some of my pals,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.937
they said no they wouldn't let them on.

00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:14.900
Well I'm glad they let me come on campus,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.100
because I holed up and worked
in the Botany Department

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.330
looking at the great
collection of marine algae

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.600
that is housed here.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.850
Most of you probably don't
even know that it exists,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.686
but it's one of the best
collections in the world.

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:30.545
It documents the history
of the kinds of creatures,

00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:33.782
the plants at least that live in the ocean

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:37.084
over long periods of
time, before the present,

00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:41.720
collected by people who
have used the herbarium

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.000
in the Botany Department as a repository

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.051
for this great historic
record of how things were

00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:51.400
and how things are, as a guide

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.078
to imagining how they
might be going forward.

00:09:55.078 --> 00:10:00.078
It's a critical part of
being alive right now,

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:04.449
to reflect on how fast
things have changed.

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:09.449
Not just in 40 or 50 years,
and not thinking geologically,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.212
of course things have changed over time,

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:14.139
but even in the last 10 years.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:18.764
The pace is picking up of how
the world, the natural world

00:10:18.764 --> 00:10:23.764
is feeling the influence
of what we're doing to it.

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:27.247
We could see it on the
land and Rachel Carson

00:10:27.247 --> 00:10:32.247
wrote in The Sea Around
Us, in 1951, about what,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.010
sort of the distillation of what was known

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.730
concerning the oceans of the
world for the popular audience,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.020
but scientifically sound.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.504
One of the great science writers

00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:48.160
who laced the scientific facts

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.318
with a good deal of poetic presentation

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:54.401
that made it accessible
to the public at large.

00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:59.401
In 1951, 10 years before the Silent World,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.654
the, excuse me, The Silent
Spring was published.

00:11:03.654 --> 00:11:08.534
Silent World, Cousteau's beginning of,

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:13.534
in terms of communicating
with the public was 1952.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.410
This was a time when, we
just were beginning to think

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.990
about what was under the
surface of the ocean.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.463
Plate tectonics was not,

00:11:25.463 --> 00:11:27.220
not known at that time.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.080
I mean I think there was some people

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.168
who thought maybe the
continents moved around,

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:34.509
no mechanism was identified
though in the 1950's.

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:37.985
Now it's a major scientific endeavor,

00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:42.725
a whole study, geo-science
of plate tectonics,

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:46.330
looking at how the
continents have moved around,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.374
how the sea floor has spread over time.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.369
We've learned more about
the ocean literally,

00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:54.755
since the mid-50's, then during all

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:59.670
preceding human history put together.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.430
And at the same time, I
think it's fair to say

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.460
that more has changed, because since then

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.324
about half the coral
reefs around the world

00:12:06.324 --> 00:12:07.793
have either disappeared

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:12.320
or they have been affected negatively.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.220
I mean there in a state of great decline.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.259
In the Caribbean, it's
about 80% of the coral reefs

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:20.580
are gone since the 1950's,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.290
since the 1950's for heaven's sake,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.995
half a century plus a bit.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:27.040
What we've done to the fish

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.920
in the sea because we love to eat them

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.230
and now we know how to catch them in ways

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.940
that fish just aren't prepared

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.415
for our means of finding, and
extracting, and shipping them

00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:38.878
all over the world.

00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:42.130
This is new on the horizon.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.960
90% more or less of many of the fish

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.260
that we love to consume,
the tunas, the swordfish,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:53.260
the sharks, the creatures
that once did not have humans

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.890
as predators, now we
are the principle source

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.503
of their decline.

00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:05.500
It's true with so many kinds
of creatures in the sea.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.985
We knew, going back to the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:11.442
that we had the power to greatly reduce

00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:14.806
the number of marine mammals in the sea.

00:13:14.806 --> 00:13:19.806
At the time whales, and seals,
and sea lions, and otters

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.049
were primarily thought of as commodities,

00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:27.776
and it's hard in today's perspective

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:32.776
to imagine a time as recently as 1972,

00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:38.690
when the Richmond Whaling
Station was still,

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.807
well that was the year it closed,

00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:42.503
but it was open until then,
taking humpback whales

00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:47.323
for dog food, for pet food,
for oil, for fertilizer.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.070
Now we understand.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.450
We understood even early
in the 20th century

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.560
that we had the power to greatly
reduce wildlife in the sea,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.463
even using relatively modest techniques.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.546
Fortunately for whales and for us,

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:11.546
we realized that while we have
the power to eliminate them,

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.346
and they are valuable as commodities,

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:20.185
that we also have the power to
protect them, and since 1986

00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:24.210
commercial whaling around the world has,

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.990
a moratorium exists.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.240
That has been good news for gray whales,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.000
good news for humpback whales,
good news for most whales.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.990
Hasn't turned things
around for some species,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.060
but the general theme is pretty obvious.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.140
If you stop killing them,
they might begin to recover.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.280
We haven't learned that with fish.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.700
We're still, still on a downward spiral

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.850
of taking too much of the
wild creatures in the sea

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.510
and haven't really faced up to the reality

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.330
that if we really want to
have tunas, and swordfish,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.698
and sharks, and many other
creatures in the ocean,

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:03.550
we've got to stop killing
them for heaven's sakes.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.460
There are other ways
we can feed ourselves,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.510
and maybe we can get by with taking a few.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.673
But the commercial
exploitation of ocean wildlife,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.870
now we know that there are real limits,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.600
and we've exceeded those limits

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.073
on most of the kinds of things

00:15:20.073 --> 00:15:22.653
that we like to take
from the sea presently.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.389
So what to do about it?

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:29.052
It's hard to bring about overnight changes

00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:34.052
on anything of consequence,
but some change,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.440
some places in the sea.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.480
If we can establish them for protection

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.184
as has been done here in California,

00:15:39.184 --> 00:15:40.749
with this little network

00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:43.691
of fully protected areas, marine reserves.

00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:47.000
Where it has happened, good news occurs.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.580
The fish in very short period of time,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.943
two or three years, begin to recover.

00:15:51.943 --> 00:15:53.538
You get greater diversity.

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:55.920
You get larger numbers.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.370
You get larger fish.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.380
Like, duh, you stop
killing them. (laughing)

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.013
It's a first step toward recovery.

00:16:03.013 --> 00:16:04.993
There are other things that we can do.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.350
You need to protect breeding
areas, feeding areas.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.390
You can't compete with them,
as we are in Antarctica,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.190
competing with not just
whales, but the whole system,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.850
by taking the krill in large numbers.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.805
Well, much of,

00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:26.128
what I'm addressing right now,

00:16:26.128 --> 00:16:31.128
is something that we have
just began to face up to

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:35.441
since I arrived on the planet.

00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:40.441
Awareness that unlike the
attitude that shaped our policies

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.730
formed in the 1950's, and
60's, and 70's, and even today,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.730
based on this feeling that
the ocean is so big, so vast,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.590
so resilient, that there's nothing much

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.310
that we puny human beings
can do to alter its nature.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.950
But now we know that it's different.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.700
We do have the power to
alter the skies above

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.000
with excess carbon dioxide
driving climate change.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.750
Global warming, and now
acidification of the oceans

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.416
with excess CO2 turning to carbon dioxide,

00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:22.416
to carbonic acid, creating
bad news for things

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.270
with a calcium carbonate
shell of the little creatures

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.420
that do much of the heavy
lifting in the ocean,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.127
generating oxygen, grabbing carbon,

00:17:30.127 --> 00:17:32.925
bad news for coral reefs.

00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:37.780
Who knows what problems
are being caused right now

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.459
because of this trend
toward acidification.

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:45.459
But the good news is, now we
know what we could not know

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:52.699
50, 60, 100, 1,000 years
ago, now it's confirmed.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.200
We have the power to alter
the nature of nature.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.200
Now we know that our lives
depend on these natural systems

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.148
for things we've always
heretofore taken for granted,

00:18:07.148 --> 00:18:09.320
like do you like to breathe?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.660
I mean where do you
think oxygen comes from.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.110
It doesn't just magically
pop into the air.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.040
It is generated by photosynthesis,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.730
those green things on the land,

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.412
the green and blue-green
creatures in the sea,

00:18:23.412 --> 00:18:28.302
largely bacteria that
generate much of the oxygen

00:18:28.302 --> 00:18:31.370
in every breath we take.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.850
And the water-cycle, the carbon-cycle,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.410
the whatever it is, is governed
largely because there is

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.656
an ocean out there that
we haven't had to take

00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:46.629
conscious actions to
protect until about now.

00:18:46.629 --> 00:18:49.460
One of the things that
gives me cause for hope

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.460
is that much has been learned
about the sea in my lifetime.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.410
I think the most important thing perhaps

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.927
may be the magnitude of our ignorance,

00:19:00.927 --> 00:19:05.927
that only about 5% of
the ocean has been seen,

00:19:06.272 --> 00:19:11.250
let alone explored, let alone
put on the balance sheet

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.390
in terms of okay this how
it relates back to us.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.733
But we know enough to know that
if the ocean is in trouble,

00:19:19.146 --> 00:19:21.000
we're in trouble, and we
also know enough to know

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.305
that we have the power to
take actions to stabilize

00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:27.850
some of these trends
that are so worrisome.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.904
And one of the things that can be done,

00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:31.210
just as on the land,

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.880
is to protect the engine that works,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.710
protect the natural
systems that have developed

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.166
through all preceding history,
and do no harm to them.

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.060
Keep them intact.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.200
Do what we can to restore
what we can of the systems

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.384
that keep the engine running in our favor.

00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:56.384
And so, when I was given
an opportunity in 2009

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.110
by the TEDsters, this
organization that originated

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.930
in this area, well Silicon Valley.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.490
It started about 26 or 27 years ago,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.910
where a group of people got together,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.300
and it was kind of an
intimate group to start with,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.535
a little brain trust of people
who began discussing issues

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:20.940
and thinking about what they
could do to use their powers

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.471
to maybe leave the world a better place.

00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:29.471
It grew, and it grew, and it grew,

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.520
and it became something
of a phenomenon that you

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.140
may now know as TED, just T-E-D,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.979
but it's Technology,
Entertainment, Design,

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:43.700
and now has moved to southern California

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.270
because a bigger space was
required and they operate it now

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.940
out of Long Beach.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.940
And now the way they tend
to generate their activity

00:20:58.182 --> 00:21:01.810
is to invite individuals that they choose

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.397
from anywhere in the world to come,

00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:07.489
basically give the talk of their life

00:21:07.489 --> 00:21:11.010
and to cram it into 18 minutes flat.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.930
I mean the door opens
and you fall through it

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.433
after 18 minutes and 10 seconds.

00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:21.565
So I had been on the
outside wanting to go attend

00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:24.850
the TED Talks, I never got to do it,

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.007
and I really did want
to have an opportunity

00:21:27.007 --> 00:21:31.030
to you know, give the talk of my world,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.782
of my life that could be
spread around the world.

00:21:33.782 --> 00:21:37.456
That's the other thing, TED
uses the new media now available

00:21:37.456 --> 00:21:42.456
to take these 18 minute
messages and make them available

00:21:43.473 --> 00:21:46.537
in the new ways that we
can, that didn't exist,

00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:49.950
not even 10 years ago but now do,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.320
as a megaphone to take
these messages far and wide.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.470
So I got the call from Chris Anderson

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:01.247
who is the backer, he calls
himself the curator of TED, to,

00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:06.210
I said, I'm gonna be asked to
give a talk, and yes I was.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.043
I was asked to give a
talk, but it was more.

00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:11.267
I was told that I had been
awarded the TED Prize.

00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:14.060
Now the TED Prize is a bit of money,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.060
but most importantly it is
they grant you a wish, huh.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.070
If somebody said we'll grant you a wish,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.529
like the fairy godmother
comes in and says bunk.

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:27.830
Okay but it can't be something little,

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.767
it has to be a wish big
enough to change the world.

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.930
Well for me that was pretty easy,

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.366
I knew what I wanted to wish right away.

00:22:36.366 --> 00:22:39.861
Cramming that into 18 minutes
was the real challenge,

00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:42.865
and articulating it in such a way

00:22:42.865 --> 00:22:47.270
that maybe people would buy into the idea,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.423
to think that yeah this
is kind of important,

00:22:49.423 --> 00:22:53.494
that maybe we should think
about taking care of the ocean

00:22:53.494 --> 00:22:55.420
that takes care of us.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.930
And how do you do that?

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.480
Lots of different ways.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.480
But I said we need to ignite
public support awareness

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.960
by harnessing the internet,
harnessing whatever media exists

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.750
by furthering research and exploration,

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.851
new technologies to explore
and understand the ocean.

00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:16.596
But fundamentally we
need to protect the ocean

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:21.596
in a physical, tangible way
by having protected areas,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.866
something that California has pioneered

00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:28.090
but we need it to go a lot
further to make this happen.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.116
And when you think, here's the world

00:23:30.116 --> 00:23:33.620
and a fraction of 1% of
it is safe for the life

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.190
that lives in the ocean,

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.790
that drives the way the world works,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.410
what an opportunity to come
along at this point in history,

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.356
at the beginning of the 21st century,

00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:45.306
to do for the oceans what those pioneers

00:23:45.306 --> 00:23:48.230
early in the 20th
century did for the land,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:53.073
the idea that some said was
the best idea America ever had,

00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:55.720
the National Park System.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.284
But we need this not
just for this country,

00:23:58.284 --> 00:24:01.244
but for the world to protect the assets,

00:24:01.244 --> 00:24:03.884
to protect our life support system,

00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:06.871
and now we have some
new tools to do it with,

00:24:06.871 --> 00:24:09.930
to share the view, to
provide the rationale,

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.841
to do what we couldn't
do when I was a kid,

00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:16.316
couldn't do even 20 years
ago, couldn't do 10 years ago,

00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:21.195
with that wonderful
platform called Google Earth

00:24:21.195 --> 00:24:23.820
and underlying that

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.820
the scientific basis information
that ESRI, the E-S-R-I,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.639
the organization based here in California,

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.854
that gathers information,

00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:39.670
knit-stitches the information together,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.670
and presents it in a
way so that ecologists

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.210
have new insights, anybody, city managers,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.740
kids, CEO's, leaders of countries.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.083
So I'm going to take you on a quick tour,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.173
using not only Google Earth,
but the Ocean in Google Earth.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.849
- [Narrator] Come along on
a tour with Mission Blue,

00:25:04.849 --> 00:25:07.530
an organization founded by Sylvia Earle

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.634
that is dedicated to exploring
and caring for the ocean.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:13.642
On this tour we'll visit
some special places

00:25:13.642 --> 00:25:16.510
called Hope Spots, that
are critical to the health

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.763
of the ocean, the blue
heart of the planet.

00:25:18.763 --> 00:25:20.210
- [Sylvia] It's the
coolest image in the world,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.581
of the world. (laughing)

00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:25.110
I mean I came along years ago,

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.065
before this image was possible.

00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:30.223
Kids now take it for granted,

00:25:30.223 --> 00:25:35.223
that yes now we know, the world is round.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.520
There's a time not so long ago

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.510
when that was still a matter of debate.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.430
Well it's not quite
round, we know that now.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.692
Now you can, with your
cell phone, your iPad,

00:25:44.692 --> 00:25:46.952
your computer, whatever you like,

00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:48.250
you can do this.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.986
You can fly to Baja California, dive in,

00:25:50.986 --> 00:25:54.539
get a look at the creatures
who live under water.

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:59.020
The engineers at Google
had a couple of challenges

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.154
in transforming Google Earth

00:26:01.154 --> 00:26:04.460
so that you could actually
dive in beneath the surface.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.320
First of all, they could
go from the stars above,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.150
down to the surface, and
fly around Grand Canyon,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.228
see your backyard, and
your neighbor's back yard,

00:26:12.228 --> 00:26:14.727
find Starbucks, and do
all sorts of things.

00:26:14.727 --> 00:26:17.588
The one thing they couldn't
do was go underwater

00:26:17.588 --> 00:26:21.170
and they didn't know how to
portray the surface of the water

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.120
so you knew when you were above or below,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.381
but as you can see they kind
of solved that problem now.

00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:30.029
And you can do what is done
here in a little snapshot,

00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:35.029
of create your own tour of
Google Earth, Google Ocean,

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.100
and there are ways to
upload your photographs

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.882
to share with the rest of the world,

00:26:39.882 --> 00:26:44.882
to actually use this as a node,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.780
a way to understand better

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.572
what's happening around the world.

00:26:51.572 --> 00:26:55.470
And anybody can be a vicarious explorer,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.926
to see places, to see creatures,

00:26:57.926 --> 00:27:02.467
to personally connect the
dots and look for patterns.

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:05.895
This is like an atlas that's alive,

00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:09.022
and the changes can change every day,

00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:13.660
and over time I think we'll have a role

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.870
in sensitizing people
to the need to take care

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.023
of this system that really is vital

00:27:21.023 --> 00:27:24.960
to our survival, our well-being,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.210
to go to places such as you see here

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:32.072
off in the Coral Triangle,
the western Pacific,

00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:36.350
where the greatest diversity
of corals, and coral reef fish,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.350
and echinoderms, and many
categories of ocean creatures

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:44.330
have their highest
level of diversity here,

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.095
but it's at risk right now from fishing,

00:27:47.095 --> 00:27:50.060
from coastal development, from ignorance.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.055
Largely, people don't
know, so they can't care.

00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:57.993
Not everybody is going to be
able to zip down to Antarctica

00:27:57.993 --> 00:28:00.690
to take a look at what's happening there,

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.990
but again, vicariously you can do this.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.680
You can see how the ice is retreating

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.430
and make the connection,
make the link back

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.775
to well why is it so quickly disappearing,

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.898
in the Arctic as well,

00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:17.200
and to understand what's
beneath the surface

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.070
like the Gakkel Ridge
under the Arctic Ocean,

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.738
that the existence of this
wasn't known when I was a kid.

00:28:23.738 --> 00:28:25.833
Now we know that it's there.

00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:29.530
Now we know about the existence
of hydro-thermal vents

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.833
in places throughout
the oceans of the world.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.861
The best hope for the
future is really in knowing.

00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:41.540
You can't care if you don't know,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.930
and we haven't known so
much about why nature,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.150
why the ocean, why fish alive matter.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.460
And so we've done some
really stupid things

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.460
in the past through ignorance,
but now there's no excuse

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.093
for not taking care of these things,

00:28:59.093 --> 00:29:00.290
that we don't know how

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.083
to put back together
again once they're gone.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.243
So watch this.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.410
Again that image, you know that associated

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.600
one way or the other with
the National Geographic

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.890
ever since I was a kid.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.240
I mean first of all we
used to subscribe to it.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.661
Our house in New Jersey

00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:21.090
was kind of tilted in this direction.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.260
The Geographics were on the downside.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.720
We can't throw them away, I
still can't throw them away.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.440
They occupy a big part

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.463
of what of what I call
home over in Oakland.

00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:38.970
But I first had a chance
to make a contribution

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.865
to the National Geographic in 1971

00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:46.420
and at they time when they
asked me if I would write

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.502
an article about living underwater,

00:29:48.502 --> 00:29:52.477
my first reaction as an
ivory tower scientist

00:29:52.477 --> 00:29:55.825
and at Harvard, it was actually
1970 when they asked me,

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:58.925
I said no, because scientists don't write

00:29:58.925 --> 00:30:01.709
for the popular press, if
they do they cross the line.

00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:03.360
Even the National Geographic,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.009
as distinguished and beloved as it is,

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:08.763
at the time for me was,

00:30:11.994 --> 00:30:14.470
you know as a scientist it would've put me

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.133
in a different category and
I wrestled with the idea

00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:19.660
of whether I should write

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.993
for the National
Geographic after I said no.

00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:26.330
And what caused me to eventually say yes

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.320
and write my first article
was a curious coincidence.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.320
On my shelf there's a little
book by Thomas Huxley called,

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.424
On Discourses, Geological and Biological,

00:30:36.424 --> 00:30:39.289
where he has a collection of essays.

00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:42.237
The first essay was to
the carpenter's union

00:30:42.237 --> 00:30:46.270
in Norwich, England, and
he took a piece of chalk

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.580
out of his pocket, and he
describes this in his essay,

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.500
and showed it to the
carpenters, and pointed out

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.830
that here was the history
of the North Atlantic Ocean

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.137
written in the creatures
that were in the chalk.

00:30:58.137 --> 00:31:01.850
And he had a way, he
entranced me a hundred years

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.018
after this book was published,

00:31:04.018 --> 00:31:06.400
and it was the beginning
of the book though.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.200
In the introduction he
said, as a scientist

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.940
your fellow scientists will scorn you

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.550
for speaking to the public,

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.570
but you must do it as a
scientist to give back,

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:20.603
and the one thing you
must do is tell the truth,

00:31:20.603 --> 00:31:24.730
and don't give in to the
temptation to embellish.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.370
That I now know, it's the kiss of death,

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.056
and that's probably why
the scientific community

00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:34.610
has over the years become
resistant to the idea

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.130
of communicating because
often communicating

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.066
with other then their learned colleagues,

00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:45.066
the truth gets stretched, and
stories get passed around,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.170
and it's not what you said,

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.113
it's what others want to believe.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:54.230
But I was motivated to give in

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.290
and write my first article
for the National Geographic,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.680
and I was impressed by the scrutiny

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.820
that they put me through, more
than any peer review journal

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.668
that I've ever, ever written for,

00:32:06.668 --> 00:32:09.877
and I mean I did cross the line,

00:32:09.877 --> 00:32:14.877
and I did lose some ground I
suppose as a learned scientist

00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:18.500
among my colleagues, but
now it's somewhat different.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.258
Now I think in part, because scientists

00:32:22.258 --> 00:32:25.790
are really having a hard time

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.280
being appreciated as, and science.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.690
It's not the scientist
it's the science that is,

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.420
we need to become better
communicators, whatever it takes,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.710
and now we have new tools to do it,

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.650
and now the National Science Foundation,

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.527
and other granting institutions,

00:32:44.527 --> 00:32:47.540
not only encourage you to do it,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.990
in some cases they really
mandate that you find some way

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.951
to communicate beyond just
the usual scientific journals.

00:32:55.951 --> 00:32:57.747
I hope this is good news

00:32:57.747 --> 00:33:02.130
because we need science-based policy.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.993
We need science-based
conservation for heaven sakes.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.568
We need to understand the reality

00:33:09.568 --> 00:33:11.332
to the best of our ability,

00:33:11.332 --> 00:33:15.366
and to get the public
generally to appreciate

00:33:15.366 --> 00:33:20.173
what we know, and what they need to know.

00:33:20.173 --> 00:33:24.270
So, this is a picture that
the National Geographic

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.183
had nothing to do with developing,

00:33:27.183 --> 00:33:31.520
but it's still perhaps the best image

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.640
that has ever been taken,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.720
in terms of something that
will make a difference

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.680
in the way people regard themselves.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.500
I've also come along,
not just during this time

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.090
of great new means of communicating,

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.630
but also new ways of exploring the ocean.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.273
I had the fun of being
one of the first people

00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:53.720
in the country to try scuba, it was 1953.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.530
I was taking one of the first classes

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.760
taught in the country in Marine Biology.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.240
It was at Florida State University.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.841
We had two scuba tanks.

00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:06.330
I had two words of
instruction, breathe naturally,

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.360
(audience laughing)

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.490
and it's really important to do that.

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.180
Don't hold your breath (chuckling)

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.749
while you're going up and
down in the water column,

00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:18.310
and it kept us alive, and later we learned

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.946
a lot of other things that we
needed to do to stay alive.

00:34:21.946 --> 00:34:25.966
I think it's fantastic,
wonderful, a blessing,

00:34:25.966 --> 00:34:30.870
that we have now developed new
means of exploring the ocean,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.112
and there are millions of people
who have taken the plunge,

00:34:34.112 --> 00:34:38.560
put on a mask and flippers,
a tank, been able to go down

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.565
to 50 meters or so beneath the surface,

00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:44.230
get acquainted with the
blue part of the planet.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.803
This little blue speck in
the universe that is special.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.410
I've had a chance to live underwater

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.700
on nine different occasions.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.891
This is the most recent
underwater laboratory

00:34:55.891 --> 00:34:59.374
in existence, the Aquarius.

00:34:59.374 --> 00:35:02.280
It was launched more than 20 years ago.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.780
It's still working away down
in the Florida Keys and I mean,

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.293
you can submit a project and
perhaps do what they call,

00:35:09.293 --> 00:35:11.063
be an aquanaut.

00:35:12.294 --> 00:35:15.845
I got to be an aquanaut first in 1970

00:35:15.845 --> 00:35:19.691
for the Tektite Project, living
underwater for two weeks.

00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:22.040
At first they didn't know
whether women would be allowed

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.310
to participate, because
they hadn't thought to say

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.010
no women should apply, but
when a number of us did,

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.010
and the projects, and our qualifications

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.630
seemed to be pretty good,

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.753
the head of the program
made history of the sort,

00:35:34.753 --> 00:35:39.753
Jim Miller, who had a
happy marriage I think,

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.970
and had a good mom, 'cause he said,

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.120
well shall there or
shall there not be women.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.330
Well half the fish are female,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.815
I guess we could put up with a few women,

00:35:52.815 --> 00:35:54.911
and they did, they put up with us.

00:35:54.911 --> 00:35:58.310
They couldn't put us together
with our male colleagues

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.640
because, and the words
they used at the time were,

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.041
there could be hanky-panky on the reef.

00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:05.231
(audience laughing)

00:36:05.231 --> 00:36:07.250
I mean hanky-panky, what
kind of word is that.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.430
But anyway, they made an all women's team

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.510
and it turned out to be a media feast.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.589
The idea of women, a team of women,

00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:21.101
mere women living
underwater for two weeks.

00:36:21.101 --> 00:36:23.710
And there were 50 men and women

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.428
over a period of that year, 1970,

00:36:26.428 --> 00:36:31.428
that stayed for 10 days to
as much as two full months

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.470
living underwater, but I was one of the,

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.318
our team, the women's
team stayed for two weeks,

00:36:38.318 --> 00:36:41.483
and we got wonderful questions such as,

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.866
did you wear lipstick underwater?

00:36:44.866 --> 00:36:47.406
Did you use a hairdryer?

00:36:47.406 --> 00:36:51.030
I mean like, okay we
answered those questions

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:56.030
to this amazing amount of
interest that was generated.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.280
We had a ticker tape parade
down State Street in Chicago,

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.623
the women's team, not the
guys, just the women's team.

00:37:02.623 --> 00:37:06.210
I got to address Congress and tell about

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.650
what it was like to live underwater.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.195
We were treated more or
less the way the astronauts

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:12.256
were treated in the early days.

00:37:12.256 --> 00:37:16.356
I mean it sounded kind of
similar, astronaut, aquanaut,

00:37:16.356 --> 00:37:21.320
and it was perhaps a
good thing for the ocean.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.470
That' the only basis on
which I could kind of stand

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.330
to look at all these microphones
that scared me to death

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.880
with the idea of speaking not
just to a group like this,

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.375
but like 25 million people out there

00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:37.480
on one of the broadcasts

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.485
that came after the Tektite Project.

00:37:40.485 --> 00:37:42.314
But that was for me,

00:37:42.314 --> 00:37:45.870
that and the National
Geographic beating on my door,

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.372
saying would you please write an article,

00:37:47.372 --> 00:37:49.650
ever since then I've been
beating on their door,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.380
saying please may I write
an article for your magazine

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.880
about this, that, or something else.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.380
This is amazing time that we live in,

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.256
time that we share, for the
first time kind of understanding

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:05.220
how the whole system, not just
a little piece here or there,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.656
but to really pull the
whole system together,

00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:12.880
and understand what we're doing to it,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.154
and how in the next 10 years,

00:38:16.154 --> 00:38:21.154
we have an opportunity to
literally make history,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.040
one way or the other, through
what we do or fail to do.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.720
'Cause we're so close to losing.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.690
We're so close to
gaining an enduring place

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.673
for ourselves within the natural world

00:38:34.673 --> 00:38:36.583
that keeps us alive.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.937
So part of it is having the
tools to get out and explore.

00:38:41.937 --> 00:38:45.550
I, in 1979 had a chance to use this suit.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.450
I'll talk about it a little
bit more tomorrow night

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.197
when we talk more about technology.

00:38:49.197 --> 00:38:51.766
But it seems so primitive in a way,

00:38:51.766 --> 00:38:55.443
to just go down and
walk around a thousand,

00:38:55.443 --> 00:38:57.726
1,200 feet beneath the surface.

00:38:57.726 --> 00:39:00.716
We can go 1,200 feet every other direction

00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:05.716
with no real issue, but
imagine just going a thousand,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:10.610
2,000, 5,000 feet under
the surface of the ocean.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.898
It's still a big deal.

00:39:12.898 --> 00:39:16.490
But I love the new technologies
that have come along

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.950
just in recent years.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.510
Little submersibles that
are so simple to drive

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.063
that even a scientist can
do it, and I'm living proof.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.370
Getting in like a little sports car

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:29.390
and take off 2,000 feet
down beneath the surface,

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:33.030
or another version of the Deep Rover,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.870
that I actually started three companies,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.399
but the first one was to
try to develop systems

00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:42.270
that would take scientists down

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.461
to explore the ocean personally,

00:39:44.461 --> 00:39:48.800
and that goes to a thousand meters.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.020
This is the two person
version of the Deep ORCA

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.200
that's built up in Canada.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.949
There are about 20 of these systems,

00:39:54.949 --> 00:39:58.510
single and dual deep worker systems.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.166
It's not quite enough to
be like Hertz-Rent-A-Sub,

00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:03.050
but it's getting there.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:04.657
You know, it's maybe in a few years

00:40:04.657 --> 00:40:06.718
it will be kind of like that.

00:40:06.718 --> 00:40:09.076
So you want to spend a Saturday afternoon

00:40:09.076 --> 00:40:13.080
going off to Monterey, not
just diving along the beach,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:13.913
in the Kelp Forest.

00:40:13.913 --> 00:40:17.630
That's really cool and I love
it, but there's a difference.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.895
If you go down to a hundred feet,

00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:24.669
you can still see kelps, you
can still see the sea lions,

00:40:24.669 --> 00:40:28.530
and the otters, but go
down to a thousand feet,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.882
and it's not that far, a thousand feet.

00:40:31.882 --> 00:40:34.921
The place is owned by echinoderms.

00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:37.600
There are basket stars.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.950
There are brittle stars.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.780
The place is just alive with
another group of animals

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.870
that you don't see at all on the land

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.660
or in fresh water,
they're only in the ocean,

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.609
and oh are there ever a lot of them,

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:52.830
and they're beautiful,
and they're important.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.760
But what do we know about them?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.090
What does the average
person who lives in Monterey

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.387
know about the starfish
that live a mile offshore

00:41:01.387 --> 00:41:03.220
and a thousand feet down?

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.171
Practically nothing.

00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:09.031
It is changing, because
we now have aquariums

00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.400
like the Monterey Aquarium,
the best in the world,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.490
and of course the Steinhart Aquarium,

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.218
it's one of the oldest in the world,

00:41:16.218 --> 00:41:20.608
and down on Pier 39
there's this great aquarium

00:41:20.608 --> 00:41:23.410
that brings in I thinks something

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:27.380
like 2 million visitors a
year, a halfway house for fish

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.560
and people to get
acquainted in ways other,

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.010
you know a lot of people see fish

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.210
swimming with lemon slices and butter.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:38.620
But seeing them swimming in
an aquarium or best of all,

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.760
go down in the ocean,
go deep in the ocean.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.640
Here's the irony, here we are
with this great space program.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.425
Yeah it's cutting back a bit, but still.

00:41:47.425 --> 00:41:50.532
You know we've been to the
moon, we have sent probes

00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:52.484
out beyond our own solar system,

00:41:52.484 --> 00:41:56.285
but we only have a handful of vehicles

00:41:56.285 --> 00:41:58.770
that can go as much as
half the ocean's depth.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:03.770
This is one the two Mir
subs that Russia owns.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.790
Actually they have three subs now

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.340
that can go to 6,000 meters.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.219
France has one, Japan has
one that goes to 6,500.

00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:15.886
India is building one to go that deep.

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:20.600
China is building one
to go to 7,000 meters.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.330
But nobody's building something
to go to full ocean depth,

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:28.680
that is to 11,000 meters except
through private initiative.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.966
Not governments, but
we have Richard Branson

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:36.856
and Jim Cameron, private
individuals with their own money

00:42:36.856 --> 00:42:40.249
backing something to push the envelope,

00:42:40.249 --> 00:42:43.350
to be able to solve the problem,

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:47.040
that actually was solved
with government funding

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.650
going back to 1960, when
the Trieste made a dive

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.199
to the deepest part of the
ocean once for 20 minutes.

00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:57.550
But once you get there what do you see?

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.845
Coral reefs, sponge reefs, life,

00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:04.904
from the surface to the greatest depths,

00:43:04.904 --> 00:43:07.182
critters everywhere.

00:43:07.182 --> 00:43:09.575
Every drop of water, Craig Venter,

00:43:09.575 --> 00:43:12.695
with his great project
on the human genome,

00:43:12.695 --> 00:43:14.835
now has turned his attention to the sea,

00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:17.585
looking kind of at the
genome of the ocean,

00:43:17.585 --> 00:43:21.375
looking at how many of
what kind of microbes

00:43:21.375 --> 00:43:23.610
live in a spoonful of water,

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.605
spoonfuls of water being
taken all over the world,

00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:29.532
and finding the enormous diversity of life

00:43:29.532 --> 00:43:33.108
at the microbial level that
we didn't even know existed

00:43:33.108 --> 00:43:37.383
going back to when I was a
kid, or even 20 years ago.

00:43:37.383 --> 00:43:39.965
What else is out there, down there?

00:43:39.965 --> 00:43:43.470
That we are just beginning to explore

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.054
now that we have tools to get
there, to try to understand

00:43:49.054 --> 00:43:53.270
what is, what are starfish worth?

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.541
I don't mean in terms of
pounds of starfish meat,

00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:57.130
but what are they doing?

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.081
What are sponges doing for the ocean

00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:02.899
and how does all this relate back to us?

00:44:02.899 --> 00:44:07.780
It's like Aldo Leopold said
about the diversity of life,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.710
the nuts, the bolts, the cogs, the wheels

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.063
that hold the world together.

00:44:12.063 --> 00:44:14.660
Which ones can we afford to lose?

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.559
Probably none, at least
at our risk do we lose

00:44:19.559 --> 00:44:24.559
diverse creatures that each
has a role, a place in the sea,

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:30.190
in making the way the
world functions as it does.

00:44:30.197 --> 00:44:34.290
Right now most people, if
they think about squid at all,

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.771
they think calamari.

00:44:36.771 --> 00:44:38.380
Even here in California,

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.607
where there's a somewhat
more enlightened attitude

00:44:41.607 --> 00:44:45.791
about life in general then
in many parts of the world,

00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:49.292
it's open season on squid, and yet,

00:44:49.292 --> 00:44:53.261
if you look at the ocean and how it works,

00:44:53.261 --> 00:44:57.200
the last creatures we would
want to kill would be the squid.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.730
They're the middle-men,
low on the food chain,

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.470
that are so important to
birds, to seals, to sea lions,

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.009
to otters, to fish, to the
chemistry of the ocean.

00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:10.799
Food chains that result
every step of the way,

00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:13.290
taking food in, putting nutrients out

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.629
that drive the phytoplankton,
that drive the food chain,

00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:17.888
that drive the oxygen cycle,

00:45:17.888 --> 00:45:19.700
that drive the carbon cycle,

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.790
that drive the way the world works.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:25.919
We need this engine to
function for our sake.

00:45:25.919 --> 00:45:27.669
I mean I am a squid-hugger.

00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:31.458
I love squid, they're
just such great animals.

00:45:31.458 --> 00:45:33.930
I've had many encounters with them,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.710
where they get probably frustrated

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.040
with humans who look at them.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.420
They go through all this repertoire

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.370
of changing their colors, and shapes.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.520
And it's true with octopuses,

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.570
and all the cephalopods are
just amazing in their ability

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.870
to communicate with color, and
perhaps with bioluminescence,

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.680
and we can't do that.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.010
We probably look like idiots out there,

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.802
all we can do is bubble.

00:45:57.802 --> 00:46:01.865
They go through this
extravagant messaging system

00:46:01.865 --> 00:46:04.499
and we just bubble back.

00:46:04.499 --> 00:46:09.499
To many water, lakes,
rivers, streams, the ocean

00:46:11.148 --> 00:46:13.706
is just that, just water,

00:46:13.706 --> 00:46:18.706
but now we know that water,
wherever it is in nature

00:46:19.115 --> 00:46:21.996
is likely to be alive.

00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:26.040
Well we don't know about Mars, or Jupiter,

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.037
or elsewhere in the
universe where water exists,

00:46:29.037 --> 00:46:31.460
in some cases in abundance.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.776
Comets, loaded with water, frozen water,

00:46:34.776 --> 00:46:39.002
but earth is blessed with lots of water

00:46:39.002 --> 00:46:41.630
and with lots of life.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.790
Liquid water is the key and we treat it

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.820
as if its ours first
of all, water is ours.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.780
We pipe it, we use it for agriculture,

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.250
we use it for all sorts of purposes,

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:59.190
but the most importance use for water

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.495
is that it's home for
most of life on earth.

00:47:01.495 --> 00:47:06.310
Perhaps 97% of life on earth
is out there in the ocean.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:10.478
It keeps us alive, shapes
the way the world works,

00:47:10.478 --> 00:47:14.795
and until we face up to it
and the need to protect it,

00:47:14.795 --> 00:47:19.720
our lives are on the line, at risk.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.896
I love going out and
diving with whale sharks.

00:47:23.896 --> 00:47:27.170
It's fairly recently that
I've had a chance to do that

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.476
because only recently have
we identified a few places

00:47:30.476 --> 00:47:32.930
in the world where they do congregate.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.064
Now pretty reliably you
can go to Baja California,

00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:38.450
you can go off Cancun, you
could go a hundred miles south

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.850
of the Mississippi Delta,
out into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.210
and find yourself in the midst

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.700
of gaggles of whale sharks feeding.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.720
You have to first of all
find out where the food is

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.930
and then you're likely to find out

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.736
where the whale sharks gather.

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:54.869
And off the west coast of Australia

00:47:54.869 --> 00:47:58.019
at certain times of the year,
whale sharks get together.

00:47:58.019 --> 00:48:01.163
And mostly they're solitary,
but when there's food around

00:48:01.163 --> 00:48:04.510
nobody knows yet where
they go to whoop it up

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.900
and do what it takes to
make more whale sharks,

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.635
the breeding areas, still a mystery.

00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:12.024
But one thing we do know is that

00:48:12.024 --> 00:48:15.139
when they take a big gulp of plankton,

00:48:15.139 --> 00:48:19.148
they're taking a gulp of a
cross-section of life on earth.

00:48:19.148 --> 00:48:22.450
The larval stages of so many
of the creatures in the sea,

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.597
maybe a dozen phyla of
animals go down the guzzle

00:48:25.597 --> 00:48:28.377
of a whale shark with every gulp.

00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:32.170
It's astonishing the diversity
of life that's out there

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.659
in the water itself.

00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:37.840
So when they put a desal
plant in and take in water,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.780
it isn't just water.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.218
It's a soup, it's a living soup.

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:43.877
You sacrifice all the little
guys that are in the water

00:48:43.877 --> 00:48:48.500
going in to get fresh water and salt

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.570
coming out the other end,

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.130
and that doesn't mean that
we shouldn't be doing this,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.397
but we should do it with our eyes open,

00:48:54.397 --> 00:48:56.650
and consider the trade-offs.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.940
Be careful and maybe get
smarter about how we deal

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.313
with water as a commodity,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.050
and fish as a commodity.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.920
Huh, living underwater,
that first experience,

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.870
and every time since, and now every dive,

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.820
every time I put my face
in the water I'm aware

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.990
that every fish is different
from every other one,

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.540
and if a fish came sailing
through this room right now

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.910
and looked around, they'd probably think

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.363
that all people look alike,
and that's the attitude

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:30.660
that I had about sardines, or grouper,

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.620
or even you know squid.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.913
You see a big flock of
them, a group of them

00:49:34.913 --> 00:49:37.530
and they do look pretty much alike,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.860
and then when you spend time with them,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.630
quality time, like day and
night, get to know individuals.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.510
You realize they have different faces,

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.870
different behaviors, different attitudes.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.590
You can tell them apart.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:53.820
Every person on the planet,
whoever has been, is now,

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.140
or ever will be is different.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.956
Every cat, every dog, I
know it about every cat.

00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:03.200
You know for sure, but it's such a,

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.890
I mean why is it taking
us so long to realize

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.620
that every sardine is its own self,

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.263
different from every other one,

00:50:11.263 --> 00:50:14.192
with its own little DNA fingerprint.

00:50:14.192 --> 00:50:19.192
It's a revelation, coupled with
a revelation new in my time,

00:50:20.012 --> 00:50:24.910
that the connectivity, the DNA, the RNA,

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.407
the chemistry of life
through all forms of life

00:50:27.407 --> 00:50:30.210
is remarkably similar.

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:32.980
That each of us shares so much in common

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:36.705
with every cat, every pine
tree, every jellyfish.

00:50:36.705 --> 00:50:39.512
That's the miracle of life.

00:50:39.512 --> 00:50:41.895
The great diversity, infinite diversity,

00:50:41.895 --> 00:50:45.533
and a great common ground we all share.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.960
That puts us as part of the system.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.053
It's all connected.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.190
No two parrot fish that look exactly alike

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.490
with freckles on their
nose, or speckled rays,

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:01.210
or spotted little trunk
fish, or angel fish,

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.883
of you name it.

00:51:03.733 --> 00:51:06.101
Now we know.

00:51:06.101 --> 00:51:10.636
Now that we know there's no excuse anymore

00:51:10.636 --> 00:51:13.453
for continuing to behave toward the ocean

00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:18.453
as if it's just a place to take
stuff out and put things in.

00:51:18.736 --> 00:51:23.670
We need to understand and
respect the ocean with new eyes,

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.370
new understanding, and new policies,

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.797
new ways that are not
just good for the fish

00:51:28.797 --> 00:51:32.470
and the reefs of the ocean,
the whales and whatever,

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.379
but it's really important to us.

00:51:34.379 --> 00:51:39.379
So extracting wildlife
from the sea using trawls

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.009
that scrape the sea floor

00:51:42.009 --> 00:51:46.559
like bulldozers catching
songbirds using, in a forest.

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:50.310
Scrape them up and shake out
the forest, throw it away,

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:52.144
and take a few pounds of protein.

00:51:52.144 --> 00:51:57.144
We're destroying much of the
ocean with these heavy duty

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.611
damaging techniques that 50 years ago,

00:52:00.611 --> 00:52:03.365
40 years ago, even 25 years ago,

00:52:03.365 --> 00:52:06.350
maybe there was some excuse
because we didn't know

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.530
what we now know, how
vulnerable the ocean is

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.228
to our actions.

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:15.850
You know I love the policies
that have been developed

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:20.479
over recent times to look
at Mars, our sister planet,

00:52:20.479 --> 00:52:23.230
and other places, and
thinking about what we can do

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.720
to terraform other parts
of the solar system,

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.260
especially Mars, and yet
you look in our back yard

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.717
and we're kind of doing the reverse.

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:38.717
We're not, I mean while we're
looking to terraform Mars,

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.852
make it more earthlike,
we're Marsiforming earth,

00:52:41.852 --> 00:52:46.440
making it more, well
making it less hospitable,

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.710
more like our sister planet

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.530
through transformation
of the carpet of life

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.570
that keeps us alive into something that,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:57.680
yeah it's okay to farm.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.033
We need to do that to grow the food.

00:53:00.908 --> 00:53:02.910
In 1800 it was a billion.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.424
When I came along it was two billion,

00:53:04.424 --> 00:53:07.310
1980, four billion,
now it's seven billion,

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.143
and the numbers go up

00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:10.340
but the planet doesn't get any bigger.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.790
But we can't just do to the entire planet

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.605
what we've done to a big chunk of it,

00:53:15.605 --> 00:53:19.644
transform the natural
systems that keep us alive,

00:53:19.644 --> 00:53:21.010
into something else.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.080
We need to get better,
smarter, more efficient,

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.570
more effective about using the assets,

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.309
instead of burning
through the assets as if

00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:32.263
it's all about us, all about now,

00:53:32.263 --> 00:53:36.293
if we want to have a future for humankind.

00:53:36.293 --> 00:53:39.490
The way we extract wildlife from the sea,

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.959
like this trawl that takes orange roughy

00:53:41.959 --> 00:53:44.277
from 2,000 feet beneath the surface

00:53:44.277 --> 00:53:46.389
in the southern hemisphere and market

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.980
it right here in Oakland.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.080
In Berkeley, I think last week,

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.533
orange roughy sold for 8.95 a pound.

00:53:54.533 --> 00:53:56.520
This fish the one you're seeing here,

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.160
may be a hundred years old.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.180
It's like the rock fish
offshore in California.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.083
They live a long time, they grow slowly.

00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:05.951
It may take 25 or 30
years for them to mature.

00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:09.256
We don't raise 25 year
old chickens or cows.

00:54:09.256 --> 00:54:11.900
You know we like to turn
'em over pretty fast,

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.203
and yet we take wildlife from the sea,

00:54:14.203 --> 00:54:19.203
sharks and creatures that
again live a long time,

00:54:20.802 --> 00:54:24.108
might have taken 20 or 25 years to grow,

00:54:24.108 --> 00:54:26.779
and yet we extract them thinking,

00:54:26.779 --> 00:54:28.861
huh, you know they're free.

00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:31.180
Let's just go get them,

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.600
and it's exactly what
we've been doing at a pace

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.600
that outstrips the capacity
of these creatures to recover.

00:54:41.038 --> 00:54:45.583
Whether it's sharks, or tunas,

00:54:46.642 --> 00:54:51.642
where is our capacity as
brilliant creatures that we are,

00:54:52.347 --> 00:54:57.162
to think of a tuna fish
is good only in a sandwich

00:54:57.162 --> 00:55:01.250
or in a salad, or sushi, or sashimi.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:05.340
I have actually stood
next to MIT engineers,

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:10.340
watching them sigh with envy
at images of bluefin tuna

00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:15.471
and other streamline fish,
while they try to figure out

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.094
how to learn from their efficiency

00:55:18.094 --> 00:55:23.094
and capture their secrets with robo-tuna,

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:28.400
with creatures that might
emulate, in engineering terms,

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.230
what they do naturally.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.344
Capturing the energy from,

00:55:32.344 --> 00:55:35.460
as they move their tail back and forth,

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.170
little whirlpools are formed

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:41.240
and power them at a speed
faster then a nuclear submarine,

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.250
50 miles an hour through the water.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.954
We don't have, with 97% efficiency

00:55:46.954 --> 00:55:49.263
according to their calculations.

00:55:49.263 --> 00:55:52.500
What can we learn from sperm whales,

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.844
biggest brain on the planet,

00:55:53.844 --> 00:55:57.534
with close-knit societies,
long migrations.

00:55:57.534 --> 00:55:59.947
They come back to areas.

00:55:59.947 --> 00:56:03.320
Ability to hold their breath
and dive more then a mile

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.916
beneath the surface and find squid.

00:56:05.916 --> 00:56:09.850
There's so much whales can tell us

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.173
or they can be turned into pounds of meat.

00:56:13.145 --> 00:56:16.663
True with dolphins, we're still
in some parts of the world

00:56:16.663 --> 00:56:19.229
just looking at dolphins
as pieces of meat.

00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:21.673
Few countries, not all of them of course,

00:56:21.673 --> 00:56:23.733
but it's an attitude.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.620
Now that we know, now
that we have alternatives,

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.123
it was a different thing 10,000 years ago

00:56:31.123 --> 00:56:33.953
when the best way we could figure out

00:56:33.953 --> 00:56:36.530
to supply energy for ourselves

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:37.936
was to go out and kill wildlife,

00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:41.733
cut the trees and all of
that, but now we know.

00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:45.008
We should be able to
capitalize on our big brains

00:56:45.008 --> 00:56:46.850
and figure it out.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.314
Find a place for ourselves
within the natural systems

00:56:49.314 --> 00:56:51.210
that keep us alive.

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.500
Figure out alternatives
to burning fossil fuels

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.890
now that we know the downside.

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:58.529
We know the upside, burning fossil fuels,

00:56:58.529 --> 00:57:00.169
we went to the moon.

00:57:00.169 --> 00:57:02.803
We couldn't do that on whale oil.

00:57:02.803 --> 00:57:06.390
Using fossil fuels, we travel the planet

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.625
and are learning things
that we couldn't know

00:57:09.625 --> 00:57:11.880
without burning through those assets

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.460
in the short period of
time since the middle

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.310
of the 20th century, to
give us what we now have

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:21.390
as the most powerful knowledge base

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:24.900
that the planet has ever
had available to it.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.986
And now we know we have
to think differently

00:57:27.986 --> 00:57:31.759
about how to power our
civilization going forward,

00:57:31.759 --> 00:57:36.042
'cause now along with the
upside, we know the downside.

00:57:36.042 --> 00:57:38.540
Let's use our brains.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.840
I mean the talent is there.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.617
The talent is in this room
to be able to measure,

00:57:43.617 --> 00:57:47.577
and calculate, and project
where we come from,

00:57:47.577 --> 00:57:51.527
where are we, and where are we going.

00:57:51.527 --> 00:57:55.810
We could not have built
this graph 50 years ago,

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:56.670
but now we can.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:59.820
This is just from 1980 to 1997,

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.250
looking at the summer ice in the Arctic.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.750
It's a powerful picture.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.816
It just shows the rate of change

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:10.657
in a little snapshot of
time that we all share.

00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:15.657
That loss of summer ice in
the Arctic is really bad news

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.823
for walruses, and polar bears.

00:58:18.823 --> 00:58:23.015
It's happening in the Antarctic as well.

00:58:23.015 --> 00:58:26.467
Bad news because of the
acidification of the ocean,

00:58:26.467 --> 00:58:29.569
with these little coccolithophords,

00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:33.410
the foraminifera, the prochlorococcus.

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:35.600
Although it doesn't have
calcium carbonate shell,

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.370
prochlorococcus is said to generate

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:39.997
one in every five breaths we take,

00:58:39.997 --> 00:58:42.660
and a change in the acidity of the ocean

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:47.660
could well effect its fate and
future, and therefore ours.

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:49.544
We didn't even know of
its existence before

00:58:49.544 --> 00:58:53.010
Penny Chisholm and some
of her colleagues from MIT

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.800
on an expedition to look for phytoplankton

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.210
using a new technique,

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.780
found these ultra microscopic organisms

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.151
that are so important to
food chains in the sea,

00:59:03.151 --> 00:59:08.093
and to powering oxygen
cycle and the carbon cycle.

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.070
What else don't we know
about the role of copepods

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.901
or the role of krill.

00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:16.107
We do know that they're
critically important

00:59:16.107 --> 00:59:17.890
to food chains in the sea,

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.900
but what are we doing to the ocean

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.638
that could alter their fate

00:59:21.638 --> 00:59:25.224
and therefore modify coral reefs.

00:59:25.224 --> 00:59:30.224
And last year, this time last year,

00:59:31.424 --> 00:59:34.346
I think many of us were
riveted with what was happening

00:59:34.346 --> 00:59:39.346
in the Gulf of Mexico with
the access to deep sea

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.740
that didn't exist until fairly recently,

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:45.060
to extract from the heart of the earth,

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.482
beneath the bottom of the ocean,

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:49.539
far beneath the bottom of the ocean,

00:59:49.539 --> 00:59:51.818
a mile of water, but then
there's the rock beneath,

00:59:51.818 --> 00:59:56.818
to access these sources of power, fuel,

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.130
that we now are using
to power our society,

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:07.021
and the downside that we are now putting

01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:09.071
on the balance sheet.

01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:11.827
There are risks, there are rewards,

01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:14.438
but certainly there is the big reward

01:00:14.438 --> 01:00:17.172
of using our power, now that we know,

01:00:17.172 --> 01:00:20.670
to shape the future

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:24.077
based on knowing for example,
that one-time-use plastics

01:00:24.077 --> 01:00:28.920
are kind of a stupid thing
for us to be engaged in

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.420
and yet we are doing it,

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.429
now that we know we
should change our ways.

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:36.650
This is a good news story,
because that little turtle

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:40.200
was freed from its
encumbrance and swam away.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.910
I hope it's still out there.

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.992
But a lot of gear is
out there in the ocean,

01:00:43.992 --> 01:00:47.954
continuing to fish,
continuing to catch and kill

01:00:47.954 --> 01:00:51.920
some 300,000 marine mammals alone,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.380
and hundreds of thousands
of birds are snared

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.673
in derelict fishing gear every year.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.520
It's not just entanglement,
it's just the sheer mass

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.714
of the junk that is clogging the ocean.

01:01:04.714 --> 01:01:06.720
This is another good news story.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.490
Volunteers, students going out

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.020
to the Northwest Hawaiian Islands,

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:15.343
hoping to retrieve masses of
plastic, the fishing gear,

01:01:15.343 --> 01:01:17.830
and taking it out of the ocean.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.380
Another good news story,
in July of this year

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.270
I went to Hong Kong where
a thousand school kids

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.938
gathered to take the pledge.

01:01:25.938 --> 01:01:28.205
We will protect sharks.

01:01:28.205 --> 01:01:32.950
We will never eat shark
fin soup again or ever.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.780
I don't think most of
them ever had tried it,

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.537
but they pledged not to.

01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:40.186
Here in California, just a week ago,

01:01:40.186 --> 01:01:43.980
Governor Brown signed a
legislation making it illegal

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.529
to have trade in shark fins, yahoo, yeah!

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:51.335
(audience applauding)

01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:53.997
The good news, people do care,

01:01:53.997 --> 01:01:58.886
and that's why I am a hope-aholic.

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:01.527
I think that armed with knowledge,

01:02:01.527 --> 01:02:03.614
the ability to communicate together,

01:02:03.614 --> 01:02:05.710
and disseminate information,

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:07.710
and to bring the community together,

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.541
not just the scientists,
not just the policy makers,

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:14.240
not just the artists,
not just the historians,

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.865
not just the writers, it's everybody.

01:02:16.865 --> 01:02:20.180
I personally have a vested
interest in all of this

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.900
because I have three children.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.103
I have four grandsons, two of them here,

01:02:25.103 --> 01:02:27.700
and they remind me, we've gotta figure out

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.189
which way are we going, you know.

01:02:29.189 --> 01:02:33.413
We have a choice, we do have a choice.

01:02:33.413 --> 01:02:36.363
What do you like, the
blue one or the red one?

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.960
I like the blue.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.180
We're edging toward the
red through our actions,

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.912
more CO2 in the
atmosphere, more like mars,

01:02:45.912 --> 01:02:50.912
less water or water that is
not usable for us, less life.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:56.977
We want to, I think, aim for this,

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:00.640
an enduring place for
ourselves within the systems

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.480
that keep us alive.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.347
Well the consequence of my TED wish,

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:10.853
I showed this picture first
and I used the comment

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:14.888
that I first used when I
gave a talk at the World Bank

01:03:14.888 --> 01:03:16.160
a couple years ago.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.786
I said, there it is, the world bank.

01:03:19.786 --> 01:03:22.253
That's where the assets are,

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:25.166
and we've been drawing them down

01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:28.232
through the history of our species.

01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:31.643
Now we know, we gotta
take care of the place.

01:03:31.643 --> 01:03:34.780
We have to use those assets wisely.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.820
It doesn't mean that
we have to stop fishing

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:42.820
or stop farming in places,
but we can be much wiser

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.407
about how we use the assets.

01:03:45.407 --> 01:03:49.558
We must think about the importance
of the diversity of life

01:03:49.558 --> 01:03:52.457
and its value to us.

01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:56.804
I mean it's good enough for
me to save whales, or tunas,

01:03:56.804 --> 01:04:01.804
or calamari in the, the
squids for their own sake,

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.998
for just because.

01:04:03.998 --> 01:04:05.599
I don't know how to make them

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:10.450
and I don't think I should
exert my power to destroy them.

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:15.450
But I think the thing that
will get to most people is

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:19.146
well what does it matter,
why should I care?

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.320
If the ocean dried up tomorrow,

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.300
what difference would it make?

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.924
Well a lot of difference,
like if you like to breathe,

01:04:25.924 --> 01:04:29.401
if you like to have an existence on earth.

01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:33.980
So, one of the outcomes of
my talk, after the talk,

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:38.343
right after the talk, one guy came up.

01:04:38.343 --> 01:04:43.343
He was just like a
little, almost elf-like.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:49.416
He's just a really
unassuming looking person,

01:04:49.416 --> 01:04:53.603
but he said with a great seriousness.

01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:56.650
I think I understand.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:05:01.650
If we fail to take care of the
ocean, nothing else matters.

01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:05.932
The economy, security,
health, all anchors back

01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:10.554
to taking care of the
natural world, mostly blue.

01:05:10.554 --> 01:05:13.621
And he wrote a check
for a million dollars,

01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:17.560
and that was the start of
Mission Blue as an organization.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.420
It was the start of an expedition
to the Galapagos Islands

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.076
that took place a year and a half ago,

01:05:24.076 --> 01:05:27.920
where we got about a hundred of people,

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.700
some of the best minds
that we could muster

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.208
from around the world to come together

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:36.360
and to give the talk of
their life. (laughing)

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.430
About 25 people actually gave talks,

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.711
the rest were there to listen

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:44.034
and to use what they were inspired to do,

01:05:44.034 --> 01:05:46.770
as a consequence of hearing these talks,

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:48.340
and thinking about the ocean,

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.060
and to go forth and do something.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.240
And it's resulted in a
lot of different things,

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.870
but it includes this organization that,

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.600
it's called the Sylvia Earle Alliance,

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.411
but it's a bit like Lance Armstrong.

01:06:03.411 --> 01:06:05.370
That's the foundation.

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:08.070
But what is he trying to do?

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.330
Livestrong.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.899
So it's the Sylvia Earle
Alliance, that's the foundation.

01:06:11.899 --> 01:06:13.660
What we're tryin' to do

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:17.640
is to just build momentum
of the Mission Blue.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.760
It's to get people to use their talents,

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.297
use their capacity in whatever
way they are inspired to do,

01:06:24.297 --> 01:06:27.110
to make a difference for the ocean.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:31.430
It's a loose network of
organizations, of individuals,

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:34.611
of anybody, everybody
to sign up to the idea

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:38.129
that it's our mission to
take care of the place.

01:06:38.129 --> 01:06:42.439
And poets can join in,
scientists can do it, kids,

01:06:42.439 --> 01:06:46.550
CEO's, presidents of companies,

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.483
or corporations, or countries.

01:06:49.483 --> 01:06:52.790
Anybody and everyone
can do what they can do.

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:55.950
I want to just share
with you a little glimpse

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.970
of what happened when we went to sea.

01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:59.334
It's a little video clip.

01:06:59.334 --> 01:07:02.443
It's a trailer actually for
a film that will come out,

01:07:02.443 --> 01:07:05.000
first at Sundance this Spring,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.034
and then it will be in
theaters I hope following that.

01:07:08.034 --> 01:07:13.034
It's a little heavy on what
they say about Sylvia Earle.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:15.050
They should say more about the ocean,

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:16.863
but it's a glimpse anyway of,

01:07:16.863 --> 01:07:20.264
to catch the idea of
what actually happened.

01:07:20.264 --> 01:07:23.514
(gentle droning music)

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.630
50 years ago

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.270
when I began exploring the ocean,

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:33.403
it seemed at that time
to be a sea of Eden,

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.570
but now we know.

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.253
We are now facing paradise lost.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.510
- This trip is absolutely
brand new for TED,

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:45.556
we've never done anything like it before.

01:07:45.556 --> 01:07:49.240
The trip came about because of a wish

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.670
that TED granted Sylvia Earle.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:56.670
- I hope for your help to explore
and protect the wild ocean

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.638
in ways that will restore the health,

01:07:58.638 --> 01:08:03.638
and in so doing secure hope for humankind.

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:07.000
- Sylvia Earle has devoted her life

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.230
to this passion of the oceans.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:11.730
- And the need for
knowledge about all aspects

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.523
of the environment, whether
on the land or on the sea.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:17.606
I've always been a scientist.

01:08:17.606 --> 01:08:20.821
I am a scientist, but I've
been transformed in part

01:08:20.821 --> 01:08:22.790
I suppose by having children

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:26.181
and seeing that the
places I knew as a child,

01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:29.687
I can't take them, because they're gone.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.870
- [Chris] Trip is a bet,
that if you bring together

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:37.240
a group of really remarkable
people who are well resourced,

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.778
some of the world's
greatest marine scientists,

01:08:39.778 --> 01:08:42.440
some of the world's great storytellers.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.649
You put them together and you show them

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:47.025
what's happening in the oceans,

01:08:47.025 --> 01:08:49.950
something incredible is gonna happen.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:54.370
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:57.450
- I was raised with a
great respect for nature,

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.390
but I'd never added the ocean to that.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:04.100
And to be able to be in a
place like the Galapagos,

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.500
to actually get into the water
and see some of the creatures

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.753
that we're talking about
has changed my life.

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.440
- Getting people to not only
understand intellectually,

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.286
but to know their hearts.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.403
We're so changing the way the world works

01:09:19.403 --> 01:09:21.590
that our future is at risk.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.429
- The type of fishing going on today

01:09:23.429 --> 01:09:27.780
is really wiping bluefin
ecologically off the planet.

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.670
- Whale meat being sold in these markets

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.530
was really dolphin meat and it was toxic.

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.505
- There's around a hundred
million sharks caught every year,

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:39.230
so this is a truly global problem.

01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:41.450
- We're literally sucking like a straw,

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.317
life right out of this planet.

01:09:43.317 --> 01:09:45.550
- And so the idea of Hope Spots,

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.740
the idea of protected areas
is like whoa, you know.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.100
But it's gotta be big,
and it's gotta be real,

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.206
and you gotta have people
with guns out there

01:09:53.206 --> 01:09:55.540
to protect it, because it sure as hell

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.640
isn't gonna be protected
by wishful thinking

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.284
or let's all go off and sing Kum ba yah.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:04.660
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.138
- But if wait another 50 years
or even another 10 years,

01:10:07.138 --> 01:10:10.076
things we can do now will be gone.

01:10:10.076 --> 01:10:15.076
- There is no more tomorrow
that we can avoid confronting.

01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:21.060
- [Newscaster] Bobby Jindal has declared

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.535
a state of emergency because of the spill.

01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:25.570
- [Man] What's at stake
for the environment

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:27.330
is the oil begins to touch land.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:32.093
- And to me, crude oil
ain't nuttin' but the devil.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.320
- Man is destroyin' the planet.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.330
- Just like the Bible
says, in greed and time

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.930
you will destroy your own earth,

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.773
and that's what's happenin'.

01:10:42.773 --> 01:10:46.200
- Scientists in Mississippi
are trying to gauge the impact

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.360
of the spill as it starts to
spread into the prime habitat

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.323
of the biggest fish in the gulf.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.190
- These animals are here
to feed during this time

01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.050
and this oil spill is
right in their backyard.

01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:01.825
- But they're on death row.

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:06.073
If for nothing else good
comes of this major spill,

01:11:06.073 --> 01:11:08.510
it may be to wake up people to say

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:10.670
we have to protect the Gulf.

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:15.670
- [Man] There are real issues
here of money, and power.

01:11:15.732 --> 01:11:19.120
- It's life itself that
the ocean is delivering

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.310
and we have been abusing the ocean.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.860
We haven't been caring for the ocean.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.572
- Why don't we write to
a hundred world leaders?

01:11:26.572 --> 01:11:30.650
- There must be someplace
where these forests

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.910
of unique creatures can be safe.

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.290
- [Man] And Sylvia's timing is
perfect, this is that moment.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.423
- The government is onboard.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.300
- And this bill is not only,

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.060
we've heard it's the first
in the United States,

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.610
this is the first in the world.

01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:47.290
- [Sylvia] We're a hundred miles offshore

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:48.453
in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:53.707
- On corals, you're just
looking at brown gunky stuff.

01:11:53.707 --> 01:11:56.860
- [Sylvia] A great grand
finale for this version

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.680
of the Alvin, we need every bit

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.236
of insight that we can muster.

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:07.736
(dramatic rhythmic music)

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.910
The ocean is alive.

01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:16.863
Without the ocean, life on
earth simply would not exist.

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:21.500
- [Woman] I do not wanna envision a world

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.731
for our grandchildren
and great-grandchildren

01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:25.960
that doesn't have Orcas,

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.310
that doesn't have hammerhead sharks,

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.803
because we're all connected.

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.910
- [Scientist] I'm here
because Sylvia Earle

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.780
is one of the most
remarkable women on earth.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.750
- [Man] She's the real thing.

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.360
She's a person who has committed herself

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.250
and everything that
that commitment implies,

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.600
and we need more of that.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.530
- We have the capacity
to protect the systems

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.713
that keep us alive.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.793
We still have a chance,
but now's the time.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.593
So this is the time, thank you.

01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:07.815
(audience applauding)

01:13:09.204 --> 01:13:10.317
- [Chris] Hi my name is Chris Pensetitch,

01:13:10.317 --> 01:13:13.316
and I work at the Turtle
Island Restoration Network.

01:13:13.316 --> 01:13:14.149
- Great.

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:18.720
- [Chris] So there's a group
of people that live very close

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.129
to the ocean, that care
very deeply about the ocean,

01:13:21.129 --> 01:13:26.129
that drag giant bulldozers
across the Gulf of Mexico,

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.339
sweeping down everything in their path,

01:13:28.339 --> 01:13:30.917
the shrimp trawl fishermen.

01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:35.917
How do we communicate to
them that this livelihood

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.420
that they care so much about is something

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.950
that is while profitable,
causing huge devastation

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.693
to the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem?

01:13:46.693 --> 01:13:50.133
- It's a tough question but,

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.720
one answer that I wish
I could snap my fingers

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.160
and make happen is to take them down

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.948
to see what it's like.

01:13:58.948 --> 01:14:03.948
It's transformative, actually
out there in the Gulf where,

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:10.040
what I was, with the whale
sharks, diving with them,

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.950
it was actually a charter fishing boat.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:17.820
This was just sports fishing,
but the crew consisted

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.441
of individuals who were
commercial fishermen,

01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:25.441
and the one, when he saw
us jumping in the water,

01:14:26.509 --> 01:14:28.240
getting the,

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.810
he wasn't intending to
get in the water with me,

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.490
but he couldn't resist it.

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:36.500
So he jumped in, grabbed
a pair of fins and snorkel

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.789
and he went in the water, and,

01:14:38.789 --> 01:14:43.110
the filmmakers involved
interviewed him afterwards,

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:46.030
I hope this comes through in
the final cut of the film.

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:51.030
Because he just gets this
faraway look in his face

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:53.990
and he talks about how
he thought he could hear

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.797
the heart beating of this big fish,

01:14:56.797 --> 01:15:00.400
and he'd never been in the
water with the fish before,

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.450
never done it.

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:05.110
But we were all doing it and
the big fish were right there.

01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:06.452
He just couldn't stand it.

01:15:06.452 --> 01:15:09.155
If I had a submarine available

01:15:09.155 --> 01:15:13.374
to take people down to just look.

01:15:13.374 --> 01:15:16.475
People who eat the shrimp
are a part of the problem.

01:15:16.475 --> 01:15:20.270
You love popcorn shrimp,
give it up. (laughing)

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:24.310
Shrimp cocktail, it's too
expensive no matter how little

01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:26.389
or how much you pay for it.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:27.980
The real price of it

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.410
is just not there for you to see.

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:31.689
It's written in the,

01:15:31.689 --> 01:15:33.992
Monterey Aquarium had a wonderful exhibit,

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:38.170
not now but recently,
it was a few years ago.

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:41.730
They had this portrayal
of a crystal goblet

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:45.430
with shrimp, like a half dozen shrimp,

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:48.748
big juicy ones all around,
and around it was this halo

01:15:48.748 --> 01:15:52.989
of life that had been
killed in the process

01:15:52.989 --> 01:15:55.180
of getting those six shrimp.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:00.180
I mean the ratio is
conservatively five to one.

01:16:00.299 --> 01:16:02.836
I've been onboard shrimp boats,

01:16:02.836 --> 01:16:07.080
it's more like a hundred
to one, sometimes more.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.607
If you've seen Forrest Gump, (laughing)

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:12.565
here's the trawler, goes
across the ocean floor,

01:16:12.565 --> 01:16:15.880
Brook dumps it out on the deck,

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.960
turtles included.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.430
I didn't see any in Forrest Gump,

01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:20.126
but that's how a lot of turtles die,

01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:22.494
or the nets that are left,

01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:26.460
some of the turtles are
drowned because the trawls

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.588
drag for quite a while on the bottom,

01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:30.260
long enough to drown the turtles.

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:35.260
Anyway, it's just disgraceful
that we know this exists

01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:39.085
and we just go on business as usual.

01:16:39.085 --> 01:16:42.201
Long lines, another great
source of killing turtles.

01:16:42.201 --> 01:16:46.765
Knowing is got to be the answer.

01:16:46.765 --> 01:16:51.250
It's the key, if you
don't know you can't care,

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.300
and most of those who are in the business,

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.300
especially the large-scale,
industrial-scale extraction

01:16:58.312 --> 01:17:02.080
of ocean wildlife, like
menhaden from the Gulf of Mexico

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.980
and the Chesapeake Bay, and
along the Eastern Seaboard.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:10.808
It's the filtration
system for those areas,

01:17:10.808 --> 01:17:15.100
along with sponges, and
oysters, and clams, and such,

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.890
and it's part of the food chain.

01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:18.746
It's part of what makes the ocean work.

01:17:18.746 --> 01:17:21.290
And we can get away with taking a few,

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:23.860
but we can't do it on
the scale that we're now,

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.651
or using the techniques
that we're now imposing.

01:17:26.651 --> 01:17:30.710
So I don't know a straight
answer to your question.

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.410
Short question, he did his job,

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:34.036
long answer, sorry about that.

01:17:34.036 --> 01:17:37.270
But it takes some real thinking

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:38.672
and ideas that you might have.

01:17:38.672 --> 01:17:41.903
It's not the fisherman's fault.

01:17:41.903 --> 01:17:44.353
They thought when they started,

01:17:44.353 --> 01:17:46.610
hey this is what we do.

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:49.230
Nobody thought that there was any problem

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:51.670
with killing all these starfish,

01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:55.767
and other things that are
dragged up from the ocean floor.

01:17:55.767 --> 01:17:57.570
But the fishermen do know,

01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:59.635
you know I did spend some time,

01:17:59.635 --> 01:18:01.960
I spent a lot of time around the Gulf

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.527
and just a few weeks ago I
was up in Martha's Vineyard,

01:18:04.527 --> 01:18:08.078
the center of the universe
for early whaling.

01:18:08.078 --> 01:18:11.130
You know they've seen the transition.

01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:14.592
Whaling, cod, and now
you know, but they're,

01:18:14.592 --> 01:18:17.302
I think small scale local fishing,

01:18:17.302 --> 01:18:22.302
sensitive to having an enduring place

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:25.328
within the system could work, might work,

01:18:25.328 --> 01:18:27.930
but whatever it is has to be coupled

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:29.850
with large-scale protected areas

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.710
where you leave the system alone.

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:32.617
If you want to have birds,

01:18:32.617 --> 01:18:36.820
you can't just slaughter
them on a wholesale basis.

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.280
We did that with passenger pigeons,

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.280
and the Carolina parakeets,
and Eskimo curlews.

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:47.759
We know how to exterminate the
great aux, we've done that.

01:18:47.759 --> 01:18:52.040
What we don't have clearly a vision for,

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.510
is how do we keep these
creatures as a part

01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:57.950
of what keeps us alive.

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:01.229
We need to start at the earliest age

01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:06.229
to get kids locked in to
that as a mission in life.

01:19:06.847 --> 01:19:08.667
The fishermen in the Gulf,

01:19:08.667 --> 01:19:12.820
the kids aren't looking to that as a way

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.479
to make a living, they're not.

01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:18.963
They can't, it's not much of a living now.

01:19:19.975 --> 01:19:22.460
- [Ed] Ed Almanzo with
Laguna Ocean Foundation.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.270
I wonder if you might say something

01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:27.373
about how these Hope Spots are selected.

01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:31.275
- How are the Hope Spots selected?

01:19:31.275 --> 01:19:36.275
Well, it's like open
season for Hope Spots.

01:19:36.384 --> 01:19:41.384
A colleague of mine, a
fellow explorer in residence

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.522
at the National Geographic, Enric Sala,

01:19:43.522 --> 01:19:45.779
who was at Scripps for 10 years,

01:19:45.779 --> 01:19:50.390
and really focused on
pristine areas to protect.

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.900
And I really whole heartedly endorse that,

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.834
find those places that
are still in great shape

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:59.770
and do everything you can to
not let them be destroyed,

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:03.869
like Raja Ampat out in
the Western Pacific,

01:20:03.869 --> 01:20:06.040
like the Northwest Hawaiian Islands

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.254
still in pretty good shape.

01:20:08.254 --> 01:20:13.160
Looking at the deep
reefs almost everywhere,

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.450
in the high seas, there's
still reason for hope

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:20.290
that if we act now we can
maintain the integrity,

01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:23.428
and they'll help restore some of the areas

01:20:23.428 --> 01:20:25.340
that have been diminished.

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:28.190
So using the new techniques
that are out there,

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:32.008
high-diversity is one
measure, water quality.

01:20:32.008 --> 01:20:35.668
Another measure is how realistic is it?

01:20:35.668 --> 01:20:38.070
Is there any possibility

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:40.300
that you can actually make this happen?

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.130
Good news, just last year,

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:43.849
this year, this year, earlier this year,

01:20:43.849 --> 01:20:48.849
the UK has declared the
biggest fully protected area

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:51.830
in the ocean, half a
million square kilometers

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:55.280
around the Chagos Archipelago
in the Indian Ocean.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.846
Beautiful coral reefs, no fishing allowed.

01:20:57.846 --> 01:21:01.333
I have a small sea story

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:03.700
about the Northwest Hawaiian Islands,

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:08.355
about how that was selected,
took about 10 years of people

01:21:08.355 --> 01:21:12.910
building a database, making
a case for why this matters.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:17.147
There's the monk seal,
that's their primary habitat,

01:21:17.147 --> 01:21:18.940
and there are only about a thousand

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.960
of them left in the world.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.900
So either you take action to protect them

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.298
or we gonna see them go
the way of the monk seal

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:28.347
that was in the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean.

01:21:28.347 --> 01:21:32.937
The last one seen in 1952,
they're gone, all gone.

01:21:32.937 --> 01:21:37.937
So Jean-Michel Cousteau did a film

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.510
about the Northwest Hawaiian Islands,

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:42.440
a series of films actually, four films,

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.087
and Laura Bush, a unlikely
person one might think,

01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:49.631
but she does really care about nature

01:21:49.631 --> 01:21:52.701
and she made a trip out to
the Northwest Hawaiian Islands

01:21:52.701 --> 01:21:56.783
to Midway, was just appalled at the mass

01:21:56.783 --> 01:21:59.850
of plastic out there, seeing
those poor albatrosses

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:04.850
just stuffed, the babies
dead, plastic spilled out

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.146
all over the ground.

01:22:07.146 --> 01:22:10.970
So one thing led to another
and she invited Jean-Michel

01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:13.352
to come to the White
House and show his film.

01:22:13.352 --> 01:22:17.780
And a little list of 50
people were selected,

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.944
I got to be one of the
lucky ducks to be invited,

01:22:19.944 --> 01:22:22.722
and nobody really expected

01:22:22.722 --> 01:22:25.170
that she would show up, but she did,

01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:28.431
and more then that, so did George.

01:22:28.431 --> 01:22:31.930
And must have been a
quiet week in Washington

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:33.877
or on the planet as a whole,
because they both came,

01:22:33.877 --> 01:22:38.440
and we watched the film,
had popcorn, drank sodas,

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.578
and then we're invited to dinner
in a room about this large

01:22:41.578 --> 01:22:44.893
with tables for six people, and each of,

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.190
they all set up.

01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:47.990
We went through a line to fill our plates

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:52.024
and I had invited a guest who sat,

01:22:52.024 --> 01:22:53.880
it was a little ahead of me in the line,

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.610
she sat at the table, and
this guy came and asked

01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:57.560
if he could sit next to her

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.853
and it was the President
of the United States.

01:22:59.853 --> 01:23:02.460
And so she said yes he could sit with her,

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:07.460
and then Jean-Michel
came and sat next to him,

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.660
that was his rightful place,

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.629
and then the head of the
Marine Sanctuary Program,

01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:15.350
Lori Arguelles, Foundation,
and her husband.

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:16.910
And there's one seat left

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.891
and I started walking toward my friend,

01:23:19.891 --> 01:23:21.470
and then I saw who she was with,

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:23.441
and then started to back
off 'cause I didn't think,

01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:25.707
you know, I'm just a guest here.

01:23:25.707 --> 01:23:28.691
This is, but my feet kept going anyway

01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:33.691
and I took my place and
we had an hour and a half

01:23:35.085 --> 01:23:40.070
over dinner, without any
watchers or anything.

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.207
We just, we talked fish.

01:23:42.207 --> 01:23:43.520
And I remember hearing myself saying,

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.933
because Bush likes to fish,

01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:48.896
that if there are to be fishermen,

01:23:48.896 --> 01:23:52.173
you've gotta have fish, duh.

01:23:53.096 --> 01:23:55.353
And if you are to have
fish you have to protect

01:23:55.353 --> 01:23:59.080
the places that they live,
breeding areas, feeding areas.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.398
They have to have space.

01:24:00.398 --> 01:24:04.060
We can't take them anywhere
in any numbers at any time,

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.050
and that's what we've been
doing to fish, and that's why.

01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:09.610
He didn't know that 90% of
many of the big fish are gone.

01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:12.124
He didn't know that less
then 1% of the ocean

01:24:12.124 --> 01:24:16.220
was really protected, at that
time it was less then 1%.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:21.003
Because of the 10 years
invested in making a case,

01:24:21.003 --> 01:24:26.003
and people, individuals and
organizations making a case,

01:24:26.071 --> 01:24:30.877
it was kind of an easy nudge,
but it was still unexpected,

01:24:30.877 --> 01:24:35.313
that when he left that night,
he called over to the group,

01:24:35.313 --> 01:24:39.267
to Jim Connaughton, who's
the head of the CEQ,

01:24:39.267 --> 01:24:41.707
"Jim, I want you to make it happen.

01:24:41.707 --> 01:24:44.430
"This should be the biggest area",

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:46.530
they had three sizes,
small, medium, and large,

01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:48.827
he said, "We want the biggest
area and want it to be

01:24:48.827 --> 01:24:50.391
"no take, no fishing.

01:24:50.391 --> 01:24:52.452
"You got that Jim?"

01:24:52.452 --> 01:24:54.440
Everybody was swept away.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.010
We thought it was going
to be another place

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:58.410
like the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary

01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:00.022
that is a managed area.

01:25:00.022 --> 01:25:02.653
Where fishing would be fine, you just,

01:25:02.653 --> 01:25:05.240
you know you declare it a sanctuary,

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.180
but you let things go on
pretty much business as usual,

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.050
with some constraints,
and certainly the idea

01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:13.450
that you would educate
people to care for the place,

01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:16.538
but no he said no take.

01:25:16.538 --> 01:25:19.447
To make it happen, meant Jim Connaughton

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:24.447
went off in a huddle and
resurrected the technique

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.280
that Teddy Roosevelt used to establish

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.280
some of the biggest and best
National Parks in the country,

01:25:32.102 --> 01:25:37.102
and that is the Antiquities
Act that made it possible

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:40.790
to declare a monument,
that isn't a sanctuary,

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:42.110
it's a monument.

01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:45.912
So the President by
Presidential decree could say,

01:25:45.912 --> 01:25:50.912
it's 240,000, no it's 340,000
square miles of ocean.

01:25:54.398 --> 01:25:56.147
I'm sorry for the
Northwest Hawaiian Islands,

01:25:56.147 --> 01:25:59.500
140,000 square miles of ocean,

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.401
at the time the biggest marine
protected area in the world

01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:07.401
by the not so green President,
he's certainly blue.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.170
Because the Northwest Hawaiian Islands

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.210
Marine National Monument is bigger

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:15.900
then all the National Parks put together,

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.520
and the fish are safe there.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.901
It takes some enforcement,

01:26:18.901 --> 01:26:20.647
as Jeremy Jackson said, you know,

01:26:20.647 --> 01:26:22.429
"You gotta go out there with guns."

01:26:22.429 --> 01:26:26.902
And there are some problems,
but the fact is that

01:26:26.902 --> 01:26:31.902
that started this big is somethin',

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.600
and in Kiribati in the Western Pacific,

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.000
they have 200 miles surrounding

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.443
their little speck of islands.

01:26:39.443 --> 01:26:44.443
They've established even a
larger marine protected area

01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:48.270
and then came the UK with
the Chagos Archipelago,

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:50.720
and then Chile, again Enric Sala

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.875
had something to do with this,

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:55.109
a little speck of rock in the
ocean called Salas y Gomez,

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:58.500
that now is fully protected
in the waters around it,

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.370
one of the biggest marine protected areas.

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.780
So the needle is moving.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.375
It was less then 1% and now
it's slightly more then 1%,

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.250
and now there are people who are saying

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:10.720
we need 20% by 2020, woo-hoo.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.216
You know, maybe we can get there.

01:27:12.216 --> 01:27:16.415
I don't know, any, every
inch, every drop counts,

01:27:16.415 --> 01:27:18.923
and that's how you do it, any way you can.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.201
- [William] Please join
me in thanking Dr. Earle

01:27:22.201 --> 01:27:24.889
for a wonderful, informative presentation.

01:27:24.889 --> 01:27:28.056
(audience applauding)

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.416
- [Sylvia] Thank you.

01:27:32.992 --> 01:27:37.242
