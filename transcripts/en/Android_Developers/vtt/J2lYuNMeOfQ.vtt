MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hi, and
welcome to this video, where

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.170
we will show you all the new
exciting stuff we have added

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.960
to Google Play services 4.4.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.750
And as you know by now,
Google Play services rocks.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.680
This also means that when you
use Google Play services--

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.660
ah, morning coffee.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.070
Let's get started
right away, shall we?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.230
Here are the highlights
for version 4.4,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.020
new activity
recognitions have been

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.696
added to the locations API.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:30.210
Yay!

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.259
And for Google Android
Maps API, we've

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.640
got some extension to
indoor maps and-- shh.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.570
That's right, shh.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.440
It's a blockbuster thing, and
we'll save that bang for later.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280
We also got some new stuff
for the Play Games Services

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.170
and Wallets.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.680
And we'll round it off by
presenting In-app's Promo

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.690
Ads for Mobile Apps.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.520
But let's get right
to it, and start off

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.730
with Activity Recognitions
in the locations API.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.180
As you hopefully
already know, it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.260
has previously been
possible to detect

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.340
if the devices on a bicycle,
in a vehicle, if it's still,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.500
if it's being
tilted, or on foot.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.640
Well that's a lot to begin with.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910
Well we decided
to add some more,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.370
and we are now happy to
introduce two more activities,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.270
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Walking and running.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.570
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Thank you.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.220
That's right.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.110
We added walking and running
to the activity detectors.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.400
But we thought now, why don't
we go a little bananas here

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.045
and try those things out.

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:25.677
So what am I doing now?

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: You are walking.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.260
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.850
That's very, very good.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.200
So what am I doing now?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.091
FEMALE SPEAKER: You are running.

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.340
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.880
That's very, very good.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.088
FEMALE SPEAKER: Keep running.

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:41.541
It is good for you.

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.220
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So
what am I doing now?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
are riding a bike.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.140
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.088
That's very, very good.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.386
Don't stop running.

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.760
You are very close
to Googleplex.

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.740
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Whew, let me tell you.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.660
That was both
exhausting and fun,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.580
and that was just a demo app.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.780
Imagine what your
apps can do with that.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.340
Now let's look at the Google
Maps Android API, starting off

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.940
with indoor maps
where you can select

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.780
a floor programmatically,
detect if a new building comes

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.020
into focus, and, of course,
also get the active building

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.950
and floor.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.710
This is, for example,
the second floor

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.020
of D Gates at San
Francisco Airport.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.040
All right, moving on to--
and ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.480
that's right, we've got a
big announcement to make.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.310
Let's welcome Street Views to
the Google Maps Android API

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.620
with a round of applause.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.940
MALE SPEAKER: Get back to work.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.990
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes, sir.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.520
You can now embed street view
imagery into an activity,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.980
enabling your users to explore
the world through panoramic 360

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.245
degrees views,
programmatically control

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:57.370
the zoom and orientation
of the street view camera,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.470
and animate the
camera movements.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.760
Wow, that's a major extension.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
Imagine all that cool stuff and
what it can do to your apps.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.020
Over to Play Game Services.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.100
In the 4.3 release, we
introduced Game Gifts,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.400
which allows you to
request gifts or wishes.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.280
Now we have extended the
request with a new API

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.840
so you can select multiple
game gift recipients.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.910
For games, this means
that more collaboration

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.050
and social engagement can
happen between your players.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.230
Which brings us
to the Wallet API,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.770
where we added Wallet Fragments
to the Instant Buy API.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.340
Wallet Fragments makes
it extremely easy

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.930
to integrate the Buy with
Google button in your app.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.370
Just configure these
fragments and add them.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.700
And just for fun, let's
see how shopping can now

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.290
be done in 10 seconds.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.670
The user logs on to an app using
Google Plus Sign-In, selects

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.440
a Google Adjustable
Bike to buy, using

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.510
Buying with Google to
complete the purchase

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.530
and get it shipped
to your home address.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.440
Voila.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000
A bike in 10 seconds.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.500
And wrapping it up with the
mobile ads, where we have

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.710
added in-app promo ads.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.230
This is an API
available for publishers

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.830
to display in-app
promo ads, and it

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.480
enables users to
purchase directly,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.899
advertise goods in the app.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.630
With these extensions, users can
conveniently purchase products

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.830
that interest them,
and advertisers

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.000
can reach consumers, and
your app connects the dots.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
A Win-win-win, in other words.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.110
That's it for this
time, but stay

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800
tuned because we've got
lots more coming up.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.710
Now it's your turn to go out
there and create great apps.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.620
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.170
Oh!

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: You need
to be more careful when

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.020
you are climbing.
