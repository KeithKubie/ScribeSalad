the whole layout but what I'm going to

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220
the whole layout but what I'm going to
 

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.320
the whole layout but what I'm going to
say wondering is if there's a way to

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:09.330
say wondering is if there's a way to
 

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.990
say wondering is if there's a way to
kind of not have to redesign the layout

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000
kind of not have to redesign the layout
 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.370
kind of not have to redesign the layout
because it's not actually mine it's

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380

yeah I'm not pay pretty much a week so
is it in just a linear layout I mean it

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:20.730
is it in just a linear layout I mean it
 

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.670
is it in just a linear layout I mean it
it's the go button anchored to the

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:22.680
it's the go button anchored to the
 

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.460
it's the go button anchored to the
fondant yeah it's a relative layout with

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:25.470
fondant yeah it's a relative layout with
 

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.080
fondant yeah it's a relative layout with
the but the go button anchor to the

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.090
the but the go button anchor to the
 

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.450
the but the go button anchor to the
bottom of the screen and then the this

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460
bottom of the screen and then the this
 

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.830
bottom of the screen and then the this
is a simplification in the real layout

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840
is a simplification in the real layout
 

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.300
is a simplification in the real layout
but basically the buttons anchor to the

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:32.310
but basically the buttons anchor to the
 

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.700
but basically the buttons anchor to the
bottom these sample boxes in the middle

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:34.710
bottom these sample boxes in the middle
 

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.260
bottom these sample boxes in the middle
and then there's a graphic at the top

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.270
and then there's a graphic at the top
 

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.150
and then there's a graphic at the top
that can get pushed out the screen if we

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:38.160
that can get pushed out the screen if we
 

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:47.210
that can get pushed out the screen if we
need to sure take the button off the

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220
need to sure take the button off the
 

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.380
need to sure take the button off the
bottom of the screen and put it up in

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.390
bottom of the screen and put it up in
 

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:54.230
bottom of the screen and put it up in
the action bar ok so I'm hearing there's

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240
the action bar ok so I'm hearing there's
 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.150
the action bar ok so I'm hearing there's
no there's no real way to do this

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:58.160
 

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.680
because I'm guessing there's no way I

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:00.690
because I'm guessing there's no way I
 

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.600
because I'm guessing there's no way I
just haven't thought about it ok because

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:02.610
just haven't thought about it ok because
 

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.190
just haven't thought about it ok because
I know the other ways I can completely

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200
I know the other ways I can completely
 

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.990
I know the other ways I can completely
redesign the layout and use a scrollview

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000
redesign the layout and use a scrollview
 

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.600
redesign the layout and use a scrollview
and then have it just resize the scroll

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:08.610
and then have it just resize the scroll
 

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.580
and then have it just resize the scroll
of you and that will work but then it's

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.590
of you and that will work but then it's
 

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.590

yeah i mean i think that the right way

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:26.980
yeah i mean i think that the right way
 

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.630
yeah i mean i think that the right way
is to is to return the pixel array in

is to is to return the pixel array in
 

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.570
is to is to return the pixel array in

what the orientation ought to be but

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120
what the orientation ought to be but
 

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.330
what the orientation ought to be but
that's I mean that's my opinion that

of what the problem is its when the

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.490
of what the problem is its when the
 

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.180
of what the problem is its when the
keyboard pops up it's distorting the

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:57.190
keyboard pops up it's distorting the
 

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.010
keyboard pops up it's distorting the
background and that's on my relative

00:47:59.010 --> 00:47:59.020
background and that's on my relative
 

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.830
background and that's on my relative
layout yeah I don't want if you and if

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:01.840
layout yeah I don't want if you and if
 

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.820
layout yeah I don't want if you and if
you look at the image it's really

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:02.830
you look at the image it's really
 

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.920
you look at the image it's really
obvious what the problem is and I'm I'd

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:04.930
obvious what the problem is and I'm I'd
 

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.540
obvious what the problem is and I'm I'd
rather it could it cropped the

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:06.550
rather it could it cropped the
 

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.160
rather it could it cropped the
background rather than it resized it

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.170
background rather than it resized it
 

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.070
background rather than it resized it
like that so using a just resize rather

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:11.080
like that so using a just resize rather
 

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.570
like that so using a just resize rather
than just time there by this and this

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:12.580
than just time there by this and this
 

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.190
than just time there by this and this
one isn't just resized yeah because the

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200
one isn't just resized yeah because the
 

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.810
one isn't just resized yeah because the

you're talking about kind of this the

00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319
you're talking about kind of this the
 

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:41.490
you're talking about kind of this the
red with the stitching at the top where

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:41.500
red with the stitching at the top where
 

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.690

what gradient were you talking about

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:42.700
what gradient were you talking about
 

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.220
what gradient were you talking about
yeah yeah because it looks like it's

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:44.230
yeah yeah because it looks like it's
 

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:45.750
yeah yeah because it looks like it's
sort of darker on the left a bottle on

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760
sort of darker on the left a bottle on
 

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.599
sort of darker on the left a bottle on
the way oh yes actually you know you're

00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:48.609
the way oh yes actually you know you're
 

00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:51.240
the way oh yes actually you know you're
right it is well you did over later all

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:51.250
right it is well you did over later all
 

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:55.109
right it is well you did over later all
right so if you have a layer which is a

00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119
right so if you have a layer which is a
 

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:57.839
right so if you have a layer which is a
gradient and a layer behind it which is

00:51:57.839 --> 00:51:57.849
gradient and a layer behind it which is
 

00:51:57.849 --> 00:51:59.759
gradient and a layer behind it which is
the bit map tiles you could probably do

00:51:59.759 --> 00:51:59.769
the bit map tiles you could probably do
 

00:51:59.769 --> 00:52:03.779
the bit map tiles you could probably do
it that way yeah that would work we are

00:52:03.779 --> 00:52:03.789
it that way yeah that would work we are
 

00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:05.700
it that way yeah that would work we are
then the gradient is just a 1 pixel

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:05.710
then the gradient is just a 1 pixel
 

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.130
then the gradient is just a 1 pixel
strip which goes across the top yeah

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:08.140
strip which goes across the top yeah
 

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.319
strip which goes across the top yeah
flan pixel deep and then the Wickery

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:10.329
flan pixel deep and then the Wickery
 

00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:14.880

be careful with how many transparent

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:16.569
be careful with how many transparent
 

00:52:16.569 --> 00:52:19.499
be careful with how many transparent
layers that you have I understand that

00:52:19.499 --> 00:52:19.509
layers that you have I understand that
 

00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:21.180
layers that you have I understand that
some devices are quite limited with how

many simultaneous stacks transparent

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640

layers they can deal with in the

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200
layers they can deal with in the
 

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.730
layers they can deal with in the
hardware so you need to want to have

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:29.740
hardware so you need to want to have
 

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.259
hardware so you need to want to have
more than like two or three transparent

00:52:31.259 --> 00:52:31.269
more than like two or three transparent
 

00:52:31.269 --> 00:52:36.269

can maybe use an xml layer list with the

00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:47.769
can maybe use an xml layer list with the
 

00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:49.259
can maybe use an xml layer list with the

couple of XML files then you end up with

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640
couple of XML files then you end up with
 

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.730
couple of XML files then you end up with

so there's lots of framework around the

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:45.020
so there's lots of framework around the
 

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.380
so there's lots of framework around the
service class which you can make use of

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:47.390
service class which you can make use of
 

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.510
