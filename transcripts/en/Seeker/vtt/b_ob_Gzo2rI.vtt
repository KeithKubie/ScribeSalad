00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.140
It’s 2016, and we’ve seen phonographs,
vinyl, cassette tapes, compact discs, mp3s,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.270
and now… vinyl.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.450
Wait, that can’t be right.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.700
Hey fellow hipsters, Jules here for Dnews.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.320
Vinyl has existed for almost a century, and
over that time, what we think of as “vinyl”

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.990
has changed quite a bit.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.270
Some picture gramophone records, but really
vinyl is everywhere!

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.750
It’s in your flooring, your t-shirts, your
phone, and depending on your medical history,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.230
it could even be inside your body.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.370
Vinyl can be black, colorful or transparent,
it can be solid or semi-liquid.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.000
It can even be a VERY short lived HBO drama
starring Olivia Wilde.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
RIP.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.610
The versatility of vinyl cannot be denied
- but what the hell is it?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.710
Well, vinyl is a plastic made from two basic
compounds: chlorine, which is also found in

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.890
salt, and ethylene which is found natural
gas.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.670
These are combined in a chemical reaction
to create ethylene dichloride, which is turned

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.250
into a gas, and then, through a process called
“polymerization”, it becomes a fine, white

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.620
powder called polyvinyl chloride, or PVC.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.409
Side note: In the United States, we often
use the terms PVC and Vinyl interchangeably,

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.130
but in other places, Vinyl refers to specific
applications of the plastic, like flooring

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.450
or artificial leather.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.620
Either way, PVC resin is the foundation for
all vinyl.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.780
And perhaps surprisingly it was discovered
by accident... twice.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.271
Two different chemists in the 19th century
left vinyl chlorine gas out in the sun, to

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:35.869
discover that over time it transforms into
a white solid.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.810
After numerous failed attempts to make use
of PVC, an American successfully plasticized

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.070
it in the 1920’s and began experimenting
with it as a cheaper and more durable alternative

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.180
to rubber and to other plastics.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.210
Initially, the material only made appearances
in random household items like shower curtains,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.170
insulated wire and and rain coats.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.310
Then in the 1930’s PVC manufacturing plants
sprung up, and vinyl made its way into industrial

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.130
applications, like gaskets and tubing.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.029
Today, vinyl is manufactured and sold more
than any other plastic in the world, short

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.179
of polyethylene..

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.439
And, of course, it’s used for records.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.219
But it wasn’t at first.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.359
Originally, records were made from shellac,
another plastic that is today found in fake

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.059
nails and wood finish.

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:25.129
However each side of these shellac discs could
only play about 3 or 4 minutes of music, and

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.749
record companies realized that if they wanted
a longer playing record, they would need a

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.819
tougher material, one that could handle smaller
grooves.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.190
By the 1950’s pretty much all record companies
had switched to vinyl.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.930
So vinyl is, obviously, prolific.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.040
Its durable, recyclable, cheap to manufacture
and can be made into just about anything.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.750
But is it environmentally friendly?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.159
Vinyl manufacturers and trade organizations
say yes, because PVC is mostly made from a

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.529
compound based on salt, a natural material,
and it supposedly uses less energy to manufacture

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.239
than other plastics.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.049
However, environmentalists and the EPA say
that PVC production releases dioxins and pollutants,

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.519
and you could be exposed to them by inhaling
polluted air near manufacturing facilities.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.510
You can also unknowingly intake harmful chemicals
through eating food in pvc-lined packaging

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.299
and drinking water transported in pvc pipes.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.589
This could lead to anything from “dizziness,
drowsiness and headaches” to liver damage

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.049
and even cancer.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.499
Greenpeace calls vinyl “the most damaging
plastic on the planet” and has also spoken

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.739
out about the dangerous toxins it emits when
it’s burned.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.810
Whether vinyl is good or bad, it’s kind
of impossible to avoid.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.599
If it’s not in your clothes or your computer,
is in the walls of your home or lining the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.739
tubes that transport your water.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.379
So maybe just chill.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.029
Put on a record or something…

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.099
And while you’re chilling, think of all
the time you’ve wasted not working on your

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.629
beach bod.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.549

So vinyl is potentially harmful. Are there less harmful plastics?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.600
What about those biodegradable ones? Are those actually good for the environment?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
