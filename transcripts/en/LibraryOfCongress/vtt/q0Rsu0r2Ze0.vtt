00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.400
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.850
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: And so now,
I'd to introduce James Gleick.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.040
We've both been in the science
writing game for quite a while.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.040
And I don't think we met
before today although,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.310
we may have passed each other
on 246 Street as I was walking

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.390
to Horace Mann and he
was walking to Riverdale

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.670
which are two neighboring
fierce competitor.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.940
We hate everybody at
Riverdale kinds of place,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.020
you know, high schools, anyway.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.840
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: All right,
that's your-- is that a surprise?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.140
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: That's the surprise.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.440
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: OK.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.740
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Jim was
born in the US--

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: And we
haven't change a bit?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.580
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Ah, good.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.110
Oh, we should make for that.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.920
Jim was born in 19-- arrived in
New York at 1954 when he was born.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.990
I arrived there a year earlier.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.950
He graduated from Harvard
College in 1976.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.100
He founded the-- He
founded Metropolis,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.490
an alternative weekly
newspaper in Minneapolis, right?

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.790
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.190
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Then he worked for
the New York Times as an editor

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.430
and reporter for 10 years and
he became a fantastic author.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.310
His first book, "Chaos"
was a National Book Award

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.440
and Pulitzer Prize finalist
and a huge best seller.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.610
He was also the author
of "The Information:

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.300
A History, A Theory, A Flood."

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.750
And his other books include the
best selling biographies, "Genius:

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950
The Life and Science of Richard
Feynman" and "Isaac Newton."

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.090
And believe me, it's hard to top
Richard Feynman in his own writing,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.940
so it's quite a note to be
doing that, as well as "Faster,"

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.240
and "What Just Happened."

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390
They've been translated
into 30 languages.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.870 position:56%
And for some years, he has written--

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.520
he wrote the Fast-Forward
column in the New York Times.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.460
And today, we'll be talking about
his new book, "Time Travel."

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.730
And he'll be available downstairs.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.640
I guess you guys know where
that is now but it's way

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.600
down after the sign-- after the
session to sign book if you want.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.960
And I thought where like,
where I'd start is, you know,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.530
I kind of wondered, you've been
writing about, thinking about,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.450
talking about I presumed time

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.360
for quite a long, long
time in your life.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.640
And I was wondering, you know,
when that started and then I came

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.480
across the answer on a footnote
on the bottom of page 244--

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.780
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Oh no.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.080
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: -- of the book.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.650
I think this was just a test
to see if I really read it.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.980
But, you're talking again is
what is time is the question

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.020
and the book grapples with that
in many ways which we'll back--

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.070
we'll go back and describe.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.190
But one of the answers,
Samuel Johnson said

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.080
"the measure of duration."

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.010
And then Jim writes, "And duration?

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.490
Continuance, length of time.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.770
A 1960 children's book,
trimmed the definition

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.990
to a single word: Time Is When."

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.170
Oh, that's interesting but
there's a little asterisk there.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.670
And I look and the
asterisk says, "Beth Gleick,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.580
Time Is When (Chicago:
Rand McNally, 1960).

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.330
The present author's mother."

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.640
[ Laughter ]

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.920
So I figured you came by this
interest honestly as they say.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.890
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Well, I should
recommend "Time Is When" now.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.330
I should fix that.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.340
1960, so I was 6 year old.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.640
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yes.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: And, yes, my mother
wrote a children's book called

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.190
"Time Is When."

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.080
It was meant to explain to children
what time is and as I remember,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.610
there is-- there are days, there
are hours, there are minutes,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.730
what if you're a kid, what
can you do in a minute and--

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.360
but I didn't really make a
direct connection in my mind

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.620
between that book, and
the "Time Travel" book.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.270
It's just-- It did come to me and
I did put that in the footnote.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.570
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: OK.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.220
I was only trying to make the
point that this has been an--

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.880
a theme we could trace
back to your early days.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.240
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: I've written
about time in time, you know--

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.260 position:56%
well, you can't write about
anything without writing about time.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
You can-- certainly can write about
science without writing about time

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.930
so there are bits about time
in probably all my books.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.150
But "Time Travel" sort of
came out of the blue for me.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.710
I mean, it's not like
I was working up to it.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.000
It's not like I ever-- I thought
I would get around to that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.390
It was more of a sudden-- there
was a sudden thing that I realized

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.480
that made me think,
there was a book here.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.780
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: And?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.970
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: And so, I
should say what that is, it was--

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.650
it's sort of the starting
point of the book.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.900 position:56%
It was the discovery-- the discovery
that the idea of time travel

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.300
in our culture didn't start
until H.G. Wells wrote

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.950
"The Time Machine" in 1895.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.050
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: I read that
and I'm stunned but--

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: I'm-- And I'm glad
you're stunned because I was stunned

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.810
and I think-- and a lot of people,
I think maybe there are people

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.940
in the audience right now who are
saying, "No that can't be true."

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.240
I mean, there are.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.330
I hope you're saying, "That
can't possibly be true,"

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.450
because it feels weird.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.400
I mean, it feels-- it feels

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.960
as though time travel
is such a natural idea.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.440
It's such an obvious
fantasy to have.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.660
Doesn't everybody think at one
time or another in our lives,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.250
what if I could get into a machine
or walk through a magic door,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.520
or just wake up and see what the
future would be like, or go back

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.150
and meet somebody famous
in the past?

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.860
Or, you know, we've seen all of
the fantasies working themselves

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.100
out in popular culture,
you know, meet your parents

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.780
when they were teenagers.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.800
People really didn't
have this fantasy

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.020
and so I thought maybe it
would be worth exploring why

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.430
that hadn't happen before and what
kind of change was taking place

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.980
in the way people were
thinking about time

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.640
to make this a natural
kind of entertainment?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.940
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.550
And now, I'm wondering
was "Connecticut Yankee

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.260
in King Arthur's Court"
prior to that

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.770
but that was like it
was an accident?

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.070
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: It was prior.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.370
And yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.780
It was about four or
five years before.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.340
You-- Do you all remember
"Connecticut Yankee

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.400
in King Arthur's Court," our
hero who I think is the narrator

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.130
of the book-- is he the narrator?

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.430
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: I guess I remember.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.730
He--

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.140
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: His method of time
travel, that was not a machine,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.700
it's-- he gets conked on the head
and then he wakes up and he's

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:54.700
in a field and he discovers--
and I love this bit of dialogue,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.840
it's Mark Twain bit of
dialogue, there's a, you know,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.090
knight on a horse, and our
guide, he's an engineer wakes up

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.790
and he says, he points to
the town, down, you know,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.370
off in the distance and
he says, "Hartford?"

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.010
And the answer is, "Camelot."

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.620
[ Laughter ]

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.980
And it's-- But that fits into my
theory which I haven't expressed

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.700
but part of my theory has to do
with developments and technology,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.610
and Mark Twain was
fascinated by technology.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.800
He was the first guy, he
knew-- on a typewriter.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:40.170
And his story is very
much about the-- about--

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.880
it's very much about
making readers think

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.260
about how different the technology
of the late 19th Century is

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.590
from the technology
of Arthurian England.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.210
Because his hero goes back and he's
got all of these magic, you know,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.370
he's got-- I forgot, you
know, does he have a--

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.670
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: A flint, I think.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.970
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: -- a flint.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.350
He has gun powder.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.830
He becomes basically
king in the world.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.130
I mean, well, people--

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.770
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: He was able to
predict the solar eclipse.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.070
That was a big one.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.370
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Exactly.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.260
So, yeah, it's part of the same--
even though he predates H.G. Wells

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.120
and it is a kind of time travel,
it's time travel by being bonked

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.290
on the head and maybe he wakes
up at the end of the book,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.670
and the whole things was a dream.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.160
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Right.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.700
So, you said there is a theory.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.120
Is the theory that
this notion was tied

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.370
to the technological developments

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.990
or maybe you could articulate
that a little bit more?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.990
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah, theory might
be a little bit of an overstatement

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.990
but I know it's my overstatement.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:49.000
But it-- I try to explore what it's
about and I think one of the things

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.190
that it's clearly about is
how suddenly technology was

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.230
changing rapidly.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.690
And for most of human history,
technology developed very slowly.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.090
And when technology was
developing slowly, you didn't--

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.780
it didn't occur to you to think,
"What's the world going to be

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.740
like for my grandchildren,"
because the world was going

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.400
to be same for your grandchildren.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.920
But now, England had been
through the industrial revolution

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.030
and there were all these marvelous
things around and railroad skimming

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.220
across the landscape and telegraph
was dramatically changing the way

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.520
people lived.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.480
And you could see, there was
an awareness that people had

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.850
that machines could
change the way you lived,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:43.610
could really alter social
intercourse, communication,

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.860
financial life, you name it.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.100
And-- So, as the 19th
Century was ending

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.190
and there was this great
calendar date coming,

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.610
the turn of the century, lots of
people were suddenly fantasizing

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.660
about what the future would
bring, and so there was H.G. Wells

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.150
and a young man, you know, young
writer struggling to make a living,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.140 position:56%
and it was a natural fantasy for
him even though he turned out not be

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.480
in the time machine
especially optimistic.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.940
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.190
So that's the kicking off
point, but the book goes

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.570
on to explore the consequences
of that quite a bit.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.330
I mean, that's-- this sort of
the maybe you're making the point

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.180
that now that it's
part of our landscape,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.310
we don't think about its origins.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.560
But now that it's part of our
landscape, we think about it a lot

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.140
and it shows up in
popular culture a lot.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.440
And it's certainly was showing up,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.300 position:56%
we were just talking before the
event started about science fiction,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.720
and that's the staple of--

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.350
I mean, maybe there was no
science fiction before H.G. Wells,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.020
I'm not sure, Jules
Verne, I can't remember.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: It was Jules Verne.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.880
There were stuff-- There was
the beginning of fantasizing

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.860
about space travel and Jules Verne
also had submarines, of course.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.910
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: But, I mean,
you seemed fascinated

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.930
with the inherent contradictions
and possibilities,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:14.810
and possibilities that came up.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.970
Why-- What's the interest
in speculating on that?

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.330
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah,
I mean, that's--

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.630 position:56%
you're right, that's the real reason

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.980
for writing the book is it's not
why didn't they have it before

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.150
but what are we doing with it now.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:34.330
And I do have a sense that-- Well,
first of all, you and I both,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.410
we both read some science
fiction when we were kids.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.600
And I remember thinking, most

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.560
of the science fictions I read had
nothing to do with time travel.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.080
There was a lot of space travel.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.270
When I was a teenage boy,
there were a lot of stories

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.100
about teenage boys
running often, you know,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.670
getting into spaceships
and having adventures.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.270
But occasionally, there
would be some kind

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.850
of time travel science fictions
and those were always the weirdest,

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:08.400
the most mind-twisting,
logical puzzles.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.870
They really made-- They made
you thinking away they were the

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.420
most fun.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.520
And so part of the
idea of my book is

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.240
to explore the way
this seems developed,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.790
not just in science fiction
but also in literature

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.260
and the rest of the culture.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.910
Now, I'm digressing a little
but, soon after H.G. Wells,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:42.840
almost contemporaneously, Marcel
Proust was performing a kind

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.340 position:56%
of time travel in "In Search of Lost
Time," and thinking about memory

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.310
and talking about time
in a way that's very--

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.040
that sounds very much like the way
science fiction writers now talk

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.340
about time.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.330 position:56%
And James Joyce played with time
and Virginia Woolf played with time.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.170
And people started to play
with time as they do today,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:11.790
as we all do in our fantasies and
in our interactions with the world

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.340
in various smart and
sophisticated ways.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:20.770
And all of the stuff, I don't mean
to claim that either H.G. Wells

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:26.670
or science fiction writers
in general are leading us

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.510
but they're certainly if not
leading us, they're doing something

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.620
in parallel with the
rest of the culture,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.540
and the whole culture has been for
this whole past century thinking

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.290
about time in more and more
complicated and interesting ways.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.590
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.890
And I was just thinking
as you were saying it.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.780
One, it's probably doesn't
parse this clearly but I wonder

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.100
if science fiction writers, when
they write about time travel tend

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.490
to write about what's going forward
and literary people tend to write

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.610
about what's going backward?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.480
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Well,
that's interesting.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.500 position:56%
I mean, maybe we should-- let's have
a-- can we have a show of hands?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.040
Here's a question.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.000
You've got a time machine, you
got one trip, you are guaranteed

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.250
that you get to return safely,
and you can go into the past

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.750
or the future, how many people
are going to the future?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.040
And how many people
are going to the past?

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.340
OK.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.640
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.940
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: That
looked about 50/50.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.240
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.540
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Now,
I've heard it theorized,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.970
I don't endorse this theory that--

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.490
and I don't have a new
judgment based on these hands.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.240
Some people have suggested that
men like to go to the future,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.050
and women like to go to the past.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.050
I don't know.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.420
And you're suggesting maybe
that the literary folk are

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.000
more past-oriented?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.300
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Well, I mean,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.980
I don't know if you can make
it generalizable that way

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:00.260
but the minute you start writing
about a future as a serious author,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.700
you're called a science
fiction writer.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.160
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: That's,
that's right.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.460
That's true.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.760
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: And so,
even though some

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.820
of these science fiction
pieces are very literary

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.110
in the way they are written,
but I think also the conundrums

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.900
that you talked about in the book,
and I hope you'll describe a couple

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.010
of them, that occurred when you go

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.180
into the past are somehow
more delicious--

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.480
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Right.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.070
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: -- because you
wind up-- I mean, that's when--

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.570
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: That's
where you get into trouble.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.170
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: That's where you get
into trouble which is, you know,

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.860
if you can go back and then
prevent Hitler, that's the classic

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.060
from being born, could
you prevent the Holocaust?

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.600
And the question is, is there--

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.250
is it possible to change
time or are we stuck with it?

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.890
And if we are stuck with it,
how can-- well, you explain?

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.420
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Well, first,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:58.270
you made a really interesting point
I think that for whatever reason,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.650
we tend to label fiction writers
who write about the future

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.790
as science fiction writers and
genre writers, whereas if you write

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:12.340
about the past, that's more likely
to be accepted as literary fiction.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.060
And this is argument about John
Rivers as literary fiction,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.230
I have a feeling it
might be being played

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.030 position:56%
out in other rooms at this festival.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.340
Well, it goes on.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.260
And personally, my own feeling
is some of the greatest,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.410
most magnificent writers of our
time are writing about the future

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.720
and it's better not to draw
bright lines but I don't believe

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.900
in these categories myself.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.700
It is-- You're right, going into
the past is where the paradoxes--

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.810
the logical paradoxes
begin, where the fun begins

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.000
because you can meet yourself.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.730
And what if you meet yourself?

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.680
I mean, already, that's sort of
a paradox, what's going on there?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.560
Are you-- Which one of them is you?

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.860
I mean, there is this great--

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:02.420
I discussed it in the book a little
bit, an early science fiction story

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.930
by Robert Heinlein, "By Your
Bootstraps" where that's the joke,

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.390
the hero keeps meeting himself
and it's only a couple of days.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.920
And at first, he's a little slow to
catch on that this new guy coming

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.050 position:56%
through the hole, in the air, in the
room is himself and then they get

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.400
into fights, and that then, there
are three of them and so on.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.770
And it's a farce, you know?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.280
And then-- But there's always
an arms race, you know,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.610
in fiction because once that's
done then the next person has

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.940
to top that.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.250
And pretty early on, you have
people wondering about what

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:47.110
if you kill an ancestor
and the canonical ancestor

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.190
for whatever reason
is the grandfather,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.260
so it's called the
grandfather paradox.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.450
And then you have people
actually having sex with people

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.810
and giving birth to themselves.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.000
And then, there are-- very early,
there are transgender versions

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.880
of this so the people are
their own fathers and mothers.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:17.190
This is, you know, long before
transgender studies became a

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.270
worthwhile subject, the science
fiction writers were there first.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.770
And as far as I can tell,
completely judgment free.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.070
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.150
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: But weird things
happen and so weird that in all

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.410
of the time travel stories
and movies that you think of,

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.000
once they get into these paradoxes,
you sort of think there has

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.850
to be a trick, there's no-- if
you think about it too hard,

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.600
it can't really be working

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.510
because time travel isn't
really possible, is it?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.180
[ Laughter ]

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.300
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Maybe we could
anyone show hands on that.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: If you're-- Yes, if
you are visiting from the future--

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.470
[ Laughter ]

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.770
-- reveal yourself now?

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.780
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: I guess we're
all visiting from the past

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.080
if you want to think about--

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.690
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: We're all
visiting from the past.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:12.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: I was hoping actually
and I guess you've already indicated

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:19.060 position:56%
that there's no resolution here, but
after watching a movie like X-Men:

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.250
Days of Future Past or
whatever it's called or the--

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.870
even the Back for the Future
movies, my kids would get

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.140
into these heroic arguments
about, "That's not possible,"

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.770
"Yes, it is," "No, it's not."

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.790
I mean, is there a
logical right and wrong

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.550
to this conundrums going backwards?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.050
Or you just-- you can
pick any outcome you

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.670
like because it's impossible?

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.010
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: I'm kind
of now I'm vacillating.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.870
I couldn't answer that
question definitively.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.170
I give you my opinion.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.890
My opinion is time travel
is not really possible one.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.460
I know that is a terrible
thing for me to be saying.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.320 position:56%
Probably, half of the people who are

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.210
about to buy my book
are now not going to.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.410
[ Laughter ]

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.710
But it's also--

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: I hope you sharpen
your arguments if you buy the book--

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.050
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: It's--

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.350
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: -- because, you know,

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.650
you have to know what the
other side is thinking.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.850
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: It's also
true that, it's also true

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:20.120
that when you talk to physicists,
it's quite possible to get

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.540
into a serious discussion
with physicists today

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.850
about the grandfather paradox.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:31.690 position:56%
And if not literally the possibility
of going back with a handgun

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:39.410
and popping the guy, the physics
equivalents of that, are there ways

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.410
in which there could be
loops in time, causal loops.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.720
And if physicists aren't
quite willing to roll

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.990 position:56%
that out then you have to ask
yourselves, who am I to roll it out,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.480
you know, they're the experts.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.830
And it's also-- A part of
that story, I feel strongly,

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:02.990
is that physicists and philosophers
are growing up and living

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.890
in the same culture
as the rest of us,

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.090
and they're reading
the same stories.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.160
And if they are pondering
these paradoxes

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.370
and these logical difficulties from
the point of view of a specialized

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:23.070
and well-equipped kind of
science, all the better.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.560 position:56%
So, there isn't as-- I'm not
willing to give a definitive answer,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.100
I'm willing to say,
any kid who is arguing

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.490
about it is thinking
along productive lines.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.790
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.600
Yeah. What is-- The other thing
that you bring up fairly early on

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.670
and I think it's very
thought-provoking is they talked

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:50.340
about the time as being the fourth
dimension where there is space

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.100
and then there is time, and then
you get into the whole question

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.990
of where there are spaces
and emergent property

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.490
of time which you bring up.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.720
But the idea that we can't perceive
the fourth dimension because we're

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.550
in a three-dimensional
world is a little bit

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.490
like the book "Flatland," where--

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.790
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.090
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: -- the people
in the plain couldn't--

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:13.010
on a plain surface couldn't imagine
if there was anything sticking up.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:20.190
You talked about the possibility
of being able to create a world

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.060
as it were that could
see all those--

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.030
all four dimensions
at the same time.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.430
Talk a little bit about that?

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.220
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: We're kind of
going back to the beginning again.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.730
We're going back to H.G.
Wells, because in 1895,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:44.340
H.G. Wells starts his
story in this way.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.480
His, not as narrator, but his
hero who doesn't even have a name

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.250
in the book is called, the
Time Traveller, gathers his--

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.970
it's such an old fashion
way of writing.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.090
He's in his house in London and
he gathers his friends around

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.030
and he says, "I've had a little
adventure and I'm going to tell you

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.900
about it but first, I have to
explain a few things to you,"

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.880
and he gives them a
lecture on science.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.720 position:56%
And the lecture begins by-- with
this notion of the fourth dimension.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.230
He says, "I'm going to tell
you-- let's talk about geometry.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.870
Everything they taught you about
geometry in school is wrong.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.890
They taught you that there
are only three dimensions,

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.460
length, breadth, and height."

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.780
And his friends say,
"Well, yes, of course,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.080
there are only three dimensions."

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.380
And he says, "No.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.440
Think about it, isn't
duration also a dimension?"

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.220
And they go on like that.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:47.010
And it's 1895, it's 10
years later that Einstein

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:53.730
and his teacher Minkowski put
forward the notion of space time

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:59.040
as a four-dimensional
continuum and explained to us

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.170
that it's extremely productive for
physicists to think of the universe

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.120
in terms of four dimensions
in which time is just

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.370
like the other three dimensions.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.760
Mathematically, it's treated
the same way and that means

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.020
that mathematically speaking,
there's no difference

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.610
in the equations between
the past and the future.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.210
And this is, you know,
pretty mind-boggling in 1905

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.550
and for the generation that
followed and to this day.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.370
But what's going on?

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.790
Is H.G. Wells somehow
intuiting the new science

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.230
of relativity before Einstein?

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.890
I am not suggesting that
because H.G. Wells, as I said,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.510
a young man really didn't--
he didn't know anything,

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.060 position:56%
he didn't even study physics really.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.960
He did have some background
in science

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.010
but it was mostly about geology.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.670
Is it just a coincidence?

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.090
It can't be a coincidence.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.780
I don't believe in that.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.800
So, there was something in the air.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.760
And one of the things
that was in the air,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.560
you mentioned was "Flatland."

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.370
I don't know how many
of you know that book.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:16.570
It's 1870s, 1880s, it's-- I
don't know if it was for kids,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.840
but it's readable by kids
and it's a sort of fantasy

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.480
about two-dimensional creatures
trying to wrap their minds

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.790
around the idea of
a third dimension.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.970
And we, as three-dimensional
creatures have the advantage

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.270
over them.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.380
And so, the question is, could
there be a fourth spatial dimension

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.990
that is as difficult
for us to imagine

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.860
as the third dimension is for them.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.220
Well, you know, we leap ahead more
than a hundred years and we know

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.060
that physicists are
very happy to talk

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.120
about not just the fourth dimension
of time but where necessary

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.600
or where it's useful, they'll
talk about five dimensions

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.550
or 12 dimensions, many dimensions.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.950
And I think it's fair to say that
we're still in the same position

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.380 position:56%
of not being able to visualize that.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.570
I won't ask for hands, but not many
people can even visualize a fourth

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.870
spatial dimension.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.710
You can almost fake yourself

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.460
into thinking you can
visualize whether I can.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:23.000
But that's my limit, 12
dimensions, I don't know.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.400
But no, again, there's been
a real productive explosion

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.870
of geometrical thinking
in real science.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:41.340
And it was starting right at
this time that fantastic writers

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.860
like H.G. Wells were letting
their thinking explode,

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.800
I think for the same reasons.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: So, I-- my background,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.680
my academic background
is in psychology.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.070
So, naturally, I was drawn to
the distinction between real

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.750 position:56%
or absolute time and perceived time.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.240
And I wonder if you talk
a little bit about that.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:10.220
And is time the same for you and
me and people on the other side

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.540
of the universe or is it mutable?

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.010
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: You
know, again, yes, no.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.310
[ Laughter ]

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.470 position:56%
Well, first of all, the difference--

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:28.000
we humans have understood
for approximately 400 years

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.430
that there's a difference
between psychological time

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.030
and what you could call real, and
actually maybe longer than that.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:40.210
Even Shakespeare talks, Shakespeare
talks about how our sense

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.910
of time varies from
moment to moment depending

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.700
on our mood or what we're doing.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.010
People certainly knew that.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:50.740
And then it was Isaac Newton
who said, time is absolute

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.930
and let's put psychological
time aside.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.950
I'm going to define time in
a mathematical way, time T,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.670
I need it for my equations,
it is absolute,

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.440
it flows everywhere
equably and the same.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.810
And he insisted based on no
particular evidence, I would say,

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.730
that it's the same
everywhere in the universe.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.050
And let's just treat it that
way, as absolute and universal.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:23.860
And fine, that worked really great
as everybody knows until Einstein.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:30.480
And Einstein changed
that and discovered

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.510
that there are some slippage,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:41.780
and maybe not as much
slippage as we tend to think.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.790 position:56%
I tend to feel-- and you don't have
to consider me an authority on this,

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.360
this could be a matter
of prejudice--

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.740
I tend to feel that Einstein
was himself very much supporting

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.470
Newton's, the main distinction
Newton was making which was

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.500
between psychological
time and real time.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.840
We use the word real time
to mean something else now,

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.280
but Einstein too needed time
to be something abstract,

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.640
very precise, very mathematical.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.050
The difference was there isn't just
one clock for the entire universe,

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.110
there are different
clocks all over the place.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.000
And if you start to move
quickly, your clock is moving

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.540
at a different speed from
somebody who is not moving at all.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.850
And so, weird things happen and
that immediately starts playing

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.880
into time travel, science fiction.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.590
You know, I remember one of my
favorite stories when I was a kid.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.000
Bet you read this one?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.300
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.600
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: What
was the name of the book

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.900
where they're twins, twins?

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.960
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Time--
yes, I know that one.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.050
Time-- Robert Heinlein?

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.350
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yes.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.430
So they are twins and one of them--
and they-- there is telepathy,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.820
you have to believe in that too.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.090
So they have a special
way of communicating.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:01.120
And one of them goes off to
space and one of them stays home.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.480
And the one who goes off to
space stays young while the one

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.030
who stays home ages quickly.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:12.530
And that is all scientifically
correct according to Einstein.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.920
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yup.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.220
Yes, I do know that book.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.270
In fact, I'm a little
embarrassed to say

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.260
that I read it again
from time to time.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.740
But I take some solace again,
from your book which I didn't know

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.680
about in the back of describing the
need to read a book more than once

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.160
in order to fully appreciate it

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.540
because when you read it the first
time, you're reading it linearly,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.650 position:56%
whereas to understand all its nuance
like when you look at a picture,

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.110
you don't have to look at it from
the one beginning to the end.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.490
So the book is linear
in time but it's meant

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.090
to be treated as a
whole work of art.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.390
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yes.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.690
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: And so as you
become more and more familiar

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.350
with it, new bits appear to you.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.510
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: And
that's unquestionably true.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.030
But in the book, it also says
something that I don't agree with.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.450
I mean, he is wonderful
on the subject of time,

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.530
another great fiction writer who
really gets obsessed with time.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.320
But he says, if I understand
him correctly that, therefore,

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.340
the only true way, the best way to
understand the book is to have it

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.470
in your mind all at once.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.370
When you finally, let's say,
have the book memorized,

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.070
if that's possible, if
you know the entire book,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.490
then you understand the book.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.230
There are no more surprises.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.250
And I don't think that's right.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.440
That doesn't correspond to
my experience of reading.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.450
First of all, I don't think
you can ever get to that point.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.800
And if you did get to that point,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.470
I think it would take away
essential elements of books,

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:58.930
of stories which are
anticipation, surprise,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.280
not knowing what's coming next.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:08.000
Being driven forward by the
desire to know what's coming next,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.090
you still make connections
between what you discover

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.210
and what you already knew, and then
there's a kind of satisfaction.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:19.600
But I think if you ever get to
the point where the whole book is

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.860 position:56%
in your head all at once, it takes--

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.370
it kind of destroys
it as a work of art.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:31.430
And it's kind of in the same way
that if you imagine the piece

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:36.910
of music, if you were the kind
of being who didn't listen

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.960
to music linearly, but could kind
of magically absorb it all at once,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.380
wouldn't that destroy something
essential about the experience

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:53.510
because it's about time, because
time as its medium and its subject.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.080
[ Laughter ]

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.380
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: It's true.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.430
I said I would take questions
from the floor if anybody would

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.590
like to come up and ask or
otherwise, I'm doing pretty well.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.660
You have to come up to the
microphone so that we can hear you.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.370
And here it comes.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.990
It's a race.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.880
I guess we'll start here.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:21.470
&gt;&gt; My first comment is on
the memorization of a book

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.010
as you were just discussing.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.910
I have had the opportunity to read
books, you know, 10 years ago.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.640
I read a lot of science fiction.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.050
I read a book 10 years ago, I read
it today, it's a different book.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.370
It's not because the book's
changed, it's because I've changed.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.780
So that's something about not--

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.940
you know, memorizing a
book doesn't lose anything.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.420
Even if I knew all the words,
it's still not the same,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.190
but I had a question about writing.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.480
If you're writing about the
past and you were time traveling

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:55.470
into the past, you kind of know
why you're going into the past.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.830
You'd like to have a conversation
with Abraham Lincoln or you would

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.920
like to see dinosaurs
or some writing

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.540
that says you have a
destination in mind.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.610 position:56%
If you're writing for the future,
you have to make the destination up.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.390
So, how did you look
at writing time travel

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:14.280
when you're going forward
and backward?

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.230
I knew that those are two
different things and I'd

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.750
like your opinion on that.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.050
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.990
There-- I think it's true that they
are fundamentally two different

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.030
things, you know.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.200
There are two kinds of people
in the world, people who would

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.300
like to divide the world in half
and people who see it whole.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.850
But you're right, there's
a very clear distinction

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.280
between time travel to the
future and the past, and yet,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.040
they do have things in common.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.790
And there are kinds of time travel
stories where people go both ways

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.500
where they've-- they try out
each of the possibilities.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.860
The-- You know, if we're
starting at the beginning,

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:02.080
there was Mark Twain sending
his guy to medieval England.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:08.160
In his case, it wasn't to enable
Mark Twain to tell us something new

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.640
that we didn't know
about medieval England.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.840
But that later became
a big motivation

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.880
for time travel stories
about the past.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.070
Time travel fiction-- Well,

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.030
there's "Sherman &amp; Peabody,"
"Rocky and Bullwinkle."

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.150
I'm-- I take that very
seriously, you know,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.970
it's an educational device
even though in the case

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.510
of "Sherman &amp; Peabody,"
you remember,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.290
it's Mr. Sherman and his pet--

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.590
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Dog.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.040
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: That's a
dog and pet human Peabody.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:46.010
Usually, the past they go to
is not historically accurate.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.670
[ Laughter ]

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.810
Anyway, I shouldn't go on and
on about this, but you're right.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.250
Then H.G. Wells is
imagining the future

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.170
and he is inventing a
future that does not exist.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:02.700
And you have-- Then, you watch
writers making the most profound

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.000
kind of choices.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.010
And of course, the first one
is, is this a utopian future

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.350
where everybody is happy
and you have a moral lesson

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.990
about how great a society
could work?

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.550
Or is it a dystopian future
where you're expressing some kind

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.950
of terrible fear or
some kind of warning

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.200
like 1984 or "Brave New World".

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.810
And I think if we counted
them up, we would discover

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.310
that our great writers
preferred dystopian futures.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.610
&gt;&gt; Sure, thank you.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:34.910
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Thank
you for your question.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.690
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask a question
about the limitations of language.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.310
But before I do, I'm struck by
one of the last things you talked

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.430 position:56%
about before questions was listening
to music or experiencing music

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.390
and about the experience
of it all at once.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.630
I believe Mozart indicated
at some point in his life

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:55.130
that he heard the notes
all together, all at once.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.860
And I think that the problem and
the difficulty of that concept is

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.690
about the limitations of language.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.720
You haven't talked about sort of
what we call the arrow of time.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.940
But, of course, our language
is limited by talking

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.660
about going back and going forward.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.610 position:56%
And obviously, there are theories of
time that it's all happening at once

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.140
but even talking about
this happening

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.270
at once is a problem of language.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.550
So, could you address
that issue of language?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.850
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Yeah.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.150
That's a really, that's
a really good question

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.600
and it's something I'm very
interested in and try to deal

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.330
with here and there in the book.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.190
It's impossible to
separate the way we think

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.920
about time from the words we use.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.740
And it's-- so, it's interesting to
focus on that and to kind of try

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.660
to subtract things that are
linguistic accidents from reality.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.520
As soon as you start talking about
time as a fourth dimension right

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.730
from the beginning,
you have to wonder

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.200
to what extent were people
influenced by words that we use

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.040
for space and time maybe just

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.650
because there aren't enough
words to go around, you know.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.130
One thing is before another.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.440
One thing is-- Well,
if you say after,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.300
that's definitely a time
word, but if you say before,

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.480
that could be a time
or a space word.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:21.560
And then, you discover problems,
you discover not problems,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.900
you discover interesting quirks

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.130
where different languages
treat time quite differently.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.560
And you have to recognize that
your own language is causing you

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.220
to be prejudice in various ways.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.990
If I ask the people in this
room to point to the future,

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.930
I'm going to guess that almost
everybody would do something

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.590
like this point forward because,

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.940
we westerners especially
speaking English,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.530
but most of other western
languages think the future is ahead

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.880
of us, it lies ahead.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.370
But believe me when I tell you
that there are quite a few cultures

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:02.080
where people think it's just as
obvious, it is just as obvious

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.220
that the future is there.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:10.060
That's the future because I
can't see it and this is the past

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.630 position:56%
because I can see it pretty clearly.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:16.430
That might be an oversimplification
of their reason.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.470
But again, it has to do with words.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.790
And in Mandarin, the
directionality of time tends

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.580
to be vertical, not horizontal.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.960
They think of time being
above and below, the past

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.260
and the future, above and below.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.770
I'm not a Mandarin speaker so
don't press me for details.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.850
But these things are--
I could go on and on.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:46.320 position:56%
Do you spend time, you waste time,
do you pass the time, all when you--

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.010
you have to admit,
metaphors are not accurate.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.490
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: And speaking of time,
I'm used to working in studios,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.790
I'm working-- where there is

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.000
like a zillion clocks
telling me how we're doing

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.580
but I haven't gotten very--
so, I'm looking to my boss.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.040
That's what I was thinking--
to my watch.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: I'm so sorry to the
people in line that I'm rumbling on.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.540
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Yeah,
well, I think that, yeah.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.840
It's--

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.140
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: So, one more?

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.440
Two more?

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.740
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: One more, quick one.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.040
Yes.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.340
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.640
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: All though quick
ones are not really happening.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.940
&gt;&gt; OK. I'll try to make this fast.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.240
I've loved your books in the
past, right, for one thing.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.560
I'm a little on the fence about
this one because I don't know

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.860
where this book is going.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.080
I don't know that much about
it because it's brand new.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.640
Is this book about the
fantasy thoughts of time travel

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.960
or time travel as a real science?

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.990 position:56%
Because time traveling in the
future, you know, right on, because,

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.960
you know, the faster you
go, I mean, the, you know,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.500
the time does slow down, all right?

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.430
Or actually speed up a few
and slow down where we left.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:52.030
Anyway, but time traveling in the
past just seems kind of ridiculous

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.160
because it's just, I mean,
it's just not practical.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.950
But so, what is the book?

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.250
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: What's
my book about?

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly?

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.890
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: What a
great question to wrap up.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.250
We haven't said what
the book is about?

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.550
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Right, right,
what's the book about?

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.210
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: The
book is about the idea

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:09.670
of time travel in our culture.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.290
How it has developed,

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.550
how it enriches the way
we think about things.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.010
But here is what the book is not
about, it's not about how to do it.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.490
[ Laughter ]

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.470
I cannot-- I can't
really help you there.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.770
And it's not so much about
any science of time travel

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:29.810
because as far as I am
concerned, there isn't a lot

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.040
of real science of time travel yet.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.070
[ Laughter ]

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.370
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: OK.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.670
And now we have to run.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.970
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: OK.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.270
Thank you all so much.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.570
&gt;&gt; Joe Palca: Thank
you all very much.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.870
[ Applause ]

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.170
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: I'm
really happy to be here.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.470
[ Inaudible Discussion
and Applause ]

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.910

of the Library of Congress.
