00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.170
Often times movie producers and directors
face the difficult situation of having to

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.420
make a change in the movie. Whether it�s
the cast, location or script; these changes

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.100
make a big impact on the final result. Luckily
some of these decisions made the movies we

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.070
love better.
These are the �Great Decisions That Saved

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.510
Popular Movies�

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.289
Stuart Townsend is NOT Precious (or Aragorn)

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:39.390
In 1999, Lord of the Rings director Peter
Jackson cast Stuart Townsend � star of the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.390
poorly received League of Extraordinary Gentleman
- in the iconic role of Aragorn.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.239
That is, until he was fired the day before
filming was set to begin.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.350
Townsend said: �The director wanted me and
then apparently thought better of it because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.679
he really wanted someone 20 years older than
me and completely different. I have no good

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.679
feelings for those people in charge, I really
don�t.�

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.780
Viggo Mortensen was brought in as a replacement
and quickly became a fan-favorite, and the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.479
career boost helped him land other major film
roles and an eventual Oscar nomination.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.360
Depp�s Pirate Dance

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.549
When Johnny Depp sat down for the first table
read of Disney�s theme park ride-to-movie

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.090
franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean in 2002,
he decided to give Captain Jack Sparrow eccentric,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.130
unconventional mannerisms similar to that
of Rolling Stone�s guitarist Keith Richards,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.820
who Depp felt shared many similarities to
18th-century pirates.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.950
In response, Disney executives asked Depp
if the character was simply drunk or gay,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.950
then eventually told him he was ruining the
film altogether. Depp�s response: trust

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.670
me or fire me. A Screen Actor�s Guild Award,
a Golden Globe nomination, and an Academy

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.640
Award Nomination for Best Actor - as well
as 4 sequels, totaling $4 billion - shows

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.829
that Mickey Mouse made the right decision
that day.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.119
Carnahan

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.590
In 2002, Joe Carnahan (director of Smokin'
Aces and The A-Team), took over Mission: Impossible

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.929
3 from Fight Club director David Fincher.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.010
For 15 months Carnahan assembled an all-star
cast for the Tom Cruise threequel, including

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.650
Kenneth Branagh, Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett
Johansson

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.900
But then Carnahan quit.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.780
After a disagreement over the tone of the
film, Carnahan left the project in 2004 and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.220
Cruise, after watching the first two season
of Alias, found a replacement in its creator

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.260
- J.J. Abrams .

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.730
So, with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Simon
Pegg on board as well, Cruise and Abrams helped

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.730
reinvigorate the struggling franchise, paving
the way for M:I - Ghost Protocol and beyond.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.790
Shark Tank�d

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.010
With $4 million and a 55-day shooting schedule,
Steven Spielberg set out make Jaws - but first

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.370
he needed a shark. After spending a large
portion of the budget on a terrifying mechanical

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.430
shark... with crossed-eyes, and another which
sank to the sea floor, Spielberg saw the cast

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.510
and crew turn on him

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.680
Locals began leaving dead sharks on his front
step and when producers wanted Spielberg to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000
find a �shark trainer�, he knew he had
to come up with a plan.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
�I had no choice but to figure out how to
tell the story without the shark,� Spielberg

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.650
said. And he did. �So I just went back to
Alfred Hitchcock: �What would Hitchcock

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.430
do in a situation like this?� "It�s what
we don�t see which is truly frightening.�

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.430
What comes next as they say, is movie history.
Makes you wonder about that shark trainer,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.880
though.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.230
Shawshank�s Redemption

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.380
The Shawshank Redemption, starring Tom Cruise
as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.230
- is how the film would have looked if Rob
Reiner had his way.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.050
After directing the Stephen King adaptations
The Body and Stand by Me, Reiner offered $2.5

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.170
million to writer/director Frank Darabont
to turn over the rights and let him take over

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.110
the project.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.910
After seriously considering the offer - and
even liking Reiner's new direction of the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.080
project - Darabont ultimately refused, deciding
that it was his "chance to do something really

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.480
great".

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.480
Although it didn�t perform well at the box
office, Shawshank was nominated for 7 Academy

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.940
Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay
for Darabont, who went on to do the Oscar

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.190
nominated The Green Mile and the record-breaking
series The Walking Dead.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.970
Robert De Niro is BIG

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.720
In 1987, Penny Marshall set out to make the
now legendary coming-of-age film Big, starring

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.440
Tom Hanks.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.450
However, if it weren�t for a $4 million
disagreement, it would be Robert De Niro telling

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:04.450
you about a glow-in-the-dark compass, and
not Hanks.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.720
Having already committed to the movies Dragnet
and Punchline, Hanks simply had too many scheduling

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.310
conflicts and was forced to turn down the
role of Josh Baskin, so Marshall offered it

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.620
to De Niro instead.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.670
Without enough money to lock down De Niro�s
salary demands, and Hanks� schedule opening

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.010
up, all returned to normal - and Marshall
became the first female director to have a

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.820
film gross more than $100 million at the box
office.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.020
RDJ is A-OK (and Iron Man)

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.340
In 2006, Robert Downey Jr. was slowly making
his return to Hollywood with cult hits like

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.510
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly and
Zodiac - but that wasn�t enough to become

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.400
Iron Man, according to Marvel. Cue: director
Jon Favreau.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.389
�I remember when we cast Robert Downey Jr.
in �Iron Man�, and I was told no several

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.590
times,� said Favreau.� �That was a big
gamble on whether or not he was really serious

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.210
about it�and now history has definitely
proven that he was dead serious about it and

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.090
now he is the biggest star in the world.�

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.060
As far back as 2004, it was Tom Cruise trying
to get the project made, but in 2005 he lost

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.060
interest in Iron Man's status and chose to
work with Spielberg on War of the Worlds instead.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.690
Tom Selleck: Indiana Jones

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.330
In 1981, fresh from Star Wars Episode V: The
Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas began casting

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.480
his new adventure film Raiders of the Lost
Ark. The problem: Lucas didn�t want Harrison

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480
Ford.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.490
Fearing that Ford was going to be �his Bobby
De Niro� (Scorsese) after appearing in 3

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.260
previous films of his, Lucas instead hired
the man, the myth, the legend: Tom Selleck.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.340
"He was perfect for the part. I can't imagine
anybody else in that part," Lucas said of

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.370
Selleck - unfortunately the actor just filmed
a pilot for a little show called Magnum P.I.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.280
and couldn�t get out of his contract. Spielberg
suggested Ford as a replacement and Lucas

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.110
agreed... with only 3 weeks before filming.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.430
Back to Stolz� Future

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.530
While starring in the TV show Family Ties,
Michael J. Fox was cast in the lead role of

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.940
a time travel movie called Back to the Future.
Unfortunately, the network wouldn�t give

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.940
Fox time off to make the film because they
considered him the reason why the show was

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.340
successful. Producers had to cast someone,
so they did: Eric Stoltz.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.199
4 weeks into filming and director Robert Zemeckis
(who also co-wrote) had enough and determined

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:55.520
Stoltz was miscast and �too humorless.�
In secret, Stoltz actually agreed with Zemeckis.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.090
With $3 million now added to the film�s
$14 million budget, Fox�s schedule eventually

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.860
opened up and he was cast because, unlike
Stoltz, producers felt he had the personality

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.840
of Marty McFly.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.030
Get Gone Girl, Witherspoon

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.270
After starring in Water for Elephants and
This Means War, Reese Witherspoon began adapting

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:24.139
the Gillian Flynn novel Gone Girl for film
with producer Leslie Dixon. Shortly after

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:28.550
the first draft of the script, director David
Fincher joined the project and set a few things

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.990
straight, namely who won�t be in the movie:
Reese.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.829
'We had a long conversation where he was like,
"You're not right for it. And this is why."

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:42.329
And I actually completely agreed with him,'
said Witherspoon. Instead, Rosamund Pike was

00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:46.990
cast as the lead and earned an Oscar nomination
for the role. Gone Girl earned nearly 100

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:52.470
award nominations, including nods from Screen
Actors Guild, Golden Globes, Academy Awards

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:59.470
and even the Grammys so the decision was a
good one.
