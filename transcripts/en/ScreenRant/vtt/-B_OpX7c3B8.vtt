00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.950
Robert Downey Jr. has been acting forever.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.190
From a very young age he’s had parts in
his father, Robert Downey Sr.’s movies.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.580
Born to a director and an actress, he seemed
destined for a career in showbiz.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.200
And what a career it’s been.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.759
Beginning with his dad’s movie Pound in
1970, he made his big screen debut as a puppy.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.580
And from there, little by little, his career
started to take off.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.120
Robert Downey Jr. has held a few different
positions in Hollywood, and has gone from

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.829
one of the lowest to highest paid actors of
all time.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.600
This is The Amazing Evolution of Robert Downey
Jr. in Movies.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.860
Venturing outside of his father’s films,
Downey Jr. was cast as cool guy Ian in the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.989
1985 classic Weird Science.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.270
The actor was also a part of the cat of Saturday
Night Live for a while before signing up to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.500
play Julian - the coke-addicted teenager from
1987’s Less Than Zero.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.830
The movie was based on the Brett Easton Ellis
novel of the same name, and gave him the opportunity

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.420
to flex his dramatic chops.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.280
Suddenly people were saying “holy shit,
this kid can act.”

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.280
Good thing, too.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.180
Because he was on his way to working with
one of the most in-demand actors of the time.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.450
Someone who would turn out to be a very important
ally down the road.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.860
Working with Mel Gibson on 1990’s Air America,
the two actors became fast friends.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.810
As Billy, Downey played a young pilot who
loses his license during the Vietnam War era.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.310
As a result, his job opportunities are minimal.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.880
So when he’s recruited to fly delivery planes
in Laos, he accepts.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.090
The only downside is that his peers and bosses
are actually all dangerous criminals.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.650
And what started as a neat employment opportunity
quickly erodes into a life-threatening situation.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.899
As a director, Richard Attenborough told the
stories of important historical figures.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.799
Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ernest
Hemingway to name a few.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.250
But it was when he sought to tell the story
of comedy legend Charlie Chaplin that he crossed

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.150
paths with Robert Downey Jr.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.670
The role required versatility; someone who
could nail Chaplin’s comedic timing as well

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.380
as his tortured soul.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.070
Audiences were taken aback by what the actor
could do, and were in awe of the physical

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.620
resemblance between the two men.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.480
The academy took notice, too.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.200
And come award season, his performance earned
him a nomination in the Best Actor category.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.540
Over the decade that followed his Oscar nom,
the actor went through struggles in his personal

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.540
life.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.290
Some of them got him in trouble with Hollywood,
and as a result his reputation came under

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.290
fire.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.859
After all the negative press, filmmakers were
reluctant to cast Downey Jr.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.910
But if you take a look at his IMDB page, it
appears as though he never stopped working,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.160
even if there is a noticeable difference in
the quality of his characters.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.580
In 2003, a good word from old friend Mel Gibson
went a long way.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.940
In talking with the team behind The Singing
Detective, Gibson suggested they also cast

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.920
RDJ, and vouched for his friend in a big way.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.380
Which some people argue was the turning point
of his whole career.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.329
Cited among lifelong fans as their favorite
RDJ performance, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was the

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.250
birthplace of a brand new kind of sarcastic
wiseass.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.100
And if you haven’t seen it, you really should.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.230
Directed by Shane Black and co-starring Val
Kilmer, the movie is a twisting murder mystery

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.930
with some of the most epic and witty exchanges
of all time.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.570
And if you can keep up with the back and forth,
you’ll probably agree.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.870
The 2005 comedy seemed to soften audiences
up a little, and the actor’s career picked

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.139
up steam and hasn’t stopped since.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.950
In his work as Harry Lockhart, RDJ proved
that he could handle the kind of dialogue

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.700
that requires a sharp tongue.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.750
Good thing, too.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.940
Because perfectly timed rants happen to be
the main export of the next big character

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.019
heading his way.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.130
Without a question, the actor is a household
name because of his work as Tony Stark a.k.a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.130
Iron Man.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.729
The relatively niche character is now a veritable
worldwide phenomenon, and audiences will flood

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.709
the theatre every single time the Avenger
appears on the big screen.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.670
That’s good news for everyone.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.430
Fans get more of what they want, the studio
gets to expand the cinematic universe, and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.310
the actor gets to keep playing a character
he clearly loves.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.230
It’s a good thing that playing Stark has
been such a positive experience so far, since

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.350
Iron Man still has a few more appearances
to make.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.310
Clearly, Robert Downey Jr. is a man of many
talents.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.780
His characters are layered and complex; always
interesting.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.290
But the amount of layers belonging to Kirk
Lazarus of Tropic Thunder is over-the-top.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.720
And that’s exactly the point.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.470
The dude playin’ the dude disguised as another
dude is an Oscar-winning Australian method

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.790
actor who gets cast as a soldier and then
turns into a soldier for real…

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.790
You know what?

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.790
It’s complicated.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.950
Just do yourself a favor and watch the movie.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.180
By 2009, RDJ had experience playing characters
that had first become famous in books.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.400
And since the stories of Sherlock Holmes have
been corrupted so many times, we can’t blame

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.980
anyone who was skeptical when they first heard
about the Guy Ritchie reboot.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.590
With Jude Law playing the Watson to his Holmes,
Downey blew viewers away with his take on

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.960
the titular detective.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.350
And even won a Golden Globe for it.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.950
The movie was incredibly successful, and so
was it’s sequel.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.280
Recently it was announced that the franchise
is getting a third installment.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.710
And we can’t wait.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.840
In between saving the world and being a dad,
the actor has also founded a production company,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.830
fittingly named Team Downey.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.800
Along with his wife Susan, they recently produced
a film called The Judge in 2014.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.720
And, because he CLEARLY didn’t already have
enough on his plate, he starred in it too.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:32.100
