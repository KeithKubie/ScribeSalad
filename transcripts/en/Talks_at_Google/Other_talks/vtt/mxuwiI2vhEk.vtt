Male #1: Hi, everybody. Thanks for coming.
We are very pleased to have a 63-minute or

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.440
less talk by Peter Nowak. We have that much
HD space currently. Um, renowned CBC tech,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.389
blogger, tweetist, and now, author. And thank
you very much for agreeing to come and talk

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.389
about your book, and we look forward to your
talk.

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:17.389
[Applause]

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:32.739
Peter Nowak: All right, uh… can you hear
me okay? All right, well, thanks. First of

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.000
all, thanks very much for having me, this
is a, this is a considerable honor for me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.050
I understand I'm one of a handful of few Canadian
authors, to actually get to do this. So that's,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.690
that's, that's really great. And I also think
it's fantastic that Google, not just Google,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.150
but any company does this sort of thing. Because
I think, it's fantastic not just for authors

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.800
to be able to come in and talk about what
they've done, but also to, for, for employees

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.280
to actually get company time to actually hear
interesting new perspectives, which I hope

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.990
I can bring to you today. So, I guess what
I'm going to do is I made a little presentation

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.130
on keynotes; my first ever presentation. I
thought it was, it was a little project that

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.549
I undertook and I had a blast doing it. So
I figured I'd do this so you wouldn't just

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.740
have to look at me; you would have something
else look at, because I'm just not that interesting.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.590
So okay, so this is "Sex, Bombs, and And Burgers".
This is my new book. It just came out last

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.399
week. So I'll give you a bit of an overview
as to what I'm going to try run-through here.

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.509
So, I'll quickly tell you about who I am,
how the book came to be, and I'll tell you

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.479
about what I call the shameful Trinity, which
are kind of 3 base instincts at the root of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.880
this book. And of course, those are food...
fast food/food processing, war, and pornography.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.460
And because this is Google, I'll tell you
a little bit about some of Google's relevance

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.659
to all of this stuff. And of course, I'll
try to give a little bit of a look of the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.599
future. So, okay, so, quickly who am I? I've
been writing about technology for about 13

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.310
years. I'm currently the Senior Science and
Technology Reporter at CBC news.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.660
We don't actually have a
[Inaudible] Beep

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.430
Junior-technology reporter so; it's kind of
an interesting title.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.970
Beep
I've also…

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.310
What is that?
[Inaudible]

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.920
Beep
[Inaudible]

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.700
[laughter]
Um, right, so, I've also worked for the National

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.560
Post, I lived abroad a couple years in China
and New Zealand. I was the Technology Reporter

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.710
for the New Zealand Herald. I used to write
about software for The Globe and Mail many,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.860
many years ago. And when I was in China I
freelanced for a lot of newspapers so some

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.651
of them are listed there. Okay, so, I often
get asked, where did you think of or what

00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:03.989
was your idea or what was your inspiration
for this book? And sadly it was Paris Hilton.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:12.269
[laughter] If you will remember a few years
ago, she is obviously famous for being famous.

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.780
Actually, the way she became famous was this
infamous sex tape that was circulating on

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.090
the Internet a few years ago. [video shows
new slide titled "Origins of the book" with

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.000
a bulleted list and picture of Paris Hilton]
And if you, I don't know if you've seen it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.349
but essentially the crux of the video was
her having sex with her then boyfriend and

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.310
it was all green. So, you know, and being
a nerd that I am, I was not really paying

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.340
attention to what was going on I was just
looking at it thinking, wow where have I seen

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.230
the green thing before? So I thought back,
and it finally clicked that it was actually

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.190
going back to 1991, when the United States
helped to liberate Kuwait from Iraq. I remember

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.379
the CNN footage that was going on at the time.
It was all green tinged; it was all in night

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.370
vision. So that really got me thinking, all
right, so here's an example of military developed

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.030
technology passed into the consumer's space,
and interestingly enough, here's, here's a

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.719
great example of it being used in a sexual
way. Of course, Paris Hilton's video is essentially

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.970
amateur porn. So the more I started reading
up on it, started looking into it, and I started

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.550
finding lots and lots of examples of technologies
that have been developed by the military eventually

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.930
found their way into the consumer's space.
And I'll talk about those in a minute. The

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.740
more I looked into it, the more I found links
between the military technology and porn technology

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.280
as well, and see Paris was a good example.
So, now where does the food part come into

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.720
it? Well, around the same time, sort of, two
things were happening, I was reading a book

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.050
called "Fast Food Nation", I don't know if
anybody's read it. It's a very good book.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.080
And there's one chapter in there that really
stood out for me. It was the author Eric Schlosser,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.099
he visited a chemical factory in New Jersey
where he sampled a whole bunch of artificial

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.479
flavors. And I read that and I was like, "Wow
that's crazy. I'd never thought about that

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.680
before." At the same time, I was kinda starting
to get into my 30s and getting older, and

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.220
starting to slow down, feel sluggish, and
I started reading labels on foods in grocery

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.830
stores, and seeing all the crazy stuff that
goes into them.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.720
So it really made me realize, how much technology
goes into the food that we eat. Even a simple

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.190
banana, you know, has genetic, has genetically,
there's genetic engineering in the banana.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.680
There's gas applied to the banana to make
it ripen, and all this crazy stuff. Um, so

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.520
the more I looked at a few technologies again
I found incredible links to the military,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800
and those links are kind of, they come in
two different ways. And I will talk about

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
those as well.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.590
[Long pause video shows new slide showing
images of monkeys]

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.560
Okay, so I call this the shameful Trinity.
So this is essentially our three base instincts

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:09.220
which is the need to fight or compete, the
need to reproduce and/or titillate ourselves,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.520
and the need to eat as much as we possibly
can or amass as much as we can.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.460
So the image on the left, I'll talk about
that in a second. That's actually a drawing

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.970
from Science Magazine of the oldest human
skeleton found. I'll talk about that in a

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.970
second.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.000
The image on the right, which I like to call
angry Wimpy eating burger... it was drawn

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.379
by a friend of mine named Stefan, and it's
in the book... and it kind of illustrates

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.020
the whole shameful Trinity.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.210
So, going back to the skeleton, which is,
scientists have named Arthur, Ardipithecus

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.520
ramidus. [video shows new slide titled " Ardipithecus
ramidus" with a bulleted points] I think I'm

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.259
saying that correctly. So the skeleton is
over 4.4 million years old, they only discovered

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.370
it last year, and some of the theories that
have been published about the skeleton are

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.819
in National Geographic and in Science are
really interesting. Because researchers at

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:16.330
Kent State University have figured that that
shameful Trinity of food, sex, and eating

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.370
are actually responsible for humans getting
up off of all fours and walking on two feet.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:30.680
And the rationale is the way that men use
to compete for women, and this is back in

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.610
caveman days, I guess you could say, is they
would obviously fight it out, and the guy

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.130
with the biggest muscles and biggest teeth
would usually get the woman. So, the lesser

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:47.370
males, the beta males, I guess, they had to
kind of improvise to try to get some action

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.430
themselves. So we know that they figured out
another way to get a female's interests is

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.289
to give gifts. And what was the only gifts
back then that really mattered? Well, it was

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:01.560
food. So as the theory goes, these guys would
go out and get food for women and bring it

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.460
back to them, but in order to do so they have
to be able to carry it. So they eventually

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:12.550
have developed the ability to stand up and
carrying their food. So I think that's kind

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:21.810
of an interesting illustration of where this
is going.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.490
[Long pause]

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:31.650
So, nearly 5 million years later, nothing
has changed. We still compete; we still, we

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.979
still, despite centuries and despite millions
of years of trying to overcome this; these

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:41.435
base instincts, we have not gotten any closer
to that. As I think this Burger King ad shows,

00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:53.290
I think this is from Malaysia. Uh, so these
three base needs over time have translated

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:59.030
into serious, serious industries. Now if we
look at the military industry.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.030
[video shows new slide titled " Really big
business" with a bulleted points]

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.649
The military industry is one of the biggest
in the world last year, and I'm sorry, in

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:10.810
2008 we were spending globally $1.4 trillion,
which is about two and half percent of global

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:18.089
GDP. The United States has been the big driver
of that and they have spent about 42% of that.

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:20.230
China, as you can see it is number two, but
they are only, basically, it's a drop, but

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:26.803
what they are spending is a drop in the bucket
compared to what the US is. And just for an

00:09:26.803 --> 00:09:32.270
interesting Canadian fact is, I thought was
kind of neat, is that the Pentagon's black

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.490
budgets, this is the money that they don't
really talk about that they are spending,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.550
it is estimated to be about $50 billion which
is about triple what Canada spends on our

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:50.870
entire military. So the last 10 years has
seen a major increase in spending to about

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.870
35%.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:57.660
Getting into the porn business, the porn business
is a lot harder to measure because there's

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:03.700
not; it's primarily dominated by small private
companies that are not required to report

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:10.710
what they make. So it's really, there's only
really a best estimate figures here, but even

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:17.560
taken with a grain of salt, $97 billion is
a really big global industry. So, as you can

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.709
see, it's more than a lot of the major technology
companies put together. [video shows slide

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:25.950
titled " Really big business" with new bulleted
points]And China, South Korea, Japan are apparently

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.660
the biggest spenders. The United States is
up their fourth with about $14 billion. So,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:38.010
the number there that's pretty whopping is
that more than $3,000 is spent every second

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:44.450
on porn. And of course, the amount spent in
the US is more than all of the three mainstream

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.480
networks put together.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.639
So, getting into food, the food is the biggest
industry in the world. It is about $4.8 trillion,

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:59.140
about 10% of the entire output. There's no
coincidence that, and this is what I'm talking

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:05.220
about a little bit when I go further in the
food industry, is food is essential to everything

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:12.350
else we have. You know, until we secure our
food supply nothing else really matters, you

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.220
know, if you don't have enough to eat we don't
have iPods, we don't have flat screen TVs.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:23.389
So it's no surprise that the most prosperous
countries in the world are also the biggest

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:31.060
food producers. So, as you can see the top
three food producers are all G8 countries.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.750
And McDonald's, obviously you'll see, is a
very big part of that. I think Google surpassed

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:41.209
McDonald's in ready revenue in the last year
or two. So, good job.

00:11:41.209 --> 00:11:44.735
[laughter; video shows slide titled "Food"
with image of a Whopper with seven patties

00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:46.450
and Chinese writing]
So I'll start with food, because like I said

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:53.850
that's kind of... this is actually real too,
I can't actually off the top my head remember

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:59.590
whether it's in Japan or Korea, I think it
was Japan. It was just a monstrosity. So as

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.510
I said food is kind of the real basic. Until
you have your food supply secured, nothing

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:11.800
else really matters. So in recent years, there
has been a lot of almost a cottage industry

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.660
developed, that criticizes the sort of industrialized
food system. [video shows slide with image

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.460
from movie Food, Inc. and cover of book "The
Omnivore's Dilemma"] So I come in documentary

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.250
food movies like "Food Inc." which was nominated
for an Oscar or of course the "Omnivore's

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.120
Dilemma" one of the sort of premises of these
books and the movies is that industrialized

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.320
food is bad, but the fact is without it we'd
be starving. [video shows new slide with title

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.060
"Food tech isn't all bad" with bulleted points]
And I'll tell you a bit more about why that

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:45.030
is. The way that technology develops is if
you look at the way developed in the United

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:52.920
States was. Start before I get to that let
me tell you a little bit about the whole issue

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:59.180
out there is a very strong movement right
now for organic food, producing organic food,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.690
and local farming, and that sort of thing.
That stuff is all great and I think they are

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.360
luxuries. And I do think that they are luxuries
that we can kind of enjoy here and in the

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.690
developed world, but the fact is if we all
converted to, if we converted all of our food

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.980
system to organic and locally grown, I think
there would be rampant starvation in not too

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.899
long of a time, because ah, farming is still
very much at the mercy of mother nature so

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:30.199
if you get too much rain one year and too
little rain one year you are screwed either

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:31.199
way.

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:37.279
So, now we'll move on to the three of what
I like to call the three epochs of food. And

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:43.930
these are sort of the three major areas or
the three major times that food technology

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.440
was developed. So we start with World War
II this was really when mass food processing

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.589
was born. That's when, it was kind of the
first real situation where United States had

00:13:54.589 --> 00:14:00.240
to send a bunch of their soldiers overseas,
and find some way to feed them. So, they had

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.579
to come up with ways to make the food last
longer, not spoil. And when you're talking

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:10.320
about things like milk and eggs it's not,
it's not easy to do. So a lot of money and

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.800
a lot of research and development went into
things like dehydration or flash freezing.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.750
And spray drying which is a process where
you, it's like dehydrating except you do it

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:29.300
with hot air. So, things like the aftereffects
of this after the war were things like coffee,

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.930
Maxwell House coffee, for example. You know
they basically powderize beans, and then they

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:40.310
dehydrate them, and once you add water, and
then you have coffee again. And they did this

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:45.279
with eggs and stuff like that. And if you've
ever had Quick, and you drink Quick when you

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:53.500
were kids that was the process that was kind
of the direct byproduct of World War II. One

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.010
of the big things that came out of the war
too was something called the mass spectrometer.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.010
[video shows new slide with title "Three epochs
of food" with bulleted points and a picture

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.490
of a mass spectrometer] It was, it's, it could
possibly be one of the dullest instruments,

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.860
dullest scientific instruments ever invented
but it's also perhaps the most important,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:15.610
because it allowed scientists to study matter
on a, on an atomic level. So, it analyzed,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:22.070
they used it in developing the atomic bomb
they isolated isotopes, and all that fun stuff.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.290
But food companies really took to it after
the war because it was a fantastic way for

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:33.329
them to look at, one good example was Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola is always very sort of jealously

00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:38.791
guarded its formula. Well, somebody could
put Coca-Cola into this mass spectrometer

00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:42.130
and figure out exactly what is going on in
there and replicate it. Now of course you

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:50.009
will get into trademark and intellectual property
issues, but the bottom line is that it allowed

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:55.860
food processors to really drill down into
the very essence of food. And that of course

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.389
led to, going back "Fast Food Nation", and
led to the development of the flavor industry.

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:09.110
So all of this kind of came together after
the war in the 50s and 60s, because one of

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.380
the big byproducts of food processing whether
it is dehydration or whatever it is that it

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.040
strips food of its nutrients, it strips it
of its tastes, so you know, it's not healthy

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.290
for you. It doesn't taste good; but with the
mass spectrometer chemical, the food processors

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:30.870
can now develop chemicals to put all of that
stuff back in. So, they could really do anything

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:37.760
they wanted to food and then basically chemically
make it taste good to some extent a little

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.949
bit better for you. So.

00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:46.010
The second major epoch of food was the space
race and the fast food revolution, which kind

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:54.480
of happened during the Cold War. Now NASA
has probably helped develop some of the, more

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:00.870
technology than just about any organization
you can think of. I'll talk a bit more about

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:06.290
what they've done in other areas. But in terms
of food one of the things, John Glenn, the

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:12.290
first American astronauts that went into space,
I am sorry the first astronaut that actually

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:18.900
ate in space. Because they sent him around
the world and he took up this tube of applesauce.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.330
Basically, he was only up there for I think
five hours, but they just wanted to do an

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.210
experiment. They said, we wanted to see if
you could swallow in space. So he squeezes

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:34.040
applesauce into his mouth, and he swallowed
it, and said Yep! Okay! Good. [mumbles] We

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.943
can eat in space. So NASA then basically turned
the Pillsbury and said well we're going to

00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:45.411
the moon so we're gonna have to send people
out there for a bunch of days at a time. So

00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:48.050
they're going to need something so Pillsbury
can you make some croissants or something.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.530
[video shows slide with new bulleted points
and a picture of Pillsbury doughboy] And Pillsbury

00:17:53.530 --> 00:18:00.150
found, NASA had such high standards, that
Pillsbury found their entire food system,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:07.440
the entire way that they produce food for
you and I was deplorable. So, they completely

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.860
revamped their entire quality control system
and over the decades, it led to some system

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.010
called "Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Points" which is basically food testing at

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:23.890
every single point. So, you know at the farm,
to harvesting of it, to the packaging of it,

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:31.100
to the processing of it, etc. etc. In this
system, HACCP is now used in every single

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:37.590
developed country, by every single food, every
single food company in the world. And that's

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:44.860
 , it's hard to overstate the importance of
NASA's contributions in this area because

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:51.060
this system basically has prevented so much
tainted food from getting out there, I mean

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.460
it's hard to estimate how much it could be.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.300
So, McDonald's on the other hand, was also
growing at the same time. McDonald's has really

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:07.000
put a lot of development into small things
and into big things. You know, from humble

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.930
things like automated ketchup dispensers,
but then going on to bigger things like frozen

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:17.130
fries and frozen burgers. Frozen foods were
around before McDonald's, but McDonald's because

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:23.320
it grew into such a big huge powerhouse so
quickly it very quickly developed power or

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.300
influence over the food industry; kind of
similar to Google not in terms of industry

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:35.090
but in terms of influence. So any sort of
innovations that McDonald's came up with soon

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:41.450
translated into the larger food industry.
So one other thing they also did was that

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.670
they pioneered, you know a Wal-Mart or Dell
often get credit a lot of credit for really

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.411
developing the just-in-time delivery supply
chain system, but McDonald's was actually

00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:57.630
there first. In the 60s they had something
like a couple of hundred beef suppliers. And

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.720
they figured, this is problematic because
it is hard to keep track of so many beef companies.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.400
So what we need to do is pair them down. And
what they did was, this happened about the

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.620
same time they started instituting frozen
burgers. By doing that, I think they lessened

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:22.090
it down to about five suppliers, and so they
basically limited their points of, you know,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:28.590
problems, problems arising.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:35.470
So the third epoch of food, which I think
we are currently in, started in late 70s and

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.690
early 80s. And this is where we start getting
into genetically modified foods. [video shows

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.720
slide with new bulleted points and a picture
a man standing with African children] There

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:47.700
is a fine line, there actually the line is
difficult to tell where we got from hybrid

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.340
seeds and hybrid foods to genetically modified
foods because it wasn't, there wasn't a lot

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.940
of food scientists don't believe there is
a clear division between the two. But in the

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.880
early days, Monsanto was one of the first
to jump on this. Monsanto was a chemical company,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:11.340
that started just over a hundred years ago
and they have been hated since their inception.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.670
Little-known fact that they are actually the
company that introduced Coca-Cola to caffeine.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:22.810
And they have also been busted the world over
for illegal dumping and all sorts of stuff

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.970
like that. They're like the environmental
movement's public enemy number one. So it

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.000
is no surprise that we now have books and
movies that are really critical of the Monsanto.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.420
But what Monsanto did was they came up with
the fertilizer. I'll tell you briefly about

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.300
the green revolution in an unfamiliar. The
fellow in the picture there is actually Norman

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:48.391
Borlaug, who's possibly the greatest humanitarian
that has ever lived. He was the father the

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:54.980
green revolution, which after World War II,
and there is a nice link to the war here.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.580
After World War II, the United States and
the rest of the free world were very concerned

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:05.130
about spread of Communism. So they supported
developing nations and in a number of ways,

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:10.170
one of which was they supplied them with arms,
another way would be that they supplied them

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:16.390
with financing and that's sort of thing, but
another I think far more ingenious approach

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:24.310
was trying to give these developing countries
that means to become prosperous themselves.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:30.360
And like I said before the only way to do
that is to take care of your food supply first.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.300
So Mexico was where this all started. Mexico,
right after World War II was kind of, they

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.620
had food supply problems and the people were
starting to think 'hey maybe Communism is

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:46.310
the answer.' So they sent not Norman Borlaug,
who is a biologist down there, and he came

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:52.610
up with this new kind of wheat. It was a hybrid
strain that resistance a lot of the climate

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:59.480
problems that they had in Mexico. And what
happened was over very short period of time,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:07.560
the wheat yields in Mexico just exploded.
And after a few years the people of Mexico

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.300
had more than enough food and they became
exporters. This is part of what was called

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.070
the "Mexican miracle" which was, I think about
20 years of steady economic growth in Mexico.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:24.380
So it worked wonders in Mexico and thoughts
of Communism fell by the wayside, so they

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:31.010
exported this idea to a number of other countries.
They did it in India was next and same effect

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:38.850
in India, and Pakistan their food was secured.
Within a very short period of time they became

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:48.410
exporters of food. And eventually economically
prosperous. So, Monsanto, part of the green

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:54.110
revolution was, a need for chemical fertilizers,
so Monsanto was very quick in there and that

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.581
was one of the criticisms of both the green
revolution and Mosanto is that it makes farmers

00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:07.480
dependant on these chemical fertilizers. But
anyhow, so they came out with this weed killer

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.920
called Roundup, and it was the number-one
weed killer in the world until the 80s. But

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.040
their patent was running out. So what they
did was they came up with something rather

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:24.670
ingenious, or sinister, depending how your
perspective. They decided' hey let's genetically

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:30.700
engineer some seeds, which when they grow
the plants, they will actually be resistant

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.790
to Roundup. So that means that a farmer can
go out, buy Roundup, spray it on his fields,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.290
and the weed killer will kill all the weeds,
but the plants, which are naturally resistant

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:47.210
to this weed killer will resist it. And um,
so essentially, in technological terms they

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:53.530
created a light list, basically only the plants
that they deemed worthy would survive their

00:24:53.530 --> 00:25:00.830
killer spray. And so that is where we are
at now. And that is a lot of the recent criticism

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.890
because also a source of intellectual property
issues both in regards to this killer into

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.410
the seeds themselves.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:16.910
Now in the 90s, just as these genetically
modified seeds were starting to take off,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:24.470
there was a big outbreak of mad cow disease
in the UK and that really cast a chill over

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.570
the whole industry. And mad cow's cause, they
found mad cow was caused by cows eating basically

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:36.380
junk food, eating chemically treated plants
and all that stuff. So Europe got very scared

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.040
of genetically modified seeds and any foods
that basically were created from genetically

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.920
modified seeds and that kind of spread to
African as well, and that is kind of where

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:53.750
we are at now. It has been the situation where
people are not sure what the long-term effects

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:59.100
of these genetically modified seeds are going
to be. The other main criticism is that again,

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.070
Monsanto and a few other companies control
the patents to these seeds. So there is concern

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:14.790
that really it's all profit motivated. But
the fact is, humanitarian aids of genetically

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.880
modified, humanitarian uses of genetically
modified foods are coming. There is something

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.180
called Golden Rice created about 10 years
ago by a Swiss scientist. And it was created;

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.650
he did it in the universities so it was free
from any sort of corporate funding or patenting

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:33.530
or anything like that. He did run into intellectual
property issues but that is a side story.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.640
It is now going through regulatory process.
Things have are really slow down this area

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.800
because people really nervous about it. Golden
Rice is something; it is rice, it is kind

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.650
of yellow or orangey colored it has been genetically
modified to have a higher vitamin A content.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:53.080
Vitamin A deficiency is a serious problem
in developing countries. It leads to blindness

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.690
in children and even death. So the first place
they are looking to roll it out is the Philippines.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:03.180
And it looks like it is going to happen in
the next year or two. And this is great because

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:10.160
it is going to be really the first rollout
of genetically modified plants, that are not

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:17.890
be done, you know, on a purely profit driven
basis.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:18.890
[Long pause]

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.450
Okay, so the last thing, I think this is a
last thing I'm going to say about food today.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:29.020
The other link between food and war is that
a lack of food usually means war, or it usually

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.990
creates the conditions for war. These quotes
here, [video shows slide with title No Food=

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.960
War and has three quotes in a bulleted list]
these are from one of the folks I spoke to

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.740
from one of my books a fellow named Peter
Singer. He has written a number of books.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.730
His latest is called "Wired for War". It is
all about robots and war. It is an awesome

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.890
book; you should check it out. These quotes
here are from a previous book of his called

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:53.450
"Children at War", which is about children
at war. And these are actually three quotes

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:59.960
from children between the ages of 12 and 14
who were recruited in Africa I think all of

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.750
them are in the Congo or somewhere around
there. They were recruited by local warlords

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:11.860
into their armies. And as you can see, the
common denominator in all of them is the need

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.220
for food.29.06

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.630
So bottom line there is if we can feed the
world, we can eliminate a lot of the causing

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:26.170
causes, causal issues for why people actually
enlist to fight, to become soldiers, to become

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.170
terrorists.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:33.620
[Long pause, video shows the word 'War' with
images of war with the words "War=Death and

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.000
suffering, but we all benefit from it" scrolling
across slide]

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.650
[Clears throat]So war, the military is probably
the biggest development of technologies and

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:49.920
I am sure that probably is not a surprise
to many people. I think the major point in

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:58.100
my book is the negatives of these base instincts
of ours: wars, porn, and fast food. We see

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:03.770
them every day, and we are very much aware
of them. As these pictures illustrate, but

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:09.210
I guess, what I've tried to point out is that
a lot of these negatives actually provide

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:16.990
us with a lot of comforts and conveniences
that we never think of. So war is definitely

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:23.210
horrific, it causes death and destruction
and suffering, but the fact is that in some,

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:28.150
in many, many ways all of us have benefited
from. It is kind of unfortunate but it is

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.220
true. [video shows new slide titled "Less
Killing, not more" with bulleted points listed]

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.980
So the reasons that military forces spend
money on developing new technologies, some

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:41.140
of them are fairly obvious, having an advantage
over your enemy, of course, is a big motivator.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:47.320
But also, believe it or not, trying to come
up with stuff that actually results in less

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:54.030
people dying is a very big motivator of military
forces particularly their own people.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:59.512
Of course, there are positive economic byproducts.
World War II is probably the best example.

00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:04.170
The world was in a depression before the war
came along and all of a sudden industry is

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:13.560
pumping out everything from shoes to submarines,
and so the global economic situation rebounds.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.360
So universities which are a lot of research
comes from, and development comes from research

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:26.090
in the US. There are estimates that a third
of all faculty since 1945have somehow been

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.740
funded by, and somehow benefited from military
funding. So even Sergey Brin and Larry they

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:37.770
even benefited in a way, some of the computers
that they used at Stanford were supplied by

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:46.790
DARPA which is one of the US military's main
technology labs.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.790
So, again there is three epochs of war. World
War II of course, was the big one; there were

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:55.820
large inventions everyone knows about. Like
the Jets, the good powers of digital computers.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:02.220
But some of the smaller ones I focused a lot
on some of the smaller ones in my book not

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.120
too many people know about that probably has
a huge effect on us. Things like the microwave

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.440
oven which originated as radar and plastics
a lot of plastics such as Teflon and the plastic

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:23.570
Coke bottles are made of. I cannot think of
it off the top of my head. A lot of these

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:30.640
plastics were developed during the war kind
of by accident. So, what did all these things

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:38.030
do, they contributed towards transforming
society into a very much consumer driven society

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:45.450
after the war. So there is a magazine as,
a famous magazine ad in the 40s the late 40s

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.480
that basically said "after total war comes
total living." [video shows new slide titled

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.990
"Thee three epochs of War" with bulleted points
listed] And you have time to put yourself

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.070
in the shoes of the people that were living
at the time. First, they had a depression

00:31:54.070 --> 00:32:00.580
to deal with, and then they have the World
War II to deal with. That was two decades

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:07.100
of absolute depravation. So when the war ends,
of course you know, basically that uncorks

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:11.840
a whole bunch of pent up [inaudible ] and
people want to just live it up. There comes

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.570
a huge wave of consumer products that came
out after the war it, that were developed

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.570
for more technologies.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.530
[video shows new bulleted points on the slide
titled "The three epochs of war" and picture

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:25.150
of space shuttle during lift off] The second
epoch was the Cold War and the space race,

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:30.020
which was kind of an offshoot of the Cold
War. Again today, when you think of space

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.790
exploration and the international space station
which I believe there is 18 countries that

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:38.660
have taken part in the international space
station. We think of it as the utmost and

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:45.640
international cooperation and whatnot, but
in the 50s, the 40s, 50s, and 60s, it totally

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.700
was not. It was not about who can create the
rockets that could lift the satellites in

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.040
orbit or people into orbit. It was all about
who can create the rockets that could launch,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.870
lob nukes over the ocean at your enemy. So
the space race was very much military influence.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:07.200
And that is why we are worried about rocket
testing by countries like North Korea and

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:13.970
Iran today. So I mentioned some of the NASA
innovations in food, but, I mean, it's just

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.710
countless, you could fill a book with the
things that NASA has come up with that has

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.640
translated into everyday life. I just listed
a few there. You know, stronger tires, they

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.370
came up with safety grading and concrete so
that you know, the roads would have better

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:34.450
traction, and these are all over the place.
Even in the jet propulsion Lab in California,

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:41.950
they came up with the Super Soaker. I cannot
remember the story behind that one, but it

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:48.040
was crazy. So DARPA which I mentioned is the
"Defense advanced research project agency".

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.620
DARPA was created same time that NASA was
this is just like the Soviet Union's launch

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.970
of Sputnik. . [video shows new slide titled
"DARPA" with bulleted points listed and picture

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.370
of Vint Cerf]It's kind of funny, after World
War II, the Americans were really and dare

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.790
I say cocky, which is unusual for Americans.
[laughter]

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:11.300
Um, they were like' oh we have all the technological
might in the world, we're awesome etc'. And

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.830
then of course the Soviet Union beat them
in the face with the first satellite; Sputnik.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:21.190
So there was kind of a panic not just because
Americans realized hey we lost our technological

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:26.610
edge, but also because, as I said with the
previous slide, the Soviet Union just proved

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:32.220
that 'hey we have the missiles launched nukes
at you.' So they were really scared. So the

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:40.440
government formed NASA and DARPA to sort of
make sure this never happens again. And DARPA

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:47.340
just like NASA, is also another just fountain
of things, of technologies that first started

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:54.290
as military and eventually came to the commercial
realm and of course the best example is the

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.690
Internet's which Vint Cerf there, he was probably
the key one of the key figures in designing.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.330
I had to find that picture [video shows picture
of Vint Cerf wearing a shirt that says "I

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:10.380
P on everything"] because I remember saying
it. You know he did a speech here a couple

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:18.840
years ago at the University of Waterloo and
he showed it, I remember I and my full nerdness

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.790
I thought it was hilarious.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:28.070
So into the third epoch of war, [video shows
new bulleted points on the slide titled "The

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.208
three epochs of war" and picture of rain on
the sea] the Middle East is a, deep chapter

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.262
I've got to in the book is called Operation
Desert Lab. One of the unfortunate things

00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:36.580
about the way that military technology tends
to unfold is that it's got to be tested. And

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:43.090
you can test it in labs all you want but there
is no better way to test than in actual warfare.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:52.620
And for the past 20 years or so, basically
that meant Iraq and Afghanistan. So the first

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:59.141
liberation of Kuwait, as I mentioned with
Paris Hilton and the night vision, that was

00:35:59.141 --> 00:36:01.990
an opportunity for the US to test out a lot
of technology they had sitting on the shelves

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:08.150
basically since the Vietnam War. They didn't
really know if they worked or not. So some

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:14.000
examples that are the laser-guided smart bombs.
These are now, the laser-guidance signals

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.020
on the smart bombs is now finding its way
into cars like the new Lexus. They use lasers

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:24.550
to detect how far in front of them another
car is, and they can adjust their speed accordingly.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:32.430
GPS of course was first rolled out for operation
Desert Storm, and now it's in basically every

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:39.720
phone. Norman Schwarzkopf who was the American
General that basically led the liberation,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.430
he kind of summed it all up. He called it.
He called that war the technology war. And

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:49.340
he said 'I could not have done it all without
the computers.' Now that was in '91 which

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.080
was right around when Windows 3 I think it
was, and I believe that was the first real

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.761
version of Windows that took off, because
it was the first one that was easy to use.

00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:06.670
Uh, the US military was buying something like
$3 billion dollars worth of computers and

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:13.240
software at the time. So they were a major
clients a major buyer of Windows. I'm not

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:21.020
to say that Microsoft's success is largely
dependent on those sales, but it certainly

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:28.790
contributed. So coming into today, the so-called
War on Terror, one of the serious side effects

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:33.850
we are going to see from that is our robots.
I'm sure you've heard about this elsewhere.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:40.450
The robots are, there is major, major money
going into robotic deployment in Iraq and

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:44.430
Afghanistan. U.S. had to start with something
like 120 and they're up to something close

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:49.530
to 10,000 now. In this area, we start them
with bomb disposal robots, but now we've got

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:57.510
to these flying reapers that launch missiles
and all sorts of stuff like that. So the companies

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.260
that are designing the robots for Iraq and
Afghanistan they are different than Japanese

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.580
companies. Japanese companies who grew like
Toyota, they have created robots that play

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:10.210
the violin and play soccer in the process.
But who really wants a robot to do that? And

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:17.210
also these robots cost millions of dollars,
so they are pretty much completely impractical.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:23.050
The military robots on the other side, on
the other hand, are being designed with cost-effectiveness

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:30.230
and actual usefulness in mind. So that's why
you take a company like IRobots down in Boston,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:34.610
they designed a lot of the bomb disposal robots,
but they also build the Roomba vacuum cleaner.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:42.490
And basically when talking with the company,
the lessons they learned in war, they've applied

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:50.120
to their home robots, which is basically make
it cheap, make it useful otherwise it won't

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.040
sell. So for the next 5-10 years this is going
to have a huge effect on us.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:00.060
One of the' way out their' technologies that
is being worked on is invisibility. Which

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:08.610
sounds like a crackpots talk but scientists
have actually succeeded in making things invisible.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:12.110
And they're doing it using something called
meta-materials, which are materials that are

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:21.290
constructed at microscopic levels. And somehow,
I'm not a scientist so I can't explain it;

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:27.301
this allows them to conduct electromagnetism
in ways that are not naturally found. So actually,

00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:34.040
I have a short video here. Certainly the godfather
of invisibility is a fellow named Sir John

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:40.360
Pendry, British, and I visited him and he
explained how invisibility works. So hopefully

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:47.100
this will work.
[shows video "How does an invisible cloak

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:53.720
work?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnV1PSNJiK8]
[background music from Sir John Pendry video]

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:09.120
&gt;&gt;Sir John Pendry: Now, um, the the way that
the cloak works is that it is very simple

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:22.010
actually. You know, it surprised me that people
were surprised because the principle was so

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:39.320
simple. So you
would have to imagine that lights flowing

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:59.390
like water, imagine it's a fluid, and not,
not really light. And if it were fluid and

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:21.000
you put an obstacle in its way and of course
the light would either bounce off an obstacle,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:35.230
or be absorbed by it if it was blank, but
fluid doesn't do that. Fluid goes round, okay?

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:46.450
And kind of closes up the other side. And
so, when you are a bit downstream, you don't

00:41:46.450 --> 00:42:00.300
know there's an obstacle is there. Of course
the fluid is flowing smoothly again like a

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:12.830
stick in
a stream, or something like that. And that's

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:21.290
the trick that you want light to move like
a fluid. It doesn't normally, but you gotta

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:30.430
make it do that. And if you can, the light
does a kind of chicane around the object you

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.200
are trying to hide. Never hits it, otherwise
it would scatter and you would see the object.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.970
It goes around it. But then, if it just went
off anyplace, you'd actually see a shadow.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:42.400
And you don't want to see that. So to close
out the flow, it's got to come back to its

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.510
original trajectory.
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Right.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:47.280
&gt;&gt;Sir John: And so it's got to do this, like,
chicane around round thing, and that's, that's

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.840
the principle of the cloak. Very, very simple.
There's nothing clever about that. Where the

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840
clever bit comes in, is going from saying,
that you want the light to flow like this

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.840
to saying how can you arrange that?
[background music from Sir John Pendry video]

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.840
Peter: Um, right. And how that happens is
in meta-material that conduct electromagnet

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.840
magnetism in many strange bizarre ways. We're
just starting to look into these things so

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.840
the effects of meta-materials can only be
guessed at right now. But it can lead to some

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.840
pretty amazing stuff.
[video shows new slide titled "Porn" and picture

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840
of a woman clothed in a revealing dress]
So that brings us to porn of course, [pause

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840
while video shows slide with a picture of
a woman, and image of Marilyn Monroe on the

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840
cover of Playboy Magazine with the caption
"Porn=Infidelity and Objectification on bottom

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840
of slide] so again the negatives of porn are
numerous and all around us and we hear about

00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840
them every day. It is seen as a cause for
everything from marital infidelity to objective,

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.840
object, objects, I can't even say it. That
word there.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840
[Pointing at word "Objectification" on slide]
Um, and those are definitely too varying extents,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840
those negatives are definitely true. Um, picture
on the left is actually not a real person

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840
is something called a real doll, which is
a company in California sells. They are basically

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.840
sex dolls. They have steel skeletons with
latex skin and it's apparently very lifelike,

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840
I don't know. [laughter] And anyway they sell
for like $7,000 but anyways, that was the

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840
first issue of Playboy. So the way that the
porn industry can tributes to technological

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840
innovation is a little bit different than
the military or the food industry. [video

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840
shows new slide titled "The early adopters"
with bulleted points listed] They don't really

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.830
have labs with engineers working on stuff.
But they are very much an early adopter. They

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:19.930
often are able to provide people who do you
create the technology with some much-needed

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:24.050
dollars to basically develop their ideas.
Further taking them to a much much larger

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:29.640
mainstream audience. And the reason they are
able to innovate is because they are small

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.390
companies they don't have shareholders to
worry about, they don't have to worry about

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:37.680
quarterly targets and all that stuff. And
of course the last reason they generally have

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.740
tons and tons of money.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.930
[video shows slide titled "The early adopters"
with new bulleted points listed and a picture

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.790
of Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert] So again in
keeping with the theme, there is kind of three

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:51.250
eras of porn and technological development.
The first was the second World War comment

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:58.210
during the war the military, again than American
military had a very strong need to film footage.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.510
Whether it was for training, whether it was
for newsreels back home etc.. So they trained

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.940
a lot of soldiers in how to basically become
amateur moviemakers but they couldn't use

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.100
standard cameras that were being used in Hollywood
because they were just giant huge monstrosities

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:19.050
that just didn't move. So they needed small
portable cameras. So they put a lot of effort

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:24.030
into developing 16mm and 8mm small cameras,
and they standardized these things and made

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:29.260
them really easy to use. And by doing all
that they effectively make them cheaper. So

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.050
what happened after the war is that all these
thousands of soldiers go off into their daily

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:37.820
lives and some of them took their camera skills
and filmed basically some backyard barbecues

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:43.530
or children's birthday parties etc.. But others
decided 'hey I am going to try to go pro.'

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:49.330
And one of the most important guys to do that
is the fellow in that left in that picture,

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:55.360
Russ Meyer. So he was a combat photographer
that was actually part of General George Patton's

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:04.300
brigade. And the fellow to his right, I don't
know if you can recognize him, but that is

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.320
Roger Ebert. They were good buddies. Ebert
actually wrote a few of Russ Meyer's early

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:13.940
movies. And what Meyer did was he kind of
started in 1959 with a movie called "The Immoral

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.410
Mr. Tease." He basically redefined what was
permissible in mainstream film. That film

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:23.860
is basically about a door-to-door salesman
who goes around and has this uncanny knack

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.810
of running into naked women. So a lot of Russ
Meyer's early films were basically soft-core

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:34.230
porn, and it really kind of led to this whole
craze called sexploitation. Which basically

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:43.600
be, were just films that the only point in
them was to actually have sex in them? So,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.610
and of course, interestingly before Russ Meyer
went off to do films, so in between George

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:55.070
Patton and porn he was a photographer for
Playboy. So he's kind of the film equivalent

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:57.600
to Hugh Hefner.
[Long pause, video shows new slide titled

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.910
"Three epochs porn" with bulleted points listed
and an image of the VCR box for the movie

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.340
"Debbie Does Dallas"]
Um, so that of course, that whole market developed.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:11.860
And that is how we got to the home entertainment
era, which kind of started with PT BN, the

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:17.840
VCR. The VCR is probably the best example
in the history of porn technology. It is not

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:24.240
porn technology. In the history of technology
is probably the one thing that is most famous

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.530
for the porn industry's involvement because
when the VCR came out there was a lot of,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:36.040
Hollywood was very nervous about VCRs. They
said they were generally to piracy and they

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.780
actually went out and sued Sony. And so the
lawsuit went on for a number of years. It

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:49.950
is kind of an argument that sounds eerily
similar to downloading today. So who, the

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.550
porn companies, saw this and stepped in to
the void. They saw this and they thought,

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:58.910
hey this is a way to get our products to the
consumer rather than making the consumer come

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:07.570
to us. Which in the late 70s and early 80s
was these shady peep show being next to the

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:14.190
tattoo parlors in the crack part of town.
So they again, this is a case where they would

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:21.550
be early adopters. If you look at a top 10
rental list in the late 70s and early 80s,

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.370
it was dominated by porn movies such as "Debbie
does Dallas."

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:31.050
So the DVD was kind of a repeat. Hollywood
was very nervous about getting into DVDs because

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:37.360
previous similar technologies such as CD-ROM
and video discs flopped. So they were kind

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.150
of gun shy about it, but the porn companies
said "Hey this fantastic; look the picture

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.990
quality on this thing." So they went into
it and again provided an early market for

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.610
DVD makers.
[video shows slide titled "Three epochs porn"

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.220
with new bulleted points listed and images
of a woman.]

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:54.890
And then of course we come to the Internet.
So the Internet, really in the early days

00:47:54.890 --> 00:48:00.260
when it was just text based, and you had the
usenets. In '95 there is a stat there, that

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:06.480
four of the most popular boards were sex related.
Playboy claims that it was the first magazine

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.720
that had a web site in '94. And of course,
it was getting 5 million visits by '97. Which

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.820
in '97 how many internet users were there?
Not that many so if you had 5 million in a

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:24.150
day, that is pretty impressive. Um, and since
you guys all work for an internet company,

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:32.330
I am sure I do not really need to tell you
much more about what kind of numbers porn

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:38.120
usually develops or drives on the internet.
And you know about streaming. One thing that

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.280
isn't well known is the whole idea of affiliate
marketing, which the porn companies came up

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.750
with in the 90s. So, it's a bit of a convoluted
description here but basically if you have

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:53.630
one site over here and the other site over
here. And this site advertised, though no

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:59.200
sorry, and this site you put a link on this
site over here, and somebody clicked on the

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:10.030
link to go to this site; this site here would
pay this site some money. Which sounds kind

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.380
of familiar. [video shows slide titled "Three
epochs porn" with new bulleted points listed

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.020
and images DVD cover.]
So there's this fellow by the name Scott Coffman

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.790
he's the founder of the Adult Entertainment
Broadcast Network one of the most successful

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:22.740
porn companies out there. They say they're
one of the most successful pay-per-view companies

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.800
in or outside of porn because what they did
was… a lot of porn sites would ask people

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.000
to sign up and pay a monthly membership. They
basically did the same thing that they charge

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.500
people by the minute rather than by the month.
And it became huge, huge doing this. And as

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:46.130
he says there, "We didn't just show the way
technology, but also in economics."

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:50.300
Of course, the Internet has come around just
like every other major media industry, it

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:55.610
has come around to bite the porn guys in the
butt, because they are suffering from piracy,

00:49:55.610 --> 00:50:01.520
and free content, and freely available amateur
content. And the downside for them is unlike,

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.590
let's say the music business or the movie
business, they don't have sort of a live component

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:12.520
to fall back on. The music industry you know
bands make a lot of their money from touring,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:18.000
movies make a lot of money from box office,
porn they don't have anything like that so

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:26.830
they're running scared right now.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:30.290
So that brings us to Google and I apologize
for that. [video shows new slide titled "Google"

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:38.940
with image of woman in bikini top spelling
the word "Google" with some of her body parts]

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.940
I apologize for the image. But when I saw
it, I thought…

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.940
[Laughter]
…completely demonic.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.410
So In working on my book I went down to Mountain
View and I talk to a couple of key folks [video

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.369
shows new slide titled "Google Earth" with
new bulleted points listed and images of John

00:50:45.369 --> 00:50:49.880
Hanke] because Google links particularly to
the military in some areas are pretty fascinating

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:55.541
I think. Google Earth is of course one of
them. It arose from something called, if you

00:50:55.541 --> 00:50:59.690
really go back in its history, it arose from
something called the Corona project. Which

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.850
was basically early spy satellites that was
in a satellites and it would take pictures

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:08.920
and they would eject film canisters on parachutes
and then they would fall gently to Earth,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:15.180
and jets would fly by and grab them. Which
seems like a roadrunner cartoon or something.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:20.010
They eventually discontinued because they
thought this is actually really stupid. And

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:24.680
actually they lost with one of their film
canisters, and they detected a Soviet sub

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.690
waiting below the drops zone. And so that
was the end of that. The satellites are used

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:37.520
in the program were called Keyhole. So the
replacement for Corona was Landsat. A program

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:44.380
called Landsat. And that program started to
make satellite imagery programming commercially

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:50.180
available. Coincidentally one of the first
companies to actually buy satellite photography

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:56.240
was McDonald's. But 2001 Keyhole was started
and it was funded by a number of companies

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:03.210
and the CIA it has a venture capital company
called In-Q-Tel, and that company is one of

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:11.710
the main investors in Keyhole. Now Keyhole
of course was acquired by Google and then

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.010
eventually turned into Google Earth and Maps.
And that is John Hanke with Google Earth and

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:24.670
Maps in the photo. So he had a couple of interesting
things to say in terms of links between military

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.560
funding and mainstream technology companies.
I won't read those to you can see it there.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.560
[video shows new slide titled "Keyhole Funding"
with quote]

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:42.590
[Pause]
There are a couple of other things there on

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:55.610
the topic. [pause while video shows new slide
titled "Military Investment" with new bulleted

00:52:55.610 --> 00:53:02.100
points listed] Okay, so one of the other key
links and this is where we venture into a

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.770
little bit of silliness. Does anybody know
who these two are? [video shows new with two

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:12.520
pictures of men, Franz Och and Daniel Greystone]
No? Okay, the guy on the left is Franz Och

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.810
so he is ahead of Google Translate. [video
shows new slide titled "Franz Och" with new

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:20.200
bulleted points listed and picture of Franz
Och] And before he came to he won a DARPA

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:26.430
contest. DARPA sometimes sponsors these crazy
contests, and so he came up with the algorithm

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.860
that basically powers Google translate and
it's something called statistical machine

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.010
translation. Which basically what it does,
it analyzes patterns in language. Previous

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:42.280
attempts at translation, you would just program
the computer with say, English and French

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:47.040
and the computer would try to compare the
grammatical rules. It didn't work very well.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.570
So, the statistical machine translation compares
patterns of the two languages, and it actually

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:51.570
gets pretty good results. I use Translate
all the time. It's pretty cool.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:56.090
So the other guy, a guy named Daniel Greystone,
[video shows new slide titled "Daniel Greystone"

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:01.840
with new bulleted points listed and picture
of Daniel Greystone] he is the main character

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:10.170
in Caprica, which is the prequel to Battle
Star Galactica. The greatest show ever. And

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:15.950
it's kind of funny, because while I was working
on the book, I watched the pilot of Caprica.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:20.680
And so the character's daughter, a girl named
Zoe, she comes up with this algorithm. That

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:26.180
basically takes all of a person's personal
data so credit card records, e-mails, face

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:34.530
book updates, whatever; and it analyzes patterns
in nodes. And basically it can predict a personality

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:40.020
pattern, which I thought the similarities
between how Google translate works and how

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:45.910
this supposed artificial intelligence on the
show work. I thought they were pretty close.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.890
So I asked Franz about it. [video shows new
slide titled "Killer cylon robots" with new

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:53.020
bulleted points listed] Whether Google is
going to create killer cylon robots? And that's

00:54:53.020 --> 00:55:01.520
what he had to say. He in a nutshell, he wasn't
sure if it would create crazy robots that

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:09.930
he did agree that it would definitely create
smarter software. Interestingly, DARPA is

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:16.630
using some of the same techniques now. [sneeze]
All right so, the last couple of things about

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:17.630
the future.

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.630
I actually noticed after the slide together.
[video shows new slide titled "The Future"

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:22.800
with a picture of a man reading a red communist
manifesto book with a bomb blowing up in the

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:31.880
background] The picture on this book on the
left side actually looks a lot like the CBC

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:40.810
logo. [laughter] So ultimately, and one of
the things I tried to point out in the book

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:45.200
is, again, we see the negatives of war, porn,
and that's the around us every day. I tried

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:50.410
to point out a lot of our comforts and conveniences
also come from these three areas. Ultimately,

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:56.670
technology is really in control, and I'm sure
everybody here agrees; what you do with it

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:03.100
is what matters. Now the things to take away
from this is that over the last century it

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.790
has really been the United States that has
driven a lot of this stuff, because the United

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:13.171
States is pretty, it's undisputed that it
has been the technology center of the world.

00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:18.221
But things are changing, and the rest of the
world is developing, and these base instincts

00:56:18.221 --> 00:56:25.270
that we've been talking about are universal.
It doesn't matter what country you live in.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:49.490
People want these three things, and are governed
by these three things. [video shows new slide

00:56:49.490 --> 00:57:01.619
titled "What does it all mean" with new bulleted
points listed] So, if they're going to continue...

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:12.980
Male #2: In contrast, like, Japan went to
a bad [inaudible]. It was a very different

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:22.590
world. If you look at things like Star Trek,
where technology lead you to a utopian future

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:34.460
compared to the Manga in Japan where technology
is seen as evil. So is, like, is war the contrast

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:43.310
between like winning and losing in all it
affects it will? Or… [inaudible].

00:57:43.310 --> 00:58:39.610
Peter: Yeah, I didn't look too much on that
side of things, but I think what I tried to

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:59.810
do is I try to stay focused on the technology.
I did actually in an earlier draft have a

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:16.000
lot more, you know, is this stuff good or
bad for us. But I think. as I went through

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:30.400
my editors and I decided, let's keep this
on technology. I've asked a few times like,

00:59:30.400 --> 01:00:04.471
so are war, porn, and fast food good for us?
But who in their right mind is going to say

01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:13.010
war is good? I don't know, you can't possibly
say it's good, but it's not that black or

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:19.790
white in question. Again the point I try to
stress is that positives do come out of it,

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:25.290
but that's an excellent idea.
And I forgot to repeat your question.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:26.290
[Laughter]

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:33.330
Male #3: [inaudible] In connection with the
local food movement, I'm on the board of directors

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:39.500
for a food link will the region but it's.
We're now finding [inaudible] that we are

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:45.590
really interested in really putting the market
back in to the farmer's hands. What happened

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:54.120
years ago, well the last 30 years the marketing
boards [inaudible] allow big grocery retailers

01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:02.400
to start looking further afield and to the
fields and farmers starting to get [inaudible].

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:13.680
And so I'm hopeful that it isn't just a luxury,
and that's we can all start eating locally

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:21.220
and more healthily. If that's a word. And
you know, in years to come.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:28.750
Peter: So that roughly summarize that. You're
hopeful that we can all start the organically

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:35.000
and locally grown. More of that in the years
to come.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.850
Male #3: Yeah, I think you know, not every
farmer is using, buys into Monsanto.

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:42.850
Peter: Right

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:51.840
Male #3: Man I may know they show this stuff.
When I used to go to agricultural conferences

01:01:51.840 --> 01:02:05.440
they would say here, if you drop a bit of
this yr. that tree in the center of that field,

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.530
it will die.

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.530
Peter: Yeah

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:11.160
Male #3: And it did. It is remarkable.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.230
Peter: Yeah

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:21.380
Male #3: Hopefully we'll be able to modify
foods even if it's strange to protect themselves

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:34.000
from certain things without the use of Monsanto's
chemicals. I think some of the breeding of

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.090
plants and animals
[inaudible] should improve better food as

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:49.050
long as we don't use you know things from
the feed company that

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:50.050
Peter: Right

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:51.400
Male #3: promotes growth unnaturally.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:59.540
Peter: I guess I can reply to that in two
ways. I don't know how many people saw Food

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.430
Inc. [inaudible] have you seen it?

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.690
Male #3: I didn't.

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:09.640
Peter: Well, you should it is probably of
interest to you. One of the most interesting

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:16.740
parts of that movie I found was when he talked
Wal-Mart because Wal-Mart and strangely you

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:22.040
wouldn't think this but they're actually starting
to get into a lot of organic food. They've

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:30.910
got possibly one of the largest organic food
sections, I don't know if that's the case

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:40.290
in Canada, but apparently it is in the US.
But they're doing this, not to be a market

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:47.610
purist, but because there's demand for it,
right? And Wal-Mart getting into it can only

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:54.170
be a positive thing, because that will create
far more demand for organic farmers and performers

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:59.260
to create organically grown foods and use
locally grown foods. And that is going to

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:05.240
bring it down from being a luxury you because
Wal-Mart has a certain business client to

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:12.880
and they don't want to sell expensive foods
so they will want to bring down the cost and

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:19.340
they do that by increasing volume, right?
So, yeah I think, part of your hope I think

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.290
is likely to come true.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.980
Male #3: It's the farmer's hope that says
man I hope [inaudible]

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.730
Peter: Exactly. Yeah, the other thing I'd
say about that thought is people always equates

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:31.730
the technology was bad negative, making food
worse. But there are scientists, the food

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:35.170
scientists that are very aware of this. And
they are working on it. One of the things

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:39.930
I didn't mention one of the developments of
NASA and the US military jointly developed

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:43.430
was something called the retort pouch. And
if you can picture military rations in your

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:48.020
head, they come in sort of aluminum pouches
and these pouches are actually a major development

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:57.210
in food, because what they do is they put
the food in the pouch, and they seal the pouch

01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:05.900
and then they cook it. But because the pouches
are a lot thinner than a can, that is what

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.240
they do with cans previously, but because
the pouch is a lot thinner than a can, they

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.327
don't have to cook the food for as long, which
means that it retains more of its natural

01:05:12.327 --> 01:05:13.327
nutrients, its natural flavors. Which also
means they need to put fewer additives into

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:14.327
the food. And it is also a win for the food
producer because the pouches are a hell of

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.327
a lot cheaper and lighter so therefore cheaper
to ship. So really that is the case where

01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:16.327
everybody is winning

01:05:16.327 --> 01:05:17.327
Male4: That's a long way from sardines [inaudible].

01:05:17.327 --> 01:05:18.327
Peter: Exactly. Any other questions?

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:19.327
Male #5: I wanted to ask, have you had the
chance to review the forces that tried combating

01:05:19.327 --> 01:05:20.327
these tendencies for your book. For example,
there is more and more people who would like

01:05:20.327 --> 01:05:21.327
to eat healthier food and who shop for healthy
food. There is more and more people that want

01:05:21.327 --> 01:05:22.327
to stop wars to minimize it. There is more
and more parents in the world that want to

01:05:22.327 --> 01:05:23.327
protect their children from going to porn
sites and related content. So, what are their

01:05:23.327 --> 01:05:24.327
ongoing efforts? Who undertakes them? What
is their result and outcome in trying to change

01:05:24.327 --> 01:05:25.327
that? It's evident that it's not possible
to, to, to completely remove it because they're

01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.327
our instincts. But there is moderation and
there is control. So, is there anyone doing,

01:05:26.327 --> 01:05:27.327
trying to implement control to make internet
safer and healthier?

01:05:27.327 --> 01:05:28.327
Peter: And that's a very excellent question.
And I'll try to answer in all three areas

01:05:28.327 --> 01:05:29.327
as briefly as I can. In the area of war, I
am not saying this to suck up, but I think

01:05:29.327 --> 01:05:30.327
actually Google is doing a lot. In the realm
of translation, the translation is incredibly

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:31.327
important because once people can communicate
with each other in real time across languages.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:32.327
The Internet opened up communication to peoples
from all over the world, right? The language

01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:33.327
is still a barrier. Once that barrier falls,
once you can communicate in real-time and

01:05:33.327 --> 01:05:34.327
you start getting friends requests on Facebook
from China, if it is hard now for democratic

01:05:34.327 --> 01:05:35.327
country to go to war, it will be a lot more
difficult when its own people are actually

01:05:35.327 --> 01:05:36.327
speaking to and understand the people in the
country they might want to go to war against.

01:05:36.327 --> 01:05:37.327
So that is a very positive development I think.
The development of communications technologies

01:05:37.327 --> 01:05:38.327
of which Translate is one of them is a serious
and major force, antiwar forces and I think

01:05:38.327 --> 01:05:39.327
that that is great.

01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:40.327
In pornography, one of the interesting, I
don't think I put this in the slide show;

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:41.327
one of the interesting motivators for porn
companies to jump on new technology is because

01:05:41.327 --> 01:05:42.327
they are almost always unregulated. So if
you look at now with the Internet, governments

01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:43.327
are only just starting to get to regulate
the Internet and saying okay we need controls

01:05:43.327 --> 01:05:44.327
on this, this sort of content is not acceptable,
etc. etc. And that's about; we've been using

01:05:44.327 --> 01:05:45.327
the Internet now for about 15 years or so,
maybe a little longer. But, so unfortunately

01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:46.327
in the pornography side of things, it's a
cat and mouse thing. Once the government and

01:05:46.327 --> 01:05:47.327
regulators start to prevent or start to take
steps to blocking pornography on the Internet

01:05:47.327 --> 01:05:51.950
their going to move on to the next technology.
What can that be? It maybe robots, sex robots.

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:52.950
[laughter]

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:59.960
As for food, and yes I think there's quite
a bit in the book about, there's a whole chapter

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.430
about genetically modified foods, and the
controversy over them. And there are a lot

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:12.190
of people who, Prince Charles's is probably
the biggest name that opposes genetically

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:21.670
modified foods and his weight in the argument
has largely determined where we're at with

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:26.640
genetically modified food people. A lot of
the resistance in Europe and Africa to those

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.369
seeds is thanks to people like Prince Charles
and also Greenpeace is a very big protester

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:39.090
of them as well. I do mention that. I think,
I don't want to be fatalistic about it, but

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:44.890
I think if you boil down the argument of my
book, is that these forces are kind of inevitable

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:50.280
and so even going back to the issue of war,
stronger communication between people of the

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:55.290
world is going to result in less war .it also
might mean it's going to be a different kind

01:06:55.290 --> 01:07:02.480
of war. So I think one nifty idea is obviously
the US has a lot of military robots now, right?

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.950
What if we get to a point in time that where
war basically equals one country's robots

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:14.770
against another country's robots? That's actually
kind of not a bad war. So, does that answer

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:16.670
your question?
[video shows new slide of cover of book "Sex,

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:19.670
Bombs, and Burgers" with website listed]
Male# 6: [Inaudible] so too, pretty much related

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:25.150
questions [inaudible] one is that the title
of your book, it makes it seem like all three

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:32.890
factors are in equal footing. Is this true?
Or do you think that there is a specific way

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:44.130
that this is [inaudible] say war is a greater
driver of technology than the others? And

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:49.730
a related question is , on observation, that
overall sex and food are ends to themselves,

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.660
and war is more of a means to an end does
that correlate with your [inaudible]?

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.621
Peter: Yes, so the question was, essentially
of Sex, Bombs, and Burgers, are they all on

01:07:56.621 --> 01:08:01.670
equal footing in terms of their influence
or is one more important than the other? And

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:04.680
the second part was?

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:12.530
Male #6: Like, I would imagine that war would
be somehow a second class citizen because

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:13.530
it's only a means to an end…
Peter: Right

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.530
Male #6: where the other ones are direct instincts.
Peter: so direct instincts versus means to

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:22.211
an end. Okay, the first part is easier to
answer. Yeah, pretty clearly war is, the military

01:08:22.211 --> 01:08:29.310
is much, much larger influence than the other
two. Because it's also the common denominator

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:34.380
to the other two as well. As is found in the
book, links between porn and war are pretty

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:41.040
strong. Links between food and war are pretty
strong. You don't find too many links between

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.569
food and sex, strangely…except, for you
know, movies like 9 and half weeks, I don't

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:52.940
know if you've seen it. Anyways, so yeah,
the military definitely does drive, the military

01:08:52.940 --> 01:09:00.339
is a very strong or very serious creator of
technology. The porn industry is very much

01:09:00.339 --> 01:09:08.150
an early adopter of technologies. The food
industry doesn't spend that much on R&amp; D,

01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:13.310
every time they put out a small change, a
small innovation; it has massive, massive

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:17.609
repercussions. And it's so now the second
part of it…

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:24.470
Male #6: Well, you mentioned about how war
there seems to be like the dominate path or

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:26.319
so…
Peter: Yes, Yes, in terms of the title, you

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:31.160
sometimes have to have a catchy title.
[laughter]

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:38.000
Male #6: It's catchy.
Male #7: [inaudible] It's really, but war

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:52.300
isn't but, is it but[inaudible] Sex, [inaudible]
sex and war with the genocide that happens

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:57.310
going into villages [inaudible] raping and
killing, there is a very real, you know, at

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:04.700
that point[inaudible] or together there evil
partners. And then the food. Just like there

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.030
are starving children, [inaudible]and that's
why we work [inaudible].

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:11.740
Peter: Thank you.
Male 8: Okay, thanks everyone for coming.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.700
Let's thank peter for his great talk.
