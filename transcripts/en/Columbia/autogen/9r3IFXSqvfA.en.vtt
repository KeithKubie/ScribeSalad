00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.860
we're at Le'Veon gymnasium at Columbia
University and we're here to play the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.880
annual Columbia community service
charity basketball event.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.180
What we do is, we run a campaign where we try to
gain a certain amount of money from our

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.300
employees so that we can give it out to
different agencies throughout the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.050
throughout the Harlem community. Our goal
is always to raised about three hundred

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.670
and fifty thousand a year, we've been the
last three years we've been making our

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.879
goal and we've been able to provide
monies to different organizations

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.930
organizations that do everything from
after-school programs,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.660
senior citizen programs, Food Pantry-- I
can go down the list.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.080
It's always great to get out here with the colleagues the
guys and the girls and see you know what

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.600
people can do outside of the desk. It's
 it's always fun to get out here and play.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.719
It gives you another purpose, yeah,
when you play for charity they've been

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.360
playing the summer for the last five
years six years since I've been at the University

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.520
There's a lot of enthusiasm
because they enjoy you know getting

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
together and competing against their
fellow employees as well as having an

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.100
opportunity to raise money for Columbia
community service
