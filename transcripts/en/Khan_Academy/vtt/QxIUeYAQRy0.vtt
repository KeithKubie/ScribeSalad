00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.810
In this video, not only are we
going to pay attention to how

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.800
these two molecules will react,
but we'll also pay

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.500
attention to the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.560
stereochemistry of the end product.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.040
To do that, we have to
pay attention to the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.460
stereochemistry of the things
that we're beginning with.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.110
And this is just regular
hydroxide anion, we've seen

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.200
this show before.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
This is going to act
as the nucleophile.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.940
It's not the strongest
nucleophile.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.750
it's not iodide, but it's a
pretty good nucleophile.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.560
So we have a good nucleophile
here.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.210
And then over here,
we have a carbon.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.790
It's not a methyl carbon.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.130
It's not bonded to a
bunch of hydrogens.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.790
That would be a super
fast Sn2 reaction.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.970
This guy could attack it.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.900
And it's not even a primary,
it's a secondary.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.860
But we said if we have a pretty
good nucleophile, this

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.310
guy's going to want to give his
electrons enough to that,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.230
that this will happen.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.150
It won't be the fastest
reaction, but we can get an

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.230
Sn2 reaction, especially if the
solvent is the right type

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.800
of solvent.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.650
And we'll talk more about this
in future videos on what type

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.200
of solvents are good for Sn2
reactions versus Sn1.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.410
So we're going to have
an Sn1 reaction.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.570
We're going to have this
situation where one of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.210
electrons from the nucleophile
will be given to this

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.180
secondary carbon.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.820
It's bonded to two
other carbons.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.770
So it'll be given to the
secondary carbon, and then

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.840
that will allow this bromine
to swipe the carbon that it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.370
was a bonded with.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.410
And we know bromine is pretty
electronegative, so it's going

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.760
to do that.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.960
It's going to swipe
that electron.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.370
And then at the end, you're
going to end up with a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.130
bromine, or I should say bromide
now that it's an

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.890
anion, a bromide anion.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.300
It swiped that electron.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.520
Before bromine had one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.510
valence electrons, and now it's
going to swipe this one

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.080
over here, so now it'll have
eight: one, two, three, four,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.160
five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.280
Put a negative charge, it
just gained an electron.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.960
And then the other stuff
will look like this.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.050
Let me draw that carbon in the
center, that's just like this.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.310
And notice, bromine is leaving
from the right, and the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.120
hydroxide is attacking, or it's
giving its electron from

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.550
the left, or it's bonding
from the left.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.080
So what's it going to look?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.380
Well, We have this ethyl group
coming straight out

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:36.140
forward, CH2, CH3.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.690
We have the hydrogen that
is still going to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.210
be behind the carbon.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.010
So I could draw it like this.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.460
The bromine is no
longer there.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.910
You still have this
methyl group above

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.060
it, so that is CH3.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.930
And now this hydroxide has
attacked right in the same

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.300
direction that the bromine is
leaving in, but from the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.950
opposite side.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.640
So that's leaving to the right,
this guy's entering

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.840
from the left, so then
the hydroxide will be

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.990
bonded like this: O-H.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.510
Now we have just described
a classic Sn2 reaction.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.650
And I always like to emphasize
the Sn2, because my brain

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.350
always confuses it with Sn1,
so I like to remind myself,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.680
this is Sn2 because it is
substitution with a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.880
nucleophile.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.790
That's the hydroxide
in this case.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.740
And that number two says the
rate-determining step, and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.080
there is only one step in this
reaction, involves both of the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.990
reactants, and this definitely
is involving both of the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.020
reactants, so this
is a classic Sn2.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.960
The point of this video is to
see what happened to the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.930
stereochemistry of
this molecule.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.205
Obviously, it's a different
molecule on this side, but it

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.780
had switched from left to right,
or I guess we should

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.510
say that it switched from R to
S, or S to R, or did it stay

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.300
in the same direction?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.210
So let's name this one using our
naming mechanisms. I guess

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.240
you could call it the
R-S naming scheme.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.050
And then we'll name this one,
and then we'll see if we

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.770
switched our handedness.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.120
So first of all, let's just
name the base molecule.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.170
This is good review.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.550
So what's our longest
carbon chain?

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.670
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.240
And actually, I probably
shouldn't have named it that

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.160
way, because this bromo group
is closer to that end.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.460
So I should number it
starting from here.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.450
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.150
So methyl is one carbon.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.370
Ethyl is two carbons.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.730
Propyl is three carbons, or
prop- is three, so it's but-,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.780
But- is four carbons, so
it's going to but-.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.945
It's all single bond, so it's
going to be a butane.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.355
And on the number two carbon, we
have a bromo group, so it's

00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:56.605
2-bromobutane.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.620
And this is a chiral carbon,
so we have to describe it's

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.090
handedness.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.420
And we know it's a chiral
carbon, because everything

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.620
it's bonded to is different.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.000
It's bonded to two carbons,
but this is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.260
a whole ethyl group.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.100
There's two carbons here.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.600
There's only one over there,
and obviously, it's a

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.700
hydrogen, and that's
a bromine.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.280
So what's it's handedness?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.130
And to do that, you want to
put the group that has the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.630
lowest atomic number
in the back.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.260
And we know hydrogen has the
lowest atomic number, so it's

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.290
already in the back.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.110
So that's convenient.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.250
We don't have to do any
visualization of how you

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.130
rotate it, so you put
it in the back.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.480
So that's already in the back.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.570
So what we have in the
front is this guy,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.130
this guy, this guy.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.550
And what you do is you start
with the guy with the highest

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.260
atomic number, and that would
be bromine right there.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.630
And then you go in a circle in
the direction of the next

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.930
highest atomic number.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.790
Carbon and carbon is a tie.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.305
The tie breaker is that
this carbon is

00:05:57.305 --> 00:05:58.390
bonded to another carbon.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.530
Well, this carbon is only
bonded to hydrogens.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.330
So you're going to go in this
direction right here.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.150
You're going to go clockwise.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.790
Let me do that in
another color.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.190
You are going to go clockwise.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.060
And the way I like to think
about is, on top, we're going

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.500
to the right.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.480
We're going clockwise,
so this is R.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.460
S is to the left for sinister,
R for the right.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.250
That's the way I think of it.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.505
So this is R-2-bromobutane.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.070
So it's handedness is R.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.690
Now, what's this thing
over here?

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.000
Well, first of all, once again
we have four carbons.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.330
We have one, two, three,
four carbons, so

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.100
but- will be our prefix.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.210
But since the group that we
are attached to is an OH

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.240
group, it's a hydroxide group,
this is actually an alcohol.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.810
So this a little bit of practice
of naming alcohols.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.955
So we still have but-
as our prefix.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.840
But we wouldn't call
it butane.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.050
Since it has an OH there,
we'll call it butanol.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:17.150
And maybe I'll write that in
blue to show the -anol comes

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.970
from the OH.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.450
Butanol, or maybe we could say
the -ol comes from-- maybe

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.170
that's even better.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.420
Let me just write butanol.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.640
That's a different color.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.020
But- -an- and then the -ol comes
from the fact that we

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.050
have the OH there.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.050
We're dealing with an alcohol.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.250
And it's attached to the number
two carbon, so we'll

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.500
call it 2-butanol.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.350
So we went from having
2-bromobutane to 2-butanol,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.220
but what is the handedness
of this?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.750
So same exercise, you put
the lowest atomic

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.200
number in the back.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.980
That's the hydrogen.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.200
It's already in the back.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.200
And then you start with the atom
or the group that has the

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.520
highest atomic number of the
things that are bonded to this

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.570
chiral carbon.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.300
It's still chiral.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.990
All of these things
are different.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.980
You start with whatever has
the highest atomic number.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.410
This oxygen has the highest
atomic number.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.865
And you go in the direction of
the next highest. This carbon

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:17.560
and that carbon are tied, but
this one is also attached to

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.260
other carbons.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.230
Well, this is attached only to
hydrogens, so we go in this

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.040
direction, or counterclockwise,
or in the

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.120
sinister direction, or the
leftward direction.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.650
So this is S, S for sinister.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.480
S-2-butanol.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.640
So the whole point of this video
is to show you that when

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:44.270
you have an Sn2 reaction on a
chiral carbon, that it changes

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.220
the carbon's stereochemistry.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.550
It changes its handedness.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.830
It went from being right-handed
to left-handed.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.750
It changes its chirality.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.000
You can even imagine a situation
where a bromine

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.070
comes and attacks, and
this bromine leaves.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.830
And then you would actually have
the same 2-bromobutane,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.180
but it would actually switch
its handedness.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.290
This is super important, because
this matters if you

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.390
care whether or not you
want to flip the

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.680
stereochemistry or not.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.440
What we're going to see in the
next video, or maybe the video

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.520
after that, is that in Sn1
reactions, not only do you not

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.390
flip your stereochemistry, that
you kind of lose-- if all

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.670
of your molecules were
one-handedness, your end

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.900
product is going to be a mix of
the two handedness when you

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.210
do an Sn1 reaction.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.030
But Sn2, you flip
the handedness.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.570
You saw here.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.910
We started with R-2-bromobutane.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.470
The Sn2 reaction happened.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.280
We ended up with S.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.420
It makes complete sense.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.790
You view this as coming from the
back, so you view this as

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.090
kind of an umbrella.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.540
This was kind of an
upturned umbrella.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540
This was the handle.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.480
And when this comes in, he
becomes the handle, and the

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.770
umbrella flips in
that direction.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.050
So that's one way to
think about it.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.500
So visually, it also should make
a little bit of sense.
