00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.052
Every human being starts out the same way:

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:17.802
two cells, one from each parent,

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:19.619
found each other and became one.

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:21.395
And that one cell reproduced itself,

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.917
dividing, dividing and dividing

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.054
until there were 10 trillion of them.

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:28.999
Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:31.035
than there are stars in the Milky Way?

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.344
But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.152
That would make for a pretty
boring human being!

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:40.247
So what is it that says a nose is a nose,

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.524
and toes is toes?

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:43.265
What is it that says this is bone

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.618
and this is brain

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:45.793
and this is heart

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:48.443
and this is that little thing
in the back of your throat

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.157
you can never remember the name of?

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.189
Everything you are or ever will be made of

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:53.991
starts as a tiny book of instructions

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:55.419
found in each and every cell.

00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:57.549
Every time your body
wants to make something,

00:00:57.573 --> 00:00:59.350
it goes back to the instruction book,

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:00.994
looks it up and puts it together.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:04.116
So how does one cell hold
all that information?

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.291
Let's get small.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.383
I mean, really small --
smaller than the tip of a sewing needle.

00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:10.634
Then we can take a journey
inside a single cell

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.058
to find out what makes up the book of you,

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.594
your genome.

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:17.548
The first thing we see
is that the whole genome, all your DNA,

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.694
is contained inside
its own tiny compartment,

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:20.869
called the nucleus.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:24.198
If we stretched out all the DNA
in this one cell into a single thread,

00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:25.761
it would be over 3 feet long!

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.270
We have to make it fit
in a tiny compartment

00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:30.110
that's a million times smaller.

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:32.428
We could just bunch it up
like Christmas lights,

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:33.726
but that could get messy.

00:01:34.173 --> 00:01:35.667
We need some organization.

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.205
First, the long thread of DNA
wraps around proteins

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.683
clustered into little beads
called nucleosomes,

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:43.282
which end up looking
like a long, beaded necklace.

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:46.118
And that necklace
is wrapped up in its own spiral,

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:47.436
like an old telephone cord.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.865
And those spirals get layered
on top of one another

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.856
until we get a neat little shape
that fits inside the nucleus.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.918
VoilÃ ! Three feet of DNA
squeezed into a tiny compartment.

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:58.870
If only we could hire DNA
to pack our suitcases!

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:02.974
Each tiny mass of DNA
is called a chromosome.

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:05.111
The book of you would have 46 chapters,

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:06.521
one for each chromosome.

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.609
Twenty-three chapters of your book
came from your mom,

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.609
and 23 chapters came from your dad.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:13.723
Two of those chapters, called "X" and "Y,"

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:15.234
determine if you're male, "XY,"

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:16.534
or female, "XX."

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:18.447
Put them together, and we get

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.939
two almost identical but slightly
different sets of 23 chapters.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:24.772
The tiny variations are what makes
each person different.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.332
It's estimated
that all the chapters together

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.652
hold about 20,000 individual
instructions, called genes.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:32.677
Written out, all those 20,000 instructions

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.981
are 30 million letters long!

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.167
If someone were writing
one letter per second,

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.040
it would take them almost
an entire year to write it once.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:43.003
It turns out that our genome book
is much, much longer

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:44.852
than just those 30 million letters --

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:46.705
almost 100 times longer!

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:48.974
What are all those extra pages for?

00:02:48.998 --> 00:02:52.233
Well, each page of instructions
has a few pages of nonsense inserted

00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:55.320
that have to be taken out
before we end up with something useful.

00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:57.702
The parts we throw out, we call introns.

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:00.042
The instructions we keep, we call exons.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.093
We can also have hundreds
of pages in between each gene.

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.038
Some of these excess pages were inserted

00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:07.165
by nasty little infections
in our ancestors,

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.038
but some of them are actually helpful.

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.313
They protect the ends of each chapter
from being damaged,

00:03:12.337 --> 00:03:15.491
or some help our cells find
a particular thing they're looking for,

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:17.981
or give a cell a signal
to stop making something.

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:20.874
All in all, for every page
of instructions,

00:03:20.898 --> 00:03:22.863
there's almost 100 pages of filler.

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:26.025
In the end, each of our books' 46 chapters

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.517
is between 48 and 250
million letters long.

00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:33.411
That's 3.2 billion letters total!

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:35.181
To type all that copy,

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:37.037
you'd be at it for over 100 years,

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.006
and the book would be
over 600,000 pages long.

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.796
Every type of cell carries the same book,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.328
but each has a set of bookmarks

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:47.447
that tell it exactly which pages
it needs to look up.

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.054
So a bone cell reads only the set
of instructions it needs to become bone.

00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:52.280
Your brain cells,

00:03:52.304 --> 00:03:54.850
they read the set that tells them
how to become brain.

00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:58.049
If some cells suddenly decide
to start reading other instructions,

00:03:58.073 --> 00:04:00.971
they can actually change
from one type to another.

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:04.244
So every little cell in your body
is holding on to an amazing book,

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.528
full of the instructions for life.

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:08.176
Your nose reads nose pages,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.174
your toes read toes pages.

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:12.499
And that little thing
in the back of your throat?

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.038
It's got its own pages, too.

00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:15.212
They're under "uvula."
