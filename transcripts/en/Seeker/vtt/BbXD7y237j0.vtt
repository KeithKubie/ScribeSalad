00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.069
if there was an Olympics for engineering
this would be it

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.330
we're just outside Los Angeles
California at the Hyperloop pod

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.350
competition some of the brightest minds
from around the world are here to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.630
impress this guy Elon Musk for the teams
at the Hyperloop competition Elon Musk

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.009
is the man he's the visionary behind the
Hyperloop and the leader of some of the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
most innovative companies in existence
Tesla SpaceX and most recently the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.370
boring company which is anything but
Elon Musk's futuristic transportation

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
system could change the way we travel
the Hyperloop intends to propel

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
passengers through a low pressure vacuum
tube at speeds up to 700 miles per hour

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
so you'll be able to travel from San
Francisco to Los Angeles in about 30

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
minutes which is faster than a plane
ride we're capable of doing this this is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.129
not you know just a pipe dream no pun
intended

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.030
Johnny is a member of Bajor loop which
is named after University of Wisconsin's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.619
mascot the team was one of the youngest
that competed in the first Hyperloop pod

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.020
competition Elon Musk launched the
competition to encourage citizen

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
engineers and students to design and
build their own prototype pods so in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.110
2016 hundreds of teams from universities
and private institutions around the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
world submitted their pod designs SpaceX
selected 30 designs to be built and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.220
tested at the competition
we proved ourselves that in competition

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
one that we could hang with these
extremely impressive programs from

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:55.710
around the world Badger loop had a goal
of getting their pod into hyper loops

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.780
3/4 of a mile vacuum chamber test track
there's a very rigorous series of tests

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.070
that you need to pass before you can get
into the full vacuum chamber and we were

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.550
extremely close on the last one but some
electrical issues kept us from getting

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.090
in
well the Badgers fell short they did

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:21.150
make an impression our earth innovation
award goes to badger Lube SpaceX gave

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
their pod an Innovation Award proving
their design had potential so as all

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.230
good underdog stories go the team is
back in there looking for redemption we

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.680
are getting that too this time we're not
taking no for an answer and we got to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.729
make sure that we do everything we can
now to prepare and to get in that to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.100
the rebooted Badgers are young scrappy
and yes hungry in more ways than one

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.420
johnny is the team's operations director
overseeing the team leads who are in

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.080
charge of building the different parts
of the pie Arjun is our breaking lead

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.920
and he's in charge of a small team
that's designing our break system that's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.770
gonna have the incredibly fun task of
stopping within a matter of seconds

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.530
ongoing you know well over 200 miles per
hour and not blowing up SpaceX's 12 and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.800
a half a million dollar tubes so good
luck with that Arjun yes Janu yeah clay

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.480
is new to the team the semester he's our
propulsion lead and he took on this

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.370
challenge knowing very little about
thermal dynamics then there's Justin

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.720
leading structural analysis Nathan on
composites max on batteries Ryan is on

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.590
controls Vaughn is the electrical and
software director Ben is on stability

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.330
chris is on structural design ends up as
the team's president and that's not even

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.110
all the team leads there are about 30
people working to make this pot a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.620
success

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.770
Hyperloop pods for competition - are
designed with the same goal in mind

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.330
speed in order for their pod to reach
over 200 miles per hour in the low

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.470
pressure vacuum tube the Badgers are
going to need a powerful propulsion

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.880
system so the system that we have for
propulsion is coal gas thruster which

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.330
employs basic jet propulsion principles
by accelerating gas across a nozzle

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.960
it works like this
two high-pressure tanks filled with

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.000
nitrogen gas empty about 90% of their
mass over the course of 3 seconds as the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.669
gas exits it converts thermal and
pressure energy into kinetic energy the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.110
challenge is who can go the fastest and
still stop arjen's team designed a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.889
primary and secondary braking system
that will hopefully do just that and

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.789
then the badger's electrical team
created code that will enable the pod to

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:08.110
operate autonomously in the tube but the
crazy thing is after seven months of

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.280
non-stop work in Wisconsin the team
won't be able to fully test their pod

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.509
until they get here the SpaceX
headquarters in Hawthorne California for

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.979
the Hyperloop pod competition the week
before competition weekend we call a

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.900
testing week I believe there's around 60
or so tests that SpaceX has for us to

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:35.889
pass the end of the tube after a week of
pulling all-nighters at a local garage

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.150
getting the pod competition ready the
team needs to wrap up because it's time

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.219
to roll literally in the ultimate
display of teamwork the Badgers push

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.990
their 500 pound pod half a mile down the
street to the SpaceX campus to undergo

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.420
the final round of tests
there are 24 teams competing this year

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.950
made up of members representing more
than 30 different countries and only the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.520
teams that pass all of spacex tests get
approved to go in the low-pressure

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.750
vacuum tube but it's a race against the
clock even if you pass all your tests if

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.169
you aren't one of the first to do so
there's a good chance you won't get into

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.040
the tube there just isn't enough time
for all the teams to complete the final

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.919
test which is an open-air run being a
few minutes late - one thing can add you

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.310
know four or five hours of us getting
kicked back in line and waiting for

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.780
something and unfortunately that's
exactly what happened to the Badgers a

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.100
series of small technical setbacks meant
that they miss their window of time of

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.660
the six teams that completed open air
run space extras through to race in the

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.460
main event on competition day paradigm
Swiss loop in the returning speed champs

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.430
bar from Germany it was a bittersweet
day for our team but when bar broke 200

00:06:51.430 --> 00:07:00.520
miles per hour in the tube the Badgers
were there cheering alone but it wasn't

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.090
all over for the Badgers SpaceX
announced that it would give out three

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.900
Innovation Awards this year and winning
one of them would give the team a slice

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.700
of redemption for their propulsion
system which we hope to see next year in

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.180
the Hyperloop competition badger loop
the University

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.830
we were over the moon I mean everyone
was hugging and celebrating and it was a

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.000
perfect ending of this trip

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:31.530
you don't really believe that you can be
amongst this company and be doing these

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.689
things until you find yourself here and
like wow this is really happening here

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.129
and in the future if the Hyperloop does
revolutionize transportation around the

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:45.580
world the Badgers will always be able to
say they helped make it possible

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.490
