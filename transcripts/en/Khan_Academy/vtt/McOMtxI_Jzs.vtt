00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.921
- [Voiceover] So we have a
nice little equation here

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.612
dealing with rational expressions.

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:05.242
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.988
and see if you can figure
out what values of x

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:10.947
satisfy this equation.

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:12.637
Alright, let's work through this together.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.690
So the first thing I'd like to do

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.803
is just see if I can simplify this at all,

00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:19.278
and maybe by finding some common factors

00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:21.028
between numerators and denominators,

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:23.956
or common factors on either
side of the equal sign.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.850
So let's factor all of the
numerators and the denominators.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.144
All the ones on the right-hand
side are already done.

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:31.925
So this thing up here,

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.370
I could rewrite this as, let's see.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.845
What's product is 21?

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:38.958
What two numbers, when I
take their product, is 21?

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.252
Positive 21, so they're
going to have the same sign.

00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:43.959
And when I add them, I get negative 10.

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.438
Well, negative seven and negative three,

00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:46.434
so this could be rewritten

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:51.022
as x minus seven times x minus three.

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:53.005
This over here, both
are divisible by three.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:57.382
I could rewrite this as
three times x minus four.

00:00:57.382 --> 00:00:59.072
And these are already factored.

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:01.085
So the one thing that
jumps out at me is I have

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:05.060
x minus four in the denominator
on the left-hand side

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.505
and on the right-hand side.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.067
And so, if I were to multiply
both sides by x minus four.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:12.788
So actually, let me just...

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:16.470
Let me formally replace this with that.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.613
And up here, it's not so obvious

00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:20.002
that it's going to be valuable for me

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.451
to keep this factored form.

00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:23.775
So I'm just going to keep
it in this yellow form.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.231
In the expanded out form.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.796
So let me just scratch that out for now,

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.275
because once I,

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:32.178
well, let me multiply by x minus four.

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:35.438
So, if we multiply both
sides by x minus four,

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:36.826
and once again, why am I doing this?

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.935
Just so I get rid of the x
minus four in the denominators.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:44.855
x minus four, and then x minus four.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:47.059
That and that cancels.

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:48.811
That and that cancels,

00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.773
and then we're left
with, in the numerator,

00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:55.773
we're left with our x
squared minus 10 x plus 21,

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:00.976
and, let's see, divided by three.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:03.572
Divided by three

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:07.133
is equal to x minus five.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.703
Let's see, now, what we can do,

00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:10.333
and actually I could have
done it in the last step,

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.835
is I can multiply both sides by three.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.525
Multiply both sides.

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:16.551
Do that in another color

00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:18.755
just so it sticks out a little more.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:22.830
So I can multiply both sides by three.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.392
So multiply both sides by three.

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:28.957
On the left-hand side,
that and that cancels,

00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:33.957
and I'll just be left with x
squared minus 10 x plus 21,

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:37.409
and on, and I don't have
a denominator any more.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.824
My denominator is one, so
I don't need to write it.

00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:41.757
Is going to be equal to three times,

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:43.719
let's just distribute the three.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.803
Three times x is three x.

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:50.089
Three times negative five is negative 15.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.223
And now I can get this into
standard quadratic form

00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:55.000
by getting all of these terms
onto the left-hand side.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.701
The best way to do that,

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.026
let's subtract three x from the right,

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:00.112
but I can't just do it from the right

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:01.531
otherwise the equality won't held.

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:04.217
I have to do it from both sides
if I want equality to hold.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.055
And, I want to get rid
of this negative 15,

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.460
so I can add 15 to both sides.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.825
So, let's do that.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.692
And what we are left with,
scroll down a little bit,

00:03:14.692 --> 00:03:17.270
so let's have a little more space.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.232
What we are going to be left with

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:24.083
is x squared minus 13 x

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.304
and then plus,

00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:30.828
what is this, plus 36.

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:33.603
Plus 36. Did I do that right?

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:35.625
Yep, plus 36

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:40.472
is equal to, is equal to zero.

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.944
Alright, now let's see,
we have it as a quadratic

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:45.211
in the standard form.

00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:46.695
How can we solve this?

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:48.023
So first thing, can we factor this.

00:03:48.023 --> 00:03:50.196
Product of two numbers, 36.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.705
If I add them, I get negative 13.

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:52.943
They're both going to be negative,

00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:54.041
since they have to have the same sign

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.486
to get their product to be positive.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.866
And, let's see, nine and
four seem to do the trick.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.070
So, or negative nine and negative four.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.386
So, x minus four times x minus nine

00:04:06.386 --> 00:04:08.278
is equal to zero.

00:04:08.278 --> 00:04:09.274
Well, that's going to happen

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:13.834
if either x minus four is equal to zero or

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:17.656
x minus nine is equal to zero.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.256
We'll add four to both sides of this.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.852
This happens when x is equal to four.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:23.211
Add nine to both side of this.

00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:25.938
This happens when x is equal to nine.

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:27.709
So we could say that the solutions are

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:30.909
x equals four or x equals nine.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:35.909
So, x is equal to four, or x equals nine.

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:37.821
But we need to be careful.

00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:38.968
Because we have to remember,

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.538
in our original expression,

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:43.647
x minus four was a factor
of both denominators.

00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:45.216
And so if we actually try to test

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:47.208
x minus four in the original equation,

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:48.506
not one of these intermediary steps,

00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:50.806
the original equation, I would end up

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.805
dividing by zero right over here,

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:56.147
and actually, I'd end up by
zero right over there as well.

00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:58.099
So the original equations, if
I tried to substitute four,

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.850
they don't make sense.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.993
So this is actually an
extraneous solution.

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:04.891
It's not going to be a solution
to the original equation.

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:09.459
The only solution is x is equal to 9.
