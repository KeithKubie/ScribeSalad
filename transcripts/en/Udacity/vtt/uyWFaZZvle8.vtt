00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.250
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.620
We're going to continue our
conversation on segmentation.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.510
Last time we,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.910
we introduced it as segmentation
as a clustering in feature space.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.250
And feature space could include
things like position, so

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.210
you might get nice segments that
are localized, within an image.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.110
This time we're going to look at, some
better algorithms than say, k-means.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.430
And then also some better,
or I should say,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.300
some more extended feature spaces which
allow us to do better segmentation.
