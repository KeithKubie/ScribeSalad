00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.600
- [Instructor] Jules works on
a small team of 40 employees.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.180
Each employee receives an annual rating,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.570
the best of which is exceeds expectations.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.670
Management claimed that 10%
of employees earn this rating,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.650
but Jules suspected it
was actually less common.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.910
She obtained an anonymous
random sample of 10 ratings

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.950
for employees on her team.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.920
She wants to use the sample
data to test her null hypothesis

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.530
that the true proportion is 10% versus

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.630
her alternative hypothesis
that the true proportion

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.940
is less than 10%, where p is
the proportion of all employees

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.260
on her team who earned
exceeds expectations.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.360
Which conditions for
performing this type of test

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.630
did Jules' sample meet?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.820
And when they're saying which conditions,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.360
they are talking about
the three conditions,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
the random condition,
the normal condition,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.390
and we've seen these before,
and the independence condition.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.300
So I will let you pause the video now

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.940
and try to figure this out on your own

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.580
and then we will review
each of these conditions

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.310
and think about whether
Jules' sample meets

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.800
the conditions that we need to feel good

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.980
about some of our significance testing.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.350
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.170
So let's just remind ourselves
what we're going to do

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.090
in a significance test.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.230
We have our null hypothesis.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.110
We have our alternative hypothesis.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.030
What we do is we look at the population.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.160
The population size, there's
40 employees on staff

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.150
at this company.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.310
We take a sample,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420
in Jules' case she took
a sample size of 10,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.820
and then we calculate a sample statistic,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.230
in this case it is a sample proportion

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.030
which is equal to, let's
just call it p hat sub one.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.890
And then we want to calculate a p-value.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.080
And just as a bit of review,
a p-value is the probability

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.500
of getting a result at
least as extreme as this one

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.090
if we assume our null hypothesis is true.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420
And in this particular
case, because she suspects

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.890
that not 10% are getting
the exceeds expectations,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.510
this would be the probability
of your sample statistic

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.510
being less than or equal to the
one that you just calculated

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.380
for a sample size of n equals 10,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.060
given that your null hypothesis is true.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
And if this p-value is less

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
than your predetermined
significance level,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.300
maybe that's 5% or 10%,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.920
but you'd want to decide
that ahead of time,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.800
then you would reject your null hypothesis

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.380
because this, the probability
of getting this result,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.120
seems pretty low, in which case

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.290
it would suggest the alternative.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.000
But then if the p-value
is not less than this,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.360
then you wouldn't be able to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.120
But the key thing, and
this is what this question

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.410
is all about, in order to feel
good about this calculation,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.810
we need to make some assumptions

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.270
about the sampling distribution.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.610
We have to assume that
it's reasonably normal,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.100
that it can actually be used
to calculate this probability,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.720
and that's where these
conditions come into play.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.430
The first is the random condition,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.630
and that's that the data
points in this sample

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.500
were truly randomly selected.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.370
So pause this video.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.410
Did she meet the random condition?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.540
Well, it says she obtained
an anonymous random sample

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.490
of 10 ratings of employees on her team.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.630
They don't say how she did
it, but we'll take their word

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.830
for it that it was an
anonymous random sample,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.280
so she meets the random condition.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.670
Now what about the normal condition?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.830
The normal condition tells
us that the expected number

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.840
of successes, which
would be our sample size

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.500
times the true proportion,
and the number of failures,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.580
sample size times one minus p,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.460
need to be at least equal to 10.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.670
So they need to be greater
than or equal to 10.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.840
Now what are they for
this particular scenario?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.700
Well, n is equal to 10,

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:57.780
and our true proportion,
remember we're going to assume

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.960
when do the significance test,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.470
we assume the null hypothesis is true,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.370
and the null hypothesis tells us

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.690
that our true proportion is 0.1.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.400
So this is 0.1, this is
one minus 0.1 which is 0.9.

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:14.010
Well, 10 times 0.1 is one,
so that's not greater than

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.920
or equal to 10.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.680
So just off of that, we don't
meet the normal condition.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.220
But even the second one,
10 times 0.9 is nine.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.930
That's also not greater
than or equal to 10,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.590
so we don't meet this normal condition.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.240
We can't feel good that
the sampling distribution

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.960
is roughly normal,
which we normally assume

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.440
when we're trying to make
this type of calculation.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.540
And then last but not least, independence.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.060
Independence is to feel good
that each of the data points

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.760
in your sample are independent.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
The results of whether they
are a success or a failure

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.610
is independent of each other.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.120
Now if she was surveying
these people with replacement,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.260
if each data point was with replacement,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.760
you would definitely meet
this independence condition.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.020
But she didn't do it with replacement,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.360
but there's another way to go about it.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.570
You could use your 10% rule.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.940
If your sample size is less than 10%

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.040
of the population size,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.010
then it's okay, it's
considered roughly okay,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.260
that you didn't do it with replacement.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.870
But her sample size here is
25%, clearly greater than 10%,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.320
and so she does not meet the
independence condition either.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.640
And so if she went and
tried to calculate this,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.810
assuming a indicative
sampling distribution

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.620
that is roughly normal,
I would not feel so good

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.490
about her results 'cause she didn't meet

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.380
two of these three conditions.
