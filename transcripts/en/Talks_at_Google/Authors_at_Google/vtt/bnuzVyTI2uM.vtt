MONICA POLETTI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.330
Thanks for coming.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.160
Today our speaker is Conrad
Anker, climber, mountaineer,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.250
author.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.020
He's summited
Everest three times.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.450
The first time
discovering the body

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.200
of George Mallory,
British climber who

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.550
went missing 75 years
earlier before you found him.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.940
Is that correct?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.300
Third time without using
supplemental oxygen.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.560
You might know him from
really beautifully documented

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.660
first ascent of Shark's Fin
on Meru Peak, and he also,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660
in addition to being a
great outdoorsman, really

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.020
likes the mountain community
and working on it, promoting it,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.240
and founded the Khumbu
Climbing Center in Nepal

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.200
in 2003 with his wife and
continues to do really good

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.000
work there promoting
responsible, safe mountain

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.760
climbing.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090
And today we're going to
hear him talk about Everest.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.210
So Conrad, welcome.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.698
Thank you for being here.

00:00:58.698 --> 00:00:59.694
Floor's all yours.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:05.172
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.730
CONRAD ANKER: Thank you,
Monica, for the introduction.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.030
That's one of the better ones.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.150
Sometimes people go to Google.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870
They pull up Conrad Anker,
and they'll sit there,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.370
and they'll read off of it for--
I mispronounced it or anything.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.200
You did a great-- keeping
it subtle and understated.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.510
Sunil, thank you so much
for being a host here.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.950
I really appreciate
everything you've done

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.680
and the chance to
revisit the Google

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.220
campus 10 years after the
first time I came and spoke

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120
to Google climbers, and
there's more people here,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.720
more people doing great
things, more people

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.860
sharing their passion
for knowledge and science

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.890
with the greater world.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.030
And to Mike, who is the AV
guy here, thank you so much.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.750
So all of you guys
are really wonderful.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.620
So today we will
delve into Everest.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.540
So it's kind of Everest season
as it is, and people always

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.670
speak about Everest
this time of year.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.030
It's the time of year that
people are always on there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.509
to go climbing.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.550
As Monica mentioned, I
have a special connection.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.889
I've been there three times
on three climbing expeditions,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.550
and then also
subsequent expeditions

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.100
where I've worked
with media, but to set

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.700
the stage from an earth
sciences standpoint--

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.500
and I like Earth sciences--
Mount Everest, or Chomolunga,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.780
as is known in Tibetan
Sherpa language,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.140
or Sagarmatha, as it
is known in Nepal,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.420
is a result of plate tectonics
in the Indian subcontinent

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.050
moving northward at about the
speed our fingernails grow,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.470
which, if you're
a fan of geology,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.850
that's supersonic speed.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.700
It's moving really fast.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.780
And all that effort of the
Indian plate moving northward

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.560
and subducting into
the Asian land mass

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.520
has created the Himalayas,
and Everest itself

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.600
is a relatively young mountain.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.530
It's anywhere between
70 and 90 million years

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.580
that that uplift has happened.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.270
And the summit of Everest
itself is marine limestone.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.950
There's shale.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.790
There's Ordovician
limestone that's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.870
approximately 270
million years old

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.060
that used to be the shallow
inland sea, the Tethys sea,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.630
off the northern part
of the Asian land--

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.240
the Indian plate that
then is being crunched up.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.470
So it's not going upward as
much as it's going northward,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.450
and so there's a deep
root in the mountain,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.900
and then there's
also, as it moves up,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.920
it has to go somewhere.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.910
So imagine if you're at
the table with your kids,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.150
and you have the tablecloth, and
you push the tablecloth in one

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.700
direction, and it crunches up,
that's how these mountains are

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.670
formed.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.470
And when you're in the
Himalayas, and you look around,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.360
and you can tell
the relative age

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.000
and how active a
mountain range is

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.670
by how jagged the skyline is--
so as we look at the pictures

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.822
here in the Himalayas you'll
see that it's really jagged

00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:02.530
and everything, where
you go to someplace

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.070
like the Appalachia, which
is one of the oldest mountain

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.410
ranges on the Earth that's in
the process of eroding away,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.257
is really an example
of all the mountains

00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:14.840
eventually turn into
the sea, and they

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.519
get recycled, and subducted,
moved around again.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.510
So that's one of
the neat things I

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.490
like about climbing-- is we
have this very direct connection

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.950
to land mass.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.470
So if you're out
climbing, you're on a rock

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.000
that's-- if you're in Yosemite,
it's 90 million years old.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.930
You go out in Kenya
where I live it's

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.930
two and a half billion
years old, which predates

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.720
atmospheric oxygen.
So just to be

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.420
able to have that time frame
kind of puts into space

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.190
how insignificant one is.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.510
This clip here is of the
Khumbu Glacier in Nepal.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.810
This is a project I did
with the Extreme Ice Survey

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.600
where we set up
time lapse cameras,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.810
and so this is a
two year time lapse.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.480
And you can see how the main
Khumbu icefall is moving there.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.950
So this is the way
that we can then

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.390
use technology to give us data
points and see how things go.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.200
So it's going to
go in reverse here,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.100
and you can see the shadow line
there is the azimuth of the sun

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.440
as it moves through, and
you can see how that is.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.150
I'm fascinated by this way
of looking at glaciers,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.180
because glaciers are very
much a part of what we do.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.290
Let's go watch it again
just because it's cool.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.050
And we've got time, and
we're here at Google,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.060
and hello to everyone
out there in the cyber

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.560
world that's following along,
but you can look at this.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.650
You can see how things change.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.460
This is a two year period
where they're watching it,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.860
and how the cryosphere,
which is the scientific word

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.860
for the land of
ice that's up there

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
and how it's changing--
and one of three ways

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.750
that we can measure glaciers--
or this is the time lapse.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.156
There's also infrared satellite.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.780
You can see the
pictures in there.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.590
There's historical
repeat photography,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.596
so we can go back
to the earliest

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.970
pictures that were
taken and then

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.870
compare it to where we are now.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.490
And the high latitude and high
altitude areas of our planet

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.800
are taking a greater hit from
the changing and the warming

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.120
climate than many other places.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.740
So it's one of these
things that, to me, I'm

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.870
always aware of it.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.549
And this old joke
in bazooka gum--

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.590
remember, they have the
cartoons wrapped in them,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.840
those little bricks,
and if they got

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.340
stale, they'd break your
teeth-- but they wrapped around

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.100
one of those was, how
do mountains hear?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.150
And it said mountaineers.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.569
And I read that at like age 14.

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.360
I've always kept that
in mind, and now it's

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.314
sort of a mission
in life because I'm

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:44.730
the eyes and ears
of the mountains

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.960
out there to share
what's going on with it.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.830
Everest itself was first
measured in 1862-- the Royal

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.120
Trigonometric Survey at India.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.960
If you like maps--
of course you do.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.440
You work at Google-- and you
like Earth-- of course you do,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.880
you work herh-- you get a
chance to see how they measured

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.080
the Indian subcontinent starting
at the southern tip using

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.500
a brass chain taking
into calculations even

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.540
things as humidity and
sag in their chains.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.110
So they got to within 90
miles of this mountain here,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.860
and they named it peak 15,
and they measured it out

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.115
to be 29,000 feet.

00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:23.740
That's what their
calculations came to.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.640
They added two feet to
it because they thought

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.760
that no one would believe
it if it was 29,000 feet,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.450
and two feet was within
the margin of error,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.170
but it's interesting to see
that they were less than 1/10

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.930
of 1% of when we look at
the height of either 29,028

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.095
feet or 29,035, or
8848 in meters or 8858

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:47.190
in meters, which
makes more sense,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.740
but that they were able to get
that accurate of a measurement

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.040
within that.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.840
Going on, the surveyor named
it after his predecessor,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.340
Sir George Everest, and
that was the name Everest,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.470
and that is where it came from.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.160
And George Everest himself
was-- he was a humble man.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.020
He didn't appreciate the
mountain being named after him,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.240
but it is a very fitting
name, and so it's

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.570
kind of poetic in a
sense that it's Everest

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.330
and it keeps on going.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.060
So the initial exploration of
Everest once it was measured

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.000
and we knew collectively as
humans the altitude of it,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.650
it began and in 1921.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.340
That was the very
first expedition,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.929
and one climber was part
of all three of them.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.740
Pictured here on--
George Mallory.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.130
He's the second from the
left over here looking

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.010
quite rakish with his foot up
on his buddy, and to his right--

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.180
left most in the
picture-- is Sandy Irvine,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.460
and they were-- this is
their third expedition,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.840
but this was the first attempt
to climb Mount Everest,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.710
and it was a pretty
special moment.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.150
England had missed
out on reaching

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.260
the south pole and
the north pole,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.810
and this was the golden
age of exploration.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.910
Prior to this,
exploration was very much

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.610
based upon economic means.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.200
It was there to bring goods
back, to enslave people,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.950
to have cultural imperialism.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.910
There's all these different
reasons why we explored,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.582
but starting in the--
humans, that is--

00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:24.040
and starting in
the 20th century it

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.969
became this goal to explore
for the sake of exploration

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.510
to say you were the
first ones there.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.170
And of course, the south
pole and Mount Everest

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.260
are both reasons for that.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.980
I mean, there is no-- Lewis and
Clark went across North America

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.560
to see what was there and
how it can benefit humans,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.930
but of course there's nothing
grows at the south pole

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.660
nor on the summit of Everest.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.130
So that eventually became
the first expedition-- 1921,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.160
'22, and '24, and my
connection to Everest,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.260
which began in 1999 when
I was part of the Mallory

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.020
and Irvine research
expedition-- we

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.720
set out to solve the
clue as to whether or not

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.220
Sandy Irvine and George
Mallory could have climbed

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.550
Everest 29 years before Sir
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.900
Norgay did in 1953.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.790
And the 1st of May-- I was at
an elevation of 8,300 meters,

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.480
and I came across the frozen,
well-preserved, and desiccated

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.800
body of George Mallory.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.570
And while they
did a great effort

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.640
at getting there
on the mountain,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.400
they didn't make
it to the summit.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.920
It's my belief just
due to the difficulty

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.977
and what went on with it.

00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:36.810
After that, there were
several expeditions--

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:42.620
1933, 1936, 1939 through 1945.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.780
We got in a big argument.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.560
We fought wars, and
then we came back,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.070
and it was in 1953 after the
war that on an expedition led

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.880
by Sir George Hunt-- was
able to attain the summit.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.910
These are some archival
footages courtesy

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.710
of the "National Geographic"
of these early expeditions.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.180
This is the trip
of 1953 going up

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.820
and climbing on the mountain.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.260
You can kind of see what it
was like and what they had.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.220
I mean, here they are
having a cigarette up there.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.510
We know better than that
now, but they actually

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.960
thought it aided
acclimatization,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.710
so we know better,
but you can imagine

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.790
climbing across the
glaciers like that,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.520
looking up onto the
Lhotse faces we see here.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.110
And at the time, when
I was a young man,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.150
climbing Everest was sort of the
end all of what climbing was.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.420
You trained in the mountains,
and you got better,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.003
and eventually if
you got good enough,

00:11:38.003 --> 00:11:39.820
you'd go to someplace
like Everest.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.050
And Everest was the
coolest place to go,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.180
and you can imagine what it was
like climbing in these clothes,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.090
and as a young man, I used
to dream of this stuff.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:56.476
And it was always-- I
guess I was destined

00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:57.850
to be a climber
when I was a kid,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.590
and we would make pillow
forts and stuff like that.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.940
And I always pretended
we were in a tent,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.880
and the wind was blowing.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.800
It was totally crazy.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.220
So I just thought I
haven't really grown up.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.290
I'm still out there
playing a lot,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.400
but it was the 29th of May,
1953 that Sir Edmund Hillary

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.030
and Tenzing Norgay attained
the summit of Mount Everest.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.980
And it was a pretty special
moment for the world.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.420
It was one that was sort of a
relief from the Second World

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.590
War exploration.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.947
We'd gotten to the South
Pole and the North Pole

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:32.530
the beginning of the
century, and then

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.130
we had Mount Everest in 1953,
and it was great and fitting

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.860
that it was Ed Hillary from
New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.070
a Sherpa from Thame
and that part of Nepal

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.090
that they together
were on the summit.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:54.070
And this wonderful image of
Tenzing Norgay on the summit

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.200
is pretty iconic.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.140
It's the one that everyone
associates with it.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.350
So keep this picture
in mind, and you'll

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.440
see current pictures of
the summit of Everest.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.480
So you could probably Google
up Everest this season, 2016,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.230
and you'd see a lot
of people up there,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.090
and the images, and
the flags, and all

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.440
that other stuff up there,
but the joy of it is here.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.820
This is why you want
to climb mountains.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.730
This is Norgay and Hillary after
their ascent in Tengboche--

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.370
just the trust,
the companionship,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.520
the smile they both have
in there is really, really

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.020
special.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.990
We have this wonderful
picture of when they came back

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.860
from the coronation,
and the next slide

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.920
does have sound in it.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.665
So Mike and I did
our AV check here,

00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:51.040
but we're going to wing it
and see if it does have sound.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.730
If it doesn't have
sound, I'll ad lib.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.090
So let's see if this works.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.816
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:58.190
-The New Zealander
Edmund Hillary

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.710
got his first mail and
congratulatory telegrams

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.520
from George Lowe,
a fellow countryman

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.400
and expedition colleague.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.760
Plus 35 miles from Kathmandu,
capital of Nepal, Hillary

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.900
and Tenzing were welcomed
and congratulated

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.860
by their fellow members
of the expedition,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.030
and what a bewildering
experience it must all

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.520
be for the Sherpa Tenzing to be
carried from a remote mountain

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.169
village and plunged into a
welter of official receptions

00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:20.710
and speeches.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.680
Tenzing brought the family along
to share in the excitement,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.920
but for all of them
the ordeal wasn't over,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.100
for now came the
inevitable questioning

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.840
about that moment
of near disaster

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.940
when Tenzing's presence of mind
saved his friend and colleague

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.739
from a fatal fall.

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:47.030
-Tenzing and I have been
climbing together a good deal,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.010
and I think we've become
a fairly happy pair.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:56.319
And this was just one example
of how [INAUDIBLE] and how one

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:57.610
is always protecting the other.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.050
I was leading down
the ice fall, and when

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.420
I was crossing a crevasse
a large clump of ice

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.230
gave way on which
I was standing,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.040
and I set sent off
down a crevasse.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.680
Well, Tenzing here
was following,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.570
had the rope tight on a very
short time, and pulled me up

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.490
so I didn't go very far.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.940
-And how did Tenzing feel up
there on top of the world?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.565
-[SPEAKING NEPALI]

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:26.134
-[SPEAKING NEPALI]

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.297
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:27.297 --> 00:15:28.880
CONRAD ANKER:
[SPEAKING NEPALI], which

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.220
means in Nepali it was very
good, and I was very happy.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.730
So I left that little clip in.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.900
I mean, I kind of
associate that band music

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.200
more with cartoons than
I do press releases.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.930
So we can see how
information went around

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.410
the world at that
time, as opposed

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.840
to how it is nowadays with the
world of the internet, which

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.710
all of you are so an
integral part of it.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.950
That was 1953, the
first ascent of Everest,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.650
and then came in
10 years later was

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.360
the American ascent in 1963.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.510
And this was an expedition that
was sponsored by the National

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.170
Geographic Society.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.400
Part of it was funding
from individual companies,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.970
and so it was a great
teamwork, but they

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.040
started at the edge of the
Kathmandu Valley seen here,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.480
and they marched in
with about 400 porters.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.910
And so nowadays you can fly
in a fixed wing to Lukla,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.775
and it's maybe an 8 to 10
day walk up to base camp,

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:29.900
or you can take a helicopter
up there if you really

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.960
want to suffer with
altitude, but it really

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.174
was sort of at the
edge of what was known

00:16:36.174 --> 00:16:37.090
and what was possible.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.350
And in these days, there was
only one expedition per season,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.310
and it was always
based on a nation.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.190
So one nation would
have the opportunity

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.810
to go climbing there, and
that would be that trip.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.270
It wasn't until
the 80s that they

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.780
started bringing multiple trips
and then sharing on there.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.900
So moving up
through the icefall.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.510
Now the icefall is
equipped with ladders.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:06.920
So you have to go
across that and-- still

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.829
tricky and dangerous, but they
had to bring a few logs up

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.599
there to move
through it, and then

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.050
climbing up onto the
Geneva spur and the summit

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.530
there in the background,
which was amazing.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.480
And it was first climbed
by the United States

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.560
by Jim Whittaker
on the 1st of May,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.520
1963, along with Nawang Gumbu,
his Sherpa partner on that.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.980
They made it to the summit in
pretty much dismal conditions,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.490
and they came down.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.950
That was it, but the story
wasn't over for the US team.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.050
Tom Hornbein and
Willy Unsoeld wanted

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.020
to climb the west
ridge, which was

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.990
sort of the be all of what you
want to do as a climber-- is

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.910
to do a first
ascent, a new route,

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.550
and so they set out to
climb the west ridge.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.090
And you see the
two climbers here.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:59.590
It's basically the sun shade
where the edge of that arete,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.970
going up to the top,
made it to the top,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:09.540
and they met up with Barry
Bishop, who was at the summit.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.860
And they, along
with Lute Jerstad,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.390
and they then kind of bivvied at
the top, and made it back down.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.590
Some of them suffered
frostbite, but it

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:22.270
was a remarkable expedition
in that it was the first team

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.920
to traverse the mountain, and
they opened up a new route.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.520
It was very difficult
and challenging.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.080
So it was a worthwhile
point for the history

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.232
of climbing in
the United States,

00:18:34.232 --> 00:18:38.260
and to this day is
totally an inspiration.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.700
I was maybe 120 days
old at that time,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.319
so of course, I had no idea.

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:44.360
I don't think I even had
an idea what a crib was,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.142
so I let it be that as
a point of inspiration,

00:18:49.142 --> 00:18:50.600
but it's one of
these great things.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.970
They were welcomed back
to the White House.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.710
President Kennedy at the
time was inspired by them,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.760
and then they were
well received.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.250
And then President Kennedy
in a speech in Austin,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.200
Texas when he lined
out the goal to get

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.104
to the moon he used the
quote from George Mallory--

00:19:10.104 --> 00:19:11.270
"Why do we need to go there?

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.290
Because it's there."

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.660
And if you get a
chance to look it up,

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.520
you can see that
connection there.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.630
And if we think about
it, between 1953,

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.960
the first ascent of Mount
Everest with Tenzing

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.430
Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary,
to the first ascent of the moon

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:31.040
16 years later on July 29, 1969,
it's a pretty short time frame.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.600
And we went from climbing
a mountain, which

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.620
is something that
children want to do

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.620
and that humans have been doing
for a long period of time,

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.760
to going to the moon, landing
there with less computing

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.460
power than we have
in our mobile phones

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.320
or on this laptop-- I'm pretty
sure there's more computing

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.810
power in this room, not
this campus, than there was

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.360
at the Houston control center to
get to the moon, but as a kid,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.750
I was seven years old at the
time, and I was like, whoa,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.780
this is great.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.090
And I remember riding my
bike, and TVs weren't flat,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.990
and they were black and white,
and they flickered, and it came

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.470
back, and the pictures of it.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.970
And it was just one
of these moments

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.200
that we can do anything.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.580
And that passion for exploration
and that drive for knowledge

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.470
is something that we
should never let go.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.680
We should always find out
what's over on the other side

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.930
of the river, what's on the
other side of the mountain

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.513
range, what's on top
of the mountains.

00:20:29.513 --> 00:20:32.710
And that's one of these
elemental forces in humans--

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.670
why we are the most
widespread dominant species

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.450
on this planet-- but it's
that curiosity and wondering

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.530
what we're going to do.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.340
So the future is right here.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.220
You guys are looking
into the nanosphere

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.600
and what things can
be done there, how can

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:55.850
we look to the outer parts of
our planet to learn about them.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.000
So bring it up to
the present here.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.880
In 2012, I was part
of an expedition

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.880
to visit Everest to celebrate
the 50th anniversary, which

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.240
came in 2013.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.270
So we went on the
49th year to be

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.270
ready to celebrate it in 2013.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.610
So technically we were off by a
year, but that was a good time.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:23.224
And our goal was initially to
try to go up the west ridge,

00:21:23.224 --> 00:21:25.640
go over the mountain, and then
come back down-- two of us,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.960
Cory Richards and I-- and
then the rest of the team

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.050
to the standard route, and
then also to build a science

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.100
and educational
component into it.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.810
So our team here-- we tried
to bring as much diversity as

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:43.800
possible, and one thing
that I want to see

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.310
is an inclusive
place for mountains,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.260
and mountains are really-- it's
the same mountain for everyone.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.990
And so I'm always like let's
get out there and get after it.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.610
So the time lapse
photography that we

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.900
did-- that was part of that.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.425
We're revisiting
the cameras there.

00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:02.550
The cameras are set up on
the side of the mountain.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.920
They take a photograph
every half hour,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.610
and then photos
are then taken out,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:11.300
and these are ways
that we can learn more

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.850
about the actual
planet that we live on.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.860
So we need to see a
Google type camera that

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.890
was looking over the
icefall in real time,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.520
and so you could see what
it looks like that day,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.130
or you could go into
it, and you could

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.000
see how has the icefall moved in
the last six months and things

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.530
like that.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.950
So that was working on the
Extreme Ice Survey project

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.790
there, and then also with
Montana State University

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.140
we conducted a geologic
profile of the limestone that

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.090
goes from the summit
down to the contact

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.900
zone with the local
granite there.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.970
And Travis Courthouts,
who was a student,

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.720
wrote his master's
thesis about this,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.440
so there's more knowledge
about what's going on.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.720
We also worked with the Mayo
Clinic in human physiology

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.040
to see how the human body
adapts to externalities.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.760
And in this case, the
externality that we used

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.900
was altitude, and
how does it affect

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.530
the cardiopulmonary system.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.540
So Dr. Johnson, who's
here, is a friend of mine.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.170
We're going to go back to
Kilimanjaro this coming August

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.580
to do more high altitude
physiology work.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.750
One of the neat
things that we're

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.930
looking at in that is
altitude is beneficial.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.220
So if you go into a
hyperbaric chamber--

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.000
that there is a benefit to it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.660
So going to altitude I enjoyed.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.196
It is just the rarefied air.

00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:39.820
Your heart has to
work a little harder.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.430
You create more red blood
cells, and for someone

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.540
that does have heart
disease and they're not

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.790
responding to a
pharmacological treatment

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.210
that they might be able to
go into a hyperbaric chamber

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.940
for a few hours a day
as a form of treatment.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.930
So this is something the
Mayo Clinic is looking into.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.510
I guess we're trying to
justify going climbing,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.600
but at the end of the day,
we're just going out there

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.450
because it's fun.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.600
And it's the type
of fun that involves

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.850
suffering, so I mean
it's definitely not

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.030
sitting on the beach and having
pina coladas with umbrellas

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.600
in them.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.340
It's you wake up in the
morning, and you feel miserable.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.440
It's a lot of hard work.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.490
It's dangerous.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.220
You're climbing in the icefall.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.090
There's an example here
of crossing the ladders.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.570
It's one of the scariest
places you can imagine being.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.380
Hilaree O'Neill was with
us on the trip on that,

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.220
and then getting up
into the Western Cwm--

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.290
this is some of the terrain
that's moving into it.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.850
The Sherpas that are
part of this-- I'll

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.150
talk more about their
connection and how

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.750
they work in the
mountains, and no climb

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.880
would be possible of Everest
without their support,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.450
unless you were to go up
pretty much on your own

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.270
and not be able to be there.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:10.710
So one of the-- last year
there was the earthquake

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.550
that took place on
the 25th of April,

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.700
and there was an acquaintance,
a friend of mine from Google,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.320
Dan, who was part
of that expedition.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.560
He and I had met, and we
had worked with each other

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.270
to give him advice, things
that he might want to do,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.700
how he would best be able
to organize that expedition.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.570
And when the earthquake
hit and ice came off

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.200
of the Pumori Lingtren glacier
and the air blast took out

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.560
his camp, he lost his life.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.650
And so climbing is
dangerous, and we know that,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.090
but I'd like to thank Dan.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.160
Dan, I'm thinking of
you here in Google.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.570
We talked about this in one way
or another, so it was-- but one

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.260
of the other-- the year
prior to that there

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.590
was an ice avalanche that
came off this icefall here.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.950
And if you look in the
upper right of center,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.420
there's sort of a
horseshoe there,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.910
and that is a hanging
glacier that comes off

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.290
the west shoulder of Everest.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:16.780
And in this area here,
this is another time lapse

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.630
of the glacier moving, just
a really direct one on there.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.810
And you can see how
challenging this is.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.700
It's something that this is
moving approximately a meter

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.380
a day, and it drops
400 meters in elevation

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.760
over a distance of
about 1,600 meters.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.530
So the icefall is one of the
most active places there is.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.040
This is the location.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.590
Those two fangs that are on
the left of center above-- they

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.810
cut loose, and then
the debris came down

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.530
into where that oval is.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:52.520
And it was most unfortunate
because the people that

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.880
suffered this were 16 Nepalese,
predominately Sherpa, that

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.450
were part of the expedition
that lost their lives on it.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.470
You can see here
this is the terrain.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.700
They moved the icefall into
a different-- the route

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.950
through the icefall a slightly
different way this year

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.950
to minimize that risk, but
it's kind of a catch 22.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.570
Places that avalanche
in-- they fill in,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.570
so it makes travel easier,
and you can go faster,

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.820
but if you're going to where
there's fewer avalanches,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.680
you're in a more
active icefall so you

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.950
have greater risk of the ice
towers and things like that

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.200
toppling over.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.400
And this is the most dangerous
part from an objective hazard

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.090
standpoint of what's available.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.830
I'll talk briefly
about the Sherpas.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.400
This is Danuru Sherpa,
who's a friend of mine.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.800
We were together on our
first expedition in 1999.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.270
He was 19 at the time, and he's
about as big and tall as I am,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.300
and we were there on the Mallory
Irvine research expedition.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.290
And he started out, and
he was-- I was like,

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.750
OK, I'm at 17,000
feet, 5000 meters,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.740
I'm going to train to get up
and go running, and laced up

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.770
my shoes, and I went
running, and jogged along,

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.210
and he was walking side by side.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.510
I was like, OK, so these guys
are a totally different realm

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.830
of what we are, but
they are the ones--

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.570
they're the backbone of
the expeditions over there.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.400
So any trip to
the Himalayas, you

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.740
will interact with
the local people,

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:24.410
whether it's in Pakistan, all
the way to Bhutan, and India,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.930
and Nepal in between,
and north of it,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.470
and they do a lot of the work.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.670
And moving the equipment
up through the icefall

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.270
is a tremendous amount of work.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.300
So they do repeated
trips for people,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.160
and one often wonders
why they're doing it,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:46.120
and it is pretty much a--
it's a market economy.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:51.100
And so this is a way for
these people to earn income.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.390
And it's hard work,
but they enjoy it also

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.260
to a certain degree.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.790
So next up, Monica mentioned
the Khumbu Climbing Center.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.960
And so this is a kind
of a fun little time

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.720
lapse of the students
of the Khumbu Climbing

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.070
Center doing selfies.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.944
So we put a camera there, and
they had the remote there.

00:29:12.944 --> 00:29:14.360
They took a picture
of themselves,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.270
and so this is kind of neat.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.300
These are the students
that we teach climbing to.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.822
We've got to watch it again
just because it's so much fun.

00:29:22.822 --> 00:29:25.030
They're all smiling, and so
this is one of the things

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.280
that my wife Jennifer
and I started in 2002,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.072
2003, vocational training
for high altitude workers,

00:29:33.072 --> 00:29:34.530
knowing that people
are still going

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.988
to continue to go
to the mountains,

00:29:35.988 --> 00:29:39.210
but to have the good
training and allow

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.300
people to have better skills.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.430
And the neat thing about
working with the Sherpas,

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.940
they're all very connected, and
they all have mobile phones.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.060
They're all on social media.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.150
They're communicating, and it's
one of these transitions that

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.270
has gone from, before
there was landlines,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.480
getting landlines up there would
have been incredibly difficult.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.580
And now there are solar
powered cell towers

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.940
and people have mobile
phones, and mobile phones

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.500
are ubiquitous.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.160
You can get smartphones, and
you can communicate with them,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.520
and it's really changed how the
mountains are on my first trip

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.690
to the Himalayas in
1988 to where we are now

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.530
when you kind of
went off the map,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.730
and you sent a
postcard home, and you

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.990
hoped your parents wouldn't
get a telex with bad news.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.850
And now you're
basically expected

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.010
to have quarterly updates.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.080
That's four times a day,
not four times a year,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.080
about what you're doing,
and what you're seeing,

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.740
and how awesome you are,
and so it's kind of changed

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.870
what's going on there, which is
an interesting way to see it,

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.420
but the benefit of mobile phones
is that they are an equalizer.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.560
Whether you're a fisher
person in Kenya knowing

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.720
what the market
price is or you're

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.734
using it is for
microfinance, there's

00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:08.150
great things that
benefit from it.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.840
And I have a Nepali cell phone
that I have in Kathmandu,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.740
and it's saved-- all
my numbers saved.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.600
And I open it up, and people
that I work with, I call them

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.900
up, and they'll meet me.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.990
So communication and connection
is a really good part of it.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.610
This is sort of a closeup
of teaching the climbing

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.140
techniques.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.850
We run the program in
the middle of winter.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.570
So we climb on
frozen waterfalls.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.700
One, it's steeper than
the actual climbing

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.670
on Everest itself so
it's a great place

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.020
to practice the
techniques that you need,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.360
and it's also a time of
year that the people are not

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.520
working on the mountains.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.130
They generally work
pre and post monsoon,

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.970
and then during
the summer they're

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:55.210
attending their land
and their flocks of yaks

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.670
and living that
agricultural life,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.120
but ultimately we
began this program

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.910
because we wanted to avoid
this, which is the loss.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.690
This woman's husband died
climbing on the mountain,

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.036
and there's nowhere in
the Khumbu and especially

00:32:12.036 --> 00:32:13.410
the upper Khumbu
that there isn't

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.400
a family that has
not been affected

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.920
by loss in the mountains.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.740
And when you have
the wage earner that

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.610
is killed in the
mountains, it's a really

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.630
difficult-- it affects
the whole community,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.390
and this is something that,
having been through loss

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.110
myself, [INAUDIBLE] with
Alex and having seen how that

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:42.500
affected our family and
where it is, it was very much

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.890
something that we wanted to
do to give something back.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.710
This is Kancha
Sherpa and his wife.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:54.260
He's the last surviving
member of the 1953 expedition,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.480
and the Khata scarf, which
is put on over the head,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.320
it's a Tibetan tradition.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.280
It's sort of like
giving flowers,

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.240
and so you can see how
much they're adored

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.300
by their fellow villagers.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.510
These images here, taken by
Aaron Huey for a "National

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.660
Geographic" assignment,
are pictures

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.320
of how they see themselves,
snapshots that they put up

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.470
on the wall, sort of the
prints of who they are,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.160
and what they do,
and what it's like,

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:29.890
and that's a pretty cool
way to see those people.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.477
Nice image here by Corey
Richards coming down

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:33.310
through the icefall.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:37.290
Corey was over on
Everest this past year,

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.880
and he had an issue
with health in 2012,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.860
but came back this
year and finished

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.850
his dream of getting up
there without the use

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.430
of supplemental oxygen, which
is kind of a challenging thing

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.930
to do.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.480
We humans really aren't
meant to be at that altitude

00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:00.050
without oxygen, and you
have probably four minutes

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.210
without oxygen before you
have irreparable brain damage.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.800
So when you go at
a reduced amount

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.239
because you're at atmosphere,
it doesn't do great things

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.909
for your body.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:15.610
Looking down to the
North Col-- pardon me--

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.949
from camp two looking
down from the South Col

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:22.949
into the Western Cym-- the
winds and the air up there.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:26.590
And then a stitch
program here taken

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.159
with a smartphone looking
all the way around.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.475
It's like a 360 panorama.

00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:33.010
And I think about
what you can use.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.000
I used an iPhone in 2012,
and took it to the summit,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.159
took pictures with
it, came down,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:44.340
and with the use
of a Thuraya sat

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.699
phone helped Emily
Harrington post an Instagram

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.670
selfie from the South Col.
It wasn't quite the summit,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.610
but it was 800 meters lower
than the south summit.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.439
So that was the
highest altitude that--

00:34:56.439 --> 00:34:59.010
and the first time an Everest
selfie had been snapped up

00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.510
there.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.190
So we're just making
the world smaller.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.180
So in 2012 we had our team.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.660
It was a very busy year on the
mountain as most years are,

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:17.110
and our goal was to get
most of our climbers up.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.201
I was the only one that had
previous Everest experience.

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:20.950
I was team leader.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.140
I wanted to open it up to others
so they had the opportunity

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.260
to try it on their own
and see what it was like.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.850
So they made it to the
summit on the 24th and 25th,

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:37.030
and I was out of gas kind
of figuratively speaking.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.280
I was trying it without
supplemental oxygen,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.040
and I spent two nights
at the South Col

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.510
just sort of slowly
just getting miserable.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.740
And I was like, OK,
it's not going to go.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.565
I'm going to go down.

00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:51.560
So it's about 5:00
in the evening.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.300
I'm like-- you do
what you always

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.124
do when you feel self-pity.

00:35:56.124 --> 00:36:00.040
You eat potato chips,
so I ate potato chips.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.527
Oh, I'm not going
to climb Everest.

00:36:01.527 --> 00:36:02.110
I'm wiped out.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.775
I'm worthless, and then all
of a sudden the weather went,

00:36:04.775 --> 00:36:06.330
and it was really good.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.080
And I knew that something
good was happening,

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.000
and so I just listened to
everyone crunch out of camp

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.200
at about 10 o'clock at night,
and then waited another three

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.890
hours at 1:00 in
the morning left,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.030
and was behind
everyone going up.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:27.890
And to claim that that route--
it wasn't a breath of wind.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.250
It was incredibly calm.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:29.940
It was warm.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.510
I had thin gloves, and
it fulfilled this dream

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.590
I had had of being able to climb
it without supplemental oxygen

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.360
and to do it by fair means.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.210
And so the third time lucky.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:45.099
The two previous times I
had used oxygen sparingly,

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:46.640
but I was there
working, and I didn't

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.160
want to compromise what I
had set out to work with.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.820
So this time I was-- the
team-- it was success.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.470
They had gotten down,
and I went for it,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.590
although my wife Jenny thought--
I didn't bring a radio,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.930
so she didn't know what was up.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.940
So I marched up there,
and had a good time,

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:10.380
and got up to the top, and
sat there, looked around.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.100
It was kind of a-- when
you're there actually

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.272
it's not any fun.

00:37:14.272 --> 00:37:14.980
You're suffering.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.440
You're head is hurting
and things like that,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.960
but when you get back that's
when you enjoy it afterwards,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.980
and I think that's-- there's
no immediate fun to it.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.710
There's the saying that three
types of fun-- it's easy,

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.060
and fun is right now.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.520
Type two is it's
not fun, but it's

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.759
fun when you get done doing
it, and type three fun is

00:37:33.759 --> 00:37:35.050
it's not fun when you're doing.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.120
It's not fun afterwards.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.990
So this kind of
fits in type two.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.310
It's a lot of hard work,
but when you get done

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.690
it's not any good.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.400
So a photograph that Kris
Erickson had snapped.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.110
He climbed Lhotse, the next
peak over, the following day.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.680
So he and Hillary O'Neil
had climbed both peaks

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.390
in a quick period of time--
and looking at the headlamps

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.540
as they moved up
onto the mountain.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.410
The view from up there, the
shadow of Mount Everest that

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.550
you get to see when
you're out looking on it,

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.877
and so there's-- your
name again please?

00:38:07.877 --> 00:38:08.460
AUDIENCE: Rob.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.510
CONRAD ANKER: Rob,
and Rob summited

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.230
in 2012, the same
year we were there,

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.760
and on the 20th, and
stormy weather, I remember.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.666
We probably crossed paths, but
we didn't have tea together,

00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:21.290
but we had tea together
at lunch today.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:25.440
So thank you, Rob, but our
team after we got done.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.360
We were all happy, and
we were all probably

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.520
10 to 20 pounds lighter, which
is a good thing after working

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.040
with the Mayo Clinic
that when we go hungry

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.720
it helps our bodies out.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.000
So they were concerned
that I was injuring myself,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.440
but still here.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.550
I'm OK.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:57.530
So on to the earthquake
of 2014-- pardon

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:03.020
me, 2015, and this is from a
Dutch university, this image

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.520
here.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.390
And we can see this
is in Langtang,

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.320
which is the area
that was closer

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.140
to the epicenter
of the earthquake.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.220
And the upper one is 2014,
and the lower one is 2015,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:20.240
and the red, because it's
infrared, is vegetation,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.290
and then the white is snow.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.250
And then you can see
where the green is,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.750
and the village of Langtang
and Gumba, which were-- there

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.550
was large debris flow that came
down and buried the village

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:40.910
under many, many meters of
rock, and snow, and slurry,

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.090
and basically took the village
out and all 400 of the people.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:50.840
Overall, 9000 people
perished in Nepal.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.560
The houses that were
built traditionally

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.650
without any reinforcement,
either rebar or cement,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.620
were the ones that took
the worst brunt of it.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.950
They came across.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.540
They fell down, fell apart.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:07.070
A village in Thome
here-- it's collapsed,

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:11.150
and we have a young girl and
her grandmother living outside

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.390
and are being
optimistic about it.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:19.340
Tending to the deceased
in a funeral pyre here.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.980
One of the-- how
deeply affected it.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.570
This is a view of the
village of Phortse,

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.440
Ama Dablam in the background,
and a very close connection

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:30.970
to this.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.720
This is where the team-- Sherpa
that I worked with in '99

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.600
came from and where we started
the Khumbu Climbing Center

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.360
and where we run the
vocational training each year.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.450
And they're a very
traditional village.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.400
They've said no to large hotels,
and they still keep it small,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.660
and they want to preserve their
culture, and history, in where

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.550
they are with it, but we
came with an idea as a way

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.890
to have some permanence for
the Khumbu Climbing Center

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.240
to build a physical building.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.360
And that was working with
the Montana Tech University

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.780
School of Architecture
to design a building that

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:15.320
would be passive solar energy
efficient, earthquake safe,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.710
and then be able to give
the climbing center,

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.850
the vocational program,
permanence, and a place

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.080
where they can base it out of
and where they can bring people

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.810
in there to do further things.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.900
So working with the village,
looking at the various plans

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:36.090
that you can look at with
it, they chose with it.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.080
And it's been an ongoing
project to build it.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.250
Everything either comes
up on the back of a porter

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:46.470
or strapped to a yak, which
is interesting to see.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.590
It gets carried up to
the red [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.680
These next few images
here are renderings

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.200
of what the building will
look like when it's finished,

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.940
and we spent-- my
wife Jenny and I

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.010
spent the month of April
working on the building

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.650
and kind of keeping along.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:09.620
We have a group of masons,
and it's a challenging project

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.460
to get done, but
we're coming along.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.130
We're having fun.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.620
It's a neat thing,
but you always

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.830
bite off more than you can chew,
and you'll never go hungry.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:27.940
So I think that's an axiom
that you can use for work, too.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.370
But it's been a really
wonderful project, a way

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.650
to integrate with them to bring
building materials and building

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.450
techniques that are
new to their culture

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.360
and how they're doing it.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:48.240
Thanks to the photographers,
and Nat Geo, my wife Jenny.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.310
A photograph from afar,
and this is a photograph

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:56.720
of the recreation of
what we-- we climbed it

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.900
in period costume in 2007
for the wildest dream.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.770
It was burly.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.330
I was really, really cold.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.087
Even though we had as close
to perfect re-creation,

00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:11.670
a lot of the clothing that was
made by the same companies that

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:17.375
were there in 1924, it
was just frightfully cold.

00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:19.500
And then in case you were
wondering if there really

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.500
is a yeti, I borrowed this
from Tintin goes to Tibet,

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.990
but there's the yeti
watching the yak train,

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.460
but I'm going to back
it up to this photograph

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:34.630
here and open it
up to the audience

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.360
if you do have a
question or you want to--

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.320
AUDIENCE: So in
terms of taking risk,

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.440
how do you find where
your limit actually is?

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.520
Because it seems to
me a lot of times

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.710
like maybe you
crossed your limit

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.835
to find where the limit
is, but in your profession,

00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:48.919
that's a little dangerous.

00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:50.793
CONRAD ANKER: Yeah,
great question about risk

00:43:50.793 --> 00:43:51.615
and when you know.

00:43:51.615 --> 00:43:53.080
Part of it is building blocks.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.890
So you go upon
experience of experience,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.370
and if I were to step in
any one of your jobs today,

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.610
it would be a train wreck.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.130
I'd probably crash
your computer.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.339
I'd lose all your data.

00:44:04.339 --> 00:44:06.880
People that you work for would
come in like, what did you do?

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.770
So you build upon experience.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.650
So all the climbing
that I've done

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:16.170
on a climb like Meru or
Everest is the previous decades

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.840
of experience
building upon that,

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.090
and then most of the time,
probably 98% of time,

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:26.157
you keep risk dialed down
below where it's acceptable.

00:44:26.157 --> 00:44:27.740
And then a little
bit of time you have

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.330
to push out of that envelope.

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.990
When you're younger,
and you're male,

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.500
and your prefrontal cortex
isn't fully developed,

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.495
you live in that
risk zone way more

00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:38.870
than you do when
you're climbing,

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.680
but making good decisions come
about based on experience.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.180
And it's sort of you
know when it's not right

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.330
and it's not safe, and then
you can plan accordingly.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.430
Hopefully that helps out.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.040
AUDIENCE: My question is,
in terms of technology,

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.946
is there anything
new that you know

00:44:55.946 --> 00:45:00.190
of that might help with safety
both ascending and descending

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.610
from the mountain?

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.322
CONRAD ANKER: Technology
and safety in the mountains.

00:45:05.322 --> 00:45:08.470
I mean, crampons
are crampons, and I

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.990
mean, ice tools
and down clothing,

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.560
all that stuff-- it really
hasn't changed that much.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.750
There's small,
incremental improvements

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.680
that make them better, but
probably the technology

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.442
that all of you work on in
terms of a the self driving

00:45:24.442 --> 00:45:26.900
automobile-- that technology
that goes in there-- maybe you

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.700
can have a device that
is in the process-- using

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.900
a smartphone that would then
help guide you get down.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.320
So having more information
available to you

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.520
would be better.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.070
Having a drone that can
fly up high, a large one,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.930
and pluck you off-- I
mean, yeah, we can do that.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:50.760
I mean, humans-- we're pretty
darn good tool users and tool

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.490
builders, but you have to
ask yourself is that really

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.130
what you want.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.350
I mean, you go up to the
mountains to get lost,

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.354
to find yourself, to
ask these questions,

00:46:00.354 --> 00:46:02.270
because if it was easy,
you wouldn't go do it.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.950
So the technology-- there's a
certain point where all of us

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.700
are like, I'm going
to turn the phone off.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.650
I'm not going to look at it.

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:09.610
I'm going to go to bed.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.762
I'm going to go to
sleep, and likewise I'm

00:46:11.762 --> 00:46:12.970
going to go in the mountains.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.940
I'm going to bring
a camera along,

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.584
but I don't want my camera to
talk to the rest of the world

00:46:17.584 --> 00:46:19.250
or broadcast with the
rest of the world.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.191
I want to take a few pictures
to come back and bring memories

00:46:22.191 --> 00:46:22.690
back.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:28.120
So I'm sure there will be
something wild and innovative

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.550
that comes out that will
help people out there,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:35.530
but the less you have the
more you rely on yourself

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.880
and your partners, the more
meaningful that experience is.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.365
And hopefully one of
the takeaways from today

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:44.060
is go out and find adventure.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.780
AUDIENCE: So being
here at Google

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.600
and also climbing part of
my life, and at this point,

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.540
climbing for me is more like
a lifestyle than a hobby--

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.716
how do you strike a balance?

00:46:56.716 --> 00:46:58.340
You want to be
successful at your work.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.330
You want to make the difference.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.370
You want to make an
impact, and you're

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.900
talking about all this great
stuff that we do at Google,

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.210
but at the same time,
you really want to climb.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.790
So at this point, in my case--
and I'm sure a lot of people

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.370
can relate to
this-- I can advance

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.397
in climbing only if
a climb more time.

00:47:11.397 --> 00:47:13.230
I can spend more time,
but at the same time,

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.230
this time can be used for work.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.140
So how do you find this balance?

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.830
CONRAD ANKER: I can't-- that's--
if I were to answer that,

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.680
I would be like, maybe this is
a conversation you have to have

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.530
with yourself,
maybe your parents,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.840
maybe a person that you trust.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.660
I mean, if you really
want to climb, you could

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.980
probably-- you could
walk to your supervisor,

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.730
and hand in your notice, and
say I'm going to camp four.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.920
I got my sprinter van, and
I've got a rope, and a rack,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.710
and the pack on my back,
and I'm going to climbing.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.930
And then you'd go
climbing all the time,

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.620
but being able to
work here and being

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.150
able to spend time in
the mountains-- I mean,

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.170
you're fortunate.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.300
I mean, if you lived
in Houston, climbing

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.720
would be once or twice a year.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.840
I mean, here you
can time it right.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.320
You can train at
the climbing gym,

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.330
and you can get up into
the Sierra high country.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.030
You can get to Yosemite.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:10.196
You can have a lot of great
opportunities with that.

00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:16.080
So yeah, finding that
balance where you're happy.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.260
So I just had to go climbing.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:26.910
I didn't have any choice, and
I wasn't a scientist in the way

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.060
that all of you were
coders and geniuses here,

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.790
and Google wasn't around
when I was a young man.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.600
AUDIENCE: I watched the
documentary for Meru

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.050
a few months ago,
and at the end of it,

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.984
I was absolutely astonished.

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.150
And you kind of mentioned
a little bit of the things

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.108
that you go through in
the documentary for Meru

00:48:45.108 --> 00:48:48.869
here that it's type two fun,
that it's not really enjoyable.

00:48:48.869 --> 00:48:50.660
What are some of the
conversations and some

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.690
of the mental strategies you use
when it just completely sucks?

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:00.730
CONRAD ANKER: Well, one thing I
always keep in the back of my--

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.650
it's like a little
pocket that you can have

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.370
in there when things are bad.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.720
So I think about
Shackleton, and he

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.010
survived 17 months out
there with nothing,

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:13.160
and living on the pack ice,
and living off of seaweed,

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.260
and penguins, and seals,
and undue hardship,

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.710
and he still came through,
and the other stories

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.410
of endurance and suffering.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.800
Humans are incredibly
strong, and we

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.900
don't realize our true
potential until we're put

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.866
into the situation where it is.

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:31.490
One of the things I
always keep in mind

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.620
is that it's not that bad,
and that it could be worse,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:44.260
and that you hold fast, and you
don't freak out, and just be

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.820
like, OK, this is where I'm at.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:54.460
This is what I'm doing, and for
myself I sort of self-selected

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.140
for climbing.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:59.680
I enjoyed doing
it, and the way I

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.290
process information-- I'm
hyper situationally aware.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.370
So the closing of the
door just registered,

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:09.430
and people moving in here.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.100
Someone's out there
walking on the lawn.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.340
All that stuff is
asking for attention.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.080
In second grade, it was
a total train wreck.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.105
Ms. Shaver was
calling up my parents.

00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:22.480
What are we going
to do with him?

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.400
He won't sit down.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.946
He can't focus.

00:50:26.946 --> 00:50:28.320
What are we going
to do with him?

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.080
But when I go climbing, then
I'm in a risky situation.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.750
So all that input--
I process it,

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.990
and I have to make
decisions on how to climb.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.634
And it's not the right thing.

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.050
I'm going out, and
I'm having fun,

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:43.962
but it is part of
how I process things.

00:50:43.962 --> 00:50:46.170
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if
you have any advice on how

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:51.000
to mitigate risk when
you're at a high altitude

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.700
and you're at a kind of
a diminished capacity

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.700
for reasoning.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.990
CONRAD ANKER: OK.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:58.810
Yeah, when you're at
altitude your body

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:04.400
is shunting oxygen away from
your extremities to your core

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:09.750
and to your brain, and
we have our organic CPUs,

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:14.450
central processing units,
are very energy intensive.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:16.220
Look into some of
the information

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.530
about human evolution, and
why we have such large brains,

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.750
and what part of
the brain we use.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.810
And so when you get to altitude
and you have a lack of oxygen,

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.430
then making decisions
becomes really difficult,

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:37.460
and the people that are at
altitude with a compromised

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.720
oxygen input, which is
everyone-- the people that

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.630
do well are the ones who have
been climbing the longest time.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.930
So it's innate
what they're doing,

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.430
and they have balance
on their feet.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:47.679
They know how to work with it.

00:51:47.679 --> 00:51:49.760
They know symptoms that
are coming in there,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.840
where someone that
is new to climbing

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.140
might-- they're in
over their head,

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.260
and then they're not
processing in the best way.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.290
So they might get frostbite.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.480
Things might change.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.660
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think the next big improvement

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.980
will come from?

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.490
Sounds like it's not
gear like your answer

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.530
from the previous question.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.550
Is it the way we train?

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.160
Is it just the way we think
about-- fast and light

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.790
was a big thing
recently, or is it

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.610
the technique and the
strides that the sport

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.226
climbers and mixed climbers
are making in the past?

00:52:25.226 --> 00:52:26.350
CONRAD ANKER: That's great.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:30.720
Probably one of the greatest
improvements in climbing

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.610
has been the climbing
gym, and now we're

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.537
having second
generation children

00:52:35.537 --> 00:52:36.620
that are growing up in it.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.760
The strongest climbers
come from the gym.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:43.270
Alex Honnold was a
competition climber.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:47.530
So he began climbing at
a gym, and so learning

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.820
that muscle memory at a younger
age, getting stronger with it,

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.780
is really a key part of
that, and training more.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.280
And when you do a rock climb,
it's always a constant.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.360
It's this handhold is that size,
and so the next person that

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.950
tries that it's the same thing.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.040
And so you might
have improvements

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.120
in the climbing shoe rubber.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.710
It's stickier, but as
people get stronger,

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:20.870
they're within it, but probably
not so much what I would

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:29.090
see as improvements, but more
people enjoying it, and being

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.920
outdoors, and being
with other people,

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.890
and that teamwork is being part
of their self actualisation--

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.440
that we become better
humans because when

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.380
we interact with people
climbing you and I are a team,

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.060
and I trust.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.920
You trust me, and we achieve
the goal by working together.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.200
If we play tennis,
I want to beat you,

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.360
and you want to beat me.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.040
And we're playing mental
games, and we're training,

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.770
and then I get a hop over the
net, or you hop over the net,

00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.830
and you shake the hand.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:08.550
I much prefer having summited a
peak, and sitting in the tent,

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:11.580
and just having a mug of
tea, and the wind is blowing,

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.565
and you're like, we did it.

00:54:16.565 --> 00:54:20.020
I mean, that's
good human emotion.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.930
I went down a rabbit
warren on that.

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:23.790
Go ahead, Rob.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:28.430
AUDIENCE: So at this point,
a lot of the easy, obvious

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.230
objectives have already been
accomplished in mountaineering,

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.610
and sponsors don't
really want to pay

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:36.380
you to go do the same thing over
and over that someone else has

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.160
already done 100 times.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.670
Do you think that the only
way to attract sponsors

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:45.820
is to take additional risk,
or is the state of the art

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.920
advancing fast enough that
people can find new projects

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.100
at the same risk threshold?

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.400
CONRAD ANKER: Great
question about risk,

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.580
but yeah, a lot of
the obvious mountains

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.060
have been climbed,
the 8000 meter peaks.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.060
So there's new routes
and faces of them.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.720
I mean, it's a finite resource.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.580
I mean, everyone says, oh, there
are thousands of mountains,

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:11.246
but there's not.

00:55:11.246 --> 00:55:14.880
I mean, there will come
a time in the future

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.640
where all the mountains
have been climbed.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.630
So I think from a
sponsorship standpoint,

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:26.540
like in parapenting, and base
jumping, and extreme skiing,

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:31.390
it's how can you ramp up
that adrenaline factor.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:35.010
And they're doing crazier stuff,
and skiing faster, and shooting

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.010
through narrower things.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.090
And in climbing it's
climbing without a rope

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.810
and doing something
faster with that,

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.970
but there's also
something that would

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.380
be-- and a great way
for a sponsor that's

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.410
looking in climbing in the way
that you can share knowledge

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.500
and information, and that
you get more people engaged

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.730
in the natural world.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:58.790
You get them to care about the
cryosphere, the atmosphere,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.790
the oceans, all these
different things

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.350
through the natural
world, and that

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:06.480
would be from a
sponsorship standpoint

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.490
something that would benefit.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:13.390
So it's not being the best.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.740
I mean, we sponsor
basketball games

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.670
because someone wins a game,
and in between shooting hoops

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:22.490
they sell us a beer
and arm deodorant.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:26.860
So I'm in the
sponsorship work, too,

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.220
but try to get people to think
about science and to-- I mean,

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.220
everyone in this room is
really healthy and fit,

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:37.390
but as a nation,
we're struggling.

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:41.710
The top five ways
that people die early

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:45.740
are accidents, which
is fate, but cancer,

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:50.320
which is, again, sort of the
luck of the draw, but diabetes,

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.825
stroke, pulmonary, and cardio.

00:56:52.825 --> 00:56:57.550
All four of those are directly
connected to lifestyle choices.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:03.440
So if you don't exercise and you
eat fatty, salty, sugary food

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.410
and then you're going to be--
so if we can encourage people

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:11.210
to be healthier and
to come back to what

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.420
that previous
connection-- question

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.750
the connection that
people have about building

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:21.664
good dialogue between humans--
then you've done a good thing.

00:57:21.664 --> 00:57:23.080
AUDIENCE: What
have you personally

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.890
seen as far as the efforts to
clean up or at least reduce

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.150
the impact that all the
different expeditions have had

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:35.250
on the mountain as far as the
trash and waste left behind,

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.040
especially as
climbing Everest has

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:40.050
become more and more commercial
and more and more popular?

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:43.720
Are they finding ways where
they're requiring expeditions

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.600
now to pack out more
than they packed in

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.789
to try to start
reducing all that's

00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:51.580
been left on the mountain
over the decades?

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.330
CONRAD ANKER: Yeah,
great question.

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:56.310
In the 90s, there were a
lot of cleanup expeditions

00:57:56.310 --> 00:58:00.751
that went out to clean up
the waste that was left.

00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:02.250
In earlier exhibitions,
it was like,

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.100
oh, no one's going
to come after me,

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.640
or I'll just throw
it in a crevasse.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.440
It's not a big deal.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.980
The standard routes
on-- the trade

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.666
routes on the north
and the south sides--

00:58:11.666 --> 00:58:13.290
there's a lot of
human impact, and it's

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:17.000
a very inhospitable
and very harsh climate,

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.230
but at the same time, it's
a very delicate and fragile

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.850
environment.

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.410
So it's kind of
this-- there's more

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.970
resiliency in the
rainforest in the jungle.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.470
I mean, there is
more life there.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:33.880
There's more turnover in
terms of biodiversity.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.390
Not much is going on up there
so litter hangs out there

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.140
for a long time.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.550
Then Nepali government
realizes that a clean mountain

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:42.450
is a safer mountain.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.800
It's also a more
attractive mountain,

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.690
and a more attractive mountain
is financially a better place

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.190
to be.

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:53.600
So this year they
had every exhibition

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.860
is required to bring their
waste back from the mountain,

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.690
and in addition to that, eight
kilos of just generic waste

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.440
that was up there.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.830
And so that was part of it,
and you have to put a bond up

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:09.820
that you bring out
all your garbage,

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:13.155
and then they put on this
extra 16 pounds, eight kilos,

00:59:13.155 --> 00:59:14.530
that you would
have to bring out.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.820
So they're making
good efforts at it.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.270
Most of the garbage,
human waste excepted,

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:23.720
that you see on Everest is
an aesthetic consideration.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.326
An old oxygen cylinder
just looks like trash.

00:59:26.326 --> 00:59:27.200
It doesn't look good.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.197
They're getting hauled down
because they're souvenirs.

00:59:30.197 --> 00:59:31.280
There's a market for them.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.460
You can sell an old
oxygen cylinder for $40,

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:39.170
and that's four or five
days wages for someone.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.950
And so there is an
incentive along those lines,

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:45.280
but probably the greatest impact
that climbers have on Everest

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.130
is the several
thousand pounds of CO2

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.550
that goes into the atmosphere
as a result of using

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.160
jet travel to get over there.

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.480
So that's cumulative,
and that adds to it.

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.950
AUDIENCE: Besides
Everest, what sticks out

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.650
in your climbing
life as that summit

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:07.976
that you can't get
out of your mind?

01:00:07.976 --> 01:00:09.350
CONRAD ANKER:
Well, the Meru one,

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:14.920
that was 25 years of obsessing,
and three expeditions

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.160
over eight years, and
spending 45 nights

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.070
on the side of the mountain just
trying to-- not letting it go.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.660
So that was a really
beautiful point of it,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:31.030
but yeah, I'll still continue
to enjoy being outdoors

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:38.200
and the level of intensity
is it'll be this nice hill

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.110
up here-- if I'm 90 or 100
and I can climb that nice hill

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:45.350
and listen to birds, that'll
be as meaningful as climbing

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.700
Meru when I was 49.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:53.950
So just adjust what
your goal is, but yeah,

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.090
I have a trip
planned in November

01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:00.970
to Nepal with David
Lama, Austrian climber,

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:05.980
and to try a [INAUDIBLE]
peak in Nepal.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980
We tried it last year.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:13.220
We got denied, so we're going
to go back, suffer some more.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.230
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'd love to
hear more about why you were

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.447
convinced that-- what was it?

01:01:18.447 --> 01:01:19.780
And now I'm forgetting his name.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.001
Edmund Hillary--
no, George Mallory

01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:23.750
didn't make it to the
summit, and is there

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.940
any big debate still?

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.177
Are people still arguing
if he did or didn't?

01:01:27.177 --> 01:01:28.510
CONRAD ANKER: Oh, good question.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:33.340
Most people accept it
was incredible what

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.850
they did in 1924 they
got to where they did.

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:39.894
A few people still believe
that, and every now and then

01:01:39.894 --> 01:01:41.810
we have internet discussions
of whether or not

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.268
they could have
made it to the top,

01:01:43.268 --> 01:01:47.080
but my view is based on the
location of George Mallory's

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.380
body, where they found
Sandy Irvine's ice

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.980
axe in 1933 above
the yellow band,

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.990
where they were last seen
by Noell Odell, and then

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:01.690
the difficulty of the
first and second steps.

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:06.720
And when we were there in
2007, we pulled the ladder

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:13.311
and free climbed, and it's 5,
10 climbing it 8,700 meters.

01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:15.310
I mean, you're right below
the summit, and to do

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:19.360
that without protection--
I mean we had a number four

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.170
Camalot with a wood
stack and a nylon rope,

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:25.560
and it was hard climbing.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.160
And to see they're up
there with hobnail boots,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.820
a hemp rope, no protection.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.110
The rope was kind of like a
safety line as they walked

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:39.880
along to keep you from
toppling off the mountain,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.950
but it wasn't-- and the systems
that we use now with belaying

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:49.170
and protection on it, and the
fact that there was no evidence

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:53.390
of a rappel station built on
top of the second step when they

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.890
came down.

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:58.600
So there wasn't-- 1960 was
the first Chinese descent from

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.730
the north side and
then again in 1975,

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:03.600
and there would have
been something up there,

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.260
but to solo the second
step and then down solo it

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.330
in the condition they were in,
and then to slip where they

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.790
were on that, I just--
doesn't seem plausible,

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:19.310
but a tremendous amount of
respect for what they did,

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.690
and who they were, and they are.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.930
Every generation owes it
to the previous generations

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.870
for what they are
able to do, and it's

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.770
that ball of knowledge
that we, and add to it,

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:34.145
and we pass it on to the next
generation, and that's why.

01:03:34.145 --> 01:03:36.019
MONICA POLETTI: Thank
you so much for coming.

01:03:36.019 --> 01:03:37.430
This is really cool insight.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:38.980
[APPLAUSE]
