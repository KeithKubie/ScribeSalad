00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.860
What's up guys, today we are back and we are fulfilling a request that came out of the comments from Phil R. who says...

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.660
"Freeze the heart in liquid nitrogen then smash it into pieces... just like my ex did."

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.320
Phil I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune but a lot of people but a lot of people are supporting your comment...

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.280
So that's the experiment that we are trying today.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.740
Now, you properly recognize this heart from the casting experiment we did where we cloned it in chocolate,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.400
and made a 2 pound solid chocolate heart for Valentine's Day.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.100
That was pretty awesome but Valentine's Day is over. So I get a big thermos of my own home-made liquid nitrogen,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
a glass jar from our vacuum chamber experiments, and a wide variety of tools,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.420
so we can chip into this thing and dissect it "King of Random" style.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.740
Now I'm no biology expert, so I printed off a little reference guide here,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.360
that we can use to figure out exactly what we're hacking into, and maybe we'll learn something,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.080
about how the heart works as we do.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.020
So looking at these pictures here you can see this is kinda like a mirror image of the heart,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.460
so right here we have the,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.860
right atrium, the right ventricle, and over here we got the left ventricle, and the left atrium,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.700
and then up here we have our arteries and valves,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.420
apparently these little things here are small muscles that are from when the heart developed,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.060
and they don't really seem to serve a purpose,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.780
so let's go ahead and transfer liquid nitrogen into the jar first,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.920
hopefully our glass jar doesn't crack from thermal shock,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.720
'cause if it does were gonna be wasting alooot of nitrogen,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.980
nitrogen is interesting stuff like as this glass cools down to temperature it actually does this rapid boil at the end,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.660
where we get little bits spilling out everywhere,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.700
which is too bad because this stuff is really precious and hard to make,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.200
alright little heart you have served us well, its time to meet your Frosty Fate,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.360
here we go,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.240
oh yeah,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.500
I always forget about this, theres like this nitrogen vapor there,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.940
and whenever something warm touches it,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.900
it like creates this little force field that is super cool!

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.560
that is nuts! hehe,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.240
it's like ripples in the ocean except it's nitrogen vapors,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.760
how cool is that? It's not even touching the nitrogen yet,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.340
here we go!

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.460
aaand we have contact.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.040
[Sizzling sound]

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.580
what's really is funny as you can still see little bits of the red chocolate and theres even some  blue silicone.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.760
from when we poured the mold stuck down inside one of these arteries.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.860
well it's been about two minutes there let's just see how the outside of the heart is looking.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.180
oh yeah that's a little frosty.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.500
[Thuds]

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.900
it's as hard as a rock.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.400
[Thud]

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.960
[Thud]

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.340
now a heart of this size, I imagine is gonna take at least ten to twenty minutes to freeze all the way through,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.280
because although the outside is freezing solid there is so much mass to this heart,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.540
that it's gonna take quite a bit of time for the cold to penetrate all the way through,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.940
and I would like this to be completely frozen by the time we start chipping into it,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.400
so let's just go ahead and plop it down into the nitrogen and let it sit for 20 minutes,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.760
oh wow my tongs got stuck,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.340
okay I'm just gonna dip this in by hand and we'll see how much nitrogen this displaces,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.580
you can already see its starting to boil out the top,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.780
and that's because that heart is so warm,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.320
the nitrogen is going crazy,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.440
and I don't want to loose too much of it so i gotta do this,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.120
kinda slowly here let the heart settle in,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.220
look at this,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.860
uh oh,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.480
there it goes that was an accident darn it -ahahaha,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.320
and there goes the nitrogen,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.340
[Thud]

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.920
WOW that froze up quick look at this,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.540
the artery is already solid, right there,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.040
that's already solid,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.580
about half my nitrogen just spilled out,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.440
so we're gonna try this again a little bit slower,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.200
and as that boils down we'll just keep it topped up with nitrogen,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.180
and give it about twenty minutes to set.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.440
*music*

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.220
so side note I actually made this liquid nitrogen I've got a generator that took a couple of years to set up,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.880
but it's finally working,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.000
and this is the first batch of homemade liquid nitrogen,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.220
that I've actually put to use,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.440
and it looks like it's doing a good job.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.000
I mean it's working! Homemade liquid nitrogen guys!

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.160
video coming soon,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.540
alright so update guys it as been twenty minutes that our heart has been sitting  in,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.140
a bath of liquid nitrogen, let's take a peak inside,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.580
and see if anythings changed.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.640
Here we go, oh look at that guys, it has cracked,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640
you can see it's cracked

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.500
right through the right ventricle,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.640
and it split over into the left ventricle and the left atrium.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.080
There is a possibility that that is from when I was dropping it,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.640
I was a little bit to abusive with this thing,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.520
but I didn't see any cracks initially.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.520
these have all popped up in the last 10 minutes.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:12.640
So the question on my mind right now is after 20 minutes in liquid nitrogen, is this thing frozen completely solid, or is there still some gummy meaty tissue on the inside.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.420
there is only one way to find out, so lets grab a hammer and a chisel and begin chipping away at it.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.740
That is frosty,
