LEON NICHOLLS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.000
My name is Leon
Nicholls, and I'm

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.880
a developer relations engineer
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.510
Today I'm going to introduce you
to several sample Actions that

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.610
are integrated with Dialogflow.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.090
It's the fastest and easiest
way to create an Action

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.640
and to learn more about
the powerful features

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.070
of the Actions on
Google Platform.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.150
We've added sample
Actions that allow

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.332
you to create working Actions
within just a few minutes.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:33.290
You end up with source
code that you can easily

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.760
edit to add new features.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.570
You can find these new samples
on our developer documentation

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.380
site.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.840
You can select from
various types of Actions.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.460
There are several
Actions that you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.280
can use for daily updates
and notifications,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.990
or be added to routines.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.670
Other types include
simple adventure games,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.580
interactive stories,
or a music player.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.650
These are just to
help you get started

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.790
by giving you a Dialogflow
agent that is fully functional.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.550
You can of course still create
a completely custom Action

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.700
on your own with Dialogflow.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.550
You can preview the user
experience of each type

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.290
by playing the audio
recording of each Action.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.760
Once you've selected the
Action you want to create,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.300
click on that type.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.620
Dialogflow will walk
you through a few steps

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.070
for building an agent that
will implement your Action.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.080
Firstly, you'll be prompted
to give your new agent a name.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.120
If you've used
Dialogflow before,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.560
you can overwrite
an existing agent.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.930
A Dialogflow agent is
created for you, including

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.170
all the intents, entities,
and fulfillment and code

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.330
to make the Action work.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.330
Within just a few minutes, your
Action will be ready to use.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.410
Your agent is preconfigured with
intents and working fulfillment

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.510
code that implement
our best practices.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.150
You can then customize the agent
to make the Action your own.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.080
To customize the agent, you
can update the source code

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.480
provided for fulfillment.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.729
The fulfillment
is hosted for you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.110
in a Cloud Function
for Firebase.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.110
The source code has
step-by-step instructions

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.990
on how to customize the
Action, and provides links

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.960
to our docs on how to
extend the capabilities.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.240
To try the action
the first time,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.280
you don't have to
understand all the code.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.290
You can come back later
if you want to customize

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.980
the Action even further.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.710
Once you are ready,
click the Deploy button

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.630
to save your changes
to the Cloud Function.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.030
Now you can test the Action in
the Actions console simulator

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.430
by clicking on the Integrations
menu in Dialogflow.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.290
In the simulator, you
can test your Action

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.050
on different surface types,
like audio-only speakers

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.120
and mobile devices which have
audio and visual capabilities.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.760
Once you are done
customizing and testing,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.100
you can use the Actions
console to submit

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.890
your Action for review.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.110
Once it's approved,
everybody will

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.270
be able to use your
Action anywhere the Google

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.410
Assistant is supported.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.830
So that was a quick
introduction to sample Actions.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.780
You can try them out
yourself by clicking

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.730
on the link in the
description below.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.610
We also have a
Google+ community,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.220
so you can ask your questions
and share your ideas with

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.600
everyone.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.830
I'm Leon Nicholls.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.840
Thanks for watching,
and I look forward

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.400
to trying out your Actions.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.750
