00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.442
- This is a rectangle.

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:05.530
And yes, this is a rectangle.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.562
Let's measure the green line below

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:10.848
using both rectangles
and a centimeter ruler.

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:12.589
So, we have this green line

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.901
and we're going to measure
it in terms of rectangles

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.687
and we're going to
measure it on this ruler.

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:17.720
And you immediately see

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.040
the green line is equal
to one rectangle long,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.805
but if we measure it in centimeters

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:25.579
it's equal to six centimeters long.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.340
So we can say the line
is one rectangle long,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.605
but it's six centimeters long

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:32.405
and that makes sense

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:34.924
because the rectangle is much more

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:35.946
than a centimeter.

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:38.663
Actually, the length of a
rectangle is six centimeters.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.042
So, the length of a rectangle is longer

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:41.867
than a centimeter.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:42.505
You see that.

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:44.119
This is the length of the rectangle,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:45.384
it's the same as the line,

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:47.660
while centimeter is this length.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.039
The rectangle is actually
six centimeters long.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.559
So it takes blank rectangles,

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.360
than centimeters,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.718
to measure the line.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.517
Well, since the rectangle is longer,

00:00:56.517 --> 00:00:58.456
it takes fewer rectangles than centimeters

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:00.302
to measure the line.

00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:02.359
So it's fewer rectangles than centimeters

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.345
and you see that.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:04.599
Fewer rectangles,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.807
one is fewer than six.

00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:07.861
It took one,

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.989
it only took one rectangle

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:09.732
to measure the line

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:11.369
because a rectangle's so long

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.249
and it took six centimeters
to measure the line.

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.652
So it took fewer
rectangles than centimeters

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:17.371
to measure the line.

00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.032
Let's keep going.

00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:21.968
Alright, so we have.

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.268
This is a rectangle.

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:25.033
Yes, that is a rectangle.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.716
Let's measure the blue line below

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:29.293
using both a rectangle
and a centimeter ruler.

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:30.849
So it's a similar idea.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:32.892
So, when we look at this blue line,

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.955
the line is now two of
these green rectangles long.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.788
So it is two rectangles long.

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:41.285
Now, in terms of centimeters,

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:42.656
it is four,

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:45.255
four centimeters long.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.869
Four centimeters long.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.375
The length of each rectangle is blank

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:51.571
than a centimeter.

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.765
Well, each rectangle is
more than a centimeter.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:54.589
It's longer.

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.795
You see, each rectangle is
actually two centimeters.

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:58.884
So, it's longer than a centimeter.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.724
So it takes blank
rectangles than centimeters

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:03.273
to measure the line.

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:04.991
Well, since each rectangle is longer,

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.674
it's going to take fewer rectangles

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:08.148
to measure the line.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:09.971
So we'll select fewer right over there

00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:11.109
and you see that over here.

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.651
It only took two rectangles
to measure the line,

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.184
but it took four centimeters.

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:19.689
Two is fewer than four.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.802
Let's see.

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:24.030
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.423
These are a lot of fun.

00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:27.083
Alright, this is a rectangle.

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.429
Let's measure the green line below.

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.627
Same idea.

00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:33.224
The line is four rectangles long.

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:36.869
The line is seven centimeters long.

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.423
The length of each rectangle is shorter,

00:02:39.423 --> 00:02:41.188
sorry, longer than a centimeter.

00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:41.942
You see that right here.

00:02:41.942 --> 00:02:45.065
Each rectangle is more
than one centimeter.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.863
So it takes fewer
rectangles than centimeters

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:48.745
to measure the line.

00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:49.860
So, we've seen this,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.652
we've seen this multiple times.
