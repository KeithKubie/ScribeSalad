This episode of Crash Course is brought to
you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.360
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course: Government
and Politics, and today, I've got my work

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.550
cut out for me because I'm going to try to
do something that every single social studies

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.060
teacher in the U.S. has tried to do, even
though there is a perfectly good cartoon you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.780
could just show. It's from the '70s. It's
catchy. It's fun.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.619
That's right, today we're going to learn how
a bill becomes a law. But we're not going

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.869
to be able to license the Schoolhouse Rock song.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.329
I'm just a bill, yes, I'm only a - you know
what has a bill? An eagle.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:41.269
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.840
Okay, I think the only way we're going to possibly
be able to compete with Schoolhouse Rock

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.200
is to jump right into the Thought Bubble with our own
cartoon. And to stop talking about Schoolhouse Rock.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.480
So let's start at the very beginning, which
in this case is a Congressman or a Senator

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.240
introducing a bill. The real beginning is
when he or she has an idea for a law. And

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.680
even this might come from an interest group,
the executive branch, or even the constituents.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.760
But the formal process begins with the
legislator introducing the bill.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060
After it's introduction, bill is referred to a committee.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.530
Although most bills can start in either house,
except for revenue bills, which must start

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.810
in THE House, let's imagine that our bill
starts in the Senate, because it's easier.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.520
Congress has the power to make rules concerning
the Armed Forces, so let's say this is a bill

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240
about naming helicopters. Anywho, this bill
would be referred to the Senate Armed Services

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.080
Committee, which would then write up the bill
in formal, legal language, or markup, and vote on it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.139
If the markup wins a majority in the committee,
it moves to the floor of the full Senate for consideration.

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.429
The Senate decides the rules for debate - how
long the debate will go on and whether or

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.929
not there will be amendments. An open rule
allows for amendments and a closed rule does

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.579
not. Open rules make it much less likely for
bills to pass because proponents of the bill

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.969
can add clauses that will make it hard for
the bill's proponents to vote for.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.560
If opponents of our helicopter name bill were
to add a clause repealing the Affordable Care

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.289
Act or something, some supporters of the bill
probably wouldn't vote for it. If a bill wins

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.329
the majority of the votes in the Senate, it
moves onto the House. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.940
We're going to have to go the rest of the
way without fancy animation. But I could sing it.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.040
Laaaa- I'm not going to sing it. I'm not
going to use a funny voice.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.389
The Senate version of the bill is sent to
the House. The House has an extra step, in

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.109
that all bills before they go out to the floor
of the House must go to the Rules Committee,

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.389
which reports it out to the House. If a bill
receives the majority of votes in the House,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.080
238 or more to be exact, it passes. YAY!

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.600
Now, this is important. The exact same bill
has to pass both houses before it can go to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.290
the president. This almost never happens though.
Usually the second house to get the bill will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.800
want to make some changes to it, and if this
happens, it will go to a conference committee,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.470
which is made up of members of both houses.
The conference committee attempts to reconcile

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.470
both versions of the bill and come up with a new
version, sometimes called a compromise bill.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.200
Okay, so if the Conference Committee reaches
a compromise, it then sends the bill back

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.010
to both houses for a new vote. If it passes,
then it's sent to the President. And then

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.450
the President signs the bill, boom, done.
That's the only option.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.990
Oh, no, there's two other options, actually.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.460
Option 2 is for him to veto the bill and we've
gone through all of this for nothing.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.640
The 3rd option is only available at the end
of a congressional term. If the President

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.090
neither signs nor vetoes the bill, and then
in the next 10 days, Congress goes out of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.460
session, the bill does not become a law.
This is called a pocket veto, and is only

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.800
used when the President doesn't want a law to pass,
but for political reasons, doesn't want to veto it either.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.420
Congress can avoid this all together by passing
bills and giving them to the President before

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.220
that 10 day period. If the President neither
signs nor vetoes a law and Congress remains

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.300
in session for more then 10 days, the bill
becomes a law without the President's signature.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.440
So that's the basic process, but there is one wrinkle,
or if you want to be all Madisonian about it,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.880
check, on the president's power.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.720
If Congress really wanted a bill and the President
has vetoed it, they can override the veto

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.900
if it gets a 2/3rd majority in both houses on
a second vote. Then the bill becomes a law

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.180
over the President's signature. Aw snap!

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.690
This is really rare, but it does happen once
in a great while. The Taft-Hartley Act of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.840
1953 passed over Truman's veto. I like to
call it the Tartley Act.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.720
Shorten it. It's a portmanteau.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.820
It doesn't happen that often because if the
President knows that two thirds of the Congressmen

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.920
supported the bill, he won't veto it. And
if Congress knows that they don't have two

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.200
thirds support, they won't try to override
the veto. Nobody wants to try something and

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.420
fail in public, right? Except for me obviously,
if you look at my other YouTube channel, WheezyWaiter.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.480
Eh.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.020
So there you have it, how a bill becomes a
law. I'll admit, the process is a little cumbersome,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.350
but it's designed that way so that we don't
get a lot of stupid or dangerous laws. Still

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.130
this doesn't quite explain why so few laws
get passed. Bills have a very high mortality

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.170
rate, and it's way more common for a bill
not to become a law than to become one.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.780
The main reason is that there are so many places
where a bill can die.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.199
The first place that a bill can die is at
the murderous hands of the speaker or majority

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.850
leader, who refuses to refer it to committee.
Then the committee can kill the bill by not

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.420
voting for it at all. And if they do vote
and it doesn't get a majority then the bill

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.480
doesn't go to the floor, and it's dead.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.630
In the Senate the murderous leadership can
kill a bill by refusing to schedule a vote

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.900
on it. And any senator can filibuster the
bill which is when he or she threatens to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.530
keep debating until the bill is tabled. It's
a bit more complex than that, but the filibuster

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.600
rules have changed recently, so hopefully we won't
have as many filibuster threats in the future.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.460
The House doesn't have a filibuster but it
does have a Rules Committee that can kill

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.230
a bill by not creating a rule for debate.
The entire House can also vote to recommit

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.820
the bill to committee, which is a signal to
drop the bill or change it significantly.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.070
And of course if either house fails to give
a bill a majority of votes, then it dies.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.340
This applies to compromise bills coming out
of conference committees too. Even if a bill

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.440
gets a majority in both houses then there's that whole
veto thing that the President can do. Remember?

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.910
So, there are many more ways for a bill to
be killed than to become a law. These hurdles

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.060
are sometimes called veto gates.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.360
They can't call 'em Bill Gates because that's
a person.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.100
Veto gates make it very difficult for Congress
to act unless there's broad agreement or the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.820
issue is uncontroversial like naming a post
office or thanking specific groups of veterans

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.560
for their service, which are two things that
Congress actually does pretty efficiently.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.400
Think of all the post offices that aren't
named. You can't think of one, can you?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.920
Name it. You can't. It's not named.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.360
Veto gates are purely procedural, which means
they don't draw a lot of attention from the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.120
media. The easiest way for Congress to kill
bills is to simply not vote on them or even

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.710
schedule votes for them. This way they don't
have to go on record as being for or against

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.120
a bill, just whether they support having a vote. And
constituents rarely check up on this sort of thing.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.780
So I hope I managed to do a good job of both
explaining how a bill becomes a law and why

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.139
it's difficult for most bills to pass. And
I hope I looked good doing it, as well.

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.530
This might be frustrating but it's strangely
comforting to consider that Congress and the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.520
government as a whole were designed to make it
difficult to get things done. A single super-powerful

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.700
executive like a king can be very efficient, but also
tyrannical. We don't like tyrannical around here.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.010
The founders set up these structural hurdles
of the bicameral Congress and the presidential

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.310
role in legislation to reduce the likelihood
that authoritarian laws would pass. Congress

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.060
added procedural hurdles like committees and
filibusters for the same reason. You can argue

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.590
that Congress has become dysfunctional, but
looking at the process of lawmaking, it's

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.860
hard to argue that this isn't by design.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.760
So next time someone accuses you of being difficult,
you just say, "I was behaving in a senatorial manner."

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.790
