00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's use this idea of work and for now I'm going to call work F  Î”x.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It just means some force times some change in position. This x could also be y.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm just going to use x for now and let's think of a very simple way of moving water from here up.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, one thing we can do is well, why not install a ladder.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can take our bucket down to where this water is sort of leaking in, fill it up, carry it up.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You need to tell me, how much work is required to lift a 5 kg bucket of water 7 m?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Enter your answer here and I'll tell you the unit.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is big J which stands for joules and that's just the unit for work--well, get more into that later.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Be careful. The answer is not just 5  7. Okay. Enter your answer there.
