TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.730
to the "Developer Show."

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.940
I'm your host, Timothy
Jordan, and this

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.900
is a quick view of what happened
in the last week, also known

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.351
as the TLDR.

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.850
First, in the world
Android, there's

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.410
a new fingerprint API
sample available to help you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.060
authenticate to remote servers.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.260
The Play Game Services
tools set has a new feature

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.800
that will help you balance
your virtual economy so

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.340
that you can earn more
with in-game purchases.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.195
Get started with Android and
Android Studio, and zombies,

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.320
with a new video from some
of your favorite Android

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.060
experts shot at the spooky
YouTube space in LA.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.280
And the Big Android BBQ
happened last week in Texas.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400
Learn more about improving
Android performance

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.550
and more with
videos from the BBQ

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.480
on the Android
developer's channel now.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.560
On the show today
are Ian and Katherine

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.010
to talk about Android and more.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.590
IAN LAKE: Yee-haw.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.959
KATHERINE KUAN: Hi, Timothy.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Brillo and
Weave are a platform for IoT,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.630
and the invite program
is now taking requests

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.680
to join so that you can
access code, documentation,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.470
and the developer console.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.100
And three big
announcements in the area

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.030
of training-- one, an Android
developer immersive training

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.300
course is going to be
offered in January, 2016

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
as part of a partnership between
General Assembly and Google

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.350
Developers.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.340
There are also now courses
for developing apps

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.640
for Android Wear, Google Cast,
Android TV, and Android Auto--

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.250
all your favorite
new form factors.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.100
Check out the blog posts
linked below for info on each.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.860
And the tech
entrepreneur Nanodegree

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.810
has launched on Udacity.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.590
It helps you learn what it takes
to design, validate, prototype,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.450
monetize, and market
apps and grow them

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.250
into a scalable business.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.870
OK, in the area of the
web, you can dramatically

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.030
improve the performance
of your web pages

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.580
with the Accelerated
Mobile Pages project.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.130
This and similar presentations
were given at the SFHTML5

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.320
Meetup last week and are
now available to watch

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.140
on their YouTube channel.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650
The Chrome Dev Summit
is coming up soon.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.420
Check out the
schedule and speakers

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.680
now live on the event site.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.510
And on the show today
to talk about the web

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.010
is Paul Backhouse.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.440
PAUL BACKHOUSE: What up?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: With that,
this message from Texas.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.010
-Hey, everybody, we're here
at the Big Android BBQ.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.630
I'm Timothy.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.300
-I'm Colt.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.186
-I'm Chet.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.810
-And it's too bad
that you're not here,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.559
but that doesn't mean
you have to miss out

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:34.710
on all the awesome content.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.770
-That's right, because we have
the videos from the Big Android

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.770
BBQ online right now on the
Android Developers YouTube

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.610
channel just for you.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.162
-And you, and you, and the
one in the back there, but not

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:48.120
the person next to him.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.900
-Well, no, but they're
here at the show,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.066
so it's not really for them.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.040
-So it's also for them.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.550
-But it's not for them.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.050
-No, but they saw it.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.855
-They're going to keep going.

00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:54.605
-They saw it live.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:56.520
-You can check out
the playlist any time.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.220
-I love the Big Android BBQ.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.200
It's an entire weekend
of nerding out.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.270
It's just wonderful.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.260
-Now listen here,
we got two things

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.565
on the agenda besides that--
keynote, performance, barbecue.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.330
-And, again, ROS
stands for Run of Slot.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.600
-Welcome to "Forget the
Storage Permission."

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.020
It's not often we go
to a tech conference

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.081
and get to go to a talk
where we're specifically

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:22.330
going to be forgetting things.

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:27.090
-Welcome to my talk.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.440
We're going to go
over system sleep.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.815
I know you're all
really excited.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.844
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:39.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: (TEXAS
ACCENT) And that was the BBQ.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.279
I got this hat for
going to the BBQ.

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.320
IAN LAKE: Do you like it?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.206
KATHERINE KUAN: What
else did you bring us?

00:03:44.206 --> 00:03:45.330
IAN LAKE: Barbecue, I hope.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, so I'm not
going to keep up the accent,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.821
but I am going to keep the hat
on in honor of the Big Android

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.080
BBQ.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.744
Pretty great time
out there, a lot

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:53.910
of great videos on playlist.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.600
IAN LAKE: Mm-hmm, so many.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
we're going to check this out.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.880
So the Fingerprint API, I'm
really excited about this.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.730
I've been trying to make other
people excited about this, too.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.050
But I think it's hard to draw
the connection from passwords

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.470
totally suck to
biometric recognition

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.760
helps solve the problem to,
hey, this is a cool API.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.262
But it is.

00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:14.720
IAN LAKE: Really hard on mobile,
because you're trading off

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.149
that security for the actual
usefulness of the feature,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.120
and fingerprint
actually goes a long way

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.262
of making it super easy
to actually be secure.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.470
KATHERINE KUAN: But what
about the devices that don't

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.724
have the fingerprint sensor?

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:28.640
IAN LAKE: Well, that's
part about this samples

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.170
is it's built on
the key store API.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Aha!

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.910
IAN LAKE: Which
works on all devices,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.120
even if they don't have
fingerprint sensors.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.640
KATHERINE KUAN: Oh, OK.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.473
IAN LAKE: You actually
a confirm credentials

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:39.440
sample which goes through that
whole flow of going back to--

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you might
as well get started with it.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.746
And then as more devices
get those sensors,

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:43.745
it's just going to work.

00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:44.495
IAN LAKE: Magical.

00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:45.889
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Magical, OK.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.430
The other thing that
I wanted to talk

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.260
about in the world
of Android is getting

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.240
started with Android and
Android Studio and zombies.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.350
Let's talk about this in a
moment, but first, the clip.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.419
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.960
-I'm going to step you through
the process of getting started

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.880
with Android, using Android
Studio, while also sharing

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.220
some pro tips based on the
experiences of a real Android

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.720
start-up.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.040
[YELLING]

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.290
-Well, that was unexpected.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.750
-What the hell was that?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.770
What's going on?

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.860
-Zombies.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.040
Obviously those were zombies.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.760
I don't know, how but I bet the
bald guy's somehow to blame.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.010
-Oh, sure, solve one problem
with the Android Nomicon,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.180
and suddenly this is my fault?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.560
-How are we going to
survive a zombie apocalypse?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.237
We don't have any training.

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:46.820
It's not like we can
go to Google Play

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.001
and download an app.

00:05:53.182 --> 00:05:54.881
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And it kind
of looks like he got away.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.740
IAN LAKE: Uh, you
could say that.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.980
You could say that.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.884
You'll have to watch
the full video.

00:06:01.884 --> 00:06:03.300
It is one of those
videos you want

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.591
to watch the whole way through.

00:06:04.591 --> 00:06:06.020
PAUL BACKHOUSE:
Oh, what a teaser.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.130
IAN LAKE: At least, you've got
to see what happens, right?

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.590
That's the whole point.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: But it
is one of those videos,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.860
and that's what's so, I
think, unique about it

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.937
is that as for a
Getting Started video,

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:15.770
I wanted to watch every
single minute of it.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.830
IAN LAKE: Well, zombies are fun.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.770
IAN LAKE: Well, not
fun-fun, but, you

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.360
know, like it's
engaging, and when

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.350
we're talking about tools
and stuff like that,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.380
you've got to start
at the basics, right?

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.290
So this gives us
a really good way

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.480
of kind of going
through semi-real life.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.850
Maybe your start-up isn't
going against zombies,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.225
but going up
against an equally--

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:37.766
PAUL BACKHOUSE:
Maybe it will, right?

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:38.727
I mean, you never know.

00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:40.560
IAN LAKE: Yeah, it could
be anything, right?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.101
It doesn't have to
be zombies, right?

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.560
But it's just as important to
get through these same steps.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.226
KATHERINE KUAN: And
I think that's where

00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:48.950
a lot of the beginners drop off
because they get stuck on how

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.169
to actually set everything up.

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.460
IAN LAKE: Yeah, and once you
actually get an app going,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.530
then it's pretty easy to
make those little changes

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.630
and stuff to make it awesome.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, and
I think for our audience,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.321
if you've been wanting to get
started in Android development,

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.580
or if maybe one of
your "friends--"

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.510
that means you-- haven't
had the chance yet,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.600
please check this one out.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.080
I think it's a really great way
to get started with Android.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.420
IAN LAKE: Fantastic.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.594
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And zombies.

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:12.510
IAN LAKE: And zombies.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And zombies.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.750
All right, moving
over to the web.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.210
Last week, the SFHTML5
Meetup happened,

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.360
and one of the big topics
discussed was the AMP Project.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.810
Paul, tell us about
the AMP Project.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.190
Why is it important?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.320
PAUL BACKHOUSE: So you
know I love the web, right?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.580
KATHERINE KUAN: Hmm-mm.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.780
PAUL BACKHOUSE:
Right now, if you

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.395
look at the mobile web,
especially the part that

00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:34.520
is new sites and bigger
sites, you really never

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.390
get to the content
because it's just really,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.630
really cluttered with ads
and beacons an analytics.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You get
to the content eventually.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.670
PAUL BACKHOUSE: Well,
eventually, right?

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.020
IAN LAKE: Four-second load time.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.853
PAUL BACKHOUSE: But so,
after three seconds,

00:07:45.853 --> 00:07:48.650
it turns out that 40%
of all users drop off,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.574
and after 10 seconds,
everyone drops off.

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:51.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's huge.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.323
PAUL BACKHOUSE: Which
is crazy, right?

00:07:53.323 --> 00:07:56.410
So that seems to be huge
issue, at least I think so.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.840
And a lot of other people
thought so as well, including

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.050
publishers, because in this
conflict of interest scenario,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.470
they want a great
user experience,

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.450
but they also want
money, turns out.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.130
So the AMP Project
is a way to fix that.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.650
It's born by all those partners
and companies, and what it does

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.910
is it's a restricted HML
framework, sort of library,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.550
that you put in
your page, and then

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.180
it controls what can be
loaded, what can't, and they

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.840
kind of flow.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.500
And so it means that
you can't actually

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.230
make your page slow anymore.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.700
IAN LAKE: So it's
fast by default.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.700
PAUL BACKHOUSE: Exactly.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.992
IAN LAKE: Oh, that's fantastic.

00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:31.783
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we
should note, though,

00:08:31.783 --> 00:08:33.000
that it's still pretty early.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.280
So it's a good time to check it
out and start playing with it

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.330
and give feedback.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.010
PAUL BACKHOUSE: Yeah, that's
the whole purpose really.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.390
Like, Lounge is sometimes
slated maybe for next year,

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.780
but we want people to
check it out very early

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.489
and work with us.

00:08:45.489 --> 00:08:46.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool, wow.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.060
IAN LAKE: Perf matters,
especially for the mobile web,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.730
right?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hashtag #perfmatters.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.430
And for the last clip
of our show today,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.370
the Electronic Frontier
Foundation recently

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.200
had their 25th
anniversary party,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.350
and we sent along our
senior Open Internet

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.408
Correspondent, Derek Slater.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:06.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.540
-I'm here with Cindy Cohn,
the Executive Director

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.190
of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.700
Cindy, can you tell us more
about what the Electronic

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.400
Frontier Foundation is?

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.060
-Well, the EFF is around to make
sure that when you go online,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.220
your rights go with you.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.960
So we do legal cases.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.990
We do policy work.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.100
We build technologies,
all designed

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.460
to make sure that
the internet stays

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.150
free, open, and a place
of privacy and security

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.400
for everybody.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.380
-The things that we, as longtime
supporters of EFF care about,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.750
are now basic
human rights issues

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.951
that everyone cares about.

00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:39.200
-We're here with Will Wheaton.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.650
Will, thanks for joining us.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.730
-I'm happy to be here.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.950
-Will, how did you get involved
with the Electronic Frontier

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.450
Foundation?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.509
What brought you to them?

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:47.550
-I found out about Electronic
Frontier Foundation

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.870
right after Operation Sundevil.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.760
I knew a fair number of people
that were involved in that just

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.470
from IRC and bulletin
board systems,

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.490
and I thought the EFF
was doing for our rights

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.750
online what ACLU is
doing for our rights

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.340
in our meatspace world.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.010
And it was in 2002
that I finally

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.200
had an opportunity to really get
involved with the organization.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.940
-EFF has a building full of look
like astounding ninja lawyers

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.014
and activists and technologists
and just killer nerds.

00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:23.680
-What would you say
to developers today?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.405
What can they do to help support
the fight for internet freedom

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:28.270
in coding and beyond?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.977
-I think that apart from
supporting the EFF in general,

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:32.560
which is like a
really important thing

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.642
to do, not just
with your dollars,

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:36.100
but also with your
name and getting

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.540
involved in sort
of the phone-ins

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.220
and the mass
letter-writing campaigns.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.430
I think developing
software that considers

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.730
the privacy needs
of everyday people,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.900
of people who
aren't super nerds,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.527
is a really important
dimension here.

00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:51.610
-Well, the first thing
that developers ought to do

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.330
is make sure that
you're developing tools

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.930
for a world you want to live in.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.430
Make sure they've
got security, make

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.180
sure you keep your users'
protections in mind,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.370
make sure you would want
to be a user of the tools

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.170
that you build.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.140
I think this is an
important time right now,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.170
where developing security
from the very beginning

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.090
of technologies is
tremendously important, more

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.450
important than ever before.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:11.950
-Great.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.780
Thank you, Cindy.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.465
-Thank you all, to EFF,
to Cindy and to Sherry.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:17.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
just before we go,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.530
I'd like to ask the panel
a question, as usual.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.050
What is going to be
your next BBQ start-up?

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.510
IAN LAKE: I really want to
bring our zombie start-up

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.286
to meter, barbecue on delivery.

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.410
That's a great idea, right?

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.618
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's an
excellent idea, but barbecue,

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:34.370
not brains.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.311
IAN LAKE: It's a barbecue, yes.

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:38.060
KATHERINE KUAN: Even
better than delivery,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.240
I want to do a start-up
that 3D prints burgers,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.574
so you can just have a snack
in the middle of the night.

00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:45.698
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Burgers in
the middle of the night,

00:11:45.698 --> 00:11:47.480
it's what all of us
need, all the time.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.604
PAUL BACKHOUSE: That's
nice, but what I really need

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:53.450
is an infinite strip of
bacon, like bacon tape.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
winner-- winner right there.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.670

the "Developer Show" this week.

at this code all day.
