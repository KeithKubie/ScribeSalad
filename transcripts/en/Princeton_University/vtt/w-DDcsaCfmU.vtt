00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.140
DAVID MILLER: There are more
people on earth every day.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.900
And they all need to be fed.


00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.420
This means we have to increase
the amount of agricultural

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.900
production on the planet.


00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.580
But it also means that we have
to increase the nitrogen

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.200
fertilizers that
are being used.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.260
This is leading to much larger
emissions of gases such as

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.650
nitrous oxide into
the atmosphere.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.950
My name is David Miller, and
I'm helping to coordinate a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.940
student-led independent
project.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.070
Our team of nine engineering
graduate students are working

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.170
to develop and deploy fast,
compact, and low-power sensors

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.870
based on a new technology,
mid-infrared lasers.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.730
The main goal of MIRTHE is to
build the next generation of

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.790
environmental sensors.


00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.020
As part of MIRTHE's interest in
new ideas and applications,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.910
the center provided a first-time
opportunity for

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.570
students to lead and manage
a fully funded

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820
field research project.


00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.280 position:97%
 


00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.910
MIRTHE and it's director,
Professor Claire Gmachl were

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.440
extremely supportive of us.


00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.090 position:97%
 


00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.980
We design and engineer our
sensors so that the laser can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.520
trace a long path to increase
the sensitivity of our

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.260
measurements.


00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.710
To do this, we bounce the laser
many times between two

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.270
mirrors, which is known as
a multipass optical cell.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.910 position:97%
 


00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.420
So this is a mid-infrared
laser, the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.570
quantum cascade laser.


00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780
The beam comes out through
a lens here.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.520
The beam is directed by these
mirrors through this hole,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.290
into the sampling cell,
where the beam

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810
passes multiple times.


00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.430
The exit beam again goes
through the hole.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.630
And it's focused right
onto the detector.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.710
We can see signals from nitrous
oxide, acetylene, and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.900
carbon monoxide.


00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.600
Many kinds of human activities
lead to the emissions of both

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.630
greenhouse gases and
air pollutants.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.060
We need to understand their
impacts on both climate and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.110
air quality.


00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.070
We took our sensors into the
field, to a location between

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.380
Washington, DC and Baltimore:
Beltsville, Maryland, where

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.120
there are both agricultural
and urban activities.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.150
So we compared our measurements
with the typical

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.330
method, collaborating with the
scientists from the USDA.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.030
We were really surprised that it
worked the first time out.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.280
Normally, when you're working
with sensors, the first time

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.080
it doesn't work out
right away.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.480
This is exactly the engineering
process.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.540
You know you have a problem to
solve, but you don't know

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.850
exactly how.


00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.540
So you try something.


00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.850
And even if it fails, you can
usually see what it takes to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.490
make it work.


00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.800
We hope that one day our
sensors will be able to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.320
measure trace gases on a large
scale, so that people

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.250
everywhere can understand
their effects on the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.550
atmosphere.
