00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.016
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This question is a little bit more challenging. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here, the absolute value

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:07.696
of p plus 3 and 4 has to equal 12. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's think about this p plus 3 as a

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:11.848
number. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know p is really a number, so this inside part will be some number.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.926
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I won't know it though. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which numbers make this statement true? Check all

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.961
the boxes that apply. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And again, think about what the meaning of absolute

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.040
value is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good luck.
