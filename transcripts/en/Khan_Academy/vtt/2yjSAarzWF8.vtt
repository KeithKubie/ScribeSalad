00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.070
The graph below contains
triangle ABC and the point P.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.700
Draw the image of triangle
ABC under a dilation whose

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.970
center is P and a
scale factor of 2.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.060
So essentially, we
want to scale this

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.380
so that every point is going
to be twice as far away from P.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.230
So for example,
B right over here

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.770
has the same y-coordinate
as P, but its x-coordinate

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.900
is three more.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.590
So we want to be twice as far.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
So if this maps to point B, we
just want to go twice as far.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.580
So we're at 3 away,
we want to go 6 away.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.870
So point P's x-coordinate
is at 3, now we're at 9.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.220
Likewise, point C
is 3 below P. Well

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.090
we want to go twice as
far, so we'll go 3 more.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.400
And point A is 4 above P.
Well we want to go 4 more.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.570
We want to go twice as
far-- one, two, three, four.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.937
And we get right over there.

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:58.520
Then they ask us,
what are the lengths

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.350
of side AB and its image?

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.320
AB right over
here, let's see, we

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.230
might have to apply
the distance formula.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.780
Let's see, it's the
base right over here.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.090
The change in x between the two
is 3 and the change in y is 4,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.630
so this is actually a
3, 4, 5 right triangle.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.770
3 squared plus 4 squared
is equal to 5 squared.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.447
So AB is 5 units long.

00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:27.030
Essentially just
using the Pythagorean

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760
theorem to figure that out.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.740
And its image, well it's
image should be twice as long.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.240
And let's see whether
that actually is the case.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.640
So this is a base right over
here that's of length 6.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.515
This has a height, or this
change in y, I could say.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:45.890
Because I'm really just trying
to figure out this length,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.390
which is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990
I don't have my drawing
tool, so I apologize.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.940
But this height right here is 8.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.510
So 8 squared is 64,
plus 6 squared is 36,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.280
that's 100, which is 10 squared.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.620
So notice, our scale factor
of 2, the corresponding side

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.990
got twice as long.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.009
Each of these points
got twice as far away

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.860
from our center of dilation.
