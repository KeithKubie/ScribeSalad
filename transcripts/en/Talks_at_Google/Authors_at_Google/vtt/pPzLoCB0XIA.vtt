JEFFREY FREBURG: Welcome,
everyone.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.450
I want to introduce Chef Jose.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.820
Thanks for coming
to Google today.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.120
JOSE GARCES: It's a pleasure
to be here.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.480
Thank you.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.030
JEFFREY FREBURG: So let us
know about your new book.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.610
Tell us about the book.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550
JOSE GARCES: The book is called
"The Latin Rode Home,"

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.770
and it's my second cookbook.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.390
The first cookbook that
I launched was "Latin

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.740
Evolution" in 2008.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.610
And the book is really a much
stripped down version.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.790
It's not "Latin Evolution,"
it's like what "Latin

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.320
Evolution" became.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.950
So it's those recipes that
really turned into the "Latin

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.050
Evolution.'

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.150
It's also a travelogue.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.230
It's a memoir of five Spanish
speaking countries that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.180
inspired my cooking for
the last 10 years.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.960
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.890
So I know that you have
15 restaurants now.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.770
Tell us about how you opened
your first restaurant, and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000
about scaling so many
restaurants in such a short

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.230
amount of time, which is
pretty impressive.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.510
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.230
So my first restaurant, Amada,
opened in 2005, and I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.860
basically opened that with a
small business loan, a couple

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.980
private equity investors,
and we were

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.440
able to pull it together.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.160
And Amada had quite a bit of
success, and from that came

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.280
many opportunities, and I also
had several other concepts

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.400
that I had brewing in my mind.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.950
So with the opportunities, we
looked at ways to develop

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.770
these concepts, and the
rest is history.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.500
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah,
so like I said,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.360
you've scaled so quickly.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.350
What kind of challenges have
you had in scaling so many

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.380
restaurants in such a short
amount of time?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.570
JOSE GARCES: There's usually
your typical construction.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.030
And then with leases and
negotiations, that sort of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.830
business constraints.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.220
But for the most part,
it's been a pretty

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
smooth and easy ride.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.670
I think, yeah, I feel pretty
fortunate about that.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.350
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.910
So do you work with a design
team to come up

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.580
with interior designs?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.610
How much of an influence
do you have on that?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.340
And what do you focus on when
you're thinking about your

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.060
next concept?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.610
JOSE GARCES: Well, I have a
design firm that I've worked

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.540
with since we started
Amada in 2005.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.300
They're called Creme Design,
and they're out of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.770
Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.110
And the chief designer,
Jun Aizaki, is now a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.850
close friend of mine.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.260
We've designed probably
85% of my restaurants

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.730
has been with Creme.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.230
And so we usually would walk
the spaces together.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.590
We might travel somewhere.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.670
So, for instance, in order to
design Amada, we were in San

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.040
Sebastian and Barcelona, and
started to really get a look

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.740
and feel for the cuisine
and the culture and the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.590
different--

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.960
and really, really to capture
that feeling of a Spanish

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.220
Tapas restaurant.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.500
For Distrito, our Mexican
concept--

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.790
modern Mexican concept--

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.700
Jun and I both traveled to
Mexico City, and we brought

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.420
back some of the flash, the
glamour, the energy from

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.150
Mexico City to design
Distrito.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.240
So those types of travel
experiences and working hand

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.220
in hand with Jun for many years
has given us the ability

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.320
to design some pretty
neat spaces.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.040
JEFFREY FREBURG: So I just want
to go back a little ways.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.600
How did you get involved
in cooking?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.640
JOSE GARCES: I always enjoyed
cooking as a kid.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.590
My mom and my grandma were
fantastic cooks.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.660
They cooked great meals for us
at home growing up, and it was

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.090
typically an Ecuadorian meal.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.720
So I had that kind of
Latin upbringing.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.720
And with time, I went to two
years of undergrad, and still

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.300
hadn't really found something
that was driving me or a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.340
passion at that point,
and I realized

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.360
that I enjoyed cooking.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.310
So I visited a culinary school
in Chicago called Kendall

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.140
College, and kind of like the
minute I got there I enjoyed

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.970
seeing the discipline
that was involved--

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.390
the white coats, the
tall white hats,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.140
that sort of thing.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.550
And it was just like, it
just felt right to me.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.810
JEFFREY FREBURG: So are there
are certain things that your

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.400
mom made that are just that go
to meal for you or anything?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.460
Or anything that kind of really
focused you on cooking?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.655
JOSE GARCES: I think that there
were several experiences

00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:37.140
that I had growing up, whether
it was having empanadas on

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.280
Sunday watching a Bears game--

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.270
I grew up in Chicago--

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.450
or having had this
[? locro, ?]

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.550
which is an Ecuadorian potato
chowder with avocado, poached

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.700
egg, pork skins that are cooked
into the chowder.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.270
I would say those are just two
examples of hearty, wholesome

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.100
dishes that always bring me back
to my childhood and have

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.280
inspired me to this day.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.610
JEFFREY FREBURG: So
where are most of

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.520
your restaurants located?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.300
JOSE GARCES: Well, my home base
is in Philadelphia, and

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.560
that's kind of where we started,
and so we have seven

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.330
restaurants in Philadelphia.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.710
I have a restaurant in Chicago
called Mercat A La Planxa.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.060
And this year, we did a big
push, and we do the food and

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.270
beverage management of two
hotels, one in Scottsdale,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.590
Arizona called the Saguaro, we
have a Distrito and Old Town

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.780
whiskey there.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.030
And in Palm Springs, we have
Tinto, which is our Basque

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.930
tapas brand, and El Hefe, a new
tequila and taco concept.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.970
JEFFREY FREBURG: See, the reason
I was asking why so

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.010
many restaurants are in
Pennsylvania is because I'm a

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.840
Chicago boy, so how come--

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.170
are you going to plan on putting
more restaurants in

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.410
Chicago, or--

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.770
JOSE GARCES: Yeah, we
really like Chicago.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.070
I mean, I get there at least
four or five times a year for

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.530
the restaurant.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.860
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.280
It's a great restaurant
town, too.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.670
JOSE GARCES: It's a great
restaurant town.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.690
I've known it for years.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.690
We just haven't focused our
energy on it, but it's top of

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.810
the list right now.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.110
JEFFREY FREBURG: And can you
tell us some of your favorite

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.760
restaurants in Chicago?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.630
JOSE GARCES: Sure.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.410
I have a good friend who I
worked with on the National

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.030
Pork Board.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.350
We were both celebrity chef
ambassadors, pork lovers, and

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.290
his name is Paul Kahan, and
he has some of my favorite

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.350
restaurants in Chicago.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.960
He has Publican, he's got a
great taco and whiskey concept

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.690
called Big Star, and
Avec, as well.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.410
So I like his places.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.920
And when I get to Chicago,
I also--

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.150
right down the street from
Mercat, which is located on

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.580
the South loop, I go to kind of
an English pub called the

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.380
Gauge, which is just homey
and a favorite.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.335
And of course the Wiener
Circle as well.

00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:55.440
JEFFREY FREBURG: That's the
best place for a hotdog.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.120
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.935
JEFFREY FREBURG: So when was the
last time you cooked for

00:06:57.935 --> 00:07:00.570
your family, and what are
some of the go to

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.110
meals that you prepare?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.380
JOSE GARCES: So typically, we
cook on Saturday and Sunday.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.230
When I say we, my wife
and I, Beatrice.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.800
She's of Cuban descent.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.860
So that's our favorite time to
bond, to kind of spend some

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.790
good family time.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.610
And so we'll do some menu
planning, and she'll actually

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.710
do a lot of the prep.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.920
So she'll get her board, get
her knife out, and once the

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.440
prep is done, I'll end
up cooking it all.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.620
JEFFREY FREBURG: So that
works out pretty well.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.820
JOSE GARCES: Yeah, no, it's
actually a great team effort,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.020
and again, I think a great
family activity.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.100
And lately, some of our most
memorable meals have been at

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.140
our farm, which we've had
for about two years.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.820
It's north of Philadelphia
in Bucks county.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.320
It's a 40 acre farm.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.640
We have about a seven acre
garden, which we planted, and

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.310
we are raising vegetables,
produce,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.860
chickens, bees, grown mushrooms.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.630
And all that produce is going
to the restaurants in

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.480
Philadelphia and
Atlantic City.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.470
So some of my most memorable
family meals have been there.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.560
We have this outdoor kitchen,
and it's just really about

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.070
eating super healthy, super
light, very fresh.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.430
And they've been right
off the farm, yeah.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.700
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.225
So I love the farm concept that
you really incorporate

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:27.400
into your restaurants,
and that's

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.990
something that we do here.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.700
Why did you decide to go that
route, which I really respect?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.659
What was your driving
factor with that?

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.429
JOSE GARCES: Well, to be honest,
I was looking for a

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.549
second home, and somewhere
that I could retreat to.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.930
And we really--

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.740
most people in Philly do the
Jersey Shore, like, head down

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.440
to the shore.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.010
I was looking for something a
little more relaxing, and so I

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.180
looked in Bucks County, and I
just found a lot of these farm

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.030
properties that were
available.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:07.130
And it was hard to find the
property that had the retreat

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.740
and the farming peace, and we
were fortunate to find one.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.300
And so once we got it, was
really just going to be a

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.120
second home, but I saw the farm,
saw the garden, and my

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.080
natural instincts took over.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.740
And before we knew it, we had
invested in deer fencing, a

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.600
new well, a tractor, an
organic farm crew

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.630
that's there every day.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.180
And it's become quite an
undertaking, and one that I'm

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.170
proud of and look forward
to seeing the

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.530
results in the future.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.660
JEFFREY FREBURG: So
how big is it?

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.870
I know you mentioned it earlier
but-- and are there

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.950
any plans to expand that?

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.590
JOSE GARCES: Currently it's
seven acres, and we farm--

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:57.850
it's a seven acre garden, and
this year was more of like a

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.260
testing period, where we had
about 100 different varieties

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:07.460
of whether it was peppers,
herbs, micrograins.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.940
The thought was to see what the
soil would give so we had

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.460
a real accurate plan
for next year.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.590
But in addition to the produce,
we have bees that are

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.790
producing honey that pollinate
the crops.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.950
JEFFREY FREBURG: And you can use
that in your restaurant?

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.380
JOSE GARCES: Could use that
in the restaurants.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.950
We have these different logs
that it's more of a log

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.090
mushroom farm.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.470
And we also put in a pretty big
greenhouse, so I'm excited

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.160
to see what we can do there
in the wintertime.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.340
And the thought is, and thus far
this year we've been able

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.970
to do two deliveries per week
into the 10 restaurants.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.050
So we have seven restaurants in
Philadelphia and three in

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.270
Atlantic City, which is just
another hour south.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.300
So it's been a pretty
successful program.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.630
And it's also forced our chefs
to kind of really be local,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.700
and really get creative with
some of the varieties of

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.340
vegetables and herbs that
we were growing.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.680
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.320
So how much produce comes from
your gardens that you can use

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.110
in your restaurant?

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.020
Is it 10%, 20%?

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.160
JOSE GARCES: It's probably--

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.850
this year I would say it's
been about 25% to 35%.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.560
JEFFREY FREBURG: And so with
the addition of the

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.280
greenhouse, do you have a set
plan of what you want to grow

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.500
in there, or what you're
going to try?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:23.770
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.340
Well, we use typically--

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.170
some of my favorite micrograins
are micro-arugula,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.110
micro-basil, micro-cilantro.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:40.300
And so we think that we can have
a good yield on those,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.810
and they're ones that can
be quite pricey as

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.210
you start to like--

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.750
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah, I know.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.900
JOSE GARCES: And then in the
spring, we'll probably start

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.530
all our seedlings there.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:55.650
But to be honest, it's
an evolving process.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.360
It's an evolving process to
find out what the right

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.530
financial solutions are to
making it a sustainable farm.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.000
So we're under, we're in that
mode right now, and I'd also

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.370
like to eventually have goats
and make goat cheese.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.370
It's one of my favorite
cheeses.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.330
But first things first.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:16.780
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.190
So do you know what you're going
to try to plant next

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.270
year, and what didn't
work this year?

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:27.820
JOSE GARCES: We had some soil
erosion issues, which--

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.340
when it rained, water pockets
collected in certain areas and

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.470
drowned some of the plants
that we had.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:39.120
So we have to grade our soil
a little better this year,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.270
create some drainage.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.470
And so that was a learning
experience for me.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.850
That was one where we
just didn't see it

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.360
coming, and it happened.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.150
So we're looking to
improve that.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.720
And I think for the most part,
everything we put in the

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.870
ground worked.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.800
Potatoes didn't work, and we
had a rough time with some

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.980
melons and certain varieties
of tomatoes.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.270
But for the most part,
everything we put in worked,

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.780
and it was, again,
quite abundant.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.890
We had about 1,000 pounds that
we were harvesting a week at a

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:12.440
certain point.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:12.710
JEFFREY FREBURG: Really?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.660
That's impressive.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.890
JOSE GARCES: Not bad
for Pennsylvania.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.395
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah,
no, definitely.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:17.460
Definitely.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.740
So everyone always wants
to know this.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.030
What are some of your favorite
kitchen tools?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.870
And if you were to assemble a
knife kit that really boils it

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.210
all down to, what's in there?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.380
JOSE GARCES: Well, I think
having sharp knives is the

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.850
most important thing.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.930
And I have a Mac--

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.750
Mac knife, it's a
Japanese brand--

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.580
which I really like.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.350
It's an eight inch,
really versatile.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.650
It can do vegetables, you could
clean fish with it.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.590
And I keep it super sharp.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.660
So I think the chef's knife is
the most important piece of

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.690
equipment you can have.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.530
A good cutting board.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.890
But I like gadgets, too, so--

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.140
JEFFREY FREBURG: Do you have
a favorite gadget?

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.400
JOSE GARCES: Well, I recently
started cooking

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.220
more with my kids.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.780
I have a nine and a five
year old, and they

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.210
really enjoy the kitchen.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.480
And again, it's a great
time for us to bond.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.100
So I've set up my kitchen
a little more usable.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.480
In the past, my home
kitchen was--

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.350
it was there, but I cooked in
the restaurant, so I wasn't

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.550
really like at home
doing it as much.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.470
But now that they're into it,
I've bought some tools.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.500
And actually my Kitchenaid
mixer is a

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.890
great versatile tool.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.160
I mean, from making
ice cream to--

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.040
I could do an ad for Kitchenaid
right now.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.960
JEFFREY FREBURG: That's great.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.370
JOSE GARCES: But we make fresh
pasta, we make ice cream in

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.500
it, fresh doughs, pizza dough.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.840
So it's been a great tool.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.200
And I haven't discovered
it as much as I

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.300
have in the last year.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.030
JEFFREY FREBURG: So I just want
to talk a little about

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.520
kitchen design.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.090
So is there anything that you
have learned designing kitchen

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.570
to kitchen?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.150
JOSE GARCES: Sure.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.650
I think the most important thing
is having a definite

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.350
idea of your--

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.450
let's just say professional
kitchen, right?

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.750
So if you're designing a
professional kitchen, really

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.080
having the concept
and the menu down

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.720
before you design is--

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.400
I mean, it seems like a basic
thing, but sometimes if you're

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.330
doing a new concept, the menu
could evolve, it could change,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.550
and that will totally change
the flow of the kitchen.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:40.060
So kitchen flow is really vital,
and so if you have your

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.100
menu in place, and really
thinking through the flow

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.060
process, how things are produced
and how they're

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.310
turned out is super important.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:55.590
So I'm actually designing
a quick serve Peruvian

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.590
rotisserie chicken place.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.710
And the menu--

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.500
at first we were like, OK, just

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.800
Peruvian rotisserie chicken.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.170
And then we thought, well, how
about empanadas as well?

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.900
And then we're like, well, we
might want to add, like, beef

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.000
ropa vieja or something.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.340
So the menu has evolved, and as
the menu has evolved, the

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.740
kitchen design has continued
to evolve.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.430
And as long as before you bid it
or have anyone do any work

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.770
on this kitchen you have that
flow, that's the most

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.660
important thing.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.590
JEFFREY FREBURG: So what do
you think the commercial

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.310
kitchen of the future
looks like?

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.380
Are we going to be only
cooking on electric?

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.330
Are we going to be
using an oven?

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.320
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.610
JOSE GARCES: Well, I think it's
pretty dependent on the

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.120
type of operation and the type
of commercial application.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.700
I think for me, I'm actually in
the process of designing a

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.710
pretty evolved kitchen.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.010
And I have several different
pieces of equipment that I'm

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.840
bringing in.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.530
It's going to be a small
restaurant in Philadelphia of

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.960
probably only about 25 to 30
seats, in which I'm looking to

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.520
do one seating per night and
really turn out what I think

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.550
is like, the most epic meal
that I could produce.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:20.099
So in this application, I'm
going for a island style

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.369
kitchen with several different
types of equipment.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.300
A [? sieve app ?]

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.849
which is a--

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.385
You're familiar with
a [? sieve app? ?]

00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:28.750
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.140
JOSE GARCES: A piece of
equipment that can cook to a

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.090
specific temperature and steam,
and really just cooks a

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.940
protein to its perfect
temperature.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.500
I have a piece of equipment
called the [? josper. ?]

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.890
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK, that
I haven't heard about.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.500
JOSE GARCES: Which is a solid
fuel encased cabinet style

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.220
grill, almost like
a [? plancher ?]

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.950
with solid fuel on the bottom,
so you get wood and smoke.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.470
And then there's other pieces,
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.930
cooking, circulators,
just to name a few.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.410
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.770
So we really try to incorporate
green aspects into

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.530
all of our buildings
and kitchens.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.390
Is that something that
you do as well?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.980
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.170
I think as much as possible, I
think from a sustainability

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.310
point of view, we're looking
to incorporate the farm in

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.040
terms of how we operate.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.700
So right now, all of our fryer
grease from all the

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.770
restaurants in Philadelphia is
being turned into biodiesel

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.170
fuel and soap for
the restaurants.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.670
The restaurants are also
composting, so we're taking

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.130
those vegetable scraps
up to the farm and

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.200
turning it into compost.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.480
And those type of sustainable
practices.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.960
In terms of building, we're not
100% there yet, for sure.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.670
JEFFREY FREBURG: Right.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.980
So I just want to take you
back to San Francisco.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.960
How long are you here for?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.980
JOSE GARCES: Well,
I've been here--

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.720
I was here yesterday, and
I leave tomorrow night.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.790
So about three full days
in San Francisco.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.290
And I could say it's been
a great time thus far.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.420
I love the city, I love
the energy of it.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.610
It seems really dynamic.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.400
And I had a great meal at
Manresa last night.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.560
JEFFREY FREBURG: That was my
next question-- where are you

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.730
going to eat tonight, and what
are some of your favorite

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.810
spots here?

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.850
JOSE GARCES: Well, thus far, we
made a point to make it to

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.070
Manresa last night,
which was amazing.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.540
David Kinch cooked a fantastic
meal for us, which was

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.330
probably around 15
or 20 courses.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.880
I don't remember.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.620
I lost track.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.220
But pretty epic meal,
really delicious,

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.630
really natural flavors.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:53.490
I was pretty inspired by his
subtlety, and his also unique

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.100
flavor combinations.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.110
And then, let's see.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.260
So a few recommendations that
I've had-- we're going to

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.530
Quince tonight, which I
heard is pretty good.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:08.260
And then we're going to State
Bird tomorrow, which I think

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.150
Bon Apetit gave it a
best new in the US.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.380
And I think Mission Chinese for
lunch tomorrow as well.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.770
So how's that list?

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.540
JEFFREY FREBURG: Good list.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.080
JOSE GARCES: Good list?

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:18.660
OK.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.580
Let me know if there's anything
else I should hit.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.490
JEFFREY FREBURG: Well,
there's a lot.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.780
I'm sure they'll tell you.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.900
I just want to open up
to the audience.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.330
Any questions from
the audience?

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.860
JOSE GARCES: So if you have a
limited budget and you have a

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.390
stove, a fridge, you like
the basic equipment--

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.890
JOSE GARCES: Got it.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.070
Well, I think the best place,
I know for me in New York,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.840
there's the Bowery district,
which has old restaurant

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.270
equipment, things
that are used.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.345
I mean, those things will last a
lifetime, so I think you can

00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:55.480
get the most bang
for your buck.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.440
I don't know what's here
in San Fran, but--

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.330
is there, like, a used
restaurant depot?

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.360
JEFFREY FREBURG:
Yes, there is.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.150
Are there any specific
pieces of

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.130
equipment that you'd recommend?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.510
Any kind of cookware that you
recommend without giving an

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.760
endorsement?

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.340
JOSE GARCES: I would say
definitely get a good quality

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.570
cutting board, because
I feel like that's--

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.390
if you have one that has a lot
of surface area, a really good

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.480
knife, I think pots--

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.970
yeah, a few solid like--

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:33.600
a stock pot, a really good cast
iron, a sautee pan, and

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.130
that's only like $100.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.430
JEFFREY FREBURG: And
a Kitchenaid.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.602
JOSE GARCES: You need a
Kitchenaid or a blender.

00:21:40.602 --> 00:21:42.450
AUDIENCE: Well, the Kitchenaid
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.510
AUDIENCE: What do you think the
impact of media and just--

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.130
it seems like America
is becoming more

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.950
of a culinary culture.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.220
How do you think that's
changing?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.040
JOSE GARCES: Sure.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.750
Well, when I was in culinary
school, and I started culinary

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:05.250
school in 1993, there was Emeril
Lagasse, Mario Batali,

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.020
Jacques Pepin, and they were
like the culinary TV

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.800
superstars.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.380
And they were just doing kind
of, they call it in our

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.080
profession dump and stir
shows, where it's just

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.490
kind of a how to.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.590
And obviously, it's evolved
tremendously

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.670
over the last 20 years.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:30.400
I've seen some impact on food
TV just inspiring the youth,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.660
where we have tons of younger
fans who are really into the

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.520
cooking shows, but also
just are more

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.200
knowledgeable about food.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.550
So that can only make for
better eating, hopefully

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.040
healthier eating going
down the road.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.990
And I think it's just going
to continue to evolve

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.320
tremendously.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.220
JEFFREY FREBURG: Do you care to
talk about your experience

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.660
on "Iron Chef" a little
bit more?

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.620
Is it really, like,
pressure intense?

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.620
I mean, what's it really
like on stage?

00:22:59.620 --> 00:22:59.920
JOSE GARCES: Yes.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.510
So "Iron Chef" has been an
incredible experience.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:12.010
I won the second season on 2009
of "Next Iron Chef." I

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.410
challenged nine other
competitors, came out on top.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:20.180
But then we started competing on
a regular basis as an "Iron

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.490
Chef," and it's the most fun
thing I'll do all year.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.840
It's also the most intense
period of the year.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.870
The battles are really tough.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.690
You're in a place that has
lots of lights, it's hot,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.140
there's fire everywhere, there's
another chef who wants

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.600
to take you out, and so I get
psyched out about it.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.510
I get into it.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:49.140
So it's been a great
experience.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.720
Also, the creativity that it
spurs during that period of

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.620
the year has really been great,
because then we're able

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.610
to take those creative
dishes and--

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.540
JEFFREY FREBURG: Put
them on the menu.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.960
JOSE GARCES: Put them on
the other menus, yeah.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.190
So it's been a great
period of time.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.270
JEFFREY FREBURG: And then so
on the "Iron Chef" do you

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.970
always keep the same team?

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.440
JOSE GARCES: The team has
evolved every year.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.550
And so the first couple years,
I had a mixture of my

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.160
different chef de cuisines,
and I kind of rotated

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.540
everybody around.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.160
But this last year, I decided
to go with just one team.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.430
It was like a powerhouse team,
like my best culinary person,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.450
Michael Fiorello, my best
corporate pastry chef, Jessica

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.770
[? Magardo, ?]

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:41.110
and so the three of us were
really able to put

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.850
on a show this year.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:45.200
So I'm excited about this year's
season as it airs.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.760
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK, so can you
give us any hints on this

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.010
year's season, or--

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.310
JOSE GARCES: Let's see.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.980
If you want to pay my $2
million confidentiality

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.710
agreement, I'm happy
to tell you.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.370
JEFFREY FREBURG: I don't,
personally, so I'm going to

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.349
pass on that.

00:25:00.349 --> 00:25:01.599
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.310
AUDIENCE: I did have another
question about

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.090
"Iron Chef,' too.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.370
Could you comment about the role
of improv when you create

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:11.910
the dishes?

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.560
Like, how you practice that,
how it's made its way into

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.630
your restaurants?

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.060
JOSE GARCES: Yeah, well, I
think for the most part,

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:24.400
before we go on the show, we'll
do some mock battles.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.750
So I go on the show with kind of
an idea of how we can apply

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.400
these different menus to
the secret ingredient.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.460
And then lately, there's been
some curves that they've

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:44.080
thrown at us on the show, and
so, like anything in life, we

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.585
improvise and it's been--

00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:47.835
yeah.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.700
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah, he's
tied to a confidentiality

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.619
agreement, so--

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:55.553
AUDIENCE: Do you find yourself
improving more in the kitchen

00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.510
in Philly now as a result?

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.210
JOSE GARCES: No, I don't
think we do.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:06.120
I think that we're actually
planning more and becoming

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.160
more diligent about our

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.060
development, and I've actually--

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.240
so with all the different
restaurants and all the many

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.180
concepts that we have, it's hard
to create and evolve the

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.110
menus on a regular basis
the way I'd like to.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.010
So this year we've taken an
approach to creating a

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.830
development team that really
helps us push all of the menus

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.440
forward and evolve.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.600
And in our business, which is
really competitive and tough

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.240
and always moving, we're finding
that it's important to

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.030
continue to evolve, stay fresh,
and that's kind of

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.850
where we are with it.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.610
AUDIENCE: All right, I
have two questions.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.640
The first one is what
is your favorite non

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.020
Latin cuisine and why?

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.660
And the second question, if
you were to die today or

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.770
tonight, what would be
your last supper?

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.370
JOSE GARCES: Mm, okay.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.210
Favorite non-Latin.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.250
That's a tough one, because
I'm a fan of cuisines.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.335
I was in France this year,
and had amazing--

00:27:06.335 --> 00:27:09.440
I was in Provence and
Paris, had amazing

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.550
French meals, more rustic.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.270
I love Asian food.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.680
We've been doing a lot of
research on Chinese cooking

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.690
lately, so it's been a huge
learning experience.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.770
And so that's been part of my
journey throughout all of this

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.370
is to explore different
cuisines, different cultures

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.940
and so I don't know that
I have a favorite one.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.990
I mean, Italian is always
a standby, in

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.060
my household, anyway.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.050
We're big pasta lovers.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.330
JEFFREY FREBURG: I'm
from Chicago, too.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.130
It's kind of--

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.210
JOSE GARCES: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:47.050
And so if I were to die today, I
think if I had a meal that I

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:53.110
wanted, I'd probably ask my
mom to make her empanadas.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:57.150
They're just so tasty, they're
good, they bring back such

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.880
great memories for me.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.350
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about when you guys are

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.120
developing a new concept with
your team, and you're

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.860
traveling to a new country, your
book covers a bunch of

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.980
different countries.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.590
So I'm wondering how you guys
approach a new concept when

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.740
you're, say, visiting
a new country.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.890
Do you go there with no research
and just sort of hit

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.260
the streets and see
what's out there?

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.180
Do you focus more on the higher
end restaurants to see

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.100
what people are eating?

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:28.600
Or do you just try to wander
around and see what people are

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.610
eating, and then find
inspiration through that?

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.750
JOSE GARCES: That's a great
question, and I'll give you a

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:41.000
great example of how our
research has evolved into

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.170
something that it is now.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.080
So we opened a restaurant
called Chifa in

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.540
Philadelphia in 2009.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.960
It's a Peruvian Cantonese
fusion.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.100
And we went to travel there, and
I went there in hopes of

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.770
finding this true fusion.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.570
I'd heard of it, and what I
found was Chinese restaurants

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:07.420
in Peru using Peruvian
ingredients with some

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.130
Chifa-esque dishes.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.470
But we really didn't
find a true fusion.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.130
And we looked and looked
and couldn't find it.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.550
What I found was several
other things.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.910
Great Peruvian food--

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:23.600
I found a gastronomic capital of
South America, some really

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.640
great chefs who have really
evolved the cuisine there.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:34.300
And so we came back to
Philadelphia with really not

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.860
much, and really we took it
upon ourselves to do this

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.630
marriage of Peruvian and
Chinese cuisine.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.485
And with some success.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.860
Fusion cuisine, I would say, is
a difficult thing to truly

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.430
master and do very well in.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.910
And for a cuisine to
be highly accepted.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.760
You don't go out and say, I
think I'm going to have

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.830
Peruvian Chinese tonight.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:06.320
So it's been quite a journey,
but the research for that was

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.660
pretty fun and insightful.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.000
JEFFREY FREBURG: So do you ever
plan on opening an Asian

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.440
concept specifically, or what's
on the horizon for you?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.020
JOSE GARCES: Currently on the
horizon is [? Volvere, ?]

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:29.430
which is going to be my 25 seat
epic Jose does the best

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.690
meal that he can, and I really
want to bring back this idea

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.560
of high level service.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.650
I feel like it's kind
of left for several

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.700
years for many reasons.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:46.740
And so that's my exploration of
molecular gastronomy, and

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.780
how I would apply it to my
food is what I'm going to

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.480
focus on immediately
next year.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.950
And then I'm working on a few
quick service concepts.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.660
So applying what I've learned
over the past 10 years and

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.690
putting it into a form which
can be accessible, fast,

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.510
fresh, delicious.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.410
AUDIENCE: I don't know if you're
aware, but California

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.810
recently banned foie gras.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.250
I'm curious what your thoughts
are on that issue, and what

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.750
you would do if you had a
restaurant here where you

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.562
wanted to serve foie gras.

00:31:18.562 --> 00:31:21.320
JOSE GARCES: Yeah, it is a
pretty controversial topic,

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.940
and several folks take several
sides of the story.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:33.110
I would say currently, we had a
lot of issues with foie gras

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.390
in Philadelphia as well.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.880
We had a lot of protests,
and folks

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.340
wanting it off our menus.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.750
So we actually obliged
everybody and

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.260
took it off the menus.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.020
And you know, personally, I
can't say that I have a

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.540
problem with it.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.140
I actually have a friend who's
a farmer in New York--

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.030
upstate New York.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.920
He owns Hudson Valley
Foie Gras--

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.586
Michael [? Genore. ?]

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:04.600
And I know that he practices
humane approaches to raising

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.390
his animals.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.290
And so that's kind of
where I stand on it.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:14.790
But we did take it off just
to keep things cool.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.760
We're in the restaurant
business, and we're there to

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.900
feed people and give great
hospitality and service.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.000
And so to be honest, my approach
is not really to get

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.330
involved in much controversy.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.690
JEFFREY FREBURG: Are there any
other things that you don't

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.330
serve on your menu?

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.410
Do you serve veal?

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.870
JOSE GARCES: We don't serve
veal, not because we think

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.490
it's inhumane, because
it really

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.710
doesn't sell in our markets.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.220
AUDIENCE: One of the most fun
parts when watching "Iron

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.020
Chef" is when someone takes a
ridiculous ingredient and puts

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.060
it into the ice cream machine.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.470
Do you have any fun ice cream
machine stories, either

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.600
something that turned out to be
surprisingly tasty or not?

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.380
JOSE GARCES: I think we made a
trout ice cream once, and it

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.300
actually was pretty good.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.660
It wasn't too bad.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.990
We're also--

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.280
I'm not a pastry chef, so making
ice cream requires some

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.180
deft of hand.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.270
And I think there was one point
where we were making

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.860
truffle ice cream, and it
overchurned, and it became

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.300
truffle butter all
of a sudden.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.935
So it was kind of like that
improvisation that you were

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.185
talking about earlier.

00:33:27.306 --> 00:33:29.400
AUDIENCE: So I know
you have two kids.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.910
I was wondering if they have any
favorite dishes that you

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.330
cook a lot for them, or are
their culinary tastes just as

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.580
diverse as yours?

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.030
JOSE GARCES: Oh, gosh.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.230
Well, both of my children,
they're nine and five, so

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.270
they're at that stage where
they're continuing to discover

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.410
flavors, textures.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:54.740
And so we emphasize vegetables
and eating healthy and that

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.100
sort of thing.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.580
And there's always the struggle
that occurs at the

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.390
kitchen table.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.280
And so we cut deals on
a regular basis.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.880
Like, okay, you can--

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.240
AUDIENCE: Cut deals.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.235
That sounds interesting.

00:34:03.235 --> 00:34:03.540
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.320
You can have this, but you're
going to have to have your

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.570
steamed broccoli.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.320
But I think their exposure to
all of this is only going to

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.500
be great for them.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.889
I'd cook breakfast for
them every morning.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.889
It's kind of our family time
that we get, because I'm

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.850
sometimes busy at night,
or I'm traveling.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.719
That's a part of the day
that I always try to

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.620
connect with them.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.929
And so we have full on breakfast
spread that occurs

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.840
at the Garces family
household.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.350
Around 7:00, there can be
anything from pancakes to

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:36.760
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.790
to waffles to sheared eggs.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.210
JOSE GARCES: Sure.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:48.139
And so that's a meal
where I think

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.330
creativity comes into play.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:55.630
And I have fun connecting with
them on that level, too.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.480
JEFFREY FREBURG: So real quick,
how much of a role has

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.190
technology and social media
played in your restaurants,

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.340
and how do you feel about
that these days?

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.990
JOSE GARCES: Well, I think it's
change the way we market

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.030
our restaurants quite a bit,
and there's a whole--

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.660
I think 10 years ago, there was
a way a marketing team or

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.060
program would occur for
a set of restaurants.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.730
So that's totally out the
window at this point.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:27.550
And I think that now, as we
market our restaurants, there

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.370
has to be a social media
side of things.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.250
And I think it's really
impactful.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:40.500
I think it can really do good
for those on the fly stories--

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.310
things that are, like,
happening now.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:48.060
And I'm curious to see how
will go in the future.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.770
It's always changing,
evolving.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.320
And from a business side, I
think could be a great tool.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.890
JEFFREY FREBURG: So do you
have a G+ account?

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.384
JOSE GARCES: I believe
so, yeah.

00:36:00.384 --> 00:36:01.836
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK,
great answer.

00:36:01.836 --> 00:36:03.560
Perfect.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.680
AUDIENCE: I have two
more questions.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.320
What's your favorite midnight
snack, or anything that you go

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.200
for from your fridge
that's always

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.770
available and always there?

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.060
Second question, if you want to
impress someone with like

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.460
the best thing they've ever
had, like blow their mind,

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.490
what would you make?

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.030
JOSE GARCES: OK, wow.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.580
All right.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.600
Midnight snack.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.120
Look at this.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.370
I can't be eating at midnight.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.520
But I would say if there's a
slice of pizza in the fridge--

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.140
I'm a pizza fanatic--

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.215
that'll be something that we're
always ordering pizza,

00:36:37.215 --> 00:36:39.780
so there's usually couple
slices in there.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.130
So I'll heat it in the
oven and have that.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.610
If not, a piece of fruit
will be sufficed.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.500
But I think, let me go to
your next question.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.236
So blow somebody's mind--
something I would cook--

00:36:54.236 --> 00:36:54.900
oh, wow.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.210
OK.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.850
I've been married for 10 years
now, so I haven't had to go

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.520
that route in some time.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.650
Usually we'll go somewhere.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.322
But let me think about
this for a minute.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.310
That's a good question.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.128
You caught-- my wife's gonna
kill me on this one.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.820
I'm a fan of raw fish, so going
out and finding, like--

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.650
and we have access to
great ingredients.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:34.180
So possibly maybe some tuna
toro or otoro with caviar.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.910
I really enjoy having
a true caviar

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.850
experience once in a while.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.540
A lot of times, you'll get
caviar, and it's in small,

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.550
small doses.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:51.190
If you can swing it, get a big
tin, get some [INAUDIBLE], a

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.890
nice bottle of champagne,
and just indulge.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.970
JEFFREY FREBURG: So in your
restaurants, do you focus on

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.010
sustainable fish?

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.840
JOSE GARCES: Yes.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.180
It hasn't been a primary focus,
but we certainly like

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.710
to practice sustainability
in terms of seafood.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.644
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK.

00:38:12.644 --> 00:38:15.920
All right, yes?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.460
AUDIENCE: Just because I like
the questions that keep

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.060
putting on the spot.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.210
You're on "Iron Chef," they're
about to pull the tablecloth

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.510
back and reveal the
secret ingredient.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.040
What is the best dream
ingredient you could possibly

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.270
see under there, and what is
your worst nightmare to see

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.460
under there?

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.620
JOSE GARCES: Best dream
ingredient is pork belly,

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.020
because we've been cooking
it for years now.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.585
We have that set.

00:38:38.585 --> 00:38:40.450
I think worst ingredient--

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.250
I don't know that I
have an awful one.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:47.620
I'm a fan of all ingredients,
and I think my job for the

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.520
last 20 years was learn how to
take something from a raw

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.840
state and make it delicious.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.800
So there's nothing, really,
that would offend me.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.280
Stinky tofu, maybe.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:01.720
AUDIENCE: Jelly beans?

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.810
JOSE GARCES: Jelly beans.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.770
You know, when they start
incorporating, like, candy,

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.620
and like weird stuff into the
show, it kind of offends me.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.700
You're right.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.634
JEFFREY FREBURG: Anyone else?

00:39:14.634 --> 00:39:15.884
OK, yes?

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.730
One of the challenges I've
always had trying to follow a

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.790
recipe is not having all
the ingredients.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:37.590
So for example, smoked Spanish
sweet paprika is not something

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.690
that I would have
in my cupboard.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:47.260
So I find myself often
substituting or altogether

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.570
skipping ingredients.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:54.550
As a professional chef, how do
you feel about people doing

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.550
that to your very well
crafted recipes?

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.030
JOSE GARCES: I think that it
occurs, and I understand that,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.820
due to time restraints,
et cetera.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.890
But I think in "The Latin Road
Home," we include a sources

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.790
and substitutions list, so there
you'll find where to go

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:20.390
get the sweet smoked paprika,
or what to use if

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.870
you can't find it.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.145
So we've thought about that, and
I think it is important,

00:40:25.145 --> 00:40:28.750
though, to get the right
ingredients, because they make

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.240
or break the dish.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.060
One ingredient might, like,
twist it one way or the other.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.300
AUDIENCE: OK, you've
got this book here.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.850
What would you recommend--

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.870
what would be the first two
things they should go

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.280
make in this book?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.320
JOSE GARCES: First two things.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.130
OK, there is the [? Nikkei ?]

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.350
style ceviche out of
the Peru chapter.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.410
It's really tasty, very simple,
and easy to make.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:04.570
And then I would say the
Ecuadorian fritata, which is a

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.460
roast pork and hominy salad.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.260
Quite delicious.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.380
JEFFREY FREBURG: Yeah, so what
was your favorite country on

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.380
your travels?

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.065
Like, where did you love
the food the most?

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:17.170
JOSE GARCES: Good question.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.670
I've been a fan of Spanish
cuisine for a long time, and I

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.480
think I've traveled there the
most out of all the countries,

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:29.270
because you can get such great
rustic tapas experiences, as

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:34.520
well as this other high end
gastronomic adventure.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.460
So I found that Spain was
one of the best places.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.820
It continues to inspire me.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.010
I'm going back this year--

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.560
this coming year in January to
continue to get inspiration

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.300
for my newest concept.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:48.720
JEFFREY FREBURG: OK.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.440
And then is there one dish that
you're like, oh my god, I

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.830
have to go to this country
and have this dish?

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.200
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:04.350
I went to Peru, and I wanted
to have the cuy, which is

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.970
guinea pig-- roast guinea pig.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.790
And I've always heard about
it, and I wanted to just

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.680
experience it.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.000
And what I found was crispy,
almost like [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.080
Fatty, but pretty
flavorful meat.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.386
And that was an interesting
experience.

00:42:21.386 --> 00:42:22.780
JEFFREY FREBURG: All right,
well, thanks.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.450
Any other questions?

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:24.720
All right.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.360
Well, I know that he has time to
sign some books, so thanks

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:28.850
for coming.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:28.970
I really appreciate it.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.230
JOSE GARCES: Yeah.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.770
Thank you.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.020
Thank you all very much.
