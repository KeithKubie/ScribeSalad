00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.110
See the line where the sky meets the sea?

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.700
It’s got uranium in it.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.610
Hey there drifters, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.409
There was a time, just after the second World
War, when atomic power held the promise of

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.160
limitless energy for the future.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.430
It’s never lived up to that promise, partly
because nuclear power has something of an

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.640
image problem, but also because that limitless
source of power isn’t limitless, at least

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.970
not the way we get it now, mining the earth
for uranium.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.520
With that in mind, researchers at Stanford
University have developed a new way to extract

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.960
uranium from seawater, bringing us closer
to nuclear power that can sustain us for 10,000

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960
years.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.930
The idea is not a new one.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.660
Uranium makes up a teeny percentage of the
particles in the ocean, about 3 parts per

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.390
billion or the roughly equivalent of a grain
of salt dissolved in a liter of water.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.070
The thing about the ocean is there’s a whole
lot of it, about 1.3 sextilion liters, or

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.360
13 with twenty zeroes after it.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.090
That’s a whole lot of uranium just drifting
around when it could be powering your fridge,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.120
so since the 90s, Japan has been developing
methods to pull it out of the water, with

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.720
the United States and China following suit.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.531
Uranium exists in water bonded to two oxygen
atoms in a molecule called uranyl - try to

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.400
be mature about the name, guys.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.530
Uranyl has a positive charge, so previous
methods of extraction took advantage of this.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.360
To capture the uranyl, long strands of plastic
coated in a chemical with a negative charge

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.860
called amidoxime were left underwater for
a month, where they would passively soak up

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.400
that uranium goodness.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Then the strands would be brought to the surface,
where an acid bath would free the uranyl and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
regenerate the fibers so they could be put
back in the ocean and used again.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.150
It’s literally rinse and repeat.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.630
So far, so amazing.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.939
But the problem is the process hasn’t been
cost effective enough.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.700
Even with serious improvements in the last
5 years that have reduced the cost of uranium

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.310
extraction by a factor of 4, this method still
produces uranium at the cost of about 440

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.880
dollars per kilogram.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.509
The current method of finding a big deposit
of uranium and scooping it out of the earth

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.340
is much more cost effective, yielding uranium
for anywhere from 22 to 260 dollars per kilo.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.650
The new method developed by Stanford should
drop prices even further.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.620
It works by combining amidoxime with a conductive
carbon nanoparticles and applying pulses of

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.170
electricity, drawing more charged uranyl ions
to the fibers.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
By the time the old fibers with just amidoxime
would be fully saturated, the new ones had

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
soaked up 9 times more uranyl and still had
room for more!

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.750
This could make fuel for nuclear power truly
limitless and much more accessible.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.580
It’s estimated that we can only mine uranium
from the earth for about another 100 years

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.920
before we’ve used it up, and the countries
with significant reserves are Australia, Canada,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.580
Kazakhstan, and Russia.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.950
Meanwhile since the ocean is so huge and it’s
constantly dissolving rocks that release more

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.950
uranium into the water, the ocean’s supply
can meet global energy demands for 10,000

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.849
years, and the ocean is accessible to anyone
with a coastline.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.780
That’s why this new method developed at
Stanford is so exciting; it brings limitless

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.660
nuclear power a step closer to reality.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.930
Nuclear power still has other hurdles, like
waste disposal and a serious public image

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.930
problem.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.260
But if we’re going to shift away from CO2-emitting
energy sources like coal and natural gas,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.820
we’re still going to need something that
can be turned on and off to meet changing

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.820
demands.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.470
Nuclear power can do just that, and the oceans
can sustain it far into the future.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.650
You may be surprised to learn that you’ve
gone swimming with uranium if you’ve ever

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.200
taken a dip in the ocean.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.840
Sometimes radiation isn’t as scary as we
make it out to be, like the radiation from

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.319
the fukushima disaster.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.709
Trace has thoughts on that here.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.800
So do you think this is the future of nuclear
power?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.269
Are you a Thorium die-hard?

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.760
Or does nuclear scare the pants off you?
