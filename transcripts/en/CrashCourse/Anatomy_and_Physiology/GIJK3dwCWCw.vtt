00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.560
You may not know it, but your body is engaged
in a never-ending battle.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.310
You are literally covered in staph and strep
and e coli, and all sorts of dubious characters

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.700
that are intent on using you, and your body’s
many resources, to feed themselves, find shelter,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.700
and reproduce as much as they want.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.100
And, hey, we all gotta make a living. But
it is not your job to give these guys a free lunch.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
So your body has developed a three-part policy
toward these shady customers, and its enforcement

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.029
is handled by your immune system.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.900
The immune system is different from all the
other systems we’ve talked about this year

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.890
in that it’s not a specific, tissue-organ-system
kind of system.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.830
Instead, it involves a whole bunch of
different tissue groups, organ systems, and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.400
specialized-but-widely-distributed defense cells.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
Together, this league of extraordinary substances
joins forces to perform all of the defense

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.809
functions your body depends on to keep you
alive in an incredibly germy world.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.809
And the first line of defense in this never-ending battle?
That’s your innate, or nonspecific, defense system.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.329
Like your average frontline soldier, it’s
prepared to immediately engage with anyone

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.199
suspicious, and it mostly includes stuff we
were born with, like the external barricades

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.469
of your skin and mucous membranes, and internal
defenses like phagocytes, antimicrobial proteins,

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.539
and other attack cells.

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.959
But some enemies must be fought with special
forces. And here, your body can deploy your

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.849
adaptive, or specific defense system, which
is more like your Seal Team Six.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:20.799
It takes more time to call in, but it’s
specially designed to go after specific targets.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.469
And it keeps files on those bad guys so it
knows how to handle them next time around.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.729
But today we’re going to focus on your innate
system, and look at how it uses an arsenal

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.399
of physical and chemical barriers, killer
cells, and even fever, to keep you healthy.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.379
Proving that sometimes, the symptoms we associate
with illness are actually the signs that we're healing.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.600
Just because something is simple doesn’t
mean that it can’t be elegant.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.709
I mean, your body is capable of some 
incredibly sophisticated things, including

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.180
defending itself from infection.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.389
But occasionally there’s something to be
said for brute force.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.399
And a lot of your innate immune system’s
functions aren’t exactly subtle. For example,

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.729
your body’s very first line of defense is
a simple physical barrier. And it works!

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.729
Like a wall around a fortress, your skin does
a fantastic job of keeping out all manner

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.799
of malevolent microorganisms.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.409
As long as that tough, keratinized epithelial
membrane doesn’t get torn open or busted

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.709
up too much, you could probably, like, make
snowballs out of raw sewage and still be alright.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.840
Although...no. No.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.060
Your many mucous membranes also provide a
handy physical barrier. You’ll remember

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.790
that they line any cavity that opens up into
the germy outside world, including the respiratory,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.129
digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.269
Not only do your skin and mucosa
supply simple physical protection,

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.560
they also pack some serious chemical weaponry.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.090
Eat some questionable leftovers for lunch?
Don’t worry, your stomach is literally filled

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.299
with acid, so you probably are covered.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.540
Walk face-first into your co-worker’s nasty
sneeze cloud? No worries, your nasal passages

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.060
can whip up a tissue-box worth of sticky mucus
to help trap viruses before they enter your lungs.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.400
You’ve also got bacteria-fighting enzymes
in your saliva and lacrimal eye fluid, and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.170
peptides called defensins in your skin and
membranes that help keep bacteria and fungi

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.980
from setting up shop around inflamed or scraped
skin.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.140
Which, no matter how careful you are, you’re
gonna get, one way or another.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.480
Maybe you shave with a dull blade. Or you
just brush your teeth too hard. And DON’T

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.120
GET ME STARTED about the dangers of bagel-cutting.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.409
So when you’ve breached that first, simple
line of defense, it’s time to call on your

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.120
second line of internal innate defenses.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.280
This is where your body starts pulling strategic
maneuvers like firing up a fever, releasing

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.609
chemical signals, causing inflammation, or
other defensive tactics that help identify

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.650
and attack infectious invaders.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.200
Some of the first defensive cells on the scene
are your phagocytes. Their name literally

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.549
means “to eat,” and like Pac-Man, they
indiscriminately chase down intruders and

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.249
gobble them up. And they come in a few different
varieties:

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.560
First you’ve got neutrophils, which are
the most abundant type of your white blood

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.159
cells. They kind of self-destruct after devouring
a pathogen. And, in fact, you’ve actually

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.579
seen piles of their little dead bodies, because
that’s what pus is made of.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.689
But the bigger, tougher phagocytes are the
macrophages. They’re derived from monocyte

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.650
white-blood cells that have moved out of the
blood stream to occupy tissues. And some are

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.129
free types that patrol tissues looking for
creepers, while others are fixed -- attached

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.510
to fibers in specific organs, devouring anything
suspicious that passes by.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.109
So when a macrophage in, say, the finger I
just cut slicing a bagel, sees a new bacterium

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.590
coming along, it snares it using cytoplasmic
extensions, reels in it, completely engulfs

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.419
it, and -- essentially -- digests it and spits
the rest out.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.080
And unlike neutrophils, it can do this over
and over again, like a boss.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.160
But not all your defense cells are phagocytic.
You’ve also got cells with what is by far

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.949
the awesomest name of any cell in the body:
the natural killer cells. You can call them

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.770
NK cells if you want to, but like, why would
you do that?

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.160
Anyway, these tiny assassins patrol your blood
and lymph looking for abnormal cells, and

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.430
are unique in that they can kill your own
cells if they are infected with viruses or

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.009
have become cancerous.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.009
How can they tell?

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.470
A normal, healthy cell contains a special
protein on its surface called MHC1, or major

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.030
Histocompatibility Complex. But if it’s
infected, it stops making that protein.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.469
And if an NK cell detects a defective cell,
it doesn’t swallow it whole like a macrophage

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.229
-- it pokes it with an enzyme that triggers
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.270
is pretty awesome.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.150
So those are some ways your innate immune
cells handle their enemies, but how do they

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.220
know where to look in the first place?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.629
So, let’s talk strategery.

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.120
So, say you’re in a banana factory and you
slip on a banana peel and scrape your knees.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.250
Your outer fortress has been breached, and
the pathogens are just flooding in like orcs

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.470
through Helm’s Deep.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.900
Banana factories are very dirty places.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.379
Now your body wants to contain the spread
of pathogens, clean up the mess, and get healing

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.699
as quickly as possible, so it cues up your
inflammatory response.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.949
This is basically an internal fire alarm,
only it uses chemicals instead of sirens to

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.960
get the message across, and instead of smoke
and fire you sense redness, swelling, heat,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.530
and pain.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.060
For example, in the event of injury, specialized
mast cells in your connective tissue send

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.470
out histamine molecules.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.419
And histamine is great at calling in the cavalry.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.770
For one thing, it causes vasodilation, which
creates redness and heat at the site of the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.419
injury. Now, those things might freak you
out a little, but they’re actually signs

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.370
of healing -- the increased temperature, for
example, ratchets up the cells’ metabolic

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.680
rates so they can repair themselves faster.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.280
Meanwhile, histamines and other inflammatory
chemicals also increase the permeability of

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.150
blood vessels, causing nearby capillaries
to release protein-rich fluids.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.479
This causes swelling -- which again, is actually
a good thing -- because that leaked protein

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.900
helps clot blood and form scabs, while the
lymphatic system sucks up and filters that

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.190
extra fluid, cleaning it up before putting
it back into your bloodstream.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.120
And of course, like chum to sharks, an inflamed
knee is also going to attract a bunch of local

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.889
phagocytes -- which find it easier to escape
your now-leaky capillaries -- and lymphocytes

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.270
that are also flowing freely, helping to destroy
pathogens while also cleaning up dead-cell

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.490
wreckage.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.750
And don’t forget: During all this, the neutrophils
have been doing their best, but they were

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.889
the first wave to arrive, so by this time,
they’re starting to die in heaps.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.969
They’re triggered when the injured knee-skin
cells release chemicals that begin leukocytosis

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.629
– the release of neutrophils from the bone
marrow where they’re made into the bloodstream.

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.289
To attract the neutrophils to the damaged
area, inflamed endothelial cells in the capillaries

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.189
send out chemicals that act like homing devices--
and when the neutrophils arrive, they cling

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.789
to the capillary walls near the injury, flatten
themselves out and squeeze through the vessel

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.050
walls to get to work.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.720
Your big monocytes eventually roll up to the
battle, and transform into hungry macrophages,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.050
replacing that first line of now-dead neutrophils
and basically just eating up any lingering

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.620
enemies and then cleaning up the carnage.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.650
Now, all this works pretty well in most circumstances.
But you may have noticed if you’ve sustained

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.039
a more major injury, or are battling an especially
nasty virus or infection, that sometimes your

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.169
local troops get overrun.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.330
When white blood cells and macrophages run
into more foreign invaders than they can handle,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.060
they let loose pyrogen chemicals that tap
the hypothalamus and raise your body’s thermostat,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.009
calling in a systemic fever to burn everything.

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.539
The resulting temperature rise increases the
metabolism of your cells so they can heal

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.849
faster, and it also tells the liver and spleen
to hold onto all of their iron and zinc, so

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:51.199
those things can’t contribute to bacterial
growth.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.740
But even then, sometimes, well sometimes you
find yourself facing a more formidable foe.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.490
That’s when you call in the specialists
-- your adaptive immune defenses.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.500
And to learn exactly how they save the day,
you have to watch next time.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.439
But for now you learned that your immune system’s
responses begin with physical barriers like

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:11.300
skin and mucous membranes, and when they’re
not enough, there are your phagocytes -- the

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.060
neutrophils and macrophages. You also learned
about natural killer cells and the inflammatory

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.810
response, and watched as all of these elements
saved the day when you slipped on a banana

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.319
peel.
