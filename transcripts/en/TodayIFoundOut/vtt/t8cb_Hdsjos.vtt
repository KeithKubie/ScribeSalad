00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.170
Unlike so many other nicknames for the police,
such as cops and the fuzz, this particular

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.900
term has a relatively well known origin.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.789
You see, starting around the sixteenth century
“pig” began being used in English as a

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.010
derogatory term for people, whether police
or not, as it still sometimes is used today.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.809
It took about three more centuries, but this
particular insult inevitably became a popular

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.441
nickname for oft-insulted police officers,
with the first documented reference to this

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.760
being in the Dictionary of Buckish Slang,
University Wit and Pickpocket Eloquence, published

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.109
in London in 1811.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.649
In it, the pertinent line in question is:
“The pigs frisked my panney, and nailed

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.649
my screws.”

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.140
Meaning: “The officers searched my house,
and seized my picklocks.”

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.579
poindexterWhy “Poindexter” is Slang for
“Nerd”

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.559
“Poindexter” as a slang name for a nerdy
person comes from a particularly memorable

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.469
stereotypically nerdy character in the cartoon
Felix the Cat.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.560
The character in question is the nephew of
Felix’s archenemy, the Professor, who is,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560
of course, named Poindexter.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.570
Poindexter was first introduced to the masses
in 1959 in the cartoon version of Felix the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.100
Cat shown on TV.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.460
Over the years, he has typically been depicted
in a lab coat, wearing thick glasses, and

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.390
otherwise personifying stereotypical nerdom
in all its glory.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.770
Despite having been around for decades, it
took another Hollywood creation to really

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.760
get the popularity of this slang term firmly
implanted into common vernacular, rather than

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.670
as a fringe moniker for nerds.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.421
This occurred in the mid-1980s thanks to the
character of Arnold Poindexter in the 1984

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.421
Revenge of the Nerds.

00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:45.560
Since then, “Poindexter” has been a relatively
popular moniker for anyone who exhibits extremely

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160
nerdy tendencies.
