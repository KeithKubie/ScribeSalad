there's there's an idea that young

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
there's there's an idea that young
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640
there's there's an idea that young
developed about the trickster and the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
developed about the trickster and the
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.679
developed about the trickster and the
Jester the comedian right that the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
Jester the comedian right that the
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020
Jester the comedian right that the
trickster is the precursor to the savior

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
trickster is the precursor to the savior
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670
trickster is the precursor to the savior
that's one of the things I learned from

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
that's one of the things I learned from
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.190
that's one of the things I learned from
young it was just it's so unlikely you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
young it was just it's so unlikely you
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590
young it was just it's so unlikely you
never think that it's so amazing that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
never think that it's so amazing that
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749
never think that it's so amazing that
that might be the case but the the the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
that might be the case but the the the
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.499
that might be the case but the the the
the the satirical in the ironic and and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
the the satirical in the ironic and and
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810
the the satirical in the ironic and and
the troublemaker that the comedian the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
the troublemaker that the comedian the
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420
the troublemaker that the comedian the
fool the fool is the precursor to the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
fool the fool is the precursor to the
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090
fool the fool is the precursor to the
savior why because you're a fool when

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
savior why because you're a fool when
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460
savior why because you're a fool when
you start something new and so if you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
you start something new and so if you're
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630
you start something new and so if you're
not willing to be a fool then you'll

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
not willing to be a fool then you'll
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.920
not willing to be a fool then you'll
never start anything new and if you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
never start anything new and if you
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.090
never start anything new and if you
never start anything new that you won't

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
never start anything new that you won't
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700
never start anything new that you won't
develop and so the willingness to be a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
develop and so the willingness to be a
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560
develop and so the willingness to be a
fool is the precursor to transformation

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
fool is the precursor to transformation
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810
fool is the precursor to transformation
and that's the same as humility and so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
and that's the same as humility and so
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819
and that's the same as humility and so
if you're gonna write your destiny you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
if you're gonna write your destiny you
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130
if you're gonna write your destiny you
can do a bad first job you're gonna get

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
can do a bad first job you're gonna get
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.499
can do a bad first job you're gonna get
smarter as you move forward that's the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
smarter as you move forward that's the
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.690
smarter as you move forward that's the
thing is that so something beckons to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
thing is that so something beckons to
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369
thing is that so something beckons to
you that's what happens here maybe the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
you that's what happens here maybe the
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.260
you that's what happens here maybe the
star that Geppetto wished on was the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
star that Geppetto wished on was the
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.700
star that Geppetto wished on was the
wrong damn star

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
wrong damn star
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800
wrong damn star
but at least it was a star right at

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
but at least it was a star right at
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.080
but at least it was a star right at
least it was in the sky at least it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
least it was in the sky at least it
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.690
least it was in the sky at least it
moved him forward and so you say in your

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
moved him forward and so you say in your
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.910
moved him forward and so you say in your
life well something grips you and and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920

and fills you with interest and you
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.500
and fills you with interest and you
think well should I do that and the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
think well should I do that and the
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.150
think well should I do that and the
answer is if not that then something

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160
answer is if not that then something
 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.850
answer is if not that then something
what if it's a mistake it's a mistake

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
what if it's a mistake it's a mistake
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580
what if it's a mistake it's a mistake
rest assured what do you know you're

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
rest assured what do you know you're
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.230
rest assured what do you know you're
gonna stumble around right and what's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
gonna stumble around right and what's
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.330
gonna stumble around right and what's
gonna happen is this you're gonna move

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
gonna happen is this you're gonna move
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.890
gonna happen is this you're gonna move
to you're gonna not stay in stasis

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
to you're gonna not stay in stasis
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330
to you're gonna not stay in stasis
you're not gonna wander around in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
you're not gonna wander around in
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.340
you're not gonna wander around in
circles and I see people like that they

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
circles and I see people like that they
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.600
circles and I see people like that they
said well I never knew what to do and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
said well I never knew what to do and
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.250
said well I never knew what to do and
now I'm 40 it's like that's not so good

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
now I'm 40 it's like that's not so good
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.110
now I'm 40 it's like that's not so good
that's not so good and you might say

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
that's not so good and you might say
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000
that's not so good and you might say
well and there is a literature too that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
well and there is a literature too that
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.120
well and there is a literature too that
suggests that people are a lot more

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130
suggests that people are a lot more
 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.440
suggests that people are a lot more
unhappy when they look back in their

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
unhappy when they look back in their
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.990
unhappy when they look back in their
lives about the things they didn't do

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
lives about the things they didn't do
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.210
lives about the things they didn't do
than they are about the mistakes they

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
than they are about the mistakes they
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.460
than they are about the mistakes they
made while they were doing things and so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
made while they were doing things and so
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.960
made while they were doing things and so
that's really worth thinking about too

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
that's really worth thinking about too
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.960
that's really worth thinking about too
because there's redemptive mistakes and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
because there's redemptive mistakes and
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.820
because there's redemptive mistakes and
a redemptive mistake would be a mistake

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
a redemptive mistake would be a mistake
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.140
a redemptive mistake would be a mistake
that you make when you go out and try to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
that you make when you go out and try to
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.730
that you make when you go out and try to
do something and no you actually you

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740
do something and no you actually you
 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
do something and no you actually you
think okay I'm gonna try to do this and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
think okay I'm gonna try to do this and
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.240
think okay I'm gonna try to do this and
you're not good at it you make a bunch

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
you're not good at it you make a bunch
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160
you're not good at it you make a bunch
of mistakes it's like what's the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
of mistakes it's like what's the
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.690
of mistakes it's like what's the
consequence if you pay attention is

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
consequence if you pay attention is
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.340
consequence if you pay attention is
you're not quite so stupid anymore

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350
you're not quite so stupid anymore
 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.620
you're not quite so stupid anymore
that's the thing is you've been informed

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
that's the thing is you've been informed
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.720
that's the thing is you've been informed
by your by the results of your errors

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
by your by the results of your errors
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.720
by your by the results of your errors
and so what happens is your you you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730
and so what happens is your you you
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.520
and so what happens is your you you
follow the beacon you follow the light

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530
follow the beacon you follow the light
 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.800
follow the beacon you follow the light
and and you're blind so you don't know

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
and and you're blind so you don't know
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.390
and and you're blind so you don't know
where the light is it's it's dimly

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
where the light is it's it's dimly
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.430
where the light is it's it's dimly
apprehended only and you're afraid to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
apprehended only and you're afraid to
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.200
apprehended only and you're afraid to
follow it but you decide to take some

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210
follow it but you decide to take some
 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.380
follow it but you decide to take some
stumbling steps towards it and as you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390
stumbling steps towards it and as you
 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.420
stumbling steps towards it and as you
take stumbling steps towards it you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430
take stumbling steps towards it you
 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.940
take stumbling steps towards it you
become illuminated and enlightened and

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950
become illuminated and enlightened and
 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.040
become illuminated and enlightened and
informed because of the nature of your

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050
informed because of the nature of your
 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.360
informed because of the nature of your
experience because you're pushing

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370
experience because you're pushing
 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.860
experience because you're pushing
yourself beyond where you are and you're

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
yourself beyond where you are and you're
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.720
yourself beyond where you are and you're
going into the country that you have not

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730
going into the country that you have not
 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.120
going into the country that you have not
yet been in and you learn something and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
yet been in and you learn something and
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.250
yet been in and you learn something and
so what happens then is the star moves

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
so what happens then is the star moves
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.980
so what happens then is the star moves
you move ten feet towards it you think

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990
you move ten feet towards it you think
 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.510
you move ten feet towards it you think
no that's not right I didn't get it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520
no that's not right I didn't get it
 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.430
no that's not right I didn't get it
right it isn't there it's actually there

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
right it isn't there it's actually there
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860
right it isn't there it's actually there
and so then you you see it somewhere

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
and so then you you see it somewhere
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.810
and so then you you see it somewhere
else and you shift yourself slightly and

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820
else and you shift yourself slightly and
 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.880
else and you shift yourself slightly and
you move forward and that's what happens

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
you move forward and that's what happens
 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.310
you move forward and that's what happens
is that you continue as you change the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
is that you continue as you change the
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.060
is that you continue as you change the
thing that guides you forward moves

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070
thing that guides you forward moves
 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.820
thing that guides you forward moves
right it's like God in the in the in the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830
right it's like God in the in the in the
 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.390
right it's like God in the in the in the
desert in Egypt the pillar of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400
desert in Egypt the pillar of
 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.700
desert in Egypt the pillar of
that you're following it's moving it's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710
that you're following it's moving it's
 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.070
that you're following it's moving it's
not a permanent thing you move towards

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080
not a permanent thing you move towards
 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.170
not a permanent thing you move towards
it it moves away it guides you forward

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
it it moves away it guides you forward
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.320
it it moves away it guides you forward
and so you say well is what I'm aiming

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330
and so you say well is what I'm aiming
 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.689
and so you say well is what I'm aiming
at paradise itself and the answer to

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699
at paradise itself and the answer to
 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.400
at paradise itself and the answer to
that is no because what do you know you

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
that is no because what do you know you
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.379
that is no because what do you know you
could you couldn't see paradise if it

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389
could you couldn't see paradise if it
 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.030
could you couldn't see paradise if it
was right in front of you but you might

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
was right in front of you but you might
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.490
was right in front of you but you might
get a glimmer of it and so you move

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500
get a glimmer of it and so you move
 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.310
get a glimmer of it and so you move
towards it and you grow and then the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320
towards it and you grow and then the
 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.870
towards it and you grow and then the
next time you open your eyes you see a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880
next time you open your eyes you see a
 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.969
next time you open your eyes you see a
little bit more clearly and that's what

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979
little bit more clearly and that's what
 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.560
little bit more clearly and that's what
happens is that just happens over and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570
happens is that just happens over and
 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.210
happens is that just happens over and
over right it keeps moving and so you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220
over right it keeps moving and so you
 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.050
over right it keeps moving and so you
move like this but the thing that's so

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060
move like this but the thing that's so
 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.740
move like this but the thing that's so
cool is that

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750
cool is that
 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.930
cool is that
although zigs and zags you say in each

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940
although zigs and zags you say in each
 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.850
although zigs and zags you say in each
of those zags is it and zigs is a

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860
of those zags is it and zigs is a
 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.670
of those zags is it and zigs is a
catastrophe I hit a wall my god and then

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680
catastrophe I hit a wall my god and then
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.200
catastrophe I hit a wall my god and then
I had to die a little bit and I barely

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
I had to die a little bit and I barely
 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.390
I had to die a little bit and I barely
got back up it's a Phoenix

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400
got back up it's a Phoenix
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.070
got back up it's a Phoenix
transformation at each at each turn and

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080
transformation at each at each turn and
 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.469
transformation at each at each turn and
it's painful but the thing is is that

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479
it's painful but the thing is is that
 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.219
it's painful but the thing is is that
even though you've you've traveled 20

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229
even though you've you've traveled 20
 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.350
even though you've you've traveled 20
miles let's say on that road and you've

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360
miles let's say on that road and you've
 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.689
miles let's say on that road and you've
only moved 3 miles forward you've moved

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699
only moved 3 miles forward you've moved
 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.360
only moved 3 miles forward you've moved
three miles forward instead of falling

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
three miles forward instead of falling
 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.010
three miles forward instead of falling
backwards because that's the thing too

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020
backwards because that's the thing too
 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.680
backwards because that's the thing too
is that if you stand still you fall

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690
is that if you stand still you fall
 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.830
is that if you stand still you fall
backwards you cannot stand still because

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
backwards you cannot stand still because
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.779
backwards you cannot stand still because
the world moves away from you if you

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789
the world moves away from you if you
 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.300
the world moves away from you if you
stand still and there's no stasis

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310
stand still and there's no stasis
 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.760
stand still and there's no stasis
there's only backwards and so if you're

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770
there's only backwards and so if you're
 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.250
there's only backwards and so if you're
not moving fact we're back forwards then

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260
not moving fact we're back forwards then
 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.250
not moving fact we're back forwards then
you're moving backwards and that's more

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
 
 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.930
 
more of the underlying truth of the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940
more of the underlying truth of the
 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.120
more of the underlying truth of the
Matthieu principle to those who have

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130
Matthieu principle to those who have
 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.490
Matthieu principle to those who have
everything more will be given from those

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500
everything more will be given from those
 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.110
everything more will be given from those
who have nothing everything will be

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120
who have nothing everything will be
 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.589
who have nothing everything will be
taken it's a warning do not stay in one

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599
taken it's a warning do not stay in one
 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.790
taken it's a warning do not stay in one
place well as you Zig and zag maybe then

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800
place well as you Zig and zag maybe then
 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.850
place well as you Zig and zag maybe then
maybe the cataclysm of each

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860
maybe the cataclysm of each
 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.200
maybe the cataclysm of each
transformation starts to lessen there's

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210
transformation starts to lessen there's
 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.210
transformation starts to lessen there's
not so much of you that has to die with

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220
not so much of you that has to die with
 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.409
not so much of you that has to die with
every mistake and maybe you end up

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419
every mistake and maybe you end up
 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.810
every mistake and maybe you end up
oriented at least reasonably properly

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820
oriented at least reasonably properly
 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.550
oriented at least reasonably properly
and if you were sensible that would have

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560
and if you were sensible that would have
 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.010
and if you were sensible that would have
been your trip but it wasn't right it's

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020
been your trip but it wasn't right it's
 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.570
been your trip but it wasn't right it's
that and perhaps it's a lot worse than

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
that and perhaps it's a lot worse than
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.520
that and perhaps it's a lot worse than
that perhaps there's no shortage of

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530
that perhaps there's no shortage of
 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.990
that perhaps there's no shortage of
backtracking but it doesn't matter

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000
backtracking but it doesn't matter
 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.140
backtracking but it doesn't matter
because as you stumble forward you you

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150
because as you stumble forward you you
 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.899
because as you stumble forward you you
illuminate and inform yourself and

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909
illuminate and inform yourself and
 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.399
illuminate and inform yourself and
perhaps that's partly

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409
perhaps that's partly
 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.609
perhaps that's partly
the world is made of information and if

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:44.619
the world is made of information and if
 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.879
the world is made of information and if
you encounter it and tangle with it then

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889
you encounter it and tangle with it then
 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.919
you encounter it and tangle with it then
it informs you and then you become

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:49.929
it informs you and then you become
 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.169
it informs you and then you become
informed and then you're in formation

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:52.179
informed and then you're in formation
 

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:55.349
informed and then you're in formation
and then you're ready
