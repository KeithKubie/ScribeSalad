00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.230
Attention-Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder
or ADHD is a diagnosable disorder that has

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.580
to do with how some people’s brains function.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.230
But some researchers are saying it might not
be a brain disorder… it might be a sleep

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.230
disorder!

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.240
We know getting a good night’s sleep is
important — it’s vital for healthy brain

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.420
function, your immune system health, and basic
cognitive functionality.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.840
It’s all part of the 24-hour circadian cycle
that determines when our bodies eat and sleep,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.910
and also comes with brainwave activity, hormone
production, cell regeneration, and other biological

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.940
processes.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.579
We also know getting bad, insufficient, or
disrupted sleep can cause anxiety, depression,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.850
increased impulsivity, and general cognitive
issues.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.679
Basically, ADHD and bad sleep sure look a
lot alike, according to a growing body of

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:45.679
evidence.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.050
One Dutch researcher believes, based on studies,
that sleep habits and ADHD may be quote “two

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.909
sides of the same physiological and mental
coin.”

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.719
Which is kind of a revolution in how we think
about ADHD.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.899
Studies have shown over 70 percent of kids
and adults with ADHD have sleep problems,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.610
and they’ve also shown if you fix the sleep
disruption some of the symptoms of ADHD can

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.610
disappear!

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.350
We’re not saying ADHD isn’t real, it definitely
is.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.700
But instead, science is seeing the beginnings
of a connection between the attention and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.229
hyperactivity in kids, and their sleep -- rather
than just a brain disorder.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.780
Preschoolers and kindergarteners need between
10 and 13 hours of sleep a night, but in many

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.939
cases are getting less than 9.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.259
Late-night iPad movies, demands of perfection,
and after-school activities could leave kids

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.509
so stimulated they can’t sleep, disrupting
the length, timing and quality of sleep which

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.640
may manifest as ADHD.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.140
Disorders like sleep apnea and other nighttime
breathing issues can also cause bad sleep

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.369
which might mimic ADHD symptoms!

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.640
Obviously, this isn’t the answer to all
cases of ADHD.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.290
There ARE still children — and adults — who
really DO need treatment.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.469
But it could be the case that sometimes what
looks like ADHD might be resolved by simply

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.359
sticking to a bedtime routine.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.429

And speaking of sleeping, Amy dug into how
white noise might help you get better rest

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.420
in this video right here.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.060
And one weird way to get better sleep?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.060
Turn up the AC!

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.170
We sleep better when we’re a little cold.
