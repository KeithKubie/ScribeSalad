00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.980
Generally speaking, the maximum occupancy
of a room or building is primarily determined

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.430
by the available exits, with each exit accommodating
only a certain number of people before bottlenecking

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.430
occurs.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.800
The other key component in determining the
max occupancy of a building or room is the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.250
intended use of the space, whether it’s,
for instance, a restaurant with tables and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.850
chairs or a more open event space.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.450
More specifically, the International Building
Code (IBC) provides an international standard

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.760
for calculating the maximum occupancy for
an area.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.030
The IBC defines an exit, or a means of egress,
as “A continuous and unobstructed path of

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.730
vertical or horizontal egress travel from
any occupied portion of the building or structure

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.370
to a public way.”

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.699
(2009 International Building Code, p 218)

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.710
In the United States, the National Fire Prevention
Association (NFPA) also forbids an exit from

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.020
leading occupants through a kitchen or storage
room on their way out of the building.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.980
In order to determine the maximum number of
people who are able to safely be in a room

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.190
or building, the IBC recommends a certain
number of inches of doorway per occupant.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.180
Exits that consist of a stairway need to have
0.3 inches of doorway per person, and all

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.860
other exits need 0.2 inches of doorway per
person.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.610
So a function hall that has a maximum occupancy
of 1,000 people and an exit that consisted

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.990
of a corridor without stairs will need 200
inches of doorway.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.500
With doorways at around 36 inches in width—wider
than the Americans with Disabilities Act requires

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.660
in the United States—that function hall
would need approximately six such doors.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.120
As mentioned, another important consideration
for determining the occupancy of a space is

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.310
the intended use of the space.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.020
A restaurant with chairs and tables will have
a smaller maximum occupancy than a bar with

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.250
an open dance floor or layout.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.650
The IBC recommends for spaces with unconcentrated
use of chairs and tables, such as a restaurant,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.310
that 15 square feet on that floor of the building
be dedicated to each occupant.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.640
That means a 500 square foot restaurant might
have a maximum occupancy of 33 people.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.330
However the IBC recommends areas with concentrated
use of chairs, such as a bar with a dance

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.310
floor, have 7 square feet of floor space on
that floor of the building per person.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.850
The same 500 square foot space in a bar with
a dance floor would have a tentative maximum

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.530
occupancy of 71 people.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
That said, those numbers are all dependent
on whether or not enough exits exist to allow

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.310
all of those occupants to safely leave the
building during an emergency.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.000
The impetus for these regulations in the United
States dates back to the worst hotel fire

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.110
in the country’s history.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.350
The Winecoff Hotel Fire occurred in the early
hours of the morning on December 7, 1946 in

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.850
Atlanta, Georgia.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.810
The 15-story hotel considered “fireproof”
due to its brick exterior had a single staircase

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.400
that allowed guests to move from the upper
floors to the first floor.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.990
That staircase had turned into a chimney for
the smoke and fire by the time that the first

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.840
of the fire fighters arrived at 3:45 AM.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.540
A number of trapped guests tried to escape
through their windows, but only a small portion

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.290
trapped managed to survive their escape while
the rest either died inside or fell to their

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.290
deaths.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.930
The fire resulted in 119 fatalities which
amounted to 41 percent of the hotel’s guests

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.930
that night.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.690
Of the remaining, 65 were injured and the
rest made it to safety whether because they

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.099
were below the third floor fire level or were
rescued by the 385 fire fighters who ultimately

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.480
responded to the fire.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.470
This fire occurred just six months after the
La Salle Hotel fire which killed 61 people.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.480
After these fires, President Truman ordered
a national conference on fire prevention to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.530
revise fire codes for buildings.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.420
One of the deadliest nightclub fires in U.S.
History took place at the ‘Cocoanut Grove’

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.040
in Boston, killing 492 people.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.629
(Legally the club was only authorized to have
a maximum of 460 people in it.)

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.760
There was only one other such event fire,
at Chicago’s ‘Iroquois Theater’ in 1903,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.190
that had a higher death toll- 602 people.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.459
Like the Winecoff Hotel Fire, the Cocoanut
Grove nightclub fire brought about some major

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.109
changes in safety standards and building codes.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.449
Most notably, all exterior doors to commercial
buildings had to open outwards.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.310
This was not the case at the Cocoanut Grove
club, and when the fire started the crowd

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.430
of people rushed to the doors to get out.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.919
The surge of people pushing against the doors
prevented the inward opening doors from opening,

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:59.460
trapping those inside.
