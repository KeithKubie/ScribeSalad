00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.500
Balance and equilibrium.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
They’re ideas that seem peaceful and harmonious
– surely that’s what we want in life?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.640
Well, as an engineer, sometimes you need to
upset the balance in the name of solving problems.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.200
Last time, we discussed mass transfer
and how two substances can form a mixture
through processes like diffusion,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.560
where the individual molecules are driven
by their concentration differences towards
a state of chemical equilibrium.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.100
That means having the same concentration on either
side of a boundary, or uniformly throughout a single
container, like food dye mixed into a beaker of water.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
But what if one of the components of the mixture
is more useful than the other?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.560
Worse still, what if one of the components
is actively harmful and you need to isolate it?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.960
It’s time to separate the wheat from the
chaff.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:57.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.640
Much like we’ve seen for momentum and heat,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.700
different types of molecules, especially in liquids,
are driven towards equilibrium by differences in
their concentrations.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.440
For some liquids, this happens naturally
through the process of diffusion,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.420
when the particles of a substance spread
from a region of higher concentration to a region
of lower concentration.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600
But, let’s consider something a little different.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280
Imagine thoroughly stirring some caramel sauce
into butterscotch pudding.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.560
No complaints here.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.040
But accidentally mixing a dollop of mustard
into your pudding?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.220
Well, that’s not going to taste so great.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.380
You’re probably going to want to get it out of
there, unless you have some very unusual tastes.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.340
Not that we’re judging.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.540
OK, so separating mustard from pudding
might not sound too vital,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.660
but separating different types of chemicals
from one another is something engineers need
to do pretty often!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.880
More specifically, we often want to be able
to purify chemicals or extract one particular
product from an evenly balanced mixture.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.740
That can be a crucial step in tackling an
engineering problem.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.200
To achieve this, engineers make clever use of
temperature, pressure, and flow, to create the right
conditions for separating two or more substances.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.340
Concentration differences might cause substances
to mix, but with the right apparatus, you can use
mass transfer to isolate substances instead.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.140
Let’s take a closer look at three particularly
useful separation techniques: distillation,
liquid-liquid extraction, and reverse osmosis.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.000
Now, if you’ve ever been to a bar, you’ll
know that the most popular drinks on the menu
have one thing in common: ethanol.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.820
That’s the type of alcohol people drink.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.240
And along with causing tipsy Saturday nights
and terrible headaches on Sunday mornings,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.440
ethanol has lots of important industrial uses
as a disinfectant, a preservative, and even a
source of renewable fuel!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.940
But in the form we produce it, it’s often
mixed in with too much water for those purposes.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.320
Whatever you’re using it for, you’ll need
to find a way to separate it into a purer state.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.760
And that’s where a process like distillation
can help.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.960
You might have heard of distillation before,
and for good reason!

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.860
It’s really important for engineering.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.660
It’s based on the fact that often the
components in a mixture have different
boiling points and volatilities;

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.360
that is, their tendency to vaporize at a
given temperature and pressure.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.920
A distillation column uses temperature to
separate the chemicals in a mixture based
on their different boiling points.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.620
You start by introducing the mixture into the column,
which can contain several round platforms, called plates,
that divide the column at different heights up its length.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.680
Each of the plates has little holes in it,
like a sieve.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.760
And those columns, by the way, can be as tall
as two stories high!

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.100
One of the important features of a distillation
column is that it’s heated from the bottom,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.080
so that the top is much cooler, setting up
a gradient of warmer to cooler temperatures
from bottom to top.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.690
That’s going to be important for separating
the substances!

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.720
There are two things going on throughout the
column.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.980
Liquid is falling down the column through the holes
in the plates or into the spillover, the gap between
the plates and the walls of the column.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.400
Meanwhile, gas is rising up throughout the
column, passing through the liquid and those
same holes in the plates.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.520
Depending on the temperature at a given plate,
the parts of the mixture that are still firmly in the
liquid phase will tend to be drawn downwards,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.820
while those chemicals that are at the right
temperature to become a gas will be drawn
upwards by the rising vapor.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.880
So the more volatile substances transfer into
the gas phase and join the rising vapor,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.900
while the less volatile substances, which are below
their boiling points, channel downwards as a liquid.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.100
There’s also some energy transfer going on.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.970
If some of the gas has risen high enough to
cool off and become a liquid again, it releases
some energy as it condenses.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.420
When that energy is absorbed by the more volatile
substances in the liquid, it causes them to undergo a
phase change, turning into a gas and traveling upwards.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.520
So you want the liquid and gas to interact as
much as they can at every point in the column.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.980
The plates are positioned at certain heights
up the column so they’re at the specific temperatures
that work for the chemicals you want to separate.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.820
Over time, they’ll collect concentrations
of different chemicals in the mixture.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.080
And there you have it!
Chemical separation.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.240
Like all processes in engineering distillation
isn’t 100% efficient at yielding products.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.140
The concentration of the product might be higher
than it was when it started, but it might not be high
enough after just one pass through the column.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.420
Well, no problem!

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.440
You can simply do what’s known as reflux, where
you pass the liquid back down to the bottom.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.920
There, it enters a reboiler and rises as a
gas to be further separated in the column.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.920
You can keep doing this until you’ve
separated the mixture into all its components
at the purities you want.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:16.520
Besides separating ethanol and water, this sort of
process is also used to separate crude oil into different
useful components, like motor fuel and lubricants.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.320
For other types of mixtures, you might need
a different strategy.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200
Consider alcohol again, but this time mixed
with oil.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.500
Introducing alcohol to vegetable oil, the
kind you cook with, is part of the process of
extracting lecithin, a mixture of fats.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.620
You can use it for all kinds of things, from
making chocolate flow better to intensifying
the colors in paint.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.680
As an added bonus, extracting lecithin also
helps refine vegetable oil.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.080
But you generally don’t want that alcohol
still in the oil when you come to actually use it.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.280
That’s where liquid-liquid extraction comes
in.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.080
Liquid-liquid extraction, is exactly what
it sounds like: extracting something from
one liquid into another.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.880
It’s nice when engineers give these things
sensible names.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.220
This time, instead of separating by temperature,
you’re separating liquids by density.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.280
Distillation works for chemicals that are
willing to mix, like ethanol vapor and liquid water
so they can exchange volatile particles.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.560
For liquids that don’t mix so easily, liquid-liquid
extraction provides an alternative.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.700
In an extraction unit, the idea is to decontaminate the
mixture by transferring the contaminant, in this case
alcohol, to another liquid with a different density.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.620
The liquid you’re transferring the contaminant
into is called the solvent.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.880
With the alcohol-oil example, the solvent
would be water.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.100
The important thing is that the solvent can mix with
the contaminant, but it won’t mix with the product –
the purified liquid that you want at the end.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.740
That way, they can pass through one another
while only exchanging the contaminant in the
mixture.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.340
So to do the extraction, you put the denser of the
two inputs – so either the mixture or the solvent – at
the top, and the lighter of the two inputs at the bottom.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.340
That way, when they enter the extraction unit
they’ll swap places as the denser liquid sinks
and the other floats up,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.260
forcing the solvent and the mixture
through one another.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.340
In this case, water is denser than the oil-alcohol
mixture, so you’d feed the solvent in at the top and
the mixture at the bottom,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.400
but different scenarios might require that the
solvent and the mixture to be the other way around!

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.040
Either way, you want to pick a solvent that the contaminant is more chemically attracted to than
in the original mixture –

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.060
in other words, that the contaminant is
more soluble in.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.120
That way, the contaminant will transfer to
the solvent and get carried away with it, leaving
behind a purer version of the product.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.980
Since alcohol mixes more easily with water than
oil, it gets drawn into the water as the water passes
through the mixture, leaving a purer form of oil.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.040
So even when temperature differences can’t
help you, solubility can!

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.800
Other times, the best way to separate things
is through reverse osmosis.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.700
That might sound like a science-fiction
surgical procedure,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.720
but it’s really just a fancy term for filtering
molecules or small particles from the medium
they’re mixed into.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.480
For example, of all the water on Earth, only
2.5% of it is fresh water, the kind we drink,
and most of that is locked up in glaciers!

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.080
The rest of it is undrinkable salt water – the
kind you find in the ocean.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.220
And the amount of fresh water available per
person on Earth is rapidly shrinking.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.980
But if you can find a way to separate out
the salt, you can make more fresh water from
salt water.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.820
In other words, you need a way to tip the
see-saw of chemical balance to isolate water
from the stuff it’s mixed with.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.680
To understand reverse osmosis, let’s take
a look at plain old osmosis first.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.990
Osmosis is based on the ideas of mass transfer
we looked at last episode.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:27.620
You have two liquids on either side of a semipermeable
barrier, which allows the solvent to pass through,
but not the other molecules in the mixture.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:36.200
In regular osmosis, the solvent moves from the side of
the barrier with a higher concentration to the side with a
lower concentration until both sides are in equilibrium.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.900
If we can reverse the process by forcing only the
solvent through the barrier while leaving the other types
of molecules behind, we can separate the two out.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.100
To make things less abstract, let’s go back
to our salt water conundrum.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.480
We wanted to filter out the salt from the salt
water, and we can do that with reverse osmosis.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.240
All you have to do is pressurize the water
and force it through a semipermeable barrier.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.660
With the right kind of filtering material,
the water is forced through,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:06.300
while ions like salt and bigger things like
other molecules, tiny bits of dirt, and bacteria,
are held back and removed.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.040
The stuff that gets filtered out is known
as a reject stream.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.340
At its best, reverse osmosis can remove over 99%
of the salt and other unwanted stuff from water!

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:23.980
Some countries that don’t have much fresh water, like
Saudi Arabia, have giant plants that use reverse osmosis
to generate over a million liters of fresh water every day.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.820
For the record, there are lots of other methods for
separating the different mass species in a mixture,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.220
like absorption columns, stripping columns,
driers, humidifiers, evaporators, and more.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.240
Diffusion, liquid-liquid extraction, and reverse
osmosis are three methods that come up a lot,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.080
but lots of the products we use every day
are made of materials derived from some
of the other processes.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.720
Unfortunately, rescuing your butterscotch
pudding is more difficult than it seems.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:56.380
You’d have to use a combination of different
techniques to separate components of the mustard
and pudding, like distillation and filtration.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:04.380
And even then, in the process you’d probably
also separate the pudding itself into streams of
isolated fats, sugars, dairy, starch, and salt.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.240
On second thought, maybe you should just have
an apple instead.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.980
Today we’ve covered the need for separating
chemicals from one another, and three different
processes engineers use to achieve that separation:

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.060
distillation, which separates substances 
based on their different boiling points;

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.840
liquid-liquid extraction, which uses
differences in solubility to transfer a
contaminant into a solvent;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.880
and reverse osmosis, which filters molecules
from a solvent by pressurizing it through a
semipermeable barrier.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.260
Next time, we’ll be taking a broader look at
materials, what kinds there are, the properties
they have,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.520
and how we use them to build everything
from screwdrivers to skyscrapers.

00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:43.339
