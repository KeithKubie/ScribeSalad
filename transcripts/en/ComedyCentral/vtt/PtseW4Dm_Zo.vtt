00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.205
HEY, GUYS.
[claps]

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.406
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.942
MY HUSBAND, THE PRESIDENT--

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.377
HE'S VERY TIRED,

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.412
AND HE WILL BE RESTING.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:17.084
HE'S VERY TIRED,
SO HE NEEDS TO REST.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.119
BUT AT THIS POINT,
THE CONGRESS WAS LIKE,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.324
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T
COME OUTSIDE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.993
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.329
AND SO THEY KNOCK ON THE DOOR,
LIKE, 'SCUSE ME!

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.831
IT'S ME, CONGRESS.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.733
WE'RE HAVING A FEELING THAT--

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.768
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE FEELING,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.336
BUT CAN YOU TALK TO US?

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.805
AND SHE'S LIKE,
NO, HE'S JUST SUPER TIRED.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.275
HE HAS EXHAUSTION.
LIKE, DON'T BOTHER HIM.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.111
GET OUT OF HERE, CONGRESS.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.947
AND THAT
ACTUALLY QUIETED PEOPLE.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.349
IT ACTUALLY QUIETED
THE CONGRESS.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.084
AND SHE EVEN WENT TO CONGRESS

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.620
AND WAS LIKE,
HEY, NO BIG DEAL.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.023
I'M GIVING HIM EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING, CONGRESS.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:59.593
I'M GIVING HIM ALL
THE LETTERS AND OTHER THINGS.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:02.496
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF THIS RULE

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.599
OR A LAW OR THING
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON?

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.502
AND THEY'D BE LIKE,
WHATEVER, WE THINK THIS.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.604
AND THEN SHE'D BRING IT
TO WOODROW WHO WAS LIKE,

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.773
HALF AWAKE,
AND SHE'D BE LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.775
WELL, CONGRESS IS LIKE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.544
AND HE'D BE LIKE...
[mumbles indistinctly]

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.681
AND SHE WAS LIKE,
WELL, I GUESS I'LL COMPROMISE.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.650
I'M JUST GONNA [bleep]
MAKE THE DECI--

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.651
[stammers]

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.654
MAKE THE DECISIONS MYSELF.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.558
SO BASICALLY, EDITH WILSON WAS
THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:35.729
SHE RAN MEMOS BETWEEN
CONGRESS AND HIM.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.865
CONGRESS IS LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:42.836
WHAT? WHAT?

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.105
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.509
SO CONGRESS PICKED THIS ONE
REPUBLICAN SENATOR, ALBERT FALL.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.145
THEY'RE LIKE, ALBERT, GO SEE
WHAT HIS TRUE CONDITION IS.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.414
GO SEE WHAT WILSON'S
TRUE CONDITION IS.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.917
SO ALBERT FALL SHOWS UP.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:01.054
HE'S LIKE, CAN WE COME IN
AND SEE THE TRUE CONDITION?

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.323
SHE'S NOT [bleep] STUPID.
SHE'S LIKE YEAH, SURE.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.825
COME ON IN.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.560
SO ALBERT FALL COMES IN.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.563
[dramatic music]

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.966
â™ª

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.469
IT WAS LIKE, YEP,
HE'S NOT--THIS IS HIM.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.504
MAKING DECISIONS EVERY DAY,

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.607
AND NOT I--TAKE THE--
THANK YOU, HONEY.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.076
AND I TAKE THE--
THE PAPERS FROM HIM

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.345
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
'CAUSE I'M JUST SOME DUMB BROAD.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.415
AND EDITH JUST PROPPED UP
WOODROW IN BED.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.584
LIKE, WAVING, LIKE HEY.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.186
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
OH, OKAY. COOL.

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:33.654
AND SHE'S LIKE, BYE.
AND THEN THEY LEAVE.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.422
THAT'S HOW DUMB GOVERNMENT IS.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.926
WE HAD A WOMAN [bleep] RUNNING
THIS COUNTRY,

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:39.993
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.094
YOU COULD GO,
NOTHING GOOD HAPPENED,

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.630
BUT I CAN GO,
NOTHING BAD HAPPENED.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.867
9/11 DIDN'T HAPPEN
ON HER WATCH.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:51.104
DISNEYLAND WITH JOHNNY DEPP
AT THE ANI--

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:55.275
THE--HO--THE HAUNTED MANSION
THAT'S ALL TIM BURTON--

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.211
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
ON HER WATCH.

00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:59.713
CHRISTMAS
AND HALLOWEEN COMBINED,

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:01.448
A LOT OF THINGS--

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:01.949 line:0%
