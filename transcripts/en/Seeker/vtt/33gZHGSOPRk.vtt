00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.380
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.950
A Do-you-think-he-saurus.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.040
Sorry not sorry, that was kind of lame, but
it got us talking about dinosaurs!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.320
The prehistoric reptiles fascinate almost
all of us at some point.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.410
I bet you know a lot about dinosaurs.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.210
But let’s run down a few of the things you
might not know about them.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.350
Let’s just get this one out of the way first…
humans and dinosaurs never coexisted.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.350
Nope.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.350
Never.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350
Sorry Flintstones fans..

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.870
The earliest human fossil we know of dates
around 2.8 million years ago.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.030
whereas the dinosaurs went exist like 65 million
years ago.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.030
So yeah.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.200
That never happened.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.140
But there were little proto-mammals running
around with dinosaurs for nearly 150 million

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.140
years.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.590
Some little guys looked like mice and weighed
as little as 2 grams.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.530
Others actually ate dinosaurs, yeah.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380
Some of the small species ate dino eggs.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.980
(Not it didn’t cause their extinction) But
one study published in the journal Nature

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.940
described two species, that dined on dinosaurs.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.399
Repenomamus giganticus and Repenomamus robustus,
lived in China about 130 million years ago.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.449
Like its name suggests, R. Giganticus, was
pretty big for an early mammal, at about 3

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.449
feet long.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.760
Speaking of big things, some giant Pterosaurs
have wingspans over 30 feet long!

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.340
And they aren’t dinosaurs!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.220
Dinosaurs are terrestrial reptiles, so by
definition, pterosaurs, a flying reptile,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.420
don’t make the cut.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.530
They did co-exist, but they are separate groups
descended from a common ancestor.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.400
According to Smithsonian magazine, “pterosaur
is no more a dinosaur than a goldfish is a

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
shark.”

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400
Oops.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.250
And one study published in the journal PLOS
One found that they didn’t use their legs

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130
to push off the ground, they used their wings!

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.840
They would run down hill, into a head wind
and launch themselves, like a pole vaulter,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.860
into the air.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.730
So yeah.. don’t call them dinosaurs.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.200
We know A LOT about dinosaurs, but there are
some really enigmatic mysteries that remain.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.350
Like, what did dinosaurs sound like?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.090
Unfortunately soft tissue doesn’t fossilize
all that well, so we don’t have an exact

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.390
idea of what kind of noises dinosaurs.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.570
Although a recent discovery shed some light
on dino sounds.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.649
A new species of “terror bird” describe
in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.380
was found with a nearly complete skeleton…
including voice box!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.659
The researchers think that it used a narrow,
low vocalization frequency range, to possibly

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.710
communicate or find prey.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969
Sounds pretty cool and could be the topic
of a whole ‘nother episode ...and maybe

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.709
if you were a subscriber you wouldn’t miss
that episode!

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.340
Last but not least..we still don’t know
what killed the dinosaurs.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.749
I mean yeah, we’ve narrowed it down pretty
close.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.420
The KT event happened 65 million years ago,
when an asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.840
region of Mexico.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.489
But my favorite hypothesis is that a global
firestorm flash fried the dinosaurs.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.849
I mean a lot of species were already on their
way out when the asteroid hit.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.950
One study published in the journal Nature
suggests that a series of crazy volcanic eruptions

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.939
that started started 250,000 before the asteroid
hit, might have killed a lot of them off.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.939
As for that asteroid…

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.970
A few years ago, a study published in the
Journal of Geophysical Research found that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.299
when the asteroid hit it kicked up a lot dirt
into the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.590
With as much force as 100 trillion tons of
TNT.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.559
As the debris rained back down it could have
heated the upper atmosphere to 2,700 degrees

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.840
Fahrenheit (1,482 degrees Celsius).

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.079
It might have also caused a devastating winter
like planet where nothing green could grow

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.019
so all the dinosaurs starved over months or
years.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.489
OOORRRR this theory suggests that it kicked
off a world wide fire storm and the dinosaurs

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.409
baked to death in a matter of HOURS.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.799
Wiping out 80% of all life on Earth.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.139
Which is a really cool idea.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.180
It’s so .. Apocalyptical.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.000
But versions of this story are over ten years
old, one first appeared in the Bulletin of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.019
the Geological Society of America in 2004.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.362
Since then, some holes have been poked in
it, like one study published in Journal of

00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:32.400
the Geological Society found that fire storms
weren’t worldwide.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.059
The heat pulses from the impact wouldn’t
have set nearby plants on fire, but could

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.870
have done some damage to those further away
from the impact site.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.999
Obviously more research is needed.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.939
Personally, I kind of like the idea that what
killed the dinosaurs still remains a mystery.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.319
It’s one of the most enduring, and frankly
fun mysteries in science.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.999
It keeps us curious.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.680
Scientists learn new stuff all the time about
dinosaurs.. sometimes they even re-learn old

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.680
things!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.139
Check out Crystal as she explains why the
name “brontosaurus” could be making a

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:10.969
comeback 
in 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:24.630
this episode here.
