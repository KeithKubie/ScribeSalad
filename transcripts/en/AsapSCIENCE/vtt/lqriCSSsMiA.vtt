00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.079
From twigs to electrical toothbrushes humans have been cleaning our teeth since the ancient Egyptians in 5000 BCE.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.300
But, what if you just straight-up stopped brushing your teeth at all for the rest of your life?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.680
Within minutes of stopping, the food debris and moist environment from your saliva creates an ideal environment for bacteria to survive.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.499
Streptococci is one of the most common bacteria found in our mouth and it's normally not harmful,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.160
until it metabolizes sugar or protein from food debris.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.340
But after a full day, these bacteria would have already produced significant amounts of plaque from sugars.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.900
Plaque is the slimy layer of biofilm that you can feel on your teeth when you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.540
"accidentally" forget to brush sometimes.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.910
And this plaque actually helps the bacteria adhere to your teeth,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.360
which allows them to produce even more plaque creating a cycle of bacteria and plaque build up.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.160
After a week, all this build-up will cause some pretty serious bad breath.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.340
Not to mention that the plaque begins to harden and form tartar that lead to your teeth appearing yellow.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.720
At this point, you're also causing significant damage to tooth enamel

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.000
as the bacteria break down sugar to produce lactic acid.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.519
Enamel is the hard mineralized outer layer of the tooth.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.869
And once it breaks down,

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.700
you can't make any more.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.669
After a month, your decaying teeth will form cavities.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.509
These holes in your teeth get deeper and deeper if left untreated, leading to gingivitis, an early form of gum disease.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.259
This is because the immune system

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.300
attacks your gums and teeth in response to the bacteria build up.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.899
Your cavities will fill up with pus, which is a protein-rich fluid filled

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.389
with dead white blood cells and your gums will be

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.119
extremely sensitive at this point, turning red when you touch it and bleeding with any significant pressure.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.760
After an entire year of neglect, you now have Periodontitis.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.040
The inner layer of the gum and bone are broken down by enzymes and pull away from the teeth to form pockets,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.160
which only further allow collected food debris and bacteria to gather.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.960
This causes the immune system to go into overdrive and destroys your gums and ligaments,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.100
resulting in advanced Periodontitis where your teeth become loose and begin to fall out.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.820
Any longer, and the issues can spread beyond your mouth and into your blood,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.220
causing inflammation throughout your organs and increasing the likelihood of erectile disfunction,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480
head and neck cancer, chronic heart disease, and even dementia development.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.300
Combine your lack of brushing with a poor diet high in processed foods, and especially sugar,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.440
which is much more common now than early Homo sapiens would have experienced,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.920
and you have a much more accelerated breeding ground for bacteria,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.321
putting your whole body's health at risk.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.500
Brush your teeth kids!

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.780
[Mitch] Thank you guys for watching if you have any burning questions.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.140
If you have any burning questions

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.459
[Greg] -Flaming questions

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.699
[Mitch] -that you want us to answer leave it in the comments below and we'll try to tackle it this year.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.700
[Greg] -Seriously. Let us know what you want to see; we'll make it.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.309
