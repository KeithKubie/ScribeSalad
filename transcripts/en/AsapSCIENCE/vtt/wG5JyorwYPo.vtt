00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
LSD, also known as acid

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is a psychedelic drug famous for altering your perception and creating hallucinations.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.500
But how does it actually works and what is the effect on your body and more importantly, your brain?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.400
Lysergic acid diethylamide was first synthesised in 1938 from the fungus that grew on rye.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.060
In 1943, the inventor Albert Hofmann accidentally touched some to his mouth,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.840
got high and became the first person in the world to learn about psychedelic properties of LSD.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.000
Research on the drug took place in the 50s and 60s, but as recreational use  began to spread,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.500
psychedelic drugs were made an illegal Schedule I drug in the US and research programs were haulted.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.500
While other drugs are dosed in grams, a single dose of LSD is measured in one 100,000th of a gram,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
which is one 10th the mass of a grain of sand.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.800
LSD affects multiple brain receptors such as the dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and glutamate receptors.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.000
But most research is on the stimulatory serotonin receptor 5H2TA

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
LSD hits the receptor at an unexpected angle causing it to fold over the LSD creating a lid.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.500
The LSD is then trapped which makes this receptor continually fire, causing you to hallucinate.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Your body responds by sucking the 5TH2A receptor into the cell in order to degrade the LSD,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but this can take up to 12+ hours to happen which is why the high can last so long.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Recently, LSD research has seen a revival and using contemporary neural imaging techniques,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
researchers found that the drug causes parts of your brain to communicate in unique ways, especially in the visual cortex

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
potentially explaining the vivid and complex hallucinations

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There's also decreased blood flow in the default mode network, correlating to strong changes in consciousness, characterized as ego-dissolution,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
described as a feeling where the boundary that separates you from the rest of the world dissolves.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Many people report this feeling brings a sense of reconnection with themselves, others, and the natural world. In fact,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.260
a study on 20 healthy volunteers receiving 75 micrograms of LSD saw that 2 weeks after being dosed,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.140
they scored higher for the traits of optimism and openness, with increased creativity and imagination.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.520
This has lead researchers to consider LSD as a therapy for patients with death anxiety and life-threatening illnesses.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.080
Researchers found that 12 months after treatment, patients reported a reduction in anxiety and rise

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.300
in quality of life, as the drug helped them restructure their habits and worldview.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.560
It is also why the trend of microdosing is emerging,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.380
where a person takes one 10th of a recreational dose of LSD, attempting to skip the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.720
hallucinations and instead experience heightened alertness, energy, and creativity.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.080
Although LSD is non-addictive and researchers rate it as significantly less dangerous than other drugs like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.840
cocaine and heroine, there's still an extreme lack of scientific studies to the explain the widespread

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.920
microdosing trend and even experienced hallucinogen users sometimes experience bad trips producing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.120
irrational fears, paranoia, and panic attacks. LSD can also cause flashbacks, where months after the drug has

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.540
worn off, it can feel as though you're experiencing the effects of the high all over again. In some extreme occasions,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.780
people have developed Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, which is like a never-ending trip.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.720
Thinking that LSD can lead to psychosis and the risk of suicide are overstated.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.540
The 14% of participants in the US national survey who had done psychedelics in the life had no increased

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.840
risk of developing psychosis, depression, or suicide attempts, but the new research around LSD's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.840
potential positive effects is also very young. So this might not be a trip you want to take.
