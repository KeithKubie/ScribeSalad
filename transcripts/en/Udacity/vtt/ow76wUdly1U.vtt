00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.440
Some other non-functional issues which we've maybe alluded to but that

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.780
also play a role in dealing with these distributed heterogeneous application.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.100
Include fault tolerance. How does the system deal with, let's say, exceptions

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.530
that arise. Flexibility, how to support, change in any of the components.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.950
In general, you want to be able to support reuse. What that means is,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.220
can you take some of the pieces, the components, and use them in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.270
related applications? Thereby, improving your productivity. In general,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.510
these applications can get quite complexed and they are often mission critical.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.390
So you need to be able to manage that complexity. And fifth is quality service.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.036
Quality of service or QOS is an, is a concept who's goal is to be able

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:59.167
to specifically measure the non-functional constraints. And

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:04.000
the extent to which the system deals with those. With performance, that's easy.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.780
You can, you can measure the things like response time or throughput. But some

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.160
of the other non-functional considerations are harder to get a number around.
