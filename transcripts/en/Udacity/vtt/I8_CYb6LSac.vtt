00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.130
How do we control access to resources
with a context of authentication that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.910
establishes a source and the idea
that these authorization check or

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.670
access control check has to happen if
the resources have to be protected.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970
Really, for us to be able to
answer this question we had,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.710
whether a request should be granted or
denied,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.450
we have to know who is allowed to access
what resources in a given system.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.670
So if you think about this, there
are really two parts to this problem, or

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.870
the way we're going to
address this problem.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.440
In part one, someone has to
specify who has access to what.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.600
So this is called
an access control policy.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.980
So there may be many ways to
decide who gets to access what.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.830
There has to be a policy
we have in place

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.860
that is going to define this for us.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.430
So to answer this question about who can
access what, is you tell the system how

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.340
the resources should be shared, or who
should be given access to what resource.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.084
Once you do that, then it's
the part two is about enforcement.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:09.505
The system has to monitor each
request for these resources, and

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:14.482
based on the policy that tells us who
can access what, it should make sure

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:19.842
any accesses that are allowed are
consistent with the policy that we have.

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:23.602
So enforcement basically says
there is no way for you to go and

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:27.472
access a resource when that access
is not allowed by the policy.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:31.212
So define the policy that's in part one,
and then enforce the policy,

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:32.810
that's part two.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.060
Now you can see the importance
of complete mediation.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.680
Clearly complete mediation says,
no one should be able to bypass and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.350
get to the resource without going
through the trusted computing base.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.660
If you don't have complete mediation
then we can't perform this check,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.130
access control check that
we are talking about.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.450
That is possible only when the trusted
computing base is involved in a request

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.730
and that is why complete mediation is so
important.
