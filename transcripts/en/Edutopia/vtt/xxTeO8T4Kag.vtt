00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.022
(birds chirping)

00:00:01.022 --> 00:00:04.060
- [Woman] Here in Nashville
we have 168 schools.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.760
- [Woman 2] We have about 88,000 students,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.760
124 languages are spoken.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.630
We have historically had over 70 percent

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.470
economically disadvantaged
in our district.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.790
In some of our schools
we had lots of tension,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.210
some frustrations,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.310
just realizing that we
weren't meeting the needs

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.910
of all of our students.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210
There wasn't an emphasis or a focus

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.850
on social-emotional learning.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810
- My first year, I had a
principal come up to me.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.344
He said, "Kyla, I completely agree with

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.180
"social emotional learning and
I love the work you're doing,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.650
"but I don't do hugs,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.480
"so we're not gonna do this at my school."

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.430
It really made me pause and reflect

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.880
and think we don't even
have a common definition

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.330
of what social emotional learning is.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.081
- Are we willing to work hard today?

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.440
- Yes!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.130
- [ Kyla] So we worked on our
definition for the district.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.150
We say that social emotional learning

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.790
are the skills that students and adults

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.980
have in order to be lifelong learners.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.220
So their self-awareness,
their self-management,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.270
relationship skills,
responsible decision making,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.850
and social awareness.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.230
- [Babs] There is a huge
and growing body of research

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.360
that shows that all great learning

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.200
happens in social context.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630
- I had one question.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.270
- So, you really can't divorce

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.939
the social and emotional
from the learning.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.160
- [Male Student] ...how
they, they just probably

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.917
say hello to her, just to, so they was...

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:37.430
- [Female Student] So, let's
answer some of these questions.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.930
Have y'all ever felt like an outcast?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.030
- Social emotional learning

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.350
is really about knowing
who we are as individuals

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.580
and giving us the skills we need

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.127
to interact with other people
in emotionally healthy ways.

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:51.200
- SEL is not separate.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
Who in here was stressed
the last two weeks?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.800
It's not just the time
that you might start

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.940
a five-minute lesson and do an SEL thing

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.890
at the beginning of class and
then that's where we leave it.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.040
- [Female Student] This
line right here say...

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.050
- When you're going in and
seeing a Socratic circle,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.150
they're demonstrating the
ability to communicate

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.740
and that is an SEL strategy.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.014
That is helping them develop that ability

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.820
in a more effective way.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.400
It needs to be ingrained and looked at

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.750
in all parts of the things
we do in the school day.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.790
- It also has really
positive impacts on culture.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.010
It helps build the skills
and mindsets that kids need

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.700
and also adults need to be pushed with

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.360
to be their best versions of themselves.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.310
- Doing alright today?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.410
- The district has supported us wholly.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.460
They've given us the green light

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.180
to do things that are innovative.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.160
Through our SEL department
we have a great team

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.610
that can come to the schools.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.620
Sometimes it's just a
word of encouragement,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.831
or can we come and see and give feedback.

00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.100
(children talking)

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.400
- We have created a walkthrough rubric.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.920
Helping schools see where they are

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.760
with the implementation process

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.750
and then we can support
the school at their level.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.090
That really identifies SEL best practice

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.670
in three broad areas.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.600
So first, we're looking
at school-wide community.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.870
Is it inclusive?

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.960
How welcome do visitors feel?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.220
How welcoming is it to the students?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.460
Does it feel like this space
belongs to the students?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.350
We also look at classroom instruction.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.280
So how are teachers explicitly
integrating SEL in academics?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.179
The teacher needs to know that, oh!

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.240
They expect that I'm gonna
make an engaging, active,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.460
and interactive classroom environment.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.139
In the third area we look
at with these walk-throughs

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.780
classroom environment,
management, discipline.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.990
What are practices and policies

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.490
that are creating disparate discipline

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.030
that are disenfranchising students

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.630
and preventing those
students who need school most

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.960
from being in school every day.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.230
Now we have much clearer
protocols and expectations

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.830
around restorative
practices in our schools.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.800
- [Rachel] Across elementary,
middle, and high school,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.160
you will see our students in circles,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.850
talking and sharing.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.520
- One commitment I
value is keeping myself-

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.970
- [Rachel] Other practices are group work,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.520
really working together on a project.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.440
Also making sure that there
are clear rules, definitions,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.030
and procedures in place
so that students know

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.880
what the expectations are of them

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.490
and have that common
language among the teachers,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.750
the students, and the community.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.583
(hallway chatter)

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.880
- Our goal is to understand together

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.300
what each person's situation is

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.210
because this is a learning process.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.043
Okay?

00:04:34.043 --> 00:04:38.030
- [Babs] Every school receives
ACES awareness training.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.863
- So, what happened?

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:41.187
And then we gonna talk about it.

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:44.370
- [Rachael] ACES are Adverse
Childhood Experiences.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.710
- There's a lot of research out,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.507
and there's a whole list of
things that are considered

00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:53.080
to be events in kids' lives
that can cause trauma,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.930
and so in order to reverse that trauma,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.450
you have to do some
very intentional things.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.080
- You guys have changed and grown up

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.390
so much this year and I'm so-

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.680
- So every schools really looking at

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.970
how can we create these safe environments

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.250
where kids wanna come to school,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.160
where they can feel engaged,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.340
where teachers are supporting children

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.870
whom come from a background
of trauma or chronic stress.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.130
- [Rachael] We saw that we really need

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.600
to start with the adults.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.720
If we don't have the knowledge,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.740
it's hard to model
something for our students.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.540
- Start with understanding
that it isn't a program,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.240
it isn't a single strategy,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.790
it's a paradigm shift.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.160
It is understand the why behind it

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.080
and be able to communicate that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.590
with the adults in the building.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.630
- [Student] Thank you so much, Allie-

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.930
- It's our responsibility
to think through,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.460
okay, how am I gonna make sure

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.440
that I have good, strong relationships

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.577
with everyone that I work with

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:53.570
and then model how to do that

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.590
with my peers and with my colleagues.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.876
- [Babs] Whenever we pull adults together,

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.550
most of the time, we're
sitting in a circle.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.810
- There's so much potential there.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.337
- [Babs] We're checking
in with each other.

00:06:04.337 --> 00:06:06.330
We're doing a mindful practice.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.320
- In through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.290
- So, we're using those various strategies

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.960
that we're asking teachers

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.820
to go back to the classroom and use.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.670
I think a real positive about our district

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.289
is that there's this top-down vision

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.560
of how we want our schools to be,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.790
but there's also this grass-roots

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.680
kind of rising from the bottom,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.290
where teachers are really
being very proactive

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.289
in advocating for students' SEL.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.330
- Breathe in, breathe out.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.680
- We have more and more
principals and school leaders,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.100
and teachers wanting to be
trained in it and wanting more.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.008
- [Student] You look fantastic.

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:49.660
- Fantastic?

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.960
- In Tennesse, we're in
transition right now.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.530
We have people in our state

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.010
that don't believe that
social emotional learning

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.810
should be a part of our curriculum,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.766
and metro-school is
still standing up going,

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.810
this is what we need to do.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.930
- [Woman] Class been okay?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.900
- Yep.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.705
- It values our work and it gives us

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:11.360
the autonomy to say, "You can do it."

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.470
That takes courage,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.650
and that takes the support of the district

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.070
and they've given that.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.830
- You had a perfect day? That's awesome.
