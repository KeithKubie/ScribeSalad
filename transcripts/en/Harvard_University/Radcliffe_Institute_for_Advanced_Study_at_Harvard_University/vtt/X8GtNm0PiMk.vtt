00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.100
- Good morning and welcome
to Radcliffe day 2017.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.770
And welcome to a lovely
spring day in New England.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.910
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.970
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.290
I'm a professor of American
history here at Harvard,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.910
and, like many of you, I am
an avid and concerned consumer

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.830
of the news.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:48.030
I am also a longtime admirer of
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.680
whom we will honor
with Radcliffe's metals

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.510
at today's lunch.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.620
By tradition, and by
design, this morning panel

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.130
is devoted to a topic
that is close to the heads

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.330
and hearts of our honorees,
often highlighting challenges

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.180
in the area in which
they have excelled.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.800
Today's exploration, of
untruths and their consequences,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.180
will help us appreciate Gwen and
Judy's commitment to integrity

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.330
in journalism all the more.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.070
Over a year ago, we decided
to focus this Radcliffe day

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.640
on the changing media
landscape and to celebrate

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.590
the best of journalism.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.530
When we began planning, the
phrase, alternative facts,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.290
was still an oxymoron and not
yet a fact of our existence,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.640
fake news was a
fringe phenomenon,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.060
and the Oxford English
Dictionary had not yet

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.470
designated post-truth as its
word of the year for 2016.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.690
Who, then, could imagine a
president of the United States

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.460
accusing the mainstream
media of purveying fake news,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.440
and in a tweet,
calling the free press,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.820
the enemy of the
American people?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.650
Presidents have long been
annoyed, even angered,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.470
by journalists,
but they have not

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190
depicted freedom of
the press as a threat

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.980
to the very nation
that enshrines

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.170
that ideal in its constitution.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.490
Meanwhile, we are experiencing
equally dramatic changes

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.520
in the ways that we
encounter the news.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.710
A proliferation
of media sources,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.660
including Facebook, clickbait,
tweets, retweets, and memes,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.600
has infiltrated
the news landscape.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.530
The dizzying number
and speed of new media

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.590
challenge the
notion of authority,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.490
dismantle long standing
methods of quality control,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.000
and fragment American
audiences into narrow,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.060
and often ideologically
defined, market segments.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.180
Tried and true media
like television news,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.990
frequently use similar
divide and conquer tactics.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.770
Networks know that there are
large potential audiences

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.970
on the left, and the right, and
across all educational levels

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.960
and income brackets, who want
their biases confirmed, not

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.460
challenged, by uncomfortable
or inconvenient facts.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.420
So, instead of sober and
meticulous reporting,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.250
we see panels of partisans who
substitute loudness of shouting

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.380
for depth of analysis.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.190
Simplified messages might
entertain viewers and boost

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.540
ratings, but they do not
provide the illuminating inquiry

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.530
that an informed
electorate requires.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.900
And, yet, with
all the pandering,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.780
a large proportion of
the American public

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.910
still claims to deeply distrust
the media and the information

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.620
it conveys.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.220
That distrust
should worry us all.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.490
Whether the topic is
the fate of Obamacare,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.030
relations with Russia,
or climate change,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.380
only a well informed citizenry,
with a genuine understanding

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.160
of the issues at stake,
can weigh opposing views

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.800
and make smart and
fair decisions,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.910
with full appreciation of
the trade offs involved.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.030
A healthy, trusted
news media matters

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.090
to all of us who care
about making the United

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.860
States the robust, deliberative
democracy it has long

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.000
aspired to be.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.560
How can we hope to live
up to those aspirations

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.280
with an embattled first
amendment, a besieged media,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.560
and an electorate
wandering in the wilderness

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.520
unable to distinguish
between truth and untruths?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.870
We are here today to probe
how we got here, but perhaps

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.950
even more important, to ask
what we can do about it.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.600
We should also ask how
journalism and journalists can

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.970
respond to these challenges.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.880
I am cheered, for
example, that in the face

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.450
of the turmoil of the last
four months, and particularly

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.700
over the astonishing
last few weeks,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.930
there have been journalists
who have remained undeterred,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.230
and even more determined,
to fulfill the press's

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.180
constitutional responsibility
to pursue the truth wherever

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.430
it may take us.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.270
One of the ways that we tackle
big questions like these

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.180
at the Radcliffe
Institute is by assembling

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.290
stellar groups of individuals
to share experiences

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.210
and expertise.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.870
We do so, all year long,
with lectures, conferences,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.710
and seminars, and
today is no exception.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.930
As an Institute
for advanced study,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.360
we know that deep research and
informed analysis do matter,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.590
and we value debate among
different perspectives as a way

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.260
to move deliberation forward.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.690
This morning's discussion
brings together

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.820
some of today's best minds.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.570
Liberal, and conservative, from
the classroom, and the news

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.360
room, to help us
think through an issue

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.500
that surely stands among the
most important challenges

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.980
our society faces
at this moment.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.140
To guide our
conversation today, we

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.340
are fortunate to have my Harvard
colleague, Ann Marie Lipinski,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.040
as our moderator.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.290
Ann Marie has won a Pulitzer
for her own investigative

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.710
journalism, and has gone
on to award Pulitzers

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.350
to others, first as
a member, and then

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.990
as co-chair of the
Pulitzer Prize board.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.140
Ann Marie is
currently the curator

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.570
of the Nieman
Foundation at Harvard,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.240
and in her six
years on campus, she

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.900
has made the Nieman
program an integral part

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.120
of Harvard's academic life.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.130
In planning this
year's Radcliffe day

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.920
on the topic of
integrity and journalism,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.760
I have benefited enormously
from Ann Marie's insight

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.230
and her generosity.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.440
She has been with me
every step of the way,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.140
so I am delighted to
have her here today

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.070
to introduce our panelists and
to moderate the discussion.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.400
But, before we dive into
our panel discussion,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.770
we have a special treat.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.650
As you know, this
afternoon we will honor

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.900
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.990
Someone who has worked
closely with both of them

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.260
is David Brooks, columnist
at the New York Times,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.650
and frequent guest
on the PBS NewsHour.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.900
Whatever the
medium, David always

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.660
enlightens us with
his own unique angle

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.090
on concerns of the moment.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.920
David has to be in
Washington, DC this afternoon.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.390
He's actually going to hold
the fort at the PBS NewsHour,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.690
so he will not be able to
stay for the lunch program.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.940
But he did not
want this day to go

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.010
by without adding his own
tribute to Gwen and to Judy.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.260
So when David finishes
his reflections,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.210
Ann Marie will
introduce the panelists

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.130
and we will begin
our discussion.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.800
Please join me now in
welcoming David to the podium.

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:49.760
- Thank you.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.843
I thought I'd try to impress
my boss by showing up

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:52.550
to work today.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.100
Now, you should know, I teach
at Yale, and so I'll be brief.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.600
I know you Harvard people didn't
come here to hear me speak,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.224
you came here to hear
yourselves speak.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.990
I will try to get out
of the way of that.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.750
I have a unique specialty.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.810
I go on Public Broadcasting
and I debate Catholics

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.570
from Massachusetts.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.430
One of them on
NPR, is EJ Dionne,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.010
is sitting over there somewhere.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.670
And then, I do a segment on
the NewsHour with Mark Shields,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.440
our segment is called
Shields and Brooks.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.330
It should've been
called Brook Shields,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.420
but that wouldn't
have been better.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.220
My line about Mark,
is, he's been doing it

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.810
for a little while,
that's the segment's now

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.650
Shields and Brooks.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.020
Before that, it was Shields
and [? Shego, ?] before

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.810
that, it was Shields and
Gergen and before that it was

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.270
Shields and Coolidge, I think.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.890
It started out at Shields
and Thomas Aquinas,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.740
I think, it's a while ago.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:05.720
And we do have just
a very good time.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.690
The show always
lightens my spirit,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.130
and informs me, and makes
me feel a little better

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.460
about America,
because of that show.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.990
Our audience skews a
little on the senior side.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.930
When a 93-year-old lady comes
up to me in the airport,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.690
I know what she's going to say,
it's I don't watch your show

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.188
but my mother loves it.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.180
So I'll just give a few quick
remarks about Gwen and Judy.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.420
I have a group that I have
dinner with every Thursday

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.050
night in DC.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.790
I've written a
column about them.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.790
And they're a bunch
of kids from DC,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.510
almost all African-American
kids 18 to 22,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.060
and they've had
rough backgrounds.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.240
And they all come to this
home where they can stay

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.740
and where they get food.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.870
And we meet there
every Thursday,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.270
and we've been doing it
for about three years.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.820
And they're just on
the cusp of life.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.730
And what we give
them is, we adults

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.357
sit there and let them
show their talents to us

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:13.690
and find themselves in that way.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.730
We provide them for an audience.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.610
What they give to us is
a complete intolerance

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.452
of social distance.

00:11:20.452 --> 00:11:22.660
So I walk into this thing
the first time I went there

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.540
three years ago and I met
a kid and his name was Ed

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.156
and I reached out
to shake his hand,

00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:30.280
and he just said, we don't
really shake hands here,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.240
we hug here, and he sort
of embraced me in a hug

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.430
and we've been hanging all
over each other ever since.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.300
And so, I was there last
night, with these kids,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.810
and it was just such a pleasure
to use time over dinner

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.320
to talk about Gwen
and Judy and to tell,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.290
sort of that generation,
a few things about how

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.220
one can conduct one's life.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.799
And when I agreed to do this,
I thought Gwen would be here,

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.590
and I was going to give
her a lot more crap

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.380
than I'll be able to today.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.510
But one of the things
I described to them

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.520
was that on the day
Gwen died and Judy

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.820
called with the news I
went through my emails,

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.029
and I just looked at all
the emails she'd sent me.

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.820
And some of them were
just check in emails,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.810
how you doin', you know, or
giving me some business about

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.160
a column I'd written.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.130
But a surprising number
were surprisingly tough

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.290
like, you need to learn
to communicate better,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.060
or, there were things that
I had let down the show.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.040
And her toughness
is one of the things

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.057
that that leaps out at me.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.015
Toughness and tenacity.

00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:41.800
A tenacity we saw all
through the conventions,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.060
as she continued doing her
work, when she was much sicker

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.620
than I, at least, knew.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.020
And so, she's at the end of
the spectrum on toughness

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.970
and resilience, but
she's also on the end

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.190
of the spectrum on kindness.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.030
And it's that odd combination
of those two things,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.300
extremely incandescent around
people at the same time

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.370
toughness on behalf of craft.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.560
The love of people
is at the extreme,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.040
the dedication to craft,
the humility before God.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.830
And so the thing I
wanted to talk to my kids

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.830
about was, just what it is,
is a vocation, which, I think,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.620
if there's one thing that
Judy and Gwen represent,

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.650
it's that quality of
having a vocation,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.260
and dedication to vocation.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.900
Frederick Bittner,
the novelist, once

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.140
wrote that a vocation is
where your deep gladness meets

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.810
the world's deepest need and
it's the marriage of those two

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:39.310
things.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.080
A career is something
you choose and you

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.380
do as long as it's paying
off for you, but a vocation

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.700
you're sort of summoned to.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.330
The great example is, Viktor
Frankl was a psychologist

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.070
in Austria in the '30s.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.180
He was put in Auschwitz,
and he said, you know,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.120
we often tell people, what
do you want from life,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.560
and he said that's
the wrong question.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.520
The right question is,
what is life asking of you.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.030
And I would say
for Gwen and Judy,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.510
life, and especially this
year, has asked them,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.380
and asked Judy now, to be
an anchor of a certain sort

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.620
of news organization, which
I'll describe in a minute

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.990
but which is a certain
sort of old fashioned news

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.650
organization.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:30.790
A vocation requires a talent,
which Gwen and Judy have had.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.222
It reveals itself
through a pleasure.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.680
When you found your vocation
you get intrinsic pleasure out

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.650
of doing those things,
and most of all

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.900
it expresses itself
through a consistency

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.220
of commitment over time.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.250
A commitment is falling
in love with something

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.470
and then building a structure
of behavior around it

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.090
for those moments
when love falters.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.970
And so, when I think
about the NewsHour

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.020
and especially Gwen's commitment
to it and now Judy's, what

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.770
I think about is consistency
over time and permanence.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.240
When I think of Judy, I
think of her writing notes

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.100
furiously before a segment,
through the afternoon

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.400
and through the mornings.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.040
Judy's been in this
business a while

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.350
and it would be easy to coast.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.480
Television is an
industry in which

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.000
coasting is supremely easy
and supremely alluring.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.570
And yet I've never seen her
come anything less than 300%

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.790
prepared for any segment
we've been doing.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.030
And so, it is that
consistency and permanence

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.300
over time that I think
is what's so emblematic,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.340
and that's what I so much
wanted to talk to my kids about.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.950
And then permanence and
consistency in what we do.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.940
The NewsHour is
not just a program,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.920
it's an institution, and those
of us who come to work there,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.800
it was there before
we came, and I hope

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.740
and pray it will be there
long after we're gone.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.720
And when you come
to the NewsHour,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.860
you come and try to inhabit
certain standards of behavior.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.580
For the first 10 years I did
it, the host was Jim Lehrer,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.910
and when I would say
something good on the program,

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.080
his eyes would crinkle
with a little pleasure,

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.165
and when I said something
bad his mouth would turn down

00:16:21.165 --> 00:16:24.200
in a little displeasure.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.360
And so, I learned how
to do this business

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.370
by trying to avoid the mouth
turn down and get the eye

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.180
crinkle.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.850
And so, there's certain
standards that no one even

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.610
has to express, that
are inherent in walking

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.520
in the place.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.370
And Jim and Robbins
started it, Gwen and Judy

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.910
have continued it, and I
think we all have a sensation

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.070
now that somehow
the NewsHour has

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.286
found its moment in this year.

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:51.660
Not only in the
ratings, which we

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:58.340
don't care about, but
in the value of doing

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.120
the permanent, long-standing
traditional things in an era

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.910
where impermanence
and attention-deficit

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.750
are becoming the norm.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.650
And so, something stable,
and solid, and permanent,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.619
and old-fashioned,
and counter-cultural,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:18.130
somehow becomes a pillar in a
moment when a lot of pillars

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.720
are being washed away.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.550
And so, basically, I just
talked to the kids about all

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.339
these things, about
permanence, about institutions,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.130
about vocations, about
the love of people,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.340
and then just to round it
off I took out my phone

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.610
and I took out a big
picture of Gwen on my phone.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.150
And after Gwen died when people
were eulogizing her the one

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.640
thing every eulogy
and every obituary

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.720
had was about the
quality of her smile.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.390
And the words were,
incandescent, luminescent,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.780
lit from within.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.140
And I don't know what creates
that kind of incandescence

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.920
and luminescence, but taking
pleasure in the small things

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.550
and in the people, combined
with that ferocious dedication

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:09.440
to the integrity of craft
was what marked her,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.190
and which marks
the program today,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.970
which I think a lot of us are so
proud to be in the same country

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.530
with.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.029
Thank you.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:59.470
- Many, many thanks to David
Brooks for those comments,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.810
and also for the work that
he, and Judy, and, Gwen,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.600
have so thoughtfully
done, for so long,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.350
on the NewsHour I think you'd
all agree that, together, they

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.240
offered us some of the
smartest political analysis

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.850
of the recent election season
and post election season

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:28.000
and I am abundantly grateful
for him and for that.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.620
OK, enough about
the guy from Yale.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.770
I am so honored
to be here today,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.500
and especially want to thank
Dean Cohen for including me

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.530
in this very, very
important conversation,

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.850
and also to thank her
for her prescience.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.900
If anything, her notion
to honor Judy and Gwen

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.810
and explore the
theme of untruths

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:00.580
and their consequences, is
more urgent, and relevant,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.310
and smarter today, than when she
first broached it a year ago,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.650
so we all owe her
a lot of gratitude

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.700
for even conceiving
of this idea.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.470
It seemed like an
issue at the time

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.790
but, boy, is it an issue now.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.560
So thank you so much for that.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.720
And as President Faust very
recently reminded our Fellows

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.850
at the Nieman Foundation
for Journalism

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.450
in a so-called
post-truth environment,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.840
the issues bearing on
the media are precisely

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.290
those faced by the academy
certainly here at Harvard,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.390
where the motto is veritas.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.080
So, I think that what we'll
be dealing with today,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.260
both celebrating,
and concerned about,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.270
has such direct ties to
what we do here every day.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:01.100
It is no exaggeration to say
that, for many in my industry,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.160
Gwen and Judy are heroes.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.730
Two women who join forces
to create a, sort of,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.680
journalistic true north.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.650
Through their work
individually, and together, they

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.950
have not only personified
our highest values,

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.600
but defined them.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.360
In what has been a
remarkably challenging year,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.900
the NewsHour has
offered us everything we

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.660
ask of journalism done right.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.410
On a personal note, I would also
like to publicly acknowledge

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.950
my great debt to Gwen who is
on the search committee that

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.700
brought me to Harvard, so
I am very grateful to her.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.680
We are so privileged to have
four extraordinary panelists

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.540
with us, this morning,
to try and help

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.510
us make sense of this
interesting and complicated

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.620
time.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.540
They offer a diversity
of experience,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.250
and perspective,
which we will hear

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.100
reflected in their remarks.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.000
A little bit about format, I
will do brief introductions

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.610
of them all next, and then
we'll hear from each of them

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.190
to make some brief
opening comments,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.850
and then we will
convene a conversation

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.780
about these issues, and,
also, invite questions

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.632
from the audience, which
somewhere there are

00:22:21.632 --> 00:22:22.840
pieces of paper going around.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.520
Cards, and you can submit those
to people gathering those,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.980
and we will try to
integrate as many of those

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.300
as we can into the conversation.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:39.000
So, first is Danielle Allen,
director of Harvard's Edmond J.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.790
Safra Center for Ethics and
a political theorist who

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.550
has published broadly
on democratic theory

where she wrote regularly

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.610
about the election.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:02.850
where we hear him frequently
in debate with David Brooks.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.700
You get the last word today, EJ.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.330

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.040
We will start with Danielle.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.510
- Thank you Ann Marie.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.850
Good morning.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.670
You can do better than that!

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.050
Good morning!

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.110
Thank you.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.450
It is such an honor to be here
in celebration of Gwen Ifill

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.497
and to be here with my
distinguished fellow panelists.

00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:45.330
And I was worried about
being cold out here,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.370
but I already have begun to feel
the warmth in David's remarks,

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.380
and in the assembly
of people here,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.170
so it's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.100
I did, as Ann Marie said,
spend much of last year

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.410
working as a columnist
for The Washington Post

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.030
writing about the
election, thinking

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.340
about the American
people, and thinking

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.630
about what's becoming of us.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.490
But the truth of the matter is
that I am a historian first.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.670
And so, in moments of
complexity and difficulty

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.180
the first thing I do is
look at historical examples

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.520
to try to contextualize.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.230
This is not the first
difficult moment

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.210
this country has lived
through, by any stretch

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.650
of the imagination.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.250
We could spend any
number of hours talking

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.170
about the Civil War,
the most extreme example

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:29.985
of our difficulty.

00:25:29.985 --> 00:25:32.110
But we don't need to look
that far back, of course.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.820
You'll hear some about
Watergate, this morning,

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.490
from some of my
fellow panelists.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.520
And I want to go back just a
little bit before the hardest

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.840
part of McCarthyism, the late
1930s, when Father Coughlin's

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.550
radio show was sweeping
up millions of listeners.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.510
Initially, he focused on a
sort of pro-Roosevelt agenda,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.000
but he turned at a certain
point to being, in effect,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.880
an advocate for
Hitler, and producing

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.600
a lot of anti-Semitic
radio broadcasts,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.200
and was seen as, generally,
in a dangerous way,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.000
spurring problematic populism.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.770
He was a supporter of
Huey Long, for instance.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.510
So, there is an organization
that sprang up in 1937,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.010
funded by Filene, of Filene's
basement department stores,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.590
called the Institute
of Propaganda Analysis.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.840
And this was an organization
that was, in some sense,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.150
trying to answer exactly
the question we're all

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.930
here today trying to answer,
what do you do with fake news.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.950
What do you do when people
are swayed by fictions,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.340
by lies, and so forth.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.720
And they worked for five
years developing lessons,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.790
disseminating them in
schools, teaching people

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.310
how to identify the
marks of propaganda.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.830
So, they have a list of
items that they asked people

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.750
to pay attention to.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.744
But I wanted to share
a little bit more

00:26:48.744 --> 00:26:51.160
about some of the specifics
of what they are trying to do,

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.590
because I think it could
be helpful for ourselves,

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.410
as we try to think our
way through this moment.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.800
So, first of all, I just
wanted to share with you

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.820
their analysis of the challenge
of the media in their day

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.480
and age.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.990
It sounds very similar to
the kinds of complaints

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.620
that we have.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.890
They're concerned about the
common man being swept up,

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.320
having all kinds of anxiety
because of The Depression,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.500
of course, and the combination
of changes in the agricultural,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.842
and rural areas,
and urban areas.

00:27:19.842 --> 00:27:21.550
And then they're
worried about the people

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.510
who are able to take
advantage of this anxiety.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.330
And they wrote, "As a rule,
spokesmen for these groups

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.040
are not concerned
with the ethics

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.680
of the means by which they use
to get the common man to make

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.802
up his mind.

00:27:33.802 --> 00:27:35.260
They're concerned
only with getting

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.260
him to make up his mind
in unquestioning agreement

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.460
with them.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.010
And to get him to do this they
employ all the subtleties,

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.020
all the knowledge
of human psychology,

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.420
which is the modern
world's heritage.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.820
Their persuasive
appeals are geared

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.120
to the century's streamlined
channels of communication,

00:27:52.120 --> 00:28:00.620
the newspaper, the radio, the
motion picture, sky writing,

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:06.550
blazing neon in electric signs,
and innumerable other media."

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:11.480
In other words, skywriting
was their Twitter.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.040
So that's how we may sound
50 years from now, in regard

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.860
to the hysteria and
some sense that we often

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.860
express about the media.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.235
So the problem is
not necessarily

00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:23.619
the channels of communication,
it's something else.

00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:25.160
From their point of
view, the problem

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.216
was specifically
whether or not we

00:28:27.216 --> 00:28:28.840
were cultivating
critical intelligence,

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.940
as educators, and as a nation.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.780
And so they built a series of
programs that had two purposes.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.840
One was to re-engage
adults in what

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.760
they called free discussion.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.330
To return to communal
conversation,

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.690
rather than mass communication,
as a way of trying

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.660
to revive independent thinking,
or, as they called it,

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.270
the free play of intelligence.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.212
The second thing they did was to
focus on the scientific method

00:28:55.212 --> 00:28:57.670
and here's where I think they
got something right, but also

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.230
something wrong.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.720
So they wrote, as
one of their goals

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.880
that they wanted to
achieve, an understanding

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.145
and a working knowledge
of the scientific method.

00:29:06.145 --> 00:29:07.770
Through day to day
individual and group

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.740
practice in asking
such questions as,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.440
are our premises
supported by the evidence,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.650
and do our conclusions
follow from our premises?

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.270
They focus a lot on facts.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.670
On getting people to clean
up their use of facts,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.400
and they used the techniques
of the scientific method

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.840
to support this.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.400
And so, for example,
just to give you

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.490
one more quotation about
their focus on facts,

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.830
they said this,
about their goal,

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.050
"education, the
development of the ability

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.330
to make judgments
independently, has

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.430
its roots in the gathering
and classification

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.760
of pertinent facts, bearing
upon the problem or question,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.250
and the arranging and organizing
of these facts in order

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.310
that a tentative solution
may be suggested."

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.980
So facts, facts, facts.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.630
And they're right,
we need to do work

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.820
on re-educating people
in the scientific method

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.400
and the use of evidence,
especially young people.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.090
But where are values
in that formulation?

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.730
My own view is that a lot of the
difficulties we currently face

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.770
have to do with our
inability to talk

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.204
about some core American
and shared values.

00:30:08.204 --> 00:30:09.870
There are two that I
believe are married

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.650
to each other fundamentally,
liberty and equality.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.440
And from my point of
view, conservatives

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.870
don't do a good job
talking about equality,

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.680
and liberals do a terrible
job talking about freedom.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.650
And so, as we work on
cleaning up our facts,

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.230
I believe we also need to work
on cleaning up our capacity

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.620
to think about the abstract
ideals that, in fact, give

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.325
democracy its meaning.

00:30:33.325 --> 00:30:34.950
If you ask somebody
what a monarchy is,

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.120
you point to the
picture of a King.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.060
You ask somebody
what a democracy is,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.910
there's no picture to point to.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.130
There's what we do together,
through conversation,

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.470
in order to make liberty
and equality real.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.456
Now, what on earth
does that mean?

00:30:48.456 --> 00:30:50.580
We have to rebuild our
understanding of that, which

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.540
I think we can do
only conversationally,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.456
and I think that's as
important as the work we

00:30:54.456 --> 00:30:55.541
need to do on facts.

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.040
Thank you.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.650
- Thank you Danielle.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.360
Jonah?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.300
- First of all, I know we got
a really crammed schedule,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.980
but I want to say
what a real honor

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.780
and treat it is
for me to be here,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:22.450
and it's a wonderful event, but
I also only have a few minutes

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.540
so, as Henry the Eighth
said to each of his wives,

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.560
I won't keep you long.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.649
Where to begin?

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:36.940
Yes, I'm a journalist, but
I should make it very clear,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.620
I'm a conservative
opinion journalist who

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.480
works for a magazine
called National Review,

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.030
and we've always seen
ourselves, in the tradition

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.610
of Bill Buckley, as
it's trying to be

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.170
the policemen of the right.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.190
Sometimes we don't do
it as well as we should,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.790
and sometimes we certainly don't
do it the way people like EJ

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:56.530
would like us to do it, but
we take the mission seriously.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.620
And one of the most
disappointing and painful

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.280
things of these last
two years for me--

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.350
I've spent my time
on Amazon searching

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.970
for deals on Hemlock--

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:14.320
is the degree to
which I've heard

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.540
from enormous numbers of people,
longtime fans of my writing,

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.240
or of National Review,
who are disappointed

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.870
in me that I didn't live
down to their expectations.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.930
And by that, I mean,
I could not bring

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.420
myself to support Donald
Trump in the primaries

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:40.460
or in the general election,
and the basic argument I made,

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.784
is that the conservatism I
love, that I grew up with--

00:32:44.784 --> 00:32:46.700
and I've been doing this
for a very long time,

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.180
I literally met Pat
Buchanan at my bris--

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.800
boils down to just simply--

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.140
and I think that actually
explains some of Pat's views

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.740
on the Jews, too, these
people are barbarians!

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.240
Anyway.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.010
Conservatism has
lots of definitions,

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.830
and I can quote lots of them,
but at the end of the day,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.070
at the meta level, it boils
down to just two things,

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.086
the idea that character matters,
and the idea that ideas matter.

00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:24.710
And you can have big
debates about what

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.270
you mean by character,
how you should

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.228
define character, what's
good character, what's

00:33:28.228 --> 00:33:29.120
bad character.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.340
And you can have a big argument
about what ideas matter,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.047
but that's it.

00:33:34.047 --> 00:33:35.880
And when I say ideas
matter, and I very much

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.490
agree with Danielle
about this, that it's

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.280
about the importance
of argument,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.040
about reason, about marshaling
facts and logic to your side

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.640
to make an argument, because
that's what democracy is about.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.050
It's about arguments.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.840
Democracy is not
about agreement.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.600
Democracy is about
disagreement, and the ability

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.780
to voice disagreement at
both at the polling station

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.030
but also in the public realm.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.630
And my problem with
Donald Trump was always

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.130
that he stands to thwart
both the importance of ideas,

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.674
which occasionally he walks
through their zip code.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.424
And I've yet, after two years
now, of asking this question,

00:34:21.424 --> 00:34:23.340
I've asked people to
come up with a definition

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.130
of good character
that he can meet.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.210
And it doesn't have to be about
sexuality or any of that stuff.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.940
It could be about business
practices, or honesty,

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.860
or self-restraint.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.234
If you pick up any definition
you want, I'm open to,

00:34:38.234 --> 00:34:39.734
no one's been able
to make the case.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.300
And so, therefore,
this gets to the point

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.659
of why I think it's really
important in journalism.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.409
I actually believe
that opinion journalism

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.480
is among the best
forms of journalism,

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.820
because opinion journalism
you are actually

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.179
making an argument.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.320
It's very much like
advocates in a court of law.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.535
We all know that the prosecution
is biased towards conviction,

00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:04.660
and we all know that the
defense attorney is biased

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.040
towards acquittal, but there
are certain rules of the court

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.700
that you have to deal with.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.090
You have to deal
with the facts, you

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.210
have to address the other side's
best arguments, not their worst

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:20.780
ones, or you'll lose, and
you have to tell the truth.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.910
And that's how I think
democracy advances is

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.712
by making those arguments.

00:35:24.712 --> 00:35:27.170
And one of the reasons why I
love opinion journalism is you

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.750
get to tell the reader
where you're coming from,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.785
and you say this is what this
is the argument I want to make,

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:34.760
yeah I'm a conservative,
or I'm a liberal,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.250
it doesn't really matter, but
this is where I'm coming from

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.477
and you can always tell the
best opinion journalism,

00:35:39.477 --> 00:35:41.810
whether it's on the right or
the left in The New Yorker,

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.450
or The Nation, or the National
Review, The Weekly Standard,

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.020
by how well the writer
characterizes the other side's

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.000
best arguments.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.610
And, I think, that is
where an enormous amount

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.610
of important work for democracy
is done, through journalism,

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.630
is there.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.280
Reporting is all
great, and important,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.320
and I'm not trying
to diminish it,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.330
but where a democracy
has its arguments

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.730
is through opinion
journalism, through the higher

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.050
end of opinion journalism.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.780
Not the barking shout shows
on late night cable news

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.780
or any of that kind of stuff.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:16.270
And so now I should
very quickly note

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.540
that there are a lot of
people out there, many

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.930
I suspect might be in this
room, who, sort of, walked

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:30.760
into the movie of American
politics, and seen Donald Trump

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.180
and yelled, where did
this monster come from,

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:39.070
and they act as if they've
walked into the last five

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.070
minutes of the movie.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.560
This stuff has been building
for a very long time.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.580
The idea that mainstream
media, the Democratic Party,

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.220
the liberals are utterly
blameless in the problems that

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.979
have arisen may be very
reassuring to certain people,

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:57.270
but you're not going to get
to the heart of the problem

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.280
unless you address it.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.880
And the mainstream media
did not lose its credibility

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.280
during the Republican primaries.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.000
The mainstream media did
not lose half the country,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.520
essentially, because Donald
Trump persuaded them to.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.260
Donald Trump took advantage
and exploited that.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.020
Donald Trump is sort
of a classic populist.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.900
One of my favorite lines comes
from William Jennings Bryan,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.500
where he says, the people of
Nebraska are for free silver,

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.320
therefore I am for free silver,
I will look up the arguments

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.855
later.

00:37:29.855 --> 00:37:31.230
And, again, as a
conservative who

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.810
believes in the importance
of ideas and arguments,

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.530
I actually believe you should
make the case for free silver,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.080
if you actually believe
the case for free silver.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.570
And one of the things
that has driven me crazy

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.320
is how many of my
colleagues on the right

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.750
think that they have
to speak for their base

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.210
rather than speak what
they believe to be true.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.830
It is astounding to
me how many times

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.322
when the little light on the
top of the camera goes off,

00:37:55.322 --> 00:37:57.780
people who have been defending
Donald Trump will turn to me

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.990
and say, I can't believe
I have to defend this guy.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.580
And I think about 90%
of journalistic ethics

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.046
is a bunch of self-indulgent
guild mentality.

00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:11.670
But one of the things I actually
truly and passionately believe

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.980
in, and I think it solves most
journalistic ethical problems,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.625
is don't lie.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.350
If you believe
something isn't true,

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.020
you shouldn't say, or
write, that it's true.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.800
It's not the most complicated
thing in the world.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.700
So what I've some dismay
about the Trumpian moment

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.890
is how corrupting it
has been to the right

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.760
where it seems fairly obvious
that you should condemn someone

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.440
for beating up a journalist
for asking about a CBO score.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.170
And, yet, yesterday, Twitter
and all sorts of other places

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.070
lit up with defenses of this.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:58.120
That this reporter
asked for it, and I

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.410
can't get my head around it and
I find it utterly dismaying.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.450
But I should also-- anyway, to
get back to the point at hand,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.271
the credibility of
the mainstream media--

00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:11.770
we hear a lot about fake news,
and we're going to talk a lot

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:17.050
about fake news, But you guys
do realize that Jon Stewart ran

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.760
a TV show called The Daily
Show, which was lionized across

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.030
the mainstream media, won
a Peabody Award for its

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.170
journalism, was the number one
source of news for millennials

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.160
throughout the last decade,
and it is literally--

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.480
not figuratively, the way
Joe Biden uses literally--

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.680
literally a fake news program.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.970
And there wasn't a lot of
outrage or embarrassment

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:44.470
about it.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.810
I think, in part, cause it
was really funny and very

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.310
well produced.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.810
But there have been
a lot of things

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.260
that have undermined the
credibility of the mainstream

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.360
media for a very long
time with a lot of people

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.690
who don't necessarily agree
with a lot of its assumptions.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.090
And to, all of a sudden,
walk into the situation

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.890
that we're in now, by all means
use Donald Trump as a pinata,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.570
but he's not the author
of any of these problems,

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.220
he's a symptom of them.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.820
And I'll just close by saying,
we live in an idiot culture.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.820
And what I mean by culture
is not we're all morons,

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.380
although they're
well-represented at large.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.010
Idiot comes from
the ancient Greek

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.650
and it means someone who didn't
have sufficient knowledge

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.090
to be a good citizen.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.730
The words idiosyncratic,
and all the other words

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.710
that have the same
root, meant someone

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.590
who is alienated and
deracinated, or disconnected,

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.010
from the greater good and
from the public polity,

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.830
and that they didn't have
the wherewithal or knowledge

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.020
to be a good citizen.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.200
And this is a problem we
have in our society that

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.420
has nothing to do with
right wing versus left wing.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.670
It has to do with how
we're raising people.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.370
It has to do with the kind of
citizens that we're producing.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:59.960
The original idea
of the liberal arts

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.570
wasn't an idea about
making people liberal,

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.240
it was about giving people
the tools, and requirements,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.820
and sets of knowledge to
make them good citizens,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.990
and this country is
falling down on that job.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.100
NewsHour is a fantastic
program, but it's very difficult

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.530
to sustain something like
that when there isn't a market

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.590
for it, and we have to figure
out how to better train young

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.130
people to want good news
and good journalism,

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.030
because as it stands right
now, a lot of them don't.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.030
Thank you all very much.

00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:46.620
- Thank you, Jonah.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.240
A'Lelia?

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.730
- Thank you, Ann Marie.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.780
I was so honored last summer
when Liz Cohen sent me a note

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.140
and said that Gwen had asked
that I be on the panel,

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.350
and that's because Gwen knew
how much I love Radcliffe,

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:07.380
and I'm class of '74, and
one of the last presidents

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.450
of the Radcliffe College
Alumni Association.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.040
So, Gwen and I, our
paths didn't cross

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.050
when we overlapped for a year,
as part of that first big post

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.610
1968, post Martin Luther
King, Jr. assassination

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:30.600
and long overdue Initiative
to recruit black students

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.630
to New England colleges
and prep schools.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.540
But our lives
eventually intersected

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.230
in many concentric circles
through mutual friends,

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.380
through journalism, and
like many black reporters,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.040
Jesse Jackson's 1984 campaign.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.920
What I hope I can bring
to today's conversation

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.090
is a sense of the constancy
and consistency and depth

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.370
of Gwen's integrity.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.470
She remained solid, grounded,
decent, and generous,

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.290
whether she was
moderating a town hall,

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.740
or sitting on her back
porch with her girlfriends.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.410
I believe that
journalists earn trust

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.640
by the way we live our lives.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.720
The same goes for
elected officials.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.680
At our best, we live by the
adage, comfort the afflicted,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.425
and afflict the comfortable.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.110
As a reporter,
Gwen kept her tools

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.380
sharpened, curiosity,
skepticism,

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.930
but never cynicism, accuracy,
respect for others, empathy

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.420
for those who felt
misunderstood,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.450
encouragement for the
young people she mentored,

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.320
impatience with those who
did less than their best,

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.450
and no mercy for those
who lied and made excuses.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:54.310
She was unimpressed
by shiny things.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.860
In a story too long to
tell, this morning, I

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.600
remember when she
was being recruited

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.890
by another network for a
show with higher visibility

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.650
and I assume
substantially more money

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.770
than she was making
at the NewsHour.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:13.570
But after much to-ing and
fro-ing, she withdrew her name.

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.230
She chose substance
over shininess.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.720
She knew she would be
judged and measured,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.300
just as all television
reporters and anchors are

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.850
judged and measured,
and expected

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:29.140
to be the shiny new thing
who could rescue the ratings.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.170
But, over time, she had been
intentional about developing

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:37.030
a pact with her audience, to
be authentic, to shed light,

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.370
rather than to generate heat.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.400
I think she sensed that
this path she had developed

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.120
would have less currency
in the new environment.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.000
And, yet, to see her on
the Sunday morning shows,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.090
on Meet the Press, and this
week in Face the Nation,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.730
was a joy to behold.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.490
She always brought her A-game.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.220
There was no question that
she was equal to the task.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:07.360
Gwen's annual New Year's
Day party was legendary,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.410
and, in many ways, a
metaphor for her life.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.560
Her capacity for love, and
friendship, and collegiality,

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.170
was expansive and encompassing.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.710
Some years later,
after the first set

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.260
of parties when she
moved to a new house,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.700
which looked a lot like
the old house on steroids.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.430
Bigger with the same floor plan.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.880
It seemed as if she had done
so to accommodate the expanding

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.850
circle of friends and
colleagues and ideas

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:42.040
At the end of the
party, I have to admit,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.140
I was always one
of the stragglers.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.390
One of the extended
circle of girlfriends who

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.550
gathered in the living room.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.220
Gwen was our friend
whom Queen Latifah had

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.700
played on Saturday Night Live.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.180
Our champion who had stumped
Dick Cheney and John Edwards

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.750
on a question they should
have been able to answer.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.660
But Gwen was Gwen,
always, always.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.250
Gwen never became
an anchor monster,

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.950
the term some of us who
spend our lives as producers

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.750
use for people who
scream and throw

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.730
tantrums when the red light
on the camera goes off.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.300
In 2017, it should not
be necessary to say

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.970
that a social gathering
like Gwen's annual party

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.870
was remarkable and
unusual in its diversity.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.900
In 2017, it should
not be noteworthy,

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.820
that a social gathering with
people of different races,

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.620
ethnicities, backgrounds,
beliefs, party affiliations,

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.230
and ideologies, is a rarity.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.020
But people whose paths
crossed at Gwen's would not

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.570
have met each
other, but for her.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.800
In a politically polarized
nation, that matters.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.190
The sensibilities she developed
as a preacher's kid who often

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.430
was the new face, as the
daughter of immigrants,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.250
as a black girl in
mostly white settings,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:03.240
as a political reporter when
the bus was mostly boys,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.120
found their way into her work
as the host of Washington

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.630
Week and every job she held.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.570
There's so much more I want
to say but time is short.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.500
There is not enough
time to talk about how

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.560
Gwen handled bigotry,
and racism, and straight

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.200
up ignorance, with grace.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.510
How she deflected and
smacked down the trolls

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.490
who found her on Twitter.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.840
When we talk about untruths and
consequences, as we are today,

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.880
I think one could
argue that a failure

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.570
on the part of journalists,
news executives, publishers,

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:37.070
elected officials, and
people who knew better,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:41.490
to more forcefully confront
the lies about Barack Obama's

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.780
birthplace and
birth certificate,

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.480
changed the course of history.

00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:52.050
The brand of lies
that we are hearing

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.690
now and the liars who purvey
them are immune to our outrage.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.530
We have crossed the threshold
when public figures lie

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.560
with the confidence
that it does not

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.720
matter that the lie
can be exposed right

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.360
after the commercial break, When
the file footage is queued up.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.580
But there is a glimmer of hope.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.260
Liars get cocky.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.060
Liars miscalculate.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.650
Lies backfire.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.740
Lies have unintended
consequences.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.380
As Abraham Lincoln said, you
can fool all of the people some

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.660
of the time, and some of
the people all of the time,

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.009
but you cannot fool all of
the people all of the time.

00:48:27.009 --> 00:48:29.300
Though, I will concede that,
in a nation where we still

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:34.340
are debating the causes and
consequences of the Civil War,

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.730
one can take nothing for granted
and must be ever vigilant.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.890
But we owe it to Gwen
to keep insisting.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.100
On the truth I leave
you with Gwen's words,

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.280
we can't expect the world
to get better by itself,

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.930
we have to create something we
can leave the next generation.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.120
And with love and respect
for my friend Gwen

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.010
I say that when we hear a
lie we must challenge it.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.220
- Thank you, A'Lelia.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.870
EJ, you're up.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.850
- The definition of
life being unfair

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.370
is to have to speak after
all these eloquent people.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.900
I want to pay tribute
to three people.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:30.360
One is Drew Faust who's sitting
in the audience in front of us,

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.430
who was generous enough to
leave the perfect job, which

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.400
was starting and running
the Radcliffe Institute,

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.280
to lead this great
university, and if drew

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.420
doesn't mind my invoking
Richard Nixon's slogan,

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.890
we need your intellectual
leadership now more than ever.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:49.540
So, thank you.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:59.250
Also, all the tributes to Gwen,
and I agree with every word--

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.490
and that was so beautiful--

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.419
and there's her wisdom, her
toughness, her intelligence.

00:50:04.419 --> 00:50:06.710
The thing I wanted to underscore
is something you said,

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.310
which is, her role
as a preacher's kid.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.930
And Gwen's family was actually
foundational for the AME Church

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:15.920
in the United States.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.740
And I think one of the
things that we will most

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:23.720
miss about Gwen is that
profound, persistent, stubborn

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.560
moral sense that she brought
to every aspect of her life.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.130
Her church was the news
hour, and her congregation

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.830
remains faithful.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.220
Secondly, I want to pay
tribute to Judy Woodruff.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:48.220
Everybody knows how
brilliant she is,

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.960
what an extraordinary
journalist she is.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.320
I once said of someone--

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.610
you know it showed me what
I thought of journalism--

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.814
this person's a journalist
and is really moral,

00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:05.230
and then I thought
to myself, what

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.230
does that tell you about what
you think of journalists.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:11.980
And Judy is just one of
the most warm-hearted,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.440
thoughtful, other-directed,
welcoming people

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.260
I have ever met.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.890
Now, as David
Brooks pointed out,

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:21.790
I am Catholic so I feel
guilt easily and deeply.

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:25.720
And, I got to say,
whenever I see Judy,

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.250
and I reflect on her
goodness and decency,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.630
I feel even more guilty.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.790
And I just do not
understand how someone

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.060
can make me feel so good
about life, and so guilty,

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.680
at the same time.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.210
I love you Judy Woodruff.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:50.270
I also want to pay tribute to
my sister Lucy and a Navy JAG

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.910
veteran who is in the audience
who would've killed me

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:57.260
if I had not paid tribute to two
people she so deeply admires,

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.180
Judy and Gwen.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:04.850
I was wondering, listening, if
this panel should be relabeled

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.210
alternative veritas,
because that's

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.450
where we seem to be going.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:15.980
And I want to say that it is
really good to be with Jonah.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.360
I confess to a soft
spot for Jonah.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.629
I met Jonah when he was
22 years old starting out

00:52:22.629 --> 00:52:23.795
in journalism in Washington.

00:52:23.795 --> 00:52:27.920
Now, I recently quoted
Jonah, in my column,

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.810
and I agreed with him--

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.440
which shows the times we are in.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.220
It was a debate in the National
Review about nationalism

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.490
versus patriotism.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:40.850
And I agreed with Jonah
that there was a difference

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:43.594
and that we should
prefer patriotism.

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:46.010
But after I wrote that I didn't
know who should feel worse

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.470
about this, Jonah or me.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.860
I mean, praise from
a liberal fascist

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.250
could make him guilty
by association.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.710
And you're watching him
get all this applause.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.960
I am now predicting the
headline in Breitbart,

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.545
phony conservative sellout wins
applause from Harvard Radcliffe

00:53:08.545 --> 00:53:09.045
liberals.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.230
- The sad part is
that's not a bold bet.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.160
- So I'm worried
about the Radcliffe

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.080
as to ruining Jonah's
career, but there's

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.420
a lot of room on the
liberal fascist side,

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:33.190
and we would welcome you.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.110
I just want to make
a couple of points,

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.980
one of my favorite
memos from an editor

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.310
was a one-line memo
from an AP editor

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:47.105
that read, avoid
cliches like the plague.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:58.400
And what I was contemplating
today, and what to talk about,

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.920
the cliche that came to
mind-- it's a great line

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.500
in the original, but
it's become a cliche--

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.359
this is the best of times
this is the worst of times.

00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:08.150
And I think when we
think about journalism,

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:13.460
right now, that is exactly
correct about where we are,

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.140
right now.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.320
This is the best of
times in the sense

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.690
that I don't think Americans
have as fully appreciated

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:27.110
the role of independent
journalism as they do now.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.490
That is to say, a significant
group of Americans.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:37.130
And I think, that as we see the
investigative work being done,

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:41.000
this amazing competition
among newspapers,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.340
they are starting
to make movies again

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:47.360
about journalism where
the journalists are not

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.350
played by the people in
the bar scene in Star Wars.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.290
I mean this is an
extraordinary moment.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.270
So I think there
is an appreciation

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:59.500
for the role of journalism that
we haven't seen in a long time.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:04.490
And yet, there is great division
over the role of journalism,

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:09.290
and, I think that, one, it
is genuinely disturbing--

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:13.790
what's even more disturbing
than that candidate slogged out

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.280
a reporter who asked
him a hard question--

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.910
is that the alibi
used by the candidate,

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.100
that was widely
accepted, was, it

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.880
was OK to slug him because
he was a liberal journalist,

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.080
and that really tells us
something about the divisions

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.580
we face now.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.490
I'm not going to talk primarily
about opinion journalism

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:37.040
but I passionately agree
with something, God help me,

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.030
Jonah said.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.690
Because, I think it's important
to defend the role of opinion

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:45.320
journalism, which is what I do,
and there's the famous Daniel

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.570
Patrick Moynihan
line, people are

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.030
entitled to their own
opinions, they're not

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.920
entitled to their own facts.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.930
But I think there should
be a corollary, which

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:57.410
is, opinion journalism
that is not based on fact

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:58.760
is not journalism.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.470
I'm going to focus primarily
on the rest of what

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.770
I have to say on journalism
broadly speaking,

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.350
but I really do think we need
a conversation in the world

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:20.120
of opinion journalism, because
there is a real danger now,

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.010
more than we have
seen in the past,

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.010
and I'm very anti-nostalgia.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.050
But more than we have
seen in the past,

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:32.010
that fact is getting
lost more and more.

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.330
The John F. Kennedy
whom David referenced

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:39.050
gave an extraordinary
commencement speech at Yale.

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:40.970
By the way, in that
commencement speech

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.800
he said when he got
an honorary degree,

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.300
I have the best of both worlds,
a Harvard education, and a Yale

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.340
degree.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:53.810
But he also said
something that is--

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.330
I have recently gone through
some old JFK speeches

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.700
because his 100th
birthday is on Monday--

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.930
and he spoke of those who
seek the comfort of opinion

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:06.510
without the
discomfort of thought.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.960
And I thought, what
an extraordinary line

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.570
for our moment.

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.570
Cass Sunstein recently wrote
a very interesting book

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.500
on the new media world and
he cited John Stuart Mill's

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.710
aspiration for debate
in a democratic republic

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.860
it involved, Mills said,
"placing human beings

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.060
in contact with persons
dissimilar to themselves

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.980
and with modes of
thought and action

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:35.360
unlike those with
which we are familiar."

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.550
And as Sunstein noted,
we live in a time

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.190
when it is far easier
than ever, I think,

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:46.460
partly because of the way we
live and organize our lives,

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.390
we tend to live more with people
we agree with than we used to,

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.924
partly because of technology.

00:57:52.924 --> 00:57:55.340
And I think it's important
when we think about technology,

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:58.910
that technology makes everything
more efficient, which includes

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:02.480
both the spreading of truth,
and the spreading of lies,

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.510
and the two can
happen, simultaneously.

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:13.070
But more than that, we can live
in our own information worlds.

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:16.100
And I just want to
salute a study that

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:21.680
was done by the Berkman Klein's
Center for Internet &amp; Society,

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.260
here at Harvard, and MIT'S
Center for Civic Media.

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.480
They study 1.25 million
stories studied online,

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.560
between April 1st,
2015, and election day.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.770
And they concluded
that, first, this

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:39.410
is a problem more on the
right end of politics

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.740
and on the left end of
politics, and that, liberals

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.670
tend to consume a larger
mix of media that includes

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.460
old fashioned media,
whereas a significant group

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:54.350
of conservatives consume
primarily, or almost entirely,

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.230
conservative media.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.950
Now, Jonah might argue that's
because all the regular media

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:00.230
are liberal, but I
think that has actually

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:03.680
led to some real
problems on the right,

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.110
by rejecting any
sources that aren't

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.810
conservative on their face.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:11.570
This study concluded that
a right wing media network

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.490
anchored around
Breitbart developed

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.700
as a distinct and
insulated media system

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:20.150
using social media as
a backbone to transmit

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:22.880
a hyper-partisan
perspective to the world.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.310
This pro-Trump
media sphere appears

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.740
to have not only been
successful in setting

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.680
the agenda for the
conservative media sphere,

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.660
but also strongly
influenced the broader media

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.050
agenda in particular
coverage of Hillary Clinton.

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:43.220
While concerns about political
and media polarization online

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.830
are longstanding, our study
suggests that polarization

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.180
was asymmetric.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.860
Pro-Clinton
audiences were highly

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.440
attentive to traditional
media outlets which

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.110
continued to be the
most prominent outlets

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.520
across the public sphere.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.320
That's good news.

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.620
Along with more
left-oriented online sites.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:05.120
But pro-Trump audiences paid
the majority of their attention

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.760
to polarized outlets
that have developed

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:14.450
recently-- many of them only
since the 2008 election.

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.770
This study points
to a central truth

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:20.420
that we can't evade that, the
problem presented by Trump

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.630
is, not the creation of
broad general trends that

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.210
have nothing to
do with ideology,

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.820
it is not the product
of technology itself,

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.160
the loss of a
common conversation

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.190
is the result in
significant part

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.550
of new habits on the political
right but their habits

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:42.320
ingrained since the 1960s.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.070
And the Harvard MIT study
underscored this by noting that

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:53.120
technology alone cannot be held
accountable but that technology

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.460
has enabled these developments.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.010
I won't go into this study more.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.350
But I think that one of the
issues we should discuss

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:05.640
is the asymmetric quality
of this conversation,

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.630
of this problem.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:13.090
But also the problems that might
exist on my side of the ledger.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.980
I just want to close
with two thoughts.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.690
One is, from Vaclav
Havel, who said

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:24.330
that, when a truth is not given
complete freedom freedom is not

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:25.800
complete.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.440
And in his powerful
essay on tyranny,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.040
the historian Timothy
Snyder offered 20 lessons

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.390
that the 20th century had
to teach us at this moment,

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:40.170
and lesson 10 was at once
basic, and essential,

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.900
believe in truth.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.650
He wrote that to abandon
facts is to abandon freedom.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.730
If nothing is true, then
no one can criticize power.

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:53.340
You submit to tyranny
when you renounce

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.880
the difference between
what you want to hear,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.890
and what is actually the case.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:01:59.390
Thank you.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.490
- Thank you, EJ Oh my gosh
we have so much to talk

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:18.400
about and so little time.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.140
There have been two
references to it,

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.480
but I want to go back
to it but for a slightly

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.200
different reason.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.870
So we all woke up this
morning to a headline,

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:30.550
"Gianforte Wins
Congressional Race One Day

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:33.390
After Assaulting a Reporter."

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:39.025
And so, putting aside the actual
act, where I want to dwell

01:02:39.025 --> 01:02:42.040
is on the reporting of that.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:49.240
And we had a situation wherein
there were eyewitnesses

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.040
to the actual event, and
the best eyewitnesses

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.040
were from Fox News,
it turned out,

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.260
and the reporters gave a
really clinical description

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.260
of what had happened.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.940
And it was a description
in complete variance

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:12.610
with the description given
by the then candidates.

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:22.450
Press spokesmen and Fox News,
and its coverage of the event,

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:26.890
gave much more time and favor
to the press spokesman's

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:31.480
description of the event than to
their own reporter's accounts.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.240
Which pretty much
underscored the reporter's

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.640
telling of the event, which
was that he had been assaulted

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.750
for asking a question.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.850
And so, in this
conversation where

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:53.710
we're having and it's all
inspiring, and it's lofty,

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:56.560
don't lie, that will
solve our problems.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.260
Facts, facts, facts.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.270
More attention to the
scientific method.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.520
How do we get there?

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:12.250
When it seems that it's going
to be very hard to extract

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:16.300
ourselves from this
dishonest relationship

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.180
we have with audiences
at the moment.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:25.540
Which may be good for ratings,
but is very bad for democracy.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.970
I think that's an example
of speaking to an audience

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:30.540
and telling them what
they might want to hear.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.680
That's a comforting
version of what

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.350
happened, if you're of a
certain political stripe,

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:37.130
but it wasn't true.

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:41.290
So how do we get
from these ideals

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:45.700
to what's happening
on the ground,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.970
in television or elsewhere?

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.630
- Can I just say, I think
traditional media have been,

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:59.410
and continue to be,
deeply attentive to fact.

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.820
I mean I don't think
it shocks us that Fox,

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.320
although it's going through a
kind of revolution, right now,

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.778
it's going to be
interesting to see

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:09.670
what Fox is five years from now
compared to what it is today,

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:15.550
but that Fox is primarily
an opinion outlet that

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:19.461
happens to have some real
good, decent, reporters working

01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:19.960
for it.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.790
And so, I guess,
fair and balanced

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:24.460
is the footage of the
event on the one side,

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.340
and the statement by
the Republican candidate

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.000
about the event that people
have just seen on the other.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.100
I think that part
of the question

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.850
is, how people
consume their news,

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.450
and whether they are
even exposed to facts

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:41.590
that they disagree with.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.170
Mark Zuckerberg
spoke here yesterday.

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:48.250
And the notion that
we all get news.

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:52.941
Fewer people go to the original
source, whether the New York

01:05:52.941 --> 01:05:54.940
Times, The Washington
Post, or any other outlet,

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.060
or National Review,
for that matter,

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.400
and they are more exposed to
what their friends tell them,

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.590
or what they see on
Facebook and Twitter.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.980
This system can be gamed
in ways that people aren't

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.670
even exposed to the
alternative view or a challenge

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.880
to a factually untrue
statement, and I

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.970
think that is one of
the problems we face.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:21.700
On the other hand, I think
all traditional media

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:26.800
can do is to continually
seek larger audiences

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.710
and to insist over and over
again that the facts matter

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:32.360
and to apply that day
to day in what they do.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.380
And I really do believe that
my colleagues, on the reporting

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.700
side, do exactly that.

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:43.840
- So I think the
answer to your question

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.115
has many parts, Ann Marie.

01:06:45.115 --> 01:06:47.240
I think that's one of the
reasons it's challenging.

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.470
There's a part of the
answer that's about,

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.996
let's call it civic
education in K through 12,

01:06:51.996 --> 01:06:53.620
and there's a part
of the answer that's

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.630
about how a massive business
conglomerate, like Fox

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:03.864
News and Murdoch's news
corps, changes course,

01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:05.030
and that's just one example.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.510
There might be other examples
we point to that perhaps we

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:08.830
think should change course.

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.622
And there are two very
different questions.

01:07:10.622 --> 01:07:12.121
And so I think one
of the challenges

01:07:12.121 --> 01:07:14.710
has always sort of figuring out
where to focus one's energy.

01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:18.430
If one focuses on the K through
12 part of the conversation,

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:24.490
it matters that one of
the most painful victims

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:30.620
of our polarization has been
social studies education.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.590
So I don't know how
clear people are on that.

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.090
But when the National
Governors Association

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.250
try to develop the Common
Core State Standards

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.680
they aspire to have standards
and three areas math

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.980
and science, English language
arts, and social studies.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.790
And they achieved the
first two of those--

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:50.290
whatever you think of the
standards of testing--

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:54.330
is the case that if you have
them you teach in those areas.

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:57.080
And so there has been
measurable significant declines

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.209
of time in school on social
studies for the last 15 years.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.500
Going back even before the
Common Core State's standard

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.284
so that no child left
behind And the reason

01:08:05.284 --> 01:08:06.950
they didn't achieve
the third standards,

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.910
was precisely
because, as a society

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.910
we couldn't agree on how
American history should

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:13.040
be taught.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.880
Is it a triumphal story of
the Americans continuously

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.391
breaking through one frontier
barrier after another

01:08:19.391 --> 01:08:20.390
and achieving greatness?

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.337
Or is it a story
that is dragged down

01:08:22.337 --> 01:08:24.920
by the histories of slavery, and
genocide of Native Americans,

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.550
and so forth?

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.160
There is a way to tell both
parts of the story together.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.460
We have not found a way
to do that, politically.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.200
And so, paradoxically,
rebuilding civic education such

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.124
that young people can
have the tools to process

01:08:39.124 --> 01:08:41.540
the media, to be the kind of
market for high quality media

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:45.050
that we need, actually
requires the grown ups--

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:49.430
all of us-- to be able
to tell a shared history

01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:54.210
and recommit to standards
in education in this area.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.319
- I actually agree
with all of that.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.590
Civilization is a verb.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:08.960
Hannah Arendt had this
great line she said,

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.970
every generation
western civilization

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:15.050
is invaded by barbarians,
we call them children.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.529
And the factory
preset of humanity

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:22.460
is always poverty and
ignorance, and the children

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.040
you raise up as a society
become the replacement

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.130
for your civilization.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.920
If you don't care about
it, if you don't teach them

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.870
how to be good citizens, they're
not going to be good citizens

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:31.536
and they're not going
to want the things

01:09:31.536 --> 01:09:32.840
that good citizens want.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.630
I want to push back a little
bit on the Fox News point,

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:39.950
in part, because I am a Fox
News contributor, and, in part,

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.260
because I think Fox News
is wildly misunderstood

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.100
by a lot of people.

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.020
I agree with EJ
entirely, Fox News

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.410
is going through quite
a transition right now,

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.550
and I'm not happy at all.

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:52.714
I was a very, very sharp
critic of some of the stuff

01:09:52.714 --> 01:09:55.130
that Sean Hannity has been
doing the last couple of weeks.

01:09:55.130 --> 01:10:04.400
But, first of all, EJ
Is right, the news side

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.700
is actually full of a lot of
really excellent reporters,

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.070
many, many of whom
are not conservative.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.195
They're just reporters,
and this is the best job,

01:10:13.195 --> 01:10:14.570
this is that the
job they wanted.

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:15.528
They like what they do.

01:10:15.528 --> 01:10:18.080
They like the freedom
that they have.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.070
And but what also people
have never understood

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:25.170
is that Fox has
never been nearly as

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:27.781
right wing as a lot of people--
a lot of its critics-- think

01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:28.280
it is.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.040
It's always been more
populous than right wing.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.530
It has always worked on
the assumption-- well,

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:36.530
an executive there once showed
me what the market for Fox News

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:41.510
was, and he put his left
hand over the eastern border

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:46.760
of California, and his right
hand over the western trim

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.370
of New York City, and said,
all this stuff in the middle,

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.400
that's our market.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.454
And Fox News works from
a certain assumption,

01:10:54.454 --> 01:10:56.120
in terms of-- not
talking about the news

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.180
part, per se-- but the
gestalt of the network,

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.120
which is that this is a good
country, that American people

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.700
are good people, that the
military may make mistakes

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.760
but it's something to be honored
and respected, that the police

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.650
may make mistakes,
there may be bad apples,

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:12.350
but there's people who should
be honored and respected.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.530
That this was a good and
decent country and that

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:17.270
it shouldn't be run down.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.790
Now, you may think that it's
sort of invidious for me

01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:22.010
to make this point,
and that somehow it's

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:26.450
wrong to suggest that the
mainstream media doesn't

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.440
agree with that.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.510
But that is a
widespread-- and I will

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.810
argue-- very
understandable perception

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.030
about a lot of the way
the mainstream media has

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.680
operated for the last 40 years.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.040
And just on this sort
of balance thing.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.770
Look, first of all, just
to bolster Daniel's point

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.900
a little bit, my favorite
New Yorker cartoon

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.560
has two dogs sitting,
drinking Martinis

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.860
in a bar in New York
in pinstriped suits.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.470
And one dog says
to the other dog,

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:59.090
"You know, it's not good
enough that dogs succeed.

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:02.600
Cats must also fail."

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.784
And we are living as a culture--

01:12:07.784 --> 01:12:09.200
not just the media
culture, but as

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.970
a culture-- in a
moment where what

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:14.750
I call "ecstatic
schadenfreude" runs rampant.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.320
Where it's not just that the
news has to help my side.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.790
It has to make you
feel bad, right?

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:24.520
And that's what the arguments
on Twitter are all about.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.830
But the idea that somehow that
the mainstream media, the media

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.760
that EJ is touting, doesn't
have any double standards

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.100
of its own, I just think
is just flatly wrong.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.320
And I could argue
about it for hours.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.600
But I'll just give one
example from this week.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.780
It was reported this week
that the FISA courts had

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:45.260
to chastise brutally the
Obama administration for lying

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.500
to them, for misleading them
while they were scooping up

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.170
vast amounts of private
data in this country.

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:54.440
One out of 20 emails in
this country was scooped up.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.930
And The New York Times,
the Washington Post,

01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:00.260
the major news networks,
none of them covered this.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.500
If this had happened on
George W Bush's watch,

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.490
this would have been a
front-page, five-alarm story

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:11.060
about the intrusion on
our civil liberties.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.550
And yet, it was only
covered on broadcast

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:16.640
on a network by Fox News,
at least as of last night.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.400
And it's only been covered in
a handful of other outlets,

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.550
because it's a story
that's bad for Obama,

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:24.950
and sort of
distracting from Trump.

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:27.410
And this kind of thing
happens a vast amount

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.840
more than I think a lot of
people in the mainstream media

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.980
want to credit.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.260
And it's noticed by
people on the right.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.540
And when people on the right--

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.290
and I don't even mean
people on the right,

01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:42.960
I mean normal Americans who make
up a big chunk of this country,

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.050
and when they see
these double standards,

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.750
it makes them lose faith
and confidence in the media.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.834
And that makes it
all the more hard

01:13:49.834 --> 01:13:52.250
for the media to do its job,
which is to get the truth out

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.090
to everybody.

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:56.930
- I want to ask A'Lelia--

01:13:56.930 --> 01:14:02.570
I want to ask her a
question about opinion news.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:06.050
And I do with some trepidation,
when I have three people who

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:09.770
write columns on this podium.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:19.160
One observation is that in your
lifetime as a news executive,

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.470
we experienced
this proliferation

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:24.350
of opinion-based journalism.

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:29.450
And there is now a lot of
news coverage, quote, unquote,

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:32.450
"news coverage" that's a lot
of people sitting arrayed

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:36.050
like this, arguing
their differing

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:41.930
political perspectives on
a news subject of the day,

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:45.410
versus kind of on-the-ground
reporting, which

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:48.350
seem to be in short
supply, for instance,

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:52.520
in coverage of the Trump
campaign during the election,

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.430
which led to our kind of failure
to understand what was really

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.230
happening with those voters.

01:14:57.230 --> 01:15:02.270
I'm wondering as somebody
who spent her career making

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:05.870
decisions about what was covered
for two of the major networks,

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:10.310
if you can pinpoint sort of
a moment in the evolution

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:15.110
of television journalism
and tell us what you think--

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.540
how you think that's worked out.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:21.500
- Well, you know, I
just had a flashback.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.740
And this was before
Fox News, when

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:27.470
Brit Hume was working at ABC.

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:28.730
It's a story I've never told.

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:33.560
But I just remember this
when Lani Guinier was--

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.410
because I knew Lani
from Radcliffe.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:38.780
When she was
nominated, I remember

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.850
Brit going on the 320, which
was our internal intercom,

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:47.000
talking about Lani,
and describing a person

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.130
that I totally didn't know.

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:55.280
But this was the narrative that
was coming from the right wing.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.020
And that, for me, was
one of the moments.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.510
And then Brit, eventually,
was at Fox News.

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:01.970
But if there is a moment,
that would be a moment

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:05.780
when I realized everyone
is not necessarily

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.230
trying to tell exactly the
story, exactly the truth,

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:12.890
that there is a perspective
and a demonization.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.320
And I guess it's that
demonization that

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.110
was a turning point for me.

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:20.540
- I want to integrate some
of the questions we're

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.600
getting from the audience,
which are terrific.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.350
And one of them focuses on the
interest currently in leaking.

01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:34.190
And the question is, is it a
public service or a scourge?

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:41.030
And how do you assess the
ethics of a leak or of a leaker?

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.210
I think we've experienced leaks
in the past week that have both

01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:45.490
been--

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:48.260
we've had two different
classes of leaks.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.760
We've had the leaks
to journalists.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.130
And then we've had,
of course, the leaks

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:58.020
from the oval about security
issues in conversations

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.080
with other countries.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:04.020
But let's focus on the
journalistic half of that.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.730
Are they good or
bad for democracy?

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:08.220
The president says
that they're bad.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.510
EJ?

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:12.980
- Well, I'm very pro-leak.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.240
Just, you know, I--

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.690
- Would you like to
give your phone number?

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:18.610
- I'm sorry?

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:20.190
Yeah.

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:21.570
No, but I mean, let's be candid.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.780
When people--
anybody in politics

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.140
who sees a leak that hurts
their side of politics

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.540
regardless of where they
stand might sometimes

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:33.340
get angry about the
leak, and say, aha,

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:36.030
this is a motivated leak.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:41.070
And I think the first thing that
matters is, is the leak true?

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.530
And that during the
McCarthy period,

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:45.950
there were things that
leaked that weren't true.

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:48.840
And so I think the test number
one is, is the leak true?

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.000
Test number two is,
is there something

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.990
in this leak that genuinely
endangers national security?

01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:58.500
That's a fair question to ask.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.890
If you leak military plans
in advance of something

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.890
the military is
going to do, it is

01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:08.340
legitimate to say, no,
that's not something

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.840
that should be leaked.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.900
I had a personal experience
of this when I was in Lebanon.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.390
And a man called
William Buckley--

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:17.490
no relation to Bill Buckley--

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:18.360
was kidnapped.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.460
And we covered this story.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.820
And we journalists, all
looked at his resume.

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:27.270
And you could just
tell the guy was CIA.

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.160
But none of us reported this.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.910
And we didn't report it because
this guy was in trouble enough.

01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:34.740
We saw no reason to do that.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:39.090
Unfortunately, for Mr.
Buckley, the kidnappers

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:42.840
knew that, because the
Iranians had discovered it

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.810
when they occupied the
US embassy in Iran.

01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:46.980
And it put together--

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.740
taken all the shredded memos
and put them back together.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.340
But none of us-- all of us
felt a sense of responsibility.

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.740
We're not going to sort of write
about this aspect of the guy's

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.240
life.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.990
We reported what he
had done in the world,

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:00.990
but we didn't say that.

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:06.060
But, you know, obviously this
comes from a point of view

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.450
that does see the Trump
administration as potentially

01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:12.690
very dangerous to our country.

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.970
There are many
different ways in which

01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:18.420
a free Republic, a free
Democratic Republic,

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.420
can fight back against
abuses in government.

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.550
And one is the courts.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.680
One is the electoral system.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.050
One is free speech
through argument.

01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:31.380
But one of them is the actions
of civil servants, people

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:35.040
who work for the government,
interacting with the media

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.740
to report on things
that they believe either

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.480
undermine the official story,
show the official story

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.010
as a lie, or put into public
discussion information

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:52.920
that the press and
the leaker believe is

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.240
in the public interest to do.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.400
So to me, what Trump
is doing-- and it's

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.910
exactly what Richard Nixon did
in Watergate, although I think

01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:06.660
all comparisons of Trump to
Nixon are unfair to Nixon,

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.880
but that's for another day.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:09.900
I really do.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.325
I could actually make that case.

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.610
I think they are largely
using this leak business

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:23.700
as a distraction to push the
story in a different direction.

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:27.900
- I've been obsessed in
recent months with lying.

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:33.180
And we focused a lot of
it on the White House.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.870
But I just started asking
reporters in my everyday life,

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:40.140
tell me the first time you
were lied to for a story.

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.960
And we all have a
story about that.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.280
And those experiences
form us deeply,

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.720
and I think contribute to
this kind of skeptical stance,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.770
sometimes cynical, that you
see in a lot of journalists.

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.170
But what was
remarkable to me was

01:20:58.170 --> 01:21:01.440
the line that occurs at
all levels in journalism.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.340
Man-on-the-street interviews,
where somebody I talked to had

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.000
interviewed somebody who gave
her his boss's name instead

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.500
of his own, because he thought
it would be funny to see that

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.400
in the paper, on up through
conversations with Michael

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.210
Resendez at the Boston
Globe about being lied

01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:23.330
to by the cardinal about sexual
abuse among Catholic priests

01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:24.010
in Boston.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.970
And I've written
about this recently,

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:31.500
but I'm reminded to
mention it, because one

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.420
of the questions
from the audience is,

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:39.150
should elected officials be
more accountable for facts

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:43.230
and for lies, for
stories that they invoke?

01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:44.200
Is it different?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.410
Should we have different
expectations from them

01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:48.120
than we do from journalists?

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.890
One of my biases
is that we don't

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:53.880
do a good enough job of
explaining when we're lied to.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.652
We kind of absorb it, and
try to ferret out the truth.

01:21:56.652 --> 01:21:58.110
And then when we
make a mistake, it

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:01.980
looks like a journalistic fault.
But how do we balance that?

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.550
And how do we manage it from
a public official perspective?

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.680
- Can I open with just
one funny story that's

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.770
not for me, but from my friend,
Alison Mitchell, a great New

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:13.110
York Times journalist.

01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:16.380
And she was interviewing the
speaker of the New York State

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.480
Assembly many, many years ago.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.550
And she asked him a
very direct question.

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:23.010
And he looks at her straight
in the face and says,

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:23.940
"On the record, yes.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.600
Off the record, no."

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.620
And Allison just
threw down her pen

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.990
and said, what the hell am
I supposed to do with that?

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:33.480
So I just can't resist
passing that on.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.060
I'll let someone take it.

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.690
It's a very serious question.

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:38.460
- It's a day-in and
day-out, I think,

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.392
experience for most journalists.

01:22:41.392 --> 01:22:44.119
- Yeah, one of the reasons
why I am not reporting--

01:22:44.119 --> 01:22:45.160
I've done some reporting.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:45.951
I had to go around.

01:22:45.951 --> 01:22:50.460
But it's mostly sort of my
gimlet eye kind of stuff

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.890
rather than day-to-day
political reporting.

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:54.450
And politicians
call me all the time

01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:55.659
and all that kind of thing.

01:22:55.659 --> 01:22:58.200
But one of reasons why I don't
do reporting is I cannot stand

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.580
being lied to.

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.210
It just-- it makes me feel
like you think I'm an idiot.

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:05.940
And I also, because
I like arguments,

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.610
I can't listen to
people I think are

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:12.720
saying really stupid things,
and say, oh, that's interesting.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.960
Oh, tell me more.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:20.505
And some people have
that gift that they can--

01:23:20.505 --> 01:23:21.922
and I don't denigrate
them for it.

01:23:21.922 --> 01:23:24.046
Some of these people are
very good friends of mine.

01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:26.832
They can sit there, and they'll
let people hang themselves

01:23:26.832 --> 01:23:27.540
in front of them.

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.385
And I'm not good at that.

01:23:29.385 --> 01:23:30.260
I just want to brawl.

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:37.260
William Rusher was the longtime
publisher of National Review.

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:40.320
He always used to pull over
the new kids at the magazine,

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.040
and he would say, look, I need
to explain something to you.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.990
Politicians will
always disappoint you.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:51.710
And the point was, particularly
for young ideological and

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:53.800
idealistic kids at
National Review,

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.890
is that politicians
are human beings.

01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:58.370
Their incentive
structure is different.

01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:03.020
They are set up to do-- to win
elections and to be popular.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.230
And this is true of people
on the left or on the right.

01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:07.090
It doesn't matter.

01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:12.800
It's that the politicians are
human beings that journalists

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.392
want to either build
up or tear down,

01:24:14.392 --> 01:24:16.100
the people want to
build up or tear down.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.360
At the end of the
day, they're just

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.485
still made from the same
crooked timber of humanity

01:24:19.485 --> 01:24:20.235
as everybody else.

01:24:20.235 --> 01:24:22.818
I agree entirely that we should
have more expectations of them

01:24:22.818 --> 01:24:23.660
not to lie.

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.370
But I also think
that bears shouldn't

01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:28.950
use our national
forests as toilets.

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:33.170
Politicians will lie because
that is what they do.

01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:34.190
- Danielle, from a--

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:36.530
I mean, you spent a lot of
time thinking and talking

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.640
and researching ethics.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:43.940
What is the ethical
arrangement or relationship

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.354
between reporters and sources?

01:24:46.354 --> 01:24:48.770
- Thanks, I'm going to put it
in a slightly different way,

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:50.186
if you don't mind,
which is to say

01:24:50.186 --> 01:24:54.770
I think one has to put the issue
of the problem of legitimacy,

01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:58.110
institutional legitimacy,
into the conversation as well.

01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:04.340
So that is, lies undermine
the credibility and authority

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:07.940
and ultimately legitimacy of
any important institution.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.630
So the leaks from civil servants
are a form of whistle blowing.

01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:13.610
And that's because
they don't see

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:16.340
the legitimacy of the process
that they're working in.

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.380
The difficult thing then
is you sort of develop

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.850
a culture of leaks.

01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:21.440
And so The New York
Times publication

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.920
of the Manchester material,
I think was a mistake.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.690
I don't think that
there was anything

01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:29.120
of public value in
that publication.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.960
But I think that the culture
of expectation of leaking

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.240
has now extended
beyond places where

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.490
there is a problem with the
legitimacy in the process.

01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:38.948
That is, there's
no reason to think

01:25:38.948 --> 01:25:41.817
that the British process is
illegitimate and won't, as

01:25:41.817 --> 01:25:44.150
appropriate, be transparent
about what they're learning.

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:45.340
No reason to think that.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.730
And so therefore, I
think that was a mistake.

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:50.960
But so the reason I'm trying to
put this concept of legitimacy

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.330
together here with the
sort of issue of lying

01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:55.790
is because I think one of the
things that we've been living

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:57.740
through is that a
lot of institutions

01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.430
could protect their legitimacy
through secrecy, that

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:04.940
is through non-disclosure in
the pre-internet world, which

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.310
is not-- it's the
lie by omission,

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:09.380
not a lie by commission.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.640
All right?

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.310
You can't keep things
secret anymore.

01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:17.450
And so the first instinct when
that protective possibility

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:20.060
disappeared was to move
from the lie by omission,

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.030
as in the case of
the Catholic church,

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:24.450
to the lie by commission.

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:26.180
So in that regard,
I think, actually,

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.570
one of the core problems
has to do with leadership,

01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:31.910
and how we teach
leadership, and how

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:34.340
we teach people to
think about protecting

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.930
their own organization
in conditions

01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:37.910
of maximal transparency.

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:40.880
And I think that's actually
a very fundamental change

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.730
in people's basic habits
of self-protection.

01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:46.790
So weirdly enough, I
actually think, in some ways,

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.264
we need to insist on
truth and hold people

01:26:49.264 --> 01:26:50.930
accountable for lies,
and the electorate

01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:53.270
holds elected officials
accountable for lies.

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:55.120
We need to hold people
accountable there.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.619
But I actually think
we have to help

01:26:56.619 --> 01:26:59.020
people rethink self-protection.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.090
Because it's that, the
desire for self-protection,

01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:04.700
even in conditions of
maximal transparency,

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.990
that is leading people into
corrupt forms of behavior.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:14.300
And I think our anti-corruption
efforts needs to focus there.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.830
- We have very little time left.

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:20.690
And I want to ask you all to
give me a very short answer

01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:24.590
to a very big question.

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:28.370
I was thinking when A'Lelia
mentioned the 1984 Jesse

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:33.410
Jackson campaign, and she
talked about how this was really

01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:36.580
a coming of age for a
lot of black journalists

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.087
and an entry into
political reporting

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.420
for a lot of black journalists--
these moments that come

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:45.280
and they change forever kind of
the trajectory of the industry,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:45.920
right?

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.930
And so I guess the question is
inspired by that and by someone

01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:53.690
in the audience, who says,
how will the media industry

01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:55.310
change in the next decade?

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:59.480
I'd like to hand each of you a
crystal ball or a magic wand.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.100
You can take whichever.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:08.540
And tell us very briefly, when
another panel is assembled here

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.292
under Dean Cohen
some years from now,

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:11.750
and they're debating
something else

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.510
but looking back at this
moment, what will we

01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:20.390
say changed about
journalism and fact-seeking

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.310
as a result of this period?

01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:24.830
EJ?

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.610
- Oh, thanks a lot for--

01:28:26.610 --> 01:28:28.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:30.560
This will just give me
a chance to piggyback

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.440
on the other point you made,
which is I was sitting here

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.400
racking my brain.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.950
I do not remember being directly
lied to very much face to face.

01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:43.640
I remember far more people
putting spin on events,

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.920
giving partial
versions of events.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.450
And I actually think
this moment really

01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:52.020
is different in kind in
terms of outright lying

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.000
that we are seeing,
that it doesn't mean

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.970
other politicians haven't lied.

01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:00.030
I think there is a
kind of disrespect

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:03.180
for truth all together
that's deeper, which

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.480
is why I'll go-- that's how
I'll lead into my answer

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.500
to your question.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.710
I think that we'll
remember this time

01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:13.890
as a time of enormous
technological change, which

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:18.630
is forcing everyone to find
new ways to find audiences.

01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:22.770
It's a time of enormous
economic change, where

01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:25.740
what we call
traditional journalism

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.400
is beginning again,
but very slowly,

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.190
to find its footing to
finance a public good.

01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.890
We used to finance the
public good of journalism

01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:37.650
through monopoly profits
that newspapers made.

01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:40.230
Those monopoly profits
are gone, and so now we're

01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:43.350
trying to figure out how do
you finance this public good.

01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:47.490
I think that is going to
be very, very important.

01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:52.155
And I'll just close with
this, that I think that the--

01:29:52.155 --> 01:29:57.090
I truly believe the Trump period
presents fundamental problems

01:29:57.090 --> 01:29:59.940
to our attitudes toward
both liberty and equality,

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.570
to pick up Daniel's point.

01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:09.720
And that how we cope-- how
people stood on this, how they

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.280
battled, and how they tried to
tell the American people what

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.860
was going on, people
are going to be judged

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.180
by how they behaved
in this period,

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.620
more than in other periods
of American history.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.160
- Thank you.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.180
A'Lelia?

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.150
- So, I mean, I think we are
at an existential moment.

01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:30.810
I think we were probably lulled
over the last eight years

01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:33.870
into thinking that the
country could come together.

01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:38.070
I don't mean post-racially,
but a different optimism.

01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:40.560
I think this is
disruptive right now.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.900
I think that 20 years from
now, 50 years from now,

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.380
this will be seen
as an aberration.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.490
At least, I hope it will.

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.420
I hope it doesn't--

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.810
that we are not going in a
direction from which we cannot

01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:53.560
come back.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.420
But I think it is
the responsibility--

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.940
people will ask, where were
you on the side of history?

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:01.410
I mean, one of my journalism
classes, Fred Friendly

01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:02.970
was my journalism professor.

01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:05.220
And he had been at CBS
during the McCarthy

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.590
hearings with Edward R Murrow.

01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:10.110
And I think that we
will look back and say,

01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:12.000
what were those hearings like?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.140
Where were people?

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.190
How did they report?

01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:17.170
What were the elected
officials doing?

01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:17.980
- Danielle.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:20.240
- I'll take the magic wand.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.990
I've got five waves,
slightly crazy.

01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:24.100
Here we go.

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:28.330
End the war on drugs,
reduce expenditures

01:31:28.330 --> 01:31:32.300
on criminal justice,
reinvest in education,

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:37.590
including public
universities, work our way

01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.920
through our polarization to
enough of a shared narrative

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.970
to rebuild civic
education and thereby

01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:47.507
create a market for
the PBS News Hour.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.220
- And let it never be said
that Radcliffe did not

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.207
give the last word
to a conservative.

01:32:04.207 --> 01:32:05.290
- The prophecies are true.

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:13.570
You know, I've spent the last
two years, pretty bad two

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.970
years, and I've
come to define hope

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:19.330
as that brief pause
between kicks to the groin.

01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:25.690
And so I'm tempted
just to say, buy gold.

01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:33.610
But a couple of
scattershot points.

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:38.140
One, a lot of us are
still in the grips

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:40.630
of nostalgia about a
certain parentheses

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:44.980
in American history, about this
idea of objective national news

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.830
that really comes basically
out of the 1930s and 1940s

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.710
and then really with
the rise of television.

01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:53.410
If you go back, and you read the
coverage of the Lincoln-Douglas

01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:55.743
debates between the Republican
papers and the Democratic

01:32:55.743 --> 01:32:59.440
papers, and in the
Republican version, Lincoln--

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.790
Douglas was reduced to a
quivering puddle of jello

01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:04.600
as he could not
withstand the blinding

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.150
heat of Lincoln's oratory.

01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:10.930
And then the democratic
papers were, like, 12 men

01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:12.370
had to restrain Lincoln.

01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:17.510
So incensed was he to lose
the argument so resoundingly.

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:21.190
And what I would
love to see is--

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:26.530
not a return to that,
but a return to the idea

01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:30.040
that the most important
media in people's lives

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.890
is generated closer to
home, that comes out

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:35.440
of the organic community
in which they live,

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.570
that covers the world that
they actually live in.

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:40.480
I'm very big believer in
pushing down as much democracy

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.389
to the lowest level possible.

01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:43.930
Because that's how
it is the best way

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:47.110
to maximize the happiness
of the most people.

01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:49.510
And the other only
last point I'll make,

01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:52.810
is that the written
word ain't going away.

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:55.370
They keep pronouncing it dead.

01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:57.340
And yet it endures.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.350
And the secret, as any
good television producer

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:04.690
will tell you, is that
the written word still

01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:06.070
drives television.

01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:08.800
Because where people learn
about what's going on

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.660
is from newspapers
and magazines,

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.090
and now from screens,
but someone still

01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:15.010
had to write it down first.

01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:17.260
And that is a glorious and
wonderful thing, because it

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.958
might keep me employed.

01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:29.290
- Thank you.

01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:32.860
And please, just join
me again in thanking

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:34.020
all of our panelists--

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.056
EJ, A'Lelia,
Danielle, and Jonah.

01:34:39.056 --> 01:34:40.024
Thanks so much.

01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:48.530
- So let me add my thanks to
the panelists for really a very

01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:51.140
thoughtful and
terrific conversation,

01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.870
and to the audience for
your great questions,

01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:57.470
and, again, to Ann Marie for
guiding the discussion so

01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:59.020
expertly.
