00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.820
In this tutorial, we'll be
walking through the steps it

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.170
takes to set up IntelliJ
IDEA to run to YouTube

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.400
API samples for Java.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
This video was recorded using
IntelliJ IDEA 12 Community

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.680
Edition, but the process for
other versions should be very

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.160
similar, even if the menus may
not look exactly the same.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.770
When you first open IntelliJ
IDEA, you're presented with

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.410
several options to
open a project

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.340
or start a new project.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.720
Select Import Project.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.950
Browse to the folder containing
the YouTube API

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.080
samples you want to import.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.000
If you don't have these samples
yet, you'll need to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.245
download these from
code.google.com/

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:49.495
p/youtube-api-samples.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.590
There's another video showing
you how to do this, as well as

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.115
how to register your API keys.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.560
For now, I'm going to go ahead
and import the topic sample.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.530
You only need to select
a folder, click OK.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.590
Select Import Project
from External

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.490
Model and click Maven.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.070
Click Next.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.680
Click Next again, if
there are no other

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.930
settings you want to change.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.410
You should now be presented with
the name of the project,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.200
which corresponds to the sample
you want to import.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.120
I want to import the topic
sample, so this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.400
looks correct to me.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.650
I'm going to click Next.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.180
Select your JDK.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.230
If a JDK doesn't appear, you'll
need to add one using

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.240
the Plus button.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.100
I'm not going to go too much
into detail about how to do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.840
this, because this could
be different on

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.260
every single system.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.550
But if you're using a recent
version of Linux, for

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.355
instance, this should be
under /user/lib/jvm.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.350
If you're not sure where this
is, it's probably best to go

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.120
to your favorite search engine
and search for JDK location

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.340
operating system version.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.030
Replace operating system and
version, which are operating

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.130
system and version.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.290
Click Next.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.680
Again, change any settings
that you want to change.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.196
Click Next, and click Finish.

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:23.190
What you'll see is that Maven is
now downloading the sample

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.440
dependencies in the
background.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.590
When this is completed, you'll
be able to open up the sample

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140
code and compile it.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.750
I'm going to go ahead
and click Run.
