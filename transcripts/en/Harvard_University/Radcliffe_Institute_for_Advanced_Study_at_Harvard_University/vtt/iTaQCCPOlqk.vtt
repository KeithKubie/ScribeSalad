00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.040
- Thank you very much, Judy.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.300
And thank you all of you
beautiful people for being here

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.890
today.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.160
I want to begin by just offering
my thanks and my gratitude

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.080
to the Radcliffe, really an
extraordinary opportunity,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.220
I think we all feel, to have
our work honored in this way

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480
and to really discover
what these projects are.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.870
And so in that spirit, most of
what I'll be presenting today

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.690
really are things
that I've begun

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.520
to think about in the
last couple of months

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.680
since I've been here.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.660
So I ask your patience and for
you to receive it in that way.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.730
And so I thank you.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.800
I thank you for honoring
my work and for honoring

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.770
our work together and
having us here for the year.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.660
Thankful-- also have
the two students

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.300
from UC Riverside who've
begun programs here

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.200
at Harvard this year.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.650
And [INAUDIBLE] and Gabriella,
I dedicate this to you.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.650
And Rebecca as well--
she's come in the back.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.970
As I am getting ready to
speak at length about ghosts,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.840
inheritance, and generations
and generations of ghosts, which

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.240
is to say about certain
others who are not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.260
present nor presently living,
either to us, inside us,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.810
or outside us, it is
in the name of justice,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.610
Derrida, Specters of Marx.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.060
In the beginning there was
ice, glacial ice, now heavy

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.610
with the weight of human history
bearing down from one layer

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.200
to the next.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.100
It records a solemn
imprint of human loss,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.740
the collapse of
indigenous populations

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.450
across this hemisphere
in the 16th century

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.479
is legible in the
geological record.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.190
The so-called Orbis Spike
refers to a measurable drop

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.280
in carbon dioxide
levels recorded

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.720
in the Antarctic glacial ice
core in the precise period

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.630
of my study, 1570 to 1620.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.740
To explain the Orbis Spike,
some climate change scientists

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.770
conclude that the
mortality crisis suffered

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.670
by native peoples led
to a near cessation

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.880
of indigenous
agriculture followed

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.930
by a period of
rapid reforestation.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.380
After the cataclysm,
the earth strangely

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.000
appears to gasp as the
indigenous population tumbles

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.940
to its nadir, a sharp intake
of breath, as if in response

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.320
to some trauma.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.500
Last year, two
British climatologists

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.960
argued that the
16th century Orbis

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.250
Spike is the preferred boundary
marker for the beginning

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.440
of the Anthropocene.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.250
Their intriguing yet
contested conclusion

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.010
is that it is
precisely this moment

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.010
of human-wrought
catastrophe that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.520
signals the current
geological age, the age

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.640
of the Anthropocene, in
which human activity is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.850
the dominant influence on
climate and the environment.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.880
The human catastrophe that
orients my reflections

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.880
this afternoon is thus
legible in geological time.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.320
Ice is more penetrable to the
suffering of humans than God,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.000
it would seem.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.990
In Mexico, both the Spanish
and indigenous survivors

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.870
of the collapse regarded
the Christian God

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.130
as a remote and dispassionate
observer of the events

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.420
He Himself had wrought.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.740
My concern is precisely to
explore religious experience

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.400
in this context of
crisis and calamity,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
religion at the dawn
of the Anthropocene.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.770
So I'll begin by saying that my
intention is to first provide

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.500
some background
conceptually to what

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.210
I want to talk about
today, to propose

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.790
some conceptual categories.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.850
And then I want
to look at the way

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.760
in which the sort of
Christian, the landscape

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.370
of the Christian imaginary
is shaped in this period,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.100
both for the Spanish and
for indigenous communities.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.640
And I want to look at the
way, the divergence, really,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.650
of these landscapes of the
imaginary after the collapse,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.480
and in doing that, to show
how the church itself sort

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.220
of shapes itself, defines
itself, and reconstitutes

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.020
itself as an institution
after this cataclysm.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.630
In the New World,
the Spanish referred

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.640
to each ravaging epidemic
as a mortandad, a death

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.030
event of apocalyptic scale.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.180
So my story this afternoon
begins with the mortandad,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.730
with the mortality
crisis itself.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.160
And the story I will tell is
one of conquest and crisis

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.510
of affliction, of devastation
and disaster, an intimate story

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.030
told up close, which is the way
of historians, but with the eye

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.520
to the larger
implications for ourselves

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.850
and our self-understanding,
which is the way of scholars

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.710
of religion.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.800
My argument is this,
that the mortandad,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.970
the indigenous mortality
crisis of the 16th century

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.020
is the point of Genesis, the
cosmological point of origin

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.900
for Christianity
and the New World.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.380
Born from this moment,
Christianity in the Americas,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.600
I imagine as an Ecclesia ex
Mortuis, a church from the dead

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.170
and a church of the dead.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.870
The Ecclesia ex Mortuis is
always defined in relation

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.640
to the death event, as to
the dead left in its wake.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.140
The Ecclesia ex Mortuis
orients and reorients itself

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.520
in relation to the mortandad
that defines its origin,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.330
not just in relation to the
singular death event of disease

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.690
and mortality crisis, but in
relation to the multiple death

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.050
worlds wrought by colonialism.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.860
Forged by the death event,
the Ecclesia ex Mortuis

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.690
is defined by the dead and
by those who survived them,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.940
by those who claimed
the dead and those who

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.960
have abandoned them,
those who had given up

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.990
and those who persisted.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.310
As the Ecclesia ex Mortuis,
the New World church

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.560
is not a phoenix, rising from
flames, remade and reborn.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.010
Rather, the Ecclesia ex
Mortuis, the religion

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.730
that emerges from the disaster
of colonialism and collapse,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.820
is a religion
rescued from rubble,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.280
rescued without
necessarily being

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.997
redeemed, a salvaged religion.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.070
So I want to stop
and say something

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.460
here about the relationship
between epidemics

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.470
and colonialism.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:46.210
In the 16th century, indigenous
peoples and Spanish observers

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.540
struggled to try to understand
the origins, the cause,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.500
of indigenous death,
of their own deaths.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.060
And there was no
consensus, I would say.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.090
Was it bad conditions,
hard labor, the violence

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.650
of the conquest?

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.310
Was it particular
vulnerability to disease?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.090
Those questions were
unresolved in the time.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.150
And I think they're still
unresolved among historians

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.130
today, those who are considering
these contexts today.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.160
I see, really, that
epidemics are not

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.320
just the kind of antecedent that
paves the way for colonialism,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.950
nor are they sequelae
of colonialism.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.289
But really, they are
co-identifying with it.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.620
They are inseparable from it.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.330
So they are-- and that
is why I regard them

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:47.180
as man-made in essence, so the
origins of man-made mass death.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.260
And for those of you who know
the work of Edith Wyschogrod

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.860
She is here.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.400
And you will see her again.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.130
And I want to say that
in my thinking about how

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.970
to engage the dead,
I've been really aided

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.270
by the work of Vince
Brown, who's here today,

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.340
and thinking about the dead as
a generative social force that

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.030
shapes social institutions
and shapes history.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.730
So I'm grateful for
that insight that I

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.370
bring to these materials.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.300
So I'm going to now talk
a little bit about what

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:32.140
this collapse is and
talk about what illness

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.150
particularly we're
talking about here.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.300
And then I'm going to
move on to really look

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.620
at these two landscapes.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.600
And I'm going to look at two
very particular documents, two

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.760
very particular
kinds of materials,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.940
to try to get at the ways that
the Christian imagination is

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.310
shaped in this
moment of collapse.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.380
And in general-- so I'm working
with unpublished manuscript

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.650
materials from the Achivo
de Indies, the Archive

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.840
of the Indies in Seville.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.900
But today, while I'll
refer to some of those,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.660
I'm actually going to focus
on published sources that

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.220
may be a little more
familiar to some people.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:23.500
So the topic, the sort of period
of collapse in Mexico of steep

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.520
decline over a course
of about 50 years,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.970
and the first an
epidemic of smallpox.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.400
And these numbers,
these are a variation

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.980
of Cook and Borah, the famous
Berkeley demographers' numbers.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.420
At the middle of
the 20th century,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.560
they radically revised the count
of the indigenous population

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.400
of Mexico and of the
Americas, really.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.290
And they radically
revised it up.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.600
And this number of 22
million to start really

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.770
is sort of on the middle
low end of their estimate.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.340
This author has chosen to
anchor the numbers there.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:06.340
And then I do want to say that
I disagree with the suggestion

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.330
of [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] as
the name, the Nahua people,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.520
the Nahua name for the disease.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.550
And I think it I think the
consensus is probably typhus,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.780
in 1545.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.700
But you can see these
steep periods of decline.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.470
And probably, the
steepest one, really,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.050
is that 1545, where you
really see that plummet.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.810
This is the period
that I'm interested in.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.110
And I think of it as
the corner of collapse,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.460
basically, that point
at which the population

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.360
tumbles to its very lowest
point and remains there

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.630
for about 250 years,
never really to recover.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.560
So I'm looking at that
precise bend, that corner.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.980
And the illness that
the indigenous people

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.730
called Cocolitzli.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:01.450
I'll talk about that a little
bit more in a minute, has been,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.910
I think, fairly
conclusively determined

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.730
to be an epidemic of
hemorrhagic fever,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.360
an arenaviral hemorrhagic
fever, characterized

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.760
by internal and
external hemorrhage,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.550
transmitted by
rodents to humans.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.440
And a really interesting
study in 2000

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.520
attributed it to kind of
tectonic agricultural shifts

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.900
under colonial rule, in
particular the introduction

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.390
of wheat and the increase
in stores of wheat

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.680
and also stores of corn that
increased the rodent reservoir

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.360
population.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.210
So I want to say, they're
not. virgin soil diseases.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.980
These are native-born.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.050
This is a native-born illness.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.490
And it's an illness that
overwhelmingly takes the lives

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.320
of indigenous peoples.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.200
But there are also some
Spanish who are susceptible,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.600
as well as Africans in Mexico.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.470
But the predominantly
affected by far

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.602
is the indigenous population.

00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:08.310
So there's a map.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.710
People like maps.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.580
So I'm really thinking about New
Spain overall, a larger story,

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.460
I want to tell about American
Christianity, sort of you

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.570
can think about when we talk
about the origins of American

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.480
Christianity, we think of
Plymouth Rock, Plymouth

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.560
Plantation.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.030
And I want to shift that access.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.210
I'm always trying to
shift Tenochtitlan now

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.770
becomes the center of the
origins of the American, story

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.510
of American Christianity.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.570
But largely, what I'm
talking about here,

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.900
and the sources come from
the larger area of the Vice

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.450
Royalty of Mexico,
and this is where

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:53.920
there's a real, one of the
large demographic centers,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.710
population centers, before
the arrival of Europeans here,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.270
the Amazon, the
Andes, and really also

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:10.630
that I'm looking at the
Nahua area and the Maya area.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.120
And those are the sources
that I'm working with.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:22.830
So for those who want a
reminder about this period, what

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.280
I'm really talking about
is the early decades

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.550
of Spanish mission
in the Americas.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.080
The first friars are
Franciscan mendicant friars.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.820
They arrive in 1524.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.940
There are 12 of them,
a symbolic number.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.480
They march into Mexico City.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.240
They process into Mexico City,
where they are ceremonially

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.220
received by Cortez,
who reverences them.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.670
I think he kisses their
skirts or their hands

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.920
and really turns over.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.740
So the spiritual
conquest then follows

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.450
on the heels of the military
conquest in a very real way.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.490
So my concern really
here are mostly

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.140
the mendicant orders--
the Franciscans,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.300
the Augustinian, the
Dominicans, and those

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.220
who are working in communities,
indigenous Indian communities,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.720
Indian pueblos, and their
sort of millennial dream

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.830
for a new Christendom, an
American Christendom that

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.880
would guide them over the
next 50 years between 1524,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.480
I would say, in the onset
of this epidemic, that sort

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.540
of fantasy, that desire.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.820
And over those
first five decades,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.480
I think we can read in the
record fluctuations of optimism

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.400
and despair for the friars.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.110
In the big picture,
I want to say

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.360
what happens in the course of
the epidemic, so this final,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.900
that corner of collapse,
when that corner is turned,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.300
is that the mendicant orders
really come to perceive--

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.465
and you'll see the
evidence in the sources

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.840
that I talk about
here-- but they

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.610
come to perceive that the
New World church is over.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.520
It's come to an end.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.650
With the death of the
indigenous population,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:19.350
there is no more a
future, or a future

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:24.840
as they imagined this sort of
indigenous Indian, Christian,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.100
Franciscan, version of
Christianity, of Christendom.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.930
And so what happens
is they retreat

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.280
from the missionary frontier.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.695
They retreat from
pueblos de indios,

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.450
the indigenous communities.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.920
They consolidate their
personnel in urban areas,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.410
in Mexico City and
other urban areas.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.020
And they really thrive
and prosper there.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.600
And then their
future and their fate

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.050
really comes to shape
kind of the New World city

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.150
urbanization.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.170
And from this, I think, we
see the origins of Mestizo

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.290
Christianity and the
origins of the Baroque

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.310
also, so that retreat into
the urban areas, consolidation

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:10.770
in the urban areas, the rise
of Baroque Christianity.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.720
I want to talk about sort
of effective positionalities

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.450
that I'm I've been struggling
with in my sources,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.000
trying to get my
head around in terms

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.520
of the ways in which the
friars see themselves

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.859
and understand their labor.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:32.160
So in my work, I'm coming
very close to them.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.930
I'm intimately involved in
their writings and their lives.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:43.710
And I'm thinking the sort of
self-perception, their identity

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.980
as conservadores de indios
is really at the core.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.360
So they are conservers of
the indigenous population.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.120
That becomes, very early,
part of their identity.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.500
They are trying to keep
indigenous people alive.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.090
And then what happens is there's
a pairing in the manuscript

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.220
sources that I'm
coming across, which

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.850
is a pairing of a kind of dual
mission for the mendicants,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.410
which is the mission of
conservacion and convercion.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:18.300
So conversion and conservation
become a joined mission.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.600
And I think there is this
sort of affect, then,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.840
that comes from this moment of
worry, anxiety, care, concern,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.170
pity, poignancy, and
this sort of Pieta vision

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.420
which I've published before
and think about this image

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.800
quite a bit, this Jose Clemente
Orozco's Friar and the Indian,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:47.070
Franciscan and the Indian,
a sort of an image of care

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:53.880
and rescue, even as the person
is dying in the frier's arms.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.010
Ultimately, I think in the
epidemic that I'm looking at,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.730
the friars come to
realize that that identity

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.060
as conservadores de idios,
that they have failed,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.540
that they have failed to
conserve the population.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.440
So for example, in 1582,
the Augustinian provincial--

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:22.500
so right in the end of the
epidemic-- Pedro Suarez de

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.985
Escobar writes the
Spanish king, and he

00:19:24.985 --> 00:19:30.460
is morning this
collapse, this endpoint

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.000
of the indigenous population.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.300
And he writes, it was
a disastrous shipwreck,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.510
in which our holy religion has
sunk to the bottom of the sea,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.150
so the sense of it
as over, as final.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.340
You know, and the reality is,
of course, in that retreat

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.860
to the urban areas, they
prosper, the religious orders

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.670
prosper.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.140
So in a sense,
though, the church

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.145
has ended before it's even
really begun, in a sense.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.350
So I want to talk about
landscape now, so the remaining

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.220
time, I want to explore
these two landscapes

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.610
of the Christian imagination,
the Christian imaginaire that

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:19.840
emerged after this epidemic or
in the wake of the epidemic.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.450
And the first for the friars,
for the religious personnel,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:31.480
for the Spanish missionaries,
is the collapse, the death,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.260
is most tangible,
most immediate,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.580
in their perception
of a depopulated land,

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.690
a land of empty roads,
roads that have been emptied

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.390
of people, that are abandoned.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.190
And so this is the landscape
that I want to think about,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.070
this idea of empty roads.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.750
And in some way, I think the
landscape of the Ecclesia ex

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:05.380
Mortuis is really a landscape
of the dead, a land of the dead.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:12.010
And so this is a source here
that, a Spanish source, that's

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.430
writing about the Miccatlalli,
which is the Nahua

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:20.140
concept of a land of the
dead, a tierra de difuntos,

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.820
and that this is
how they regard,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.810
this is in this moment how the
Spanish Christian imaginary

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.430
in Mexico is regarding the New
World, the landscape of the New

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.310
World.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.430
So empty roads,
abandoned roads, this

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.410
is a tangible sign as evidence
of death of the Indians.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.350
And there's a way in which
these roads, I think,

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:51.880
are full of pathos and
sentiment and drive them forward

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.140
into the cities and in
retreat from that vision.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.930
So some of the
documents I'm working

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.670
with, the bishop of Mexico,
grand inquisitor, Pedro

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.140
Contreras, kind of was holed up
in the course of the epidemic

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.240
in his home, his cathedral home.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.140
And then right as it's
crested, after about 18 months.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:14.770
He comes out.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.570
And he walks 800 leagues
to survey his diocese.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.250
He had postponed this
trip from most two years.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.410
And then he writes a letter
describing a wasteland.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.720
It was much to consider
and contemplate,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.270
he writes, to see the
land so depopulated,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.880
a land that in the
time of Montezuma

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.842
was swarming with people.

00:22:35.842 --> 00:22:38.050
It seemed like there was no
remedy that it could ever

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.350
be that way again, because the
Indians that remain in the land

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.140
are being consumed
with great speed.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.660
He goes on, having witnessed
the state of the provinces,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.320
their greatly reduced
populations, and the sites

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.210
from antiquity that
so clearly show

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.730
how great the
population once was,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.140
it fills one with grief and pity
to see these superb ruins which

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.980
so clearly marked the great
diminishment of the population.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.280
Along the same lines, the bishop
of Michoacan, at the same time,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.500
writes-- he's an
Augustinian friar.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.660
He'd been in Mexico
for half a century.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.020
And in October of
'81, 1581, he writes,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.290
one feels the loss most in
the loneliness and emptiness

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.180
of the roads and towns.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.790
And what is most terrifying
is that it does not

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.020
cease to continue to take lives
here and there, even though

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.000
so very few remain.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.292
Mexico City was truly a
valley of tears, una valle

00:23:32.292 --> 00:23:35.410
de lagrimas.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:39.370
So I want now to
bring this reading

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.310
into a more familiar document.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:47.320
This is Sahagun, Bernardino,
Franciscan recorder,

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.470
chronicler, editor
of encyclopedias,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.650
I would say, in
the 16th century.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.340
His history of the
things of New Spain

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:04.690
is 12-volume,
encyclopedic-- 12 books,

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.210
really, bound in
three volumes that

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.660
chronicle the culture
of Mesoamerica, probably

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.840
our most important
source for understanding

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.830
Mesoamerican populations
before the conquest,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:24.850
because the Spanish destroyed
much artifacts and objects that

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.220
might have assisted us.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.680
So the interesting
thing about this book

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.260
is that the Getty Villa, a
couple, maybe a decade back

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.350
or something-- in
the last 10 years--

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.920
repatriated a bunch of
Italian masterpieces,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.750
sent them back to Italy.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:48.070
The Getty Villa is
this sort of a hotbed

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.996
of Greek and Roman antiquities.

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:52.370
And so they had
repatriated, they

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.740
had returned these Italian
works with the understanding,

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.290
the agreement, that they
would be able to receive

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.280
on loan Italian masterpieces.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.340
So the moment arises,
and they say--

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.210
the Getty Villa
curatorial staff say--

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.430
what we want, the first thing we
want, is the Florentine Codex.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.420
So Sahagun's codex,
his three volumes,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.611
are in the library in Florence.

00:25:23.611 --> 00:25:25.860
And they were shocked right,
because they're expecting

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.856
some Italian masterwork.

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:31.230
And the person, apparently,
on the other end of the phone

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.860
didn't even know what this
was and had to figure it out.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.310
So for the first time
in 400 years in 2010,

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.160
one volume of the Florentine
Codex came to the Getty Villa.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.360
And it was on display there.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.900
And I took students to see it.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.240
And at the opening, I believe
it was the ambassador, one

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.080
of the ambassador,
Mexican ambassador, said,

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.701
we may not be able
to let this go back.

00:25:57.701 --> 00:25:58.950
We might have to keep it here.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:03.110
So really, really,
everyone sort of

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.270
laughed nervously in that
moment, like, you know,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.440
is he serious?

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.580
But really quite extraordinary--
so the work is beautifully

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.260
illustrated.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.980
So Sahagun is collaborating.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.472
So in the midst of the epidemic,
of this particular epidemic--

00:26:20.472 --> 00:26:21.930
and Dinah [INAUDIBLE]
has described

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.210
this beautifully, the art
historian-- in the midst

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.560
of this epidemic, Sahagun is
holed up in a studio workshop

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.310
with perhaps some 22,
some portion of 22

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.610
indigenous artists,
and illustrators,

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.830
and experts, cultural experts,
creating this document.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.030
And it is Nahua on the one
side with Spanish translation

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.870
on the other.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.180
So the original text is
Nahua, and the Spanish

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.190
is the translation, and
then these gorgeous images,

00:26:53.190 --> 00:27:00.010
and just an extraordinary,
beautiful work.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:04.050
So what I have been
working on, I think,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.120
is something that,
so far I don't

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.680
know if anyone is
writing about this,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.110
but I've found the sort
of interesting thing

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.930
in Sahagun's, in book 11
of his volume dedicated

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.840
to the kind of earthly
things, to objects, to things

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.660
of the natural world,
in chapter eight.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.740
So it's a catalog of indigenous
culture, basically, and flora

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.630
and fauna of the New World.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.050
And so what he's
done is this section

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.040
is supposed to be dedicated
to caminos, to roads,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.000
in the Nahua culture before
the arrival of the Spanish.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.330
And the whole
12-series volume ends

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.640
with the arrival of Cortez.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.910
That's the final scene
of these 12 books.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.240
But anyway, so on this
side, it's all about roads.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.910
And the indigenous scribes, the
Nahua scribes, have written.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.930
I'm going to read some of the
things they say about roads.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.360
But then on the left side,
rather than translation,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.240
we have a really
interesting interruption,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.090
which is Sahagun
takes this moment

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.190
to write about the epidemic.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.670
And there six pages
dedicated to the epidemic.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.120
And he sort of fit it in.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.990
So this sort of landscape that
he is painting in the narrative

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:26.730
is really one of an imperfect,
broken, Christian orb,

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.630
in which Christianity has
traveled across the globe,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.840
kind of failed
wherever it's gone,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.070
and has finally come to Mexico,
where it's also just failed.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.587
It's ended.

00:28:38.587 --> 00:28:39.920
The Christian mission has ended.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.790
And I'm going to read from that.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:46.380
But first, I want to read from
this these incredible Nahua

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.920
discussion of roads that
he doesn't translate.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.490
And in the main published
version of this,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.060
the author, the editors,
decided to translate the Nahua

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.400
and to kind of leave
out the Spanish.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:08.850
So the sort of litany of roads
that the Nahua scribes offer--

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.060
so for example, regarding
main or principal roads,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.700
they write, I travel the road.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.750
I travel the main road.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.060
I widen it, broaden it,
narrow it, make it narrow.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.010
I sweep the road.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.789
I clean it up.

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:21.330
I improve it.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.950
I take it straight ahead.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.230
I go directly along it.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.130
I go straight on it.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.880
I go down it.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.540
I go up it.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.920
I travel directly along it.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.150
I follow its curve.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.130
I follow its curves.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.240
I double back on it.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.220
I follow the winding road.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.170
I break off my journey along it.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.090
I regard the smooth road.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.500
I remove trees from the road.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.300
I clean the road.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.110
I improve the road.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.150
I place myself on the main road.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.550
I fill the main road with sheep.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.330
I herd them.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.040
I bring them to the main road.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.240
I join the main road.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.380
I come to join it.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.640
I join it there.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:59.130
I depart from it, so this
sort of litany of roads.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.730
And then meanwhile,
Sahagun writes,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.400
having passed through
mountains and valleys and roads

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.280
of diverse kinds, it seems
to me the opportune time

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.690
to talk about the roads that
the church itself has traveled,

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.230
until arriving at
this last dwelling,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.040
where it is now
a pilgrim, sowing

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.930
the doctrine of the gospel.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:26.190
And he goes on to say as the
church has passed from Europe,

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.840
from Palestine into Europe into
Germany, Italy into Africa,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.270
it's failed pretty much
everywhere it's gone.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.550
Right It's failed in
each of these places

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.260
to take deep roots.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.610
Mexico, for Sahagun, was the
land of infinite possibility.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.170
But he writes,
the Catholic faith

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.500
has found infertile
territory here.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.800
There were once a diversity of
people in this land, he writes.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.900
But these are pretty
much finished.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.040
And those that remain are on
the road to their end as well.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.490
It is a great land here to sow
Christianity, but difficult

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.826
to harvest.

00:31:03.826 --> 00:31:05.700
It seems to me that the
Catholic faith is not

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.010
long for these lands,
because the people head

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.400
to their end with great haste,
not only for the bad treatment

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.230
they receive, but
because of the diseases

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.250
God has sent upon them.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.800
But it seems to me
that our Lord has

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.290
opened a new road for
the church, the road

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.657
to Asia and the Philippines.

00:31:21.657 --> 00:31:23.490
And as the Catholic
Church is planted there,

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.950
I think will last
for many years,

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.050
because for this
land of New Spain,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.480
the Catholic faith has
done nothing more than pass

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.000
through it as through a road.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.240
So that sort of landscape is
really quite extraordinary.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.800
So here's this final bit,
just one last thing here.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.200
I think what's
really striking to me

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.130
about Sahagun's
interruption of his work

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.560
to write about the
epidemic and to reflect

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.700
on this particular
corner of collapse

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.470
is the way in which it's a
rupture, in so many ways,

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.800
from the rest of the work.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.010
And then also, I want to
say a temporal rupture,

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:10.050
because the work
otherwise closes

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.930
with the arrival of Cortez.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.340
But here's this other
really, another rupture.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.590
So there's a little asterisks.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.550
I don't know if you
can see that there.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.790
And then it refers to a
section right down there.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.500
It refers you to that section.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.730
So he's asking the reader,
future imagined reader--

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.180
I don't know who--
to pray for us.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:43.520
So he says, [SPEAKING SPANISH],
so pray for us that this ends.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.758
Because if it lasts any
longer, everything is over.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.560
So for Sahagun and his brethren,
the Christian landscape now

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.360
a marred landscape, the
landscape of the Ecclesia ex

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:06.440
Mortuis, a broken landscape,
an empty landscape.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.350
So I want to shift gears now
and bring the-- this will be

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:14.630
the last five, 10 minutes here.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.750
I want to talk now
about how I'm trying

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.970
to access-- It's
more difficult--

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.240
but how I'm trying to
access indigenous responses

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.580
to the epidemic.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.190
I don't have
indigenous languages.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.950
But also, the sources even in
this period for this material

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.690
are hard to find and
few exist at all.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:39.940
So I'm need to look at published
materials, visual sources,

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.650
as well.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.550
But I want to kind of contrast
the, what I would say,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:50.650
the emerging Christian imaginary
of indigenous communities

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.050
at the same time, in the
same corner of collapse,

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.950
in the same crisis, and
how indigenous communities,

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.130
Christian communities, are
reconstituting themselves

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:04.340
in the wake of this epidemic.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.100
And so I want to say something
about indigenous Christianity.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.360
So I would say one of the
questions that really drives

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.600
part of my work is to
think about this paradox

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.310
of colonial imposition
of Christianity

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:25.600
and the fact of indigenous
Christian faith.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.400
That's the kind of
thing I struggle with,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.060
how to talk about that,
how to write about that.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.096
And so I want to say that
there's an argument-- I'm not

00:34:38.096 --> 00:34:39.929
very versed with this
material-- but there's

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:43.710
an argument that
says that epidemics,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.199
disease, and the
origins of Christianity

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:50.280
in the first century, first
centuries, that those really

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.570
helped solidify the
Christian church.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.940
Christianity was
particularly prepared

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.020
to deal with broken
body in this way,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.880
with illness, with disease.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.100
And also, there was sort
of a social factor that

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.520
allowed for Christians
to care for each other

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.030
and then facilitated
their survival.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.460
I don't see evidence
for anything

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.885
like that in this period.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.610
What I want to say is
that in central Mexico,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.310
according to my, what I
have come to understand

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:31.990
my sources, that in most
indigenous communities,

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.630
were not-- I would say, and
I've written-- they immediately

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.740
kind of recognize the potency
of the Christian sacred.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.740
So there was a fairly
immediate willingness

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:49.650
to accept where conflict
and violence occurred

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.380
was rather around two
areas of contest--

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.460
one, Christian exclusivism,
Christianity and no other.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.630
And then the other is
Spanish-European control

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.150
over local Christian practice.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.830
So communities of
indigenous Christians

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.310
fought those two struggles.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.790
And that's where, often,
the greatest violence

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.240
happened as a result, as
indigenous communities insisted

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.600
on that.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.290
So I want to say that
this epidemic does not

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.970
make people more Christian.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.810
It does not make
more Christians.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.970
It is the communities
that already understood

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.520
themselves to be
Christian reasserted

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.470
that in a particular frame.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:38.210
And so I want to talk
about that as I close.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:44.330
So this is a particular document
that kind of gets at or sheds

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.030
some light, I think, on
how indigenous communities

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.750
were seeing this epidemic.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.120
So Cocolitzli, the name
that they give it, coco

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.410
from the Nahuatl, demolish,
dismember, destroy, itzli,

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.050
or litzli, blood, demolished
by blood, destroyed by blood,

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.360
laid waste by blood.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.830
And you can see here
is an illustration.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:11.990
This is a codex from 1607
by an anonymous indigenous

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:16.910
author, written in Nahuatl for
an elite indigenous audience.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.700
And it's an annal, so
every year has its events.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.150
And this is for the year 1576.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.940
And you can see he's
kind of bleeding here

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.160
on this cross, which I think
is kind of interesting,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.969
and with the friar with
sunglasses or something.

00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:33.552
I don't know what's
going on with him.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:43.880
But anyway, so what the Nahua
says accompanying these images

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:50.840
about this epidemic is it
talks about how the friars went

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.350
home and home, trying to
care for the sick for a time,

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.510
trying to rescue the sick.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.880
But then that ended.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.826
And the author writes--
this is the Spanish.

00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:04.200
I don't need to
read the Spanish.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.360
Basically, that is when
the bells stopped ringing.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.270
They stopped ringing for
the dead, for the burials.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:17.070
And it was as if we had been
abandoned in the church.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:22.080
But the sense that as the
mendicant orders are retreating

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.580
from indigenous
communities, they've

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.110
abandoned both the
living and the dead.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:35.650
So the sources that I've
found myself rereading

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.600
over the last
couple months, these

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.370
are very famous maps, the Mapas
of the Relaciones Geograficas.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.170
They're a set.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.080
I think there's 167
of them in existence.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.960
They were part of an answer
to a survey circulated

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.610
by King Philip II in 1576,
thereabout, something

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.610
like that.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.360
And it coincides--
rather incidentally,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.760
this survey coincided with
this period of collapse.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.950
There are 50 questions.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.160
These are circulated to pueblos,
communities, all over Mexico,

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.260
all over, actually, New Spain.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.040
I'm focusing on
the ones in mostly

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.820
in the central--
in Mexico proper.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:26.840
But question 10 in the
survey asks for a map.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.940
And the idea was that the king
wanted to survey his colony.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.150
He wanted to understand what
resources there might be,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.130
was trying to create
together, thinking

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.740
these would create a
comprehensive map that he

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.480
could use in some way.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.720
And both the answers
to the questions

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.769
are often referred to indigenous
leaders in the communities,

00:39:51.769 --> 00:39:53.560
because they're asking
about local history,

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.290
and local resources,
and local languages

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.660
and then the
commissioning of the maps

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.770
also, in many instances, they're
done by indigenous artists

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.850
and artisans.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.830
And they turn out
to be completely

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.550
useless for colonial purposes,
completely illegible,

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.340
completely bizarre, right?

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.200
But they've been read.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.600
But they coincide
precisely to this period

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.520
of the end of this epidemic.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.750
And so I've been
trying to reread them,

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.790
because I'm in visual
sources and visual materials.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.230
I've been trying to read
them as documents that

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.240
are responding to the epidemic.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.600
And so the way that
they've been regarded

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.800
in the past by scholars--
for example, Serge Gruzinski,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.370
beautiful scholar who
writes about this period

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.100
and writes about these
maps as memories to order.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.330
They are nostalgic.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.820
They are backward-looking.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.370
They are recalling
a time of order.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.010
And we have now entered
a time of disorder.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.810
And I am proposing to read them
in a different way as actually

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.140
a projection of
local communities

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.340
into the future in a kind
of Christian landscape,

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.310
written on a
Christian landscape.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.720
And where scholars who have
looked at them before are

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.190
interested in indigenous
motifs, indigenous writing,

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.670
pictographs,
iconography, I'm really

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:31.360
interested to trace
the Christian images

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.280
and Christian symbols
on these maps.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.530
And so you can see the
intersection of roads

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.171
and churches is something
I've been thinking quite a bit

00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:42.670
about.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:46.750
So there's one map in particular
that I want to talk about.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.690
This is one of the
more famous maps.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.046
And so my suggestion,
basically, the way

00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:54.670
that I'm reading
these, because they're

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:59.485
sent to the king, that
these local communities,

00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:04.110
these local communities
of indigenous Christians

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.760
have now mapped
Christian architecture,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.740
Christian buildings,
the Christian church,

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:15.530
Christian symbols, onto their
local cosmological imagination.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:25.240
And so they are, I'm suggesting,
a kind of proffered covenant--

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.530
covenants often
follow cataclysm--

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:33.370
for a way forward for
these local communities.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:38.950
And if I had more time, I would
talk about the altepetl, which

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:47.910
is the Nahua ethnic unit that
is the sort of thing on which

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.480
indigenous communities
insist in the conquest

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.730
that that will survive.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.110
It is the ethnic state,
could be very small.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:01.230
There were 300 of them in
the larger part of Mexico

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.660
when the Spanish arrived.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.330
And so my argument is
that these maps and like

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.200
this map of
Teozacoalco that they

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.790
are inscribing that Christian
imaginary onto the landscape

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:21.210
of the altepetl and proposing
a local sovereign Christianity,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.430
bounded, territorially bounded.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.470
These are boundary
markers all around,

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.010
these pictographs of covenants
and boundary markers,

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:34.770
marking space and sort of
inscribing Christian space

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.971
within this frame.

00:43:35.971 --> 00:43:37.470
And I want to say,
of course, if you

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.500
want to read Mesoamerican
maps, David Carrasco

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.210
is the person to help with this.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.710
He's written
beautifully about that.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.130
So what captures
my attention here

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.440
is at the very
center of this map

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.090
is this image of a
church, and next to it,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.330
an early colonial
palace, and the way

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:02.310
that that interfaces with
these other figures, which

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:08.160
are indigenous lineages,
royal lineages, and this space

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.810
of this town, this
altepetl, that

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:15.240
interacts with only outward
to its indigenous history.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.190
I think about-- it's
hard to see here,

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.850
and the quality of the
slide isn't that good--

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.280
but these roads, thinking
about roads and landscape,

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.120
have footprints, which is very
traditional to pre-Hispanic

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.120
Mesoamerican cartography.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.040
They have footprints on them
that run all around the church,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.810
so thinking about
circumambulation

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.380
and the way in which the person
is bound to that community,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.950
and the sacred is made through
walking, and the paths that are

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.100
walked around this church.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.980
So this-- I think that
many of these maps

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.670
can be read as a
proffered covenant.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:58.930
We move forward as
Christian on these terms.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.060
And so here, you
have, for example,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.150
this royal lineage
that kind of grows out

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:11.830
of the church palace structure
in reference to that structure.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:19.210
So I'll just close by
saying that in kind

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.420
of tracing these two
Christian landscapes,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.480
distinct Christian
landscapes, one that projects

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.390
into the future, indigenous
Christianity into the future,

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.900
and one that suggests
that Christianity

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.490
is dead in any
form we would have

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:40.120
wanted, kind of delineating
those two trajectories.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.580
In thinking about the
collapse and the cataclysm,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:51.790
I have to say, and the way in
which this cataclysmic event

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.767
plays on both geological,
religious, cosmological,

00:45:55.767 --> 00:45:57.850
and cartographic registers--
it plays out on those

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:01.570
registers-- that in
thinking about it,

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.610
I thought a lot about
how I position myself

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.090
as a scholar in relation to
this cataclysm and in relation

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.830
to the dead.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.710
And I am moved by Edith
Wyschogrod and her thinking

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:16.120
about, her call to the
heterological historian.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.750
She writes, in writing
about the human death event,

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:23.980
before saying thus it was,
the heterological historian is

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.832
willing to pronounce the words,
it ought not to have been thus.

00:46:27.832 --> 00:46:29.110
So, thank you.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.460
