00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.860
Now that we have these expanded versions of our equations, I'd like you to use

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.570
them to find L2 minus L1. Now assuming you simplify this properly, your answer

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.640
should actually just be a number. When you find that number I'd like you to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.480
round it to the nearest integer. Your answer will be something that's measured

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.050
in decimals.
