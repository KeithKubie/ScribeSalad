00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is--you just cannot tell. It could be any of these.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It could be a line that I haven't even drawn.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The truth of the matter is longitude is in many ways completely arbitrary.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Right now the prime meridian or 0Â° longitude line passes through Greenwich, England.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In the past, it's passed through Rome; Florence, Italy; Paris, France; Stockholm Sweden

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and many, many other locations.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The fact that this line is so arbitrary, actually hints that how difficult longitude in general

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is to calculate.especially when you're at sea.
