00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
And at first, I want you and me to derive this

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.316
mathematically and it is challenging if you don’t

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:10.501
like calculus, you can skip over it. So feel free to

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.038
skip. If you skip, no one is ever going to know

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:16.420
and I promise you derivation is not essential for

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.643
using this formula over here. You can use

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.907
entirely without understanding why it’s correct.

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:25.321
But if you stick with me, you get a sense of how

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.916
statistics really works as a scientific discipline.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:31.199
So it’s a glimpse into the beauty of more

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.995
advanced statistics. So last chance, you’re going

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:36.796
to skip? Hey, thanks for staying on.

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:39.147
So here’s my quiz and it looks complicated but

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:41.672
let me explain it to you. I better derive for you

00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:44.090
the desired equation on here which is the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.327
maximum likelihood estimator all the way from

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:49.142
the definition of the probability of the data. You

00:00:49.142 --> 00:00:52.329
might remember data is comprised of XIs where

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.028
each XI is 1 one for heads and zero for tails.

00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:58.987
And of course, P is the desired probability of

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:01.973
heads. I left open the derivation, however, nine

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:04.799
steps or where these nine bars that will turn into

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.424
boxes very soon, and what you have to do is

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.474
you have to pick from the 13 choices over here,

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.475
the ones that fit best. There is always a unique

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:14.024
answer and you can only use each of the things

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:16.373
on the right side once. So there will be four

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:19.454
things left, 13 minus 9, that you’ve never used.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.200
So for example, if you believe that the right

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.372
answer over here is PN, then you’re going to

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:27.356
type 6 into the box over here and PN is now

00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:30.604
used, you can't write 6 anywhere else. So good

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:34.170
luck with this. The way the proof works is by first

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.641
taking the logarithm of this expression over here,

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:39.388
this ends up over here and we said the first

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:41.038
derivative is zero. So you have to complete the

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.236
first derivative and plug in here and then you

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.427
have to transform it all the way until you achieve

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:49.427
the final result. Good luck.
