00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.004
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
SCANDAL IN THE WIND.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:11.211
SCANDAL IN THE WIND.

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:12.613
JON WAS MAKING FUN OF BERNIE
SANDERS AT THE COMMERCIAL

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:16.149
BREAK.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.118
&gt;&gt; GIVE ME ALL THE POINTS.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.487
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR,
JUST BECAUSE I GARGLE WITH

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.458
MILK DUDS, TO MAKE FUN OF MY
VOICE.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.093
AND SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP THE
POINTS I DO WANT TO POINT

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.629
OUT I'M BEHIND ON THE SCORE
NATIONALLY BUT IN NEW

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:33.000
HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA I AM
AHEAD ON POINTS.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.501
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.370
&gt;&gt; Chris: THAT'S GOOD.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.971
YOU HAVE GOOD POINTS.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.040
MOVING ON, SINCE THE ADVENT
OF PHOTOGRAPHY POLITICIANS

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.875
HAVE BEEN GETTING CAUGHT IN
SCANDALOUS SITUATIONS

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.680
LIKE THIS SHAMEFUL PHOTO OF
MARTIN VAN BUREN.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.551
HE HAD GLAUCOMA, DON'T
JUDGE.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:54.821
BUT BY TALKING YOUR WAY OUT
OF TROUBLE-- WHAT ARE YOU-- WAIT

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.824
BERNIE, COME HERE A SECOND,
BERNIE, COME HERE.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.426
BERNIE SANDERS.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.928
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON, FOLKS.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.064
I THINK, THERE IS A
RESEMBLANCE HERE.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:04.932
&gt;&gt;WHOA.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.333
&gt;&gt;WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.034
I DON'T SEE IT.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:13.207
&gt;&gt; Chris: ARE YOU--
(APPLAUSE)

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.108
ARE YOU-- WAIT A MINUTE.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.177
&gt;&gt; I HAVE JUST ENOUGH HAIR
AND I'M ALSO EXACTLY BALD

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.746
ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.614
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.317
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.056
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Chris: TALKING YOUR WAY

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.491
OUT OF TROUBLE IS A
POLITICAL TRADITION.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.126
SO WE HAD OUR @MIDNIGHT
PAPARAZZI CATCH A FEW

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.330
CANDIDATES IN COMPROMISING
POSITIONS AND OUR PANEL WILL

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.632
DO THEIR DAMAGE CONTROL. FOR
250 POINTS PUT A POSITIVE

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.869
SPIN ON THESE RATHER
SALACIOUS PICTURES.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.670
HEATHER, WE WILL START WITH YOU.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:48.242
YOU WILL BE HILLARY
CLINTON'S SPIN DOCTOR HERE.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.843
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE?

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:52.279
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, AS HILLARY'S
PR HERE I WANT TO SAY THE

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.548
TATTOO WASN'T FINISHED. IT IS
SUPPOSED TO SAY

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.919
"NICKELBACK RULES: RULE #1, NO
NICKELBACK."

00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.586
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.621
SO IT WAS JUST NOT DONE YET.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:01.488
&gt;&gt; YEAH, NOT DONE.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:06.593
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, POINTS.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.463
BUT HILLARY DIDN'T STOP WITH
GETTING INK, SHE ALSO WAS --

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.698
THERE.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:12.699
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:13.433
&gt;&gt; Chris: EXACTLY.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.836
HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS
ONE?

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.071
&gt;&gt; WELL, TO BE FAIR, PUTIN
WANTED BAREBACK AND SHE

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:24.044
TALKED HIM DOWN TO HORSEBACK.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:29.216
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.717
WELL DONE, HEATHER ANNE
CAMPBELL. YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.119
NAVIGATED A LOT OF
SCANDALS FOR HILLARY

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.220
CLINTON.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.689
JON DALY, YOU WILL BE TAKING THE
ROLE OF SPIN DOCTOR ON

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:41.261
BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP. GOOD
[BLEEP] LUCK.

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:42.896
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN
WHAT MR. TRUMP WAS UP TO

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.333
HERE, JON DALY, HUH?

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.836
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT
THAT?

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.871
&gt;&gt; THIS LOOKS BAD BUT AS WE'VE
COVERED, MR. TRUMP HAS HAD

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.941
TROUBLE WITH HIS BUSINESSES.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.343
AND ACTUALLY IN THIS HE WAS
JUST LOOKING FOR A CHEAP WAY

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.078
TO DEMOLISH TWO CASINOS.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:02.015
&gt;&gt; Chris: NO!

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.954
&gt;&gt; OH YEAH.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.288
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:09.756
&gt;&gt; Chris: BERNIE SANDERS YOU
ARE UP NEXT.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.258
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU WERE CAUGHT
DOING.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.526
WHAT'S THIS BUSINESS?

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:17.097
WHAT IS THAT?

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.499
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S
HAPPENING

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.135
AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.104
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH SHARING A BATHTUB WITH

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.639
GUY FIERI.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.442
TWO MEN BATHING TOGETHER IS
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.310
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WATER
CRISIS.

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:33.814
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:36.817
&gt;&gt; AND THAT IS ORGANIC
VERMONT SYRUP THAT WE'RE

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.585
DRINKING.

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.821
&gt;&gt; Chris: OH YOU'RE DOING SYRUP
SHOTS, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.123
NEXT ONE, NEXT ONE.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.158
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE,
BERNIE SANDERS?

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.493
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I AM PROUD OF THAT.

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:48.495
I DON'T HIDE THAT FROM MY
RECORD.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.565
I'M PROUD OF THAT BECAUSE I
THINK THAT ALL WORKERS

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:55.669
DESERVE A LIVING WAGE.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.972
I FOUGHT FOR THAT.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:05.646
AND ALSO WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL
PAY WITH MEN!

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.348
AND ALSO IF YOU SIMPLY TALK
IN THIS CADENCE AND POINT

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:11.051
YOUR FINGER IN A CERTAIN WAY
YOU WILL FORCE AN AUDIENCE

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:17.457
TO APPLAUD AT A CERTAIN PERIOD
OF TIME.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:17.558
&gt;&gt; Chris: HE'S REALLY GOOD.
