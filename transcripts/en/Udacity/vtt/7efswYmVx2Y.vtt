00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.085
For this exercise you'll start with a fragment sheeter that performs diffuse

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:06.340
sliding per pixel. I've hooked up a uniform called uBorder to the user

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.261
interface. Change the program to instead compute the diffuse component as

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:16.633
follows. If the dot project is greater than uBorder, then diffuse is 1.0. Else,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.531
diffuse is 0.5. Make sure to use floating point number and don't leave off the

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:24.800
point 0 in 1.0. When you get this new code in place, it should look like this.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.532
Once you have the solution, try the border slider, and see the effect. If

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:31.568
nothing for negative values of border, you might want to think about the effect

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:33.229
of the max function.
