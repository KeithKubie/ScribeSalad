everyone, good morning.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.910
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.210
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington: Good
morning, [laughs] good morning.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.700
We are so happy that
you all are here.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.000
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.360
Welcome to the 2016
National Book Festival

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180
in the Poetry and Prose Pavilion.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.220
This pavilion is sponsored by the
National Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.180
our nation's arts agency.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.350
And the NEA we are currently
celebrating our 50th anniversary.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.840
So we are celebrating years of
giving Americans the opportunity

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.120
to participate in the arts,
exercise their imaginations,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.450
and develop their creative
capacities.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.820 position:56%
On behalf of everyone at the Arts
Endowment, thank you for joining us.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.130
I'm Eleanor Billington.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.380
I manage the Poetry Out Loud
Program at the Arts Endowment.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.240
Poetry Out Loud is a national
youth arts program that seeks

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.760
to foster the next generation of
literary readers by capitalizing

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.510
on the latest trends in poetry,
recitation and performance.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.830
Poetry Out Loud encourages
high school students to learn

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.890
about classic and contemporary
poetry

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.670
through memorization
and public recitation.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.070
Started in 2005 as a partnership
between the National Endowment

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.900
for the Arts, the Poetry
Foundation, Chicago, and 53 state

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.960
and jurisdictional art agencies,
Poetry Out Loud has grown

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.720
to serve more than three million
students and 45,000 teachers

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.390
at 10,000 high schools nationwide.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.170
We are really proud of its growth.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.420
The program helps students
master public speaking skills,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.000
and build self confidence.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.060
But most importantly, it helps them
discover their own creative voice.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.400
If poetry recitation sounds
a little bit dry to you,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.090
I promise that in a few minutes,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.080
you're going to see firsthand
the power of a poem spoken aloud.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.360
A little bit about the way
the program is structured;

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.660
we use a pyramid structure,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.220
so it's a lot like the
National Spelling Bee.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.430
Poetry Out Loud starts
at the classroom level.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.300
Winners in the classroom then
advance to a school competition,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.940
then to a state and regional
competition, and ultimately,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.580
they come to the national finals,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.070
which is held in Washington,
DC each spring.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.310
If you're an interested high
school student in the audience,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.660
talk with your teachers
about Poetry Out Loud.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.230
And if you're an interested high
school teacher in the audience,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.600
please consider taking on
Poetry Out Loud this year.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.250
It is not too late to get involved.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.010
We have information on the side
of the room about the program,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.360
so come talk to me or anyone at
that table after our session.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.530
We also have a great website
dedicated to the program.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.360
I know everybody has
smart phones now.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.460
So if you go to poetryoutloud.org,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.060
you can see the website includes
more than 900 eligible poems.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330
We have video recitations,
we have many of the students

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.850
on the stage featured
on that website.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.200
We also have a comprehensive
teachers guide,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.190
all free and available to you.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.130
We have -- again that
information is over here.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.730
So visit the table when we're done.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.830
Last year we had more than
315,000 students participate

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.130
in Poetry Out Loud.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.460
And today you're going to hear
from three of the state champions

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.080
who made it all the way
to the national finals.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.940
Poetry Out Loud students are
eligible for prizes at the state

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.660
and national level of competition,
including a $20,000 prize

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.050
for the national champion.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.200
Every year, Poetry Out Loud awards
more that $100,000 in prizes

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.520
and school stipends for the
purchase of poetry materials.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.010
While a $20,000 prize
is nothing to scoff at,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.110
we believe that the
real reward comes

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.590
when students connect their poems
to their own life experience.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.190
A successful poem can
challenge us, teach us,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.890
and invite us to view
our world anew.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.640
In the words of poet Naomi Shihab
Nye, "I love the deep attribution

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.760
of poetry to pause, to look,
to listen, to pay attention

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.820 position:56%
to variety, to learn something new."

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.140 position:56%
This morning we have the opportunity
to slow down and really listen

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.190
to these students, to honor
their work with our attention,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.560 position:56%
and to open ourselves to learning
from them and the poems they embody.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.080
So with that said, we're
going to get started.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.680
Our first student is Nealy Seams.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.940
Nealy is the 2016 Poetry Out Loud
state champion from West Virginia.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.270
She was one of the top
nine national finalists

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.650
at this year's competition in DC.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.590
She's a recent graduate of
Greenbrier East High School,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.790 position:56%
and is attending Marshall University
in Huntington, West Virginia,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.310
where she studies theater.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.510
Please join me in welcoming
Nealy to the podium.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.680
[ Applause ]

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.300
&gt;&gt; Being in a competition
like Poetry Out Loud seems

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.150
like it would be a lonely
experience to those looking in.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.710
But it's not.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.090 position:56%
Sure, you're up onstage by yourself,
but whenever you're backstage,

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.510
you're making friends with people
who think the same way you do,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.200
and like the same things,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.960 position:56%
and are feeling the exact same thing
you are at the exact same time.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.510
Especially at the national level,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.860
you can broaden your
outlook on life.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.760
It's a microcosm of the
diversity of America,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.710
and it's at your fingertips.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.580
Relating to the poems, and
the audience, and your peers

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.930
that you're meeting is
a beautiful experience,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.770
and it widens your outlook on life.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.130
And that's the biggest thing

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.340
that I've taken away
from Poetry Out Loud.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.610
I will be doing two poems.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.510 position:56%
My first one called "Degrees of Gray
in Philipsburg" by Richard Hugo.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.240

Sunday on a whim.

Say your life broke down.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.760
The last good kiss
you had was years ago.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.090
You walk these streets laid
out by the insane past,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.330
hotels that didn't last, bars
that did, the tortured try

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.650
of local drivers to
accelerate their lives.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.630
Only churches are kept up.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.870
The jail turned 70 this year.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.550
The only prisoner is always
in, not knowing what he's done.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.180
The principle supporting
business now is rage,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.050
hatred of the various grays the
mountain sends, hatred of the mill,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.380
the Silver Bill repeal,
the best liked girls

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.320
who leave each year for Butte.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.570
One good restaurant and bars
can't wipe the boredom out.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:14.000
The 1907 boom, eight going
silver mines, a dance floor built

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.020
on springs, all memory
resolves itself in gaze,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.090
in panoramic green you know the
cattle eat, or two stacks high

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.740
above the town, two dead kilns, the
huge mill in collapse for 50 years

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.440
that won't fall finally down.

Isn't this your life, that ancient
kiss still burning out your eyes?

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.600
Isn't this defeat so accurate,

the church bell simply seems a pure
announcement, ring and no one comes?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.160
Don't empty houses ring?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.140
Are magnesium and scorn
sufficient to support a town,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.150
not just Philipsburg, but towns
of towering blondes, good jazz

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.440
and booze the world
will never let you have

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.210
until the town you
came from dies inside?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.790
Say no to yourself.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.180
The old man, 20 when the
jail was built, still laughs,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.040
although his lips collapse.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.210
'Someday soon,' he says, 'I'll
go to sleep and not wake up.'

You tell him, 'No; you're
talking to yourself.'

you here still runs.

And the money you buy lunch with, no
matter where it's mined, is silver.

your food is slender

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.510
and her red hair lights the wall'."

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.580
And my second poem is called
"Passing" by Toi Derricotte.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.410
"A professor invites me
to his 'Black Lit' class;

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.220
they're reading Larson's 'Passing'.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.190
One of the black students says,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.340
'Sometimes light-skinned blacks
think they can fool other blacks,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.020
but I can always tell,'
looking right through me.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.380
After I tell them I am black,
I ask the class, 'Was I passing

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.260
when I was just sitting
here before I told you?'

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.420
A white woman shakes
her head desperately,

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.300
as if I had deliberately
deceived her.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.230
She keeps examining my
face, then turning away

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.660
as if she hopes I'll disappear.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.940
Why presume passing is
based on what I leave out,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.290
and not what she fills in?

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:59.270
In one scene in the book, in
a restaurant, she's 'passing'.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:05.540
Though no one checked her at
the door, 'Hey, are you black?'

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.110
My father, who looked
white, told me this story.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.200
Every year when he'd go to
get his driver's license,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.230 position:56%
the man at the window filling out
the form would ask, 'White or black,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:29.920
My father wouldn't pass, but he
might use silence to trap a devil.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.440
When he didn't speak, the man
would look up at my father's face.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.950
'What did he write,'
my father quizzed me."

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.630
with an emphasis in songwriting.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.430
Welcome, Marta.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.690
[ Applause ]

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.180
&gt;&gt; I memorized my poem, but I
did not memorize my statement,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.850
so [laughs] hello, everyone.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.190
It's such an honor to be here
representing Georgia one more time,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.560
you know, at the Georgia Poetry Out
Loud at the National Book Festival,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.170
and to get to recite
alongside my fellow competitors

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.670
from earlier this year.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.380
So winning second place at the 2016
competition was such a wonderful,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.510
indescribable experience.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.400
I remember being amazing at how
nice and welcoming everyone was.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.130
And, you know, we were all
supportive of each other.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.810
And I remember telling jokes
and dancing around backstage

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.920
because we were so nervous;
[laughter] so as we were waiting

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.970
for our names to be called.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.210
And most of all, I remember, you
know, walking out onstage time

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.650
after time, just hoping that
reciting my poems as best

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.950
as I could would be enough.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.250
And apparently, it was.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.900
So it was amazing, but however
magical it was to be onstage,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.700
I think one of the most memorable
parts was the after-party,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.480
not because it meant that
the competition was over,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.090
but on the contrary, it gave us
a new place to begin, you know?

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.860
It was wonderful.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.800
I sang a snippet of
a song that I ended

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.850
up releasing just a
month ago on my first EP.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.050
I heard original poetry that
left me absolutely awestruck just

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.190
at the capacity of feeling what
I was witnessing in that room.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.280
You know, I heard monologues,
and poetry,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.840
and singing, and more poetry.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.780
And at one point, there was
some beat-boxing going on.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:57.430
I'm not entirely sure; am I right;
and, of course, more poetry.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.030
But it wasn't just a celebration
of what had come to pass,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.910 position:56%
it was a celebration of everything
that we had learned from each other.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.200
It was a final moment to let our
walls down and share our passion,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.170
creativity, and experience
this time not for competition,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.560 position:56%
but for no other reason than that we
wanted to share what we had created

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.870
with people that we knew
would appreciate it,

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.580
and we knew would love us for it.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.600
So the poems I'm reciting
today are the two poems

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.580
that got me into the final three.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.180
"For The Young who Want To" by
Marge Piercy is especially relevant

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.500
in my life, seeing
as an artist myself,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.630
I kind of encounter
this situation a lot.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.130
And "Mingus at the
Showplace", on the other hand,

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.150
holds a special place in my heart.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.710
It takes a while to understand,
analyze and fully appreciate,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.100
but when you do, it's
really impossible to forget.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.650
So without further adieu, I will
be performing, "For The Young

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.510
Who Want To" by Marge Piercy.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.260
[ Silence ]

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.770
"Talent is what they say you have

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.000
after the novel is published
and favorably reviewed.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.960
Beforehand what you have
is a tedious delusion,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.340
a hobby, like knitting.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.320
Work is what you have done
after the play is produced,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.130
and the audience claps.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.780
Before that friends keep asking

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.760
when you are planning
to go out and get a job.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.140
Genius is what they know you had

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.600
after the third volume
of remarkable poems.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.810
Earlier they accuse
you of withdrawing,

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:46.200
ask why you don't have
a baby, call you a bum.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:53.170
The reason people want MFAs,
take workshops with fancy names

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.170 position:56%
when all you can really learn is a
few techniques, typing instructions,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:02.780
and somebody else's mannerisms, is
that every artist lacks a license

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.620
to hang on the wall,
like your optician,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.170
your vet proving you may be a
clumsy sadist whose fillings fall

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.150
into the stew but you're
certified dentist.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:24.050
[Laughter] The real writer
is one who really writes.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:30.170
Talent is an invention like
phlogiston after the fact of fire.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.490
Work is its own cure.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.290
You have to like it
better than being loved."

[ Silence ]

00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:05.050
"I was miserable, of course, for I
was 17, and so I swung into action

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.880
and wrote a poem, and
it was miserable,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.520
for that was how I
thought poetry worked,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.170
you digested experience
and shat literature.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:24.710
It was 1960 at The Showplace, long
since defunct, on West 4th Street,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.480
and I sat at the bar, casting beer
money from a thin reel of ones,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.360
the kid in the city,
big ears like a puppy.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.570
And I knew Mingus was a genius.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.310
I knew two other things, but
they were wrong, as it happened.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.140
So I made him look at the poem.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.430
'There's a lot of that
going around,' he said.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.060
And Sweet Baby Jesus he was right.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.180
He laughed amiably.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.920
He didn't look as if he thought
bad poems were dangerous,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.380
the way some poets do.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.210
If they were baseball executives,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.610
they'd plot to destroy
sandlots everywhere

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.550
so that the game can
be saved from children.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.810
Of course later that night he
fired his pianist in mid-number

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.170
and flurried him from the stand.

in personnel,

who is also our Poetry
Out Loud national champion

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.740
for this year, Ahkei Togun.

Ahkei is a recent graduate of
the Governor School for the Arts

in Norfolk, Virginia, and he
just began, or is about to begin,

Musical and Dramatic Academy

will be studying acting.

Since becoming the Poetry Out

in the Poet's House Brooklyn Bridge
Poetry Walk in New York City,

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.410
and that the Governor of
Virginia over the summer.

International Storytelling Festival

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.480

&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.260
&gt;&gt; It's always a pleasure to
be onstage representing Poetry

Out Loud, whether it's a state
champion, national champion,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.160
or just starting off as nothing.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.570
When I first started Poetry Out
Loud, I was just a student trying

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.600
to get an A in my English class.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.960
[Laughter] But reading the poems
along the way sparked something

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.270
inside of me.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.070
I began to fall in love
with the thought of poetry,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.300
and how I connected with some
of the poems that I ran across.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.120
Excitement grew for the next time
I would be able to get onstage

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.210
and display this passion.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.700 position:56%
Three years of my high school career
consisted of me learning the ins

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.110
and outs of this thing
called "Poetry Out Loud".

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.280
Winning it all seemed like a dream.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.100
Thinking of it was like
watching the quarterback

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.130
of the winning Super Bowl team
hold up the trophy and say,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.950
"I'm going to Disneyland."

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.250
[Laughter] But when I
got the chance to hold

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.290
that trophy, I became speechless.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.880
The moment was so bittersweet.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.230
Because it wasn't just about
the title, it was about getting

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.760 position:56%
on the stage and doing what I loved.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.280
It was sharing life-changing
experiences with the poetic family

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.240
that I could never forget.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.080
These people made it so easy to
enjoy the moments offstage in order

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.020
to be ready for the moment onstage.

waiting to change the world.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.500

this competition has laid

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.850
out for us as artists.

I am Ahkei, but we
are Poetry Out Loud.

Today I will be reciting
two poems for you.

The first one is called

"Always Something More
Beautiful," by Stephen Dunn.

And this poem it really resonates
with like the cores of how Poetry

Out Loud goes, the race of
what Poetry Out Loud really is,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.510

as I begin to recite.

of the clock and the
underfooting and the other runners.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.610
Each of us would be
testing excellence

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.610
and endurance in the other runners.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:33.900 position:56%
Though in the past I'd often veer
off to follow some feral distraction

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:41.020 position:56%
down a side path, allowing myself to
pursue something odd or beautiful,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.350 position:56%
becoming acquainted with some of the
ways not to blame myself for failing

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:52.310
to succeed, I had come to believe
what's beautiful had more to do

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.720
with daring to take yourself
seriously, to stay the course,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.200
whatever the course might be.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.100
The guy in the front seemed
ready to fade, his long,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.850
graceful stride shortening
as I came up along his side.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.260
I was sure now I'd at
least exceed my best time.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.660
But the guy with the famous final
kick already had already begun

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.960
his move.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.920
"Beautiful," I heard a spectator
say, as if something inevitable,

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.140
again, coming from nowhere
was again on its way.

world where anything is possible

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.030
and I understand, also,
that one often has

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.250
to make do with what one has.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:23.440 position:56%
I have eaten pancakes, for instance,
with that clear corn syrup on them

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.480
because there was no maple syrup;
and they weren't very good.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.930
Well, anyway, this is different.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.970 position:56%
My man downfield is waving his arms.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.200
One has certain responsibilities,
one has to make choices.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.600
This isn't right and I'm
not going to throw it."

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.400
Thank you.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.340
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
Thank you, Ahkei.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.640
Thank you to all of
our students again.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.970 position:56%
I think they've earned another round
of applause, they're so amazing.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.770
[Laughs]

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:06.070
[ Applause ]

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.310
So we have a little bit of time
this morning for questions.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.660
So if you'd like to ask a
question, there are mics

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.960
on either side of the room.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.260
You can come up to the mic.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.970
If you're asking a question,
please do come to the mic

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.280
because we're recording all this,
and we want to get your question

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.780
for our audience that
is not in the room.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.170
So I have a couple, actually,
before we turn to the audience.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.540
And we'll just go in order,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.970
if you guys don't mind coming
to the podium to answer.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.550
So my first question is for Nealy.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.880
Nealy has been involved
in POL several years.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.480
You've been a state champion more
than one time in West Virginia.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.650
And so I just want to hear from
you, how did POL start for you?

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.950
What was your introduction to it?

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.600 position:56%
We know from Ahkei he was in English
class trying to get a good grade.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.900
[Laughter] But we want
to hear from you sort

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.200
of what your story is with POL.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000
How did you get involved?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.300
[ Silence ]

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:55.120
&gt;&gt; Well, I started out with
POL pretty unenthusiastically.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.800
I heard about it and I was like,
"Oh, maybe I want to do that."

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.240
So I went to my English teacher
and I expressed some interest.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.920
And then the next thing I know,

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.210
the next day in class,
it was an assignment.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.350
[Laughs] And so we
all picked out poems.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.880
And I won for the classroom.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.810
And then I didn't know when
the school competition was

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.670
until the day before.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:28.420
So the day of, I went crying to my
teacher, and I said, "I really --

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.780
I don't want to do this."

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.770
And she made me.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.620
[Laughs] And then I
won for the school.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.190
And then I went to states and
I didn't make it that far.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.770
But after being at states,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.800
that's whenever it really
ignited an interest.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.010
And I realized that there
was more on the Poetry

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:52.110
Out Loud anthology
than fire and ice.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.870
[Laughter] And it just, it
sparked this love of literature

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.260
and it sparked in me a love of
writing, which has carried on.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.960
So yes, that's how I got started.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.260
[Laughs]

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.560
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
Thank you, Nealy.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.260
We hear from a lot of students
that they love this program now.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.020
But when their teacher first said,
"You need to recite a poem in front

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.290
of the classroom,"
it's a scary thing.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.590
I remember doing it in high school.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.890
It's terrifying.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.190
You do it and you feel empowered.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.490
It's awesome once it happens.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.980
But it's hard at the beginning;
it takes a lot of courage.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.100
So Marta, my next question
is for you.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.990
You mentioned songwriting
and having an EP out.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.340
Is there a way that working on
Poetry Out Loud and learning poems

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.210 position:56%
by heart has influenced your
creative voices as you're, you know,

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.710
writing your own work
and that sort of thing?

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.510
How do the two relate to
one another, if they do?

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.600
[ Background Sounds ]

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.510
&gt;&gt; Well, they actually relate
a lot just because for me,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:55.230 position:56%
I recite poetry the way I would
sing a song, like mentally at least.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.550 position:56%
And it's funny because my literature
teacher never understands how I mark

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.060
my poems, because I write them
-- you know, I print them out

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.580
and then I mark through them like
I would mark a piece of music.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.730
So I have like okay, fortissimo
here, and then crescendo to this,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.000
and, you know, it's like I mark
everything like a piece of music.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.060
So honestly, I think my chorus
teacher would be more able

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.530
to tell what I'm trying
to do with the poem

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.010
than my literature teacher would.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.700
[Laughter] But so they really
do relate because, you know,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.570
whether the poems rhyme or
not, like a song, it's --

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.570
I think it all comes from
the same creative space.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.060
You know, it's telling a story.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.950
It's expressing something
within yourself

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.280
which is really all
that music is as well.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.840
And just because there's no actual
music to the poem doesn't mean

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.090
that you can't sing it in a way.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.600
So that's how it relates to me.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.400
[Laughs]

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.820

question is specifically for Ahkei.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.460
You're going to start school soon.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.400
You're at New York -- you're
going to be in New York City,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.360
and you're going to be
studying acting, correct?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.290
How does poetry relate to that?

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.370
Will it -- are you still going
to continue to read poetry?

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.940
Do you know you had a -- it's
hard to know before you started,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.240
but I'd like to hear a little bit

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.510
about what you expect
to do this fall; so yes.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.500
[ Silence ]

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.990
&gt;&gt; Well, I had been acting
way before I was introduced

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.290
to the poetry world.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.580
I had been acting since
I was like seven.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.130
So coming into poetry was like --

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.040
at first it was like reading
a bunch of like boring poems.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.920
It's like, "Oh, God,"
and everything's rhyming,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.080
"The cat in the hat,"
and this and that.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.680
[Laughter] But then it's like
finding those poems that you relate

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.380
to is just like finding a
monologue that you relate to,

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.310
or just like playing a
role that you relate to.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.370
It's kind of embracing that
story, which is what you do

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.300
when you're acting, and just
releasing it, and telling it

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.830
to the audience, which, again,
is basically what you do

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.420
as an actor is that's all
we do is tell stories.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.800
So it relates dynamically.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.270
Like it relates drastically
as an actor and poetry.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.980 position:56%
And it actually makes it much more
easier to understand the literature,

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.100
and know how to, like
work my way through it.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.680
So this fall, I do plan on
continuing with the poetry world.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.120
I do plan on doing some
more things up there

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.660
with organizations
and things like that.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.550
I'm also a spoken word
artist myself.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.270
So poetry is still a big
part of my life as well

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.510
as continuing with acting.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.650

one question for all the students.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.950
And then we'll open it up to see

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.430
if anybody here has
questions in the audience.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.900
We've talked a lot about picking
poems and how important it is

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.740
to have a poem that speaks to you,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.990
because otherwise there's
not something that resonates,

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.850
and it's harder to connect,
and especially know something

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.630
by heart and care about it.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.540
So how did you guys
choose your poems?

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.840
What was the process like for you?

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.840
I know some kids go through every
single poem in the anthology.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.110
We've spoken to some students
who have read 900 poems

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.990
or at least looked at
them, which is amazing.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.410
Not these guys, maybe.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.060
But yes, if you guys don't mind,
Nealy, we'll start with you

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.570
and we'll just maybe come up in a
little sort of little rolling roll.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.190
You go first.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.370
[ Silence ]

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.600
&gt;&gt; Well, you go on there
and there are so many poems

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.060
that it seems overwhelming.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.510
And for the most part,
I -- whenever I began,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.320
I just started picking
random letters on --

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.790
because it's alphabetized.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.680
And so I'd pick a random
letter, and I would look

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.870
through the poems on that letter.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:30.550 position:56%
Then as I got more involved, I would
find works that I found on my own

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.680
that I enjoyed and related to.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.830
And if it wasn't on the anthology,
I would go and find related works

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.820
that relate back to that poem.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.410
How I picked my poems this
year specifically, I --

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.740
with "Degrees of Gray," I
come from West Virginia,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.740
which is a coalmining state.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.160
And even though it takes place
outside of West Virginia,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.080
I know those towns that I talk
about in "Degrees of Gray".

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.140
And there's something
so personal about it.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:12.780 position:56%
And with "Passing", it was also very
personal where since I am biracial

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:19.180 position:56%
and I can pass, and that's something
that has always bothered me,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.600
but I've never been able
to put it into words.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.920
So after reading "Passing",
it was someone understands me,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.160
and now I can vocalize this.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.510
And that's how I picked
mine this year.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:37.500
[ Applause ]

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.740
&gt;&gt; Well, mine were mostly
by accident the first year.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.860
There's an option on the website
that says, "Find random poem."

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.780
[Laughs] And so basically because
I didn't want to have to go

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.280 position:56%
through the whole anthology, or like
go by letter and then be like, "Oh,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.580
I didn't check that letter.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.310
That's such a great poem,
why didn't I do that,"

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.930
I would just click
"random" and read it.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.470
If it didn't inspire me by
like the first couple lines,

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.600 position:56%
I'd be like, "No, next, next, next."

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.120
And so the first year, that's
really how I found those poems.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.600
It's just I kind of waited to see
something that would inspire me.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.300
And it's not that I stopped
doing that as I went on,

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.640 position:56%
because I've done it all four years.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:23.350
But by the time I got to the
year that took me to nationals,

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.640
"Mingus at the Showplace" had
been done by a girl in my school

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.130
who didn't advance, but
I just loved the poem.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.790
It was just so interesting.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.530
I didn't understand
it when she said it.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.220
And so that really
bothered me because I wanted

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.520
to be able to understand it.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.930
So I went and I looked
it up, and I read it,

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.560
and I read it, and I read it.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.420
And so that's how I decided,
"I'm going to do this."

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.500
"For the Young Who Want To"
was completely by accident,

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.310
just through the anthology
and I read it,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.110
and I was like, "This is awesome.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.410
I need to do this."

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.250
You know, I just -- I
understood it so well.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.460
And my first poem that I
didn't recite was "Echo".

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.310
And so that was -- I had come
across it a previous year,

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.720
and then I heard someone recite it.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.260
And I love Christina
Rossetti like as a poet.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.100
So I just -- I really wanted to do
something by her, and to be able

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.770
to kind of get into that mindset.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.000
So that's how I chose them,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.940
mostly by accident, and
some on purpose, so.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.740

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:24.040
[ Applause ]

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.760
&gt;&gt; That's exactly how I feel
about picking the poems.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.130
Like it is such a long process.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:34.820
It's like I had to dedicate
myself like to a whole night

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.120
of just picking out poems.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.010
It's literally like a
five-hour process for me.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.820
Because it's literally reading
through poems in the anthology,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.130
and it's like, "Oh, no, this
one is about a dog in a house.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.870
I don't have a dog so I don't
want to talk about that one."

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.010
But mostly I do it very
methodically, though.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.560
I always want to find like a
fun poem to do, because I feel

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.360
like you should have
fun with poetry,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.120
and I feel like that's what
a lot of people forget.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.230
They feel like -- again like
I said at first they felt

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.850
like it's just a bunch
of boring poems.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.420
But a lot of those poems on
there are actually really fun.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.800
And then again at the same
time, I like to find poems

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.100
that I really connect with.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.090
So it'll be those poems where I'm
like, "Oh, my God, this is me.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.390
This is me.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.690
I should have written this."

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.050
So those are the ones where
I'd probably be like, "Okay;

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.360
I want to do this one," because
it's easier to do and recite poems

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.980
that you actually relate to,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.230
but it is a long process
to pick a poem out.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.530
But yes, that's my process, though.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So why do you only choose through
the anthology; because Nealy, right,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.330
you said that you found something
that you liked, but you didn't --

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.910
you couldn't use it, and
then you had to like go

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.670
to the anthology and
see how it worked.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.220
Like why did you only
choose from the anthology?

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.360
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington: Do you -- I
can answer that as well as Nealy.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.000
Nealy had to choose
from the anthology.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.150
The way this program works is
we have an anthology online

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.980
of about 900 plus poems.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.470
And those are the poems that
the students can recite from.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.390
So those are the poems that
we've negotiated rights for,

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.060
they're the ones that are
included in our anthology.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.850 position:56%
And so every summer, we update that.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.090
So we're always looking for
suggestions from anyone.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.840
Students can suggest poems,
teachers, the general public.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.990
So during the summer, we go
through the whole anthology,

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.230
and we decide which
poems we're going to add,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.620
and how to negotiate rights for
that, and that kind of thing.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.940
So that's the way that it works.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.660
So if you guys have ideas and
if you want to email the NEA,

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.950
me in particular, we
accept ideas all year long.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.020
And then we look at the poem over
the summer -- I mean, excuse me,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.870
we look at the anthology over the
summer to add, you know, new poems.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.430
So yes Nealy, Ahkei, Marta, they
had to choose from that anthology.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.490
Oftentimes, a student will
say, "I love this poem.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.790
Why is it not in there?"

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.090
And they'll tell us
and we'll say, "Great,"

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.390
and we try to add it that summer.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.690
So that's how it works.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.990
Yes, yes, of course.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.290

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.930
Oh, right here.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.680

your poems?

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.980
Do you have a coach?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.280
Do you look in the mirror?

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.580

[Laughter] Yes;

do you recite to your
family, your pets?

Why don't we start
with Nealy, and yes.

&gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.630
So well first of all,
you just read it a lot.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.370
And if you have a poem that
you connect with, it's easier.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.170
It sounds magical and
weird to explain,

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.920
but there's something
behind clicking with it.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.660
You understand it.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.210
Then you go through and
you mark out what it means.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:42.520
You do research, you find out all
of the ins and outs of the poem.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.860
And then you just recite
it over and over again.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.340 position:56%
I work with my theater teacher, and
I do it for my parents all the time.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:55.120
I think they can recite all of my
poems as well, including my dog.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.790
So he gets really rambunctious.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.090
And sometimes it helps because it
helps me deal with distractions

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.790
that might happen in the audience.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:08.640
So as he's like freaking out,
I -- it makes me focus more.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.900
So it's just repetition and
understanding is how I do it.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.100
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
Marta or Ahkei,

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.500
do you guys want to
speak to that too?

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.800
Yes.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.100

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.400
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington: Okay.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.700
&gt;&gt; I -- it's repetition, like she
said, it really is repetition.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.000
I mean, you sit there, you
print it out, and you just --

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.880
you kind of read it
the first couple times.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.980
And then you're like, "Okay; I'm
going to recite the first stanza.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.930
Crap, what was the word, you know?

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.860
And you're just kind of,
like -- it's just, you know,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.360
you have to like get into it.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.030
And so you kind of just go
stanza by stanza is what I do.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.960
And then once I feel like
I have it memorized enough,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.650 position:56%
maybe not to recite it right off the
bat, but to remember it slowly piece

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.370
by piece, and even if I have
to pause and be like, "Okay;

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.460
and the next line rhymes with
this word, so it's this."

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.910
I write it down, because
it really helps me.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.560
I heard a rumor one time
that before you play shows,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.760
if you write down your lyrics,
you remember them better.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.820
And so that's what I've
been doing for my shows.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.220
And I decided, "Why not do
it with poetry as well?"

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.040
And it actually really works
because there's something

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.890
about your handwriting and
seeing the words come out slowly

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.520
as you're -- you know, not
that you're speaking them,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.990
but you're just writing
them out yourself.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.910
There's something that really
helps me remember in that.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.640

going over the poem,
going over the poem.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.080
I take it line by line.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.610
It's kind of also like doing a
research paper, I look up the words

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.800
that I don't know, and make
sure I know what they are.

And then it's like if I can say it
really fast, I know I know the poem.

really elaborate.

the poems that you actually connect

recite because it's basically

of the poems that I didn't pick out.

I started Poetry Out Loud,

my librarians were
like, "Oh, you're a guy,

so let's throw you a sports poem."

to do with football.

was fun in poetry.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.340
So the audience really loved
it every time I did it.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.960
So it was just one of those poems
that like it took me a long way,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.520
and it was just enjoyable to do.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.820
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington: [Inaudible].

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.230
Over here, go ahead.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.790
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Kennedy.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.070
And my question is, "What was your
inspiration for all of your poems?"

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.370
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
That's a great question.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.050
What was your inspiration for
reciting and how you chose them?

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.420
Nealy, do you want to start?

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.260
You always have to
start [inaudible].

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.560
&gt;&gt; I can start.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.990
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
Marta, go for it.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.340
[Laughter]

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.920
&gt;&gt; So for -- the easiest one to
say is "For the Young Who Want To",

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.900
because obviously, you know, as --
you know, when I tell people like,

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.710
"Oh, you know, I study
music," they're like,

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.010
"What are you majoring in?"

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.250
I'm like, "Music," you
know, like it's a study.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.710
[Laughs] So, you know, I've
gotten that question a few times.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.090
And so it's funny because I
read this poem, and it was like,

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.520
you know, "For the young who
want to be artists, you know,

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.920
you have to work at your art.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.080
And there are going to be people
that are like, 'Are you going

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.680
to get a job'," you
know, like, "Okay."

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.890
So my inspiration for
that was really kind

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.960
of just I really understood
what they were talking about.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.060
And I was like, "I want to do this
because it really is good advice."

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.110
You know, talent is an
invention you have to work at it.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.560
So I thought it was really
great advice for myself.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.490
And I wanted to share it because I
knew that I'd be in a room full of,

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.220
you know, writers,
artists, poets, everything.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.770
So I just felt like I
really needed it to be said.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:12.110
"Mingus at the Showplace" --
there's just this element of,

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.720
like childish wonder to it that
I really loved because, you know,

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.520
this -- and it's -- there's
also so much uncertainty.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.900
You know, this kid
like worships Mingus.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.270
And, you know, Mingus
is just this kind

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.520
of this larger than life person.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.530
And then, you know, at
the end, he's, you know,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.780
dismissing his staff and, you
know, just a normal human being.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.390
And you get to kind of see
a little aspect of that.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.710
And I really loved
that about, you know,

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.490
this kid who thinks he's
got it all figured out.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:41.660
He's like, "Oh, I'm 17 and I'm
so miserable," and, you know,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.780
"I suck at writing poetry,"
you know, just stuff like that.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.080
So there's really so many
little aspects to it.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.380
And I loved that the poem itself
never really completed any

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.510
of those aspects, it just
left you figure to them

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.860
as the kid himself
is figuring them out.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.740
So I really loved that about it.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.530
And I, again, felt like
it needed to be said.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:04.530
So really the inspiration for
reciting is more just when you feel

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.720
that something needs to be
shared with other people,

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.330
and when you love it because you
feel like you can just say it.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.310
And I think that's really
what most of the inspiration

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.510
for reciting comes from, so.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:20.790
[ Background Sounds ]

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:26.590
&gt;&gt; Well, like I said, where I came
from helped with "Degrees of Gray",

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.690
and who I am helped
inspire me for "Passing".

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:36.190
But what keeps me reciting, and
what keeps me interested is there's

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.780
personal growth that happens
every time you read a poem.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.770
And then a little bit more
happens whenever you memorize it.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.120
And then whenever you get to
share it with other people,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.840
you learn about literature,
and you learn about yourself.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.500
Sometimes I read a
poem, and I just have

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.600 position:56%
to ask myself, "Why do I like this?"

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.130
And so I learn more about
myself with other people's work.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:04.700
And it gives me new ways to relate
to myself and to other people.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.120
And you find out about so many
different aspects of the world

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.500
and views every time
you read a new poem.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.510
So that's why I keep reciting,
and keep reading poetry.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:21.500
[ Silence ]

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.740
&gt;&gt; My inspiration goes
back to, of course,

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.990
the poems that we connect to.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.390
It's one of those things -- and
I believe Nealy said it earlier,

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.790
she said it's like the
things that you want to say,

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.490
but you don't know how
to put it into words,

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.890
and it's all right there in a poem.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.010
So it's like one of those things
where it's like you can't wait

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.300
to really express that
part of yourself.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.640
You want to get that
story out of you.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.270
One of my favorite poems that I
did during the competition was

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.760
"I'm A Fool To Love
You" by Cornelius Eady.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.330
And it actually -- that's one of
the poems that set my mom in tears,

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:57.860
because it has a lot to do with
what my mother went through as far

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.310
as like falling in love, no,
that's not the right one.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.680
And then this other guy
isn't so good as well.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.280
And it's like basically that.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.760
And it's just like those
moments where I can get onstage

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.800
and tell stories of
what actually happened

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.510
to me is what keeps me going,
and keeps me inspired by it.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:21.070
[ Silence ]

Thank you all the --

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.670
ooh, hard to follow these students.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.970
We have time for one more question.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.270
Would you like to go ahead, sir?

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.790
&gt;&gt; Yes. My question is that is
there any tips for parents in terms

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.690
of trying to motivate
their sons and daughters,

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:36.620
especially my 14-year-old daughter,
who's more involved and engaged

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.880
with her iPhone than, you know,
reading the written poetry?

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.280
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Billington:
That is a great question.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.610
I cannot speak to that.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.910
I have a six-month-old baby,

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.460
and so she does exactly what
I tell her to right now.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.760
[Laughter] But I'm wondering --

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.570
and I don't want to put anyone on
the spot here, but do you mind?

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.510
So this is Ahkei's mother, and
she might have some -- yes.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:43:01.780
[ Applause ]

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.600
&gt;&gt; I will just say that I am so --
anytime I have the opportunities

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.860
to say it, I want to do that, I
am so very, very proud of my son

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.160
and what he has accomplished.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.320
I love him so very much, and I'm
proud of you two as well, ladies.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.060
We've had a tremendous time during
our experience in Poetry Out Loud.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.310
Ahkei has been on the stage
since he was about seven,

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.020
and my biggest thing
in terms of him --

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.850
being able to do what it
is that he really loved was

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.640
to find the outlet
and to nurture it.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.260
I have a son that plays football,
and I thought he was going

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.920
to say that's why he
picked "Football".

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.550
[Laughs] But I have a
son that plays football,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.790
and he was very good as an athlete.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.140
And I remember Ahkei being on the
football field, and his stepdad

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.610
and I sitting on the
sidelines like, "No.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.980 position:56%
No; you're suppose to tackle the guy

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.990
with the ball," and
he was like, "Hey."

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:02.290
So but it's those moments when
you realize that as parent,

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.470
it is your responsibility
to push kids

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.180
and to nurture the
gift that's in them.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.320
And they don't have
to be like other kids.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.310
And Ahkei said to me one time,
"I wanted to hide the fact

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.790
that I was a poet because
no one else was doing it,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.260
and it didn't seem like
the right thing to do."

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.750
He felt like he had
to be an athlete.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.310
And so then I knew it was my
job to pull that out of him.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.540
And so he participated in programs

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.950
that nurtured the gift
and pushed him.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.650
And I have always, and will
continue to be his number one fan.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:36.020
So if I had to give any
advice, nurture the gift,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.510
and always be on the sidelines
as their number one fan.
