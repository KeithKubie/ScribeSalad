00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.980
So let's dig a little deeper into

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.450
what we mean by the Happened Before Relationship.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.270
I'm going to denote the Happened Before Relationship

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.500
with this arrow. A happened before B. That's

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.660
what this notation means. What this notation is implying is one of two things,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.370
either A and B are events in the same process which means given a belief that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.750
a process is sequential A must have happened before

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.570
B. If it was a textual order A is here

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.560
and B is here then A must have happened

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.680
before B and that's one possibility. Or if you're asserting

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.640
that A happened before B and A and B are not events on the same process but A is

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
an event in one process, B is an event in

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.706
a different process. Then there must be a communication event

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:55.360
that connects A and B. In other words, if A is a communication event of a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.710
message, and B is a receipt of that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.800
same message. Then, A happened before B, where

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.660
A is the sender of the message and B is the receiver of the message. So,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.210
this is the implication of saying that an

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.150
event in a distributed system A happened before B,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.860
and these events can be anywhere in the system.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.000
Anywhere in the system an event could be happening

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.750
A, and another event could be happening B, and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.450
if we are asserting that A happened before B, what

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.640
we are implying is one of these two possibilities.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.550
One is that A and B are events in the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.850
same process or A is the act of a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.160
sending a message and B is the act of receiving

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.640
a mess, the same message on a different

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.450
node of the distributed system. The other property

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.560
of the happened before relationship is that it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.290
is transitive. What I mean by that is,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.040
if we're asserting that there is an event

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.300
A that happened before B. And this event

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.970
B happened before C. The implication is this

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.080
relationship is transitive ad therefore A happened before C.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.990
So that's the transitivity of the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.710
Happened Before Relationship. Now that I introduced

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.410
to you the Happened Before Relationship it is time for another fun quiz.
