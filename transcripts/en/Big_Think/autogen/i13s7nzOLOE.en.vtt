sex partner is going to lead to
 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.380
sex partner is going to lead to
resentment discomfort whatever it's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
resentment discomfort whatever it's
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.350

going to lead to a diminishment of

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360
going to lead to a diminishment of
 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.569
going to lead to a diminishment of
passion certainly so we start with that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
passion certainly so we start with that
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.180
passion certainly so we start with that
and then we add to that the the notion

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
and then we add to that the the notion
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.569
and then we add to that the the notion
that were taught that that shouldn't

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
that were taught that that shouldn't
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580
that were taught that that shouldn't
happen that if it does happen there's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
happen that if it does happen there's
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.750
happen that if it does happen there's
something wrong with you or something

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
something wrong with you or something
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209
something wrong with you or something
wrong with your relationship and so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
wrong with your relationship and so
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709
wrong with your relationship and so
people aren't expecting that to happen

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
people aren't expecting that to happen
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689
people aren't expecting that to happen
and so they interpret that diminishment

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
and so they interpret that diminishment
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.110
and so they interpret that diminishment
of passion as a failure the point that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
of passion as a failure the point that
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.520
of passion as a failure the point that
