[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:12.330
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.830
Three, two, one, action,
you're supposed

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.345
to say, aren't you?

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:15.595
Action.

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:17.730
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.540
I'm Paul Wilkinson,
and I'm 68.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.090
I was born with AKU, and I was
diagnosed at 16, and I was

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.570
referred to a London hospital.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.600
I'll tell you how
I describe it.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.830
AKU is a genetic metabolic
disease.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.100
The body can't deal
with protein.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.140
It turns the protein into
homogenic acid, and the acid

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.510
eats the cartilage away.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.410
I understand it's linked
to chromosome 3.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.930
Patients with alkaptonuria, or
AKU, have trouble breaking

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680
down protein, and this leads
to the harmful buildup of a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.660
compound called homogentisic
acid.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.880
It is a recessive genetic
disease associated with a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.690
defective gene on
chromosome 3.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.110
So in order to get AKU, patients
must inherit two

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.390
copies of this faulty gene,
one from their mum and one

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.730
from their dad.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.070
This makes it a very
rare disease

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770
So they're born with
the condition.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.930
So therefore, all you can see
initially is just dark urine.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.970
By around the age of 25 to 30,
they start to get back pain.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.710
They start to get discoloration
of the ears.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.390
And progressively, over time,
the knees and the hips, all

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.280
the joints of the body
start to become

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.880
involved in this process.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.490
I'm Professor Ranganath.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.320
I'm a consultant at the Royal
Liverpool University Hospital.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.530
And I'm the clinical director
of the National Alkaptonuria

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.840
Centre in Liverpool.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.450
Funded by the Department
of Health, the National

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.690
Alkaptonuria Centre opened in
June 2012, and for the first

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.230
time brings together a team of
specialists to help treat and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.600
monitor AKU patients.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.490
So we quickly realised that
people with alkaptonuria have

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.520
problems walking.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.670
Mobility is impaired
significantly in patients.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.910
And that is a hugely important
issue for quality of life.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.990
In my 30s, my back of my neck
was the first thing that began

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.840
to get very stiff,
very painful.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.380
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.750
And then, within a very short
while after that, one of my

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.620
hips virtually went in a
matter of months, just

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.090
crumbled away.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.480
The cartilage gets brittle,
and it breaks up, and over

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.750
time leads to pretty much the
damage of the whole joint.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.530
And the ultimate treatment
that's all the rage is joint

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.420
replacement.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.460
The National Alkaptonuria Centre
are now collaborating

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.740
with the Liverpool John Moores
University to analyse gait

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.320
impairments in AKU patients.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.050
Because the joints undergo this
kind of degradation, the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.810
inevitable effect of that is
that the way the person moves

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.910
will be affected.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.590
So what we've been doing here
today is called "clinical gait

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.870
analysis." It's basically the
scientific method of measuring

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.590
how we walk.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.360
I've been walking up and down
with these markers on my legs

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.860
so that, I think, they can
analyse my walking method,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.050
what's good, what's bad.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.120
We analyse it scientifically.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.930
We can then pinpoint which
joints are damaged and what

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.690
mechanism might be affecting
mobility in these patients.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.030
From his gait, we can see if
he's making any compensations.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.580
Obviously pain is one of the
biggest predictor if you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.730
change a gait.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.190
So if something looks abnormal,
and in that area he

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.240
says he has pain, we can kind
of connect the dots.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.050
We can give some advice to the
patient on how, perhaps, to

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.000
avoid some compensations and
prefer another type of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.740
compensation that puts less
stress on their joints.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.320
Paul was walking quite slowly.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.880
That was the first obvious
thing that we noticed.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.130
And having been through so many
operations, I'm sure that

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.920
he has had a fair share
of trouble and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.580
difficulties walking.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.070
I'm having some real mobility
issues in my left foot, and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm under a bit of pressure
to have some more surgery.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.910
It's quite difficult
at the moment.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.130
The National Alkaptonuria Centre
is currently trialling

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.740
a new treatment called
nitisinone that helps prevent

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.994
the buildup of homogentisic acid
and, therefore, eliminate

00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:20.410
the harmful effects of
this rare disease.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.650
Since 2006, 2007, which is
really quite short period of

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.150
time-- six or seven years--

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.990
we have made enormous strides,
and we're now on the brink of

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.260
a treatment for alkaptonuria.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.240
Oh the black pee. i haven't
got the black pee now.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.040
I feel bereft that I haven't
got black pee.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.850
So I have known Paul for
nearly six years.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.180
And he commenced the nitisinone
last year when he

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.300
came to the centre in October,
and he has been on that for

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.870
one year so far.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.940
But he's doing really well.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.700
A matter of weeks, if
not months, the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.010
black pee had gone.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.040
For the first time in 60-plus
years, I peed normal colored

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.602
male urine.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.380
What was that like?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.010
It's just amazing,
really, isn't it?

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.660
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.020
