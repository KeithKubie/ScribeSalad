hi my name's Adam I'm studying

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
hi my name's Adam I'm studying
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.400
hi my name's Adam I'm studying
mathematics and physics at a-level the

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
mathematics and physics at a-level the
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.470
mathematics and physics at a-level the
cosmic background microwave radiation is

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
cosmic background microwave radiation is
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.030
cosmic background microwave radiation is
obviously convincing evidence for the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
obviously convincing evidence for the
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.500
obviously convincing evidence for the
big bang theory but it's still just a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510
big bang theory but it's still just a
 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.499
big bang theory but it's still just a
theory as the theory of evolution could

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
theory as the theory of evolution could
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780
theory as the theory of evolution could
be potentially blown apart by fossils of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400

rabbits in the same rock strata as

dinosaurs my question is what piece of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
dinosaurs my question is what piece of
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779
dinosaurs my question is what piece of
evidence if found could potentially

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
evidence if found could potentially
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.230
evidence if found could potentially
bring the big bang theory to its knees
