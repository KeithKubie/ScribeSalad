00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.630
Identify the hypothesis and
conclusion of the following

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.510
statement, and determine whether
the statement is

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.980
always, sometimes,
or never true.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.160
So let's see what the
statement is.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.379
We have x-- well, this should be
an x squared plus 5x plus 7

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.930
is greater than 0 for
all real numbers x.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.840
So first let's rewrite this
as a proposition,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.120
as an if/then statement.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.360
Then it becomes a lot easier to
identify the hypothesis and

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.500
the conclusion.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:39.630
So we could rewrite this as
if x is a real number,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.880
then this is true.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.430
Then, x squared plus 5x plus
7 is greater than 0.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.280
And when you write it as an
if/then statement like this,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.680
it becomes a lot easier to
identify the hypothesis and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.330
the conclusion.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.520
Now the hypothesis is literally
just what the if

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.700
part is conjuring up.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.625
So this right here in pink.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.700
x is a real number.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
That's the hypothesis.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.190
Sometimes it's called
the antecedent.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.556
That is the hypothesis.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.800
And as we said in previous
videos, it's different,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.050
although related, to the
notion of a scientific

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.070
hypothesis.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.060
Here we're dealing with the
hypothesis of a hypothetical

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.445
proposition.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:23.980
Don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.600
It's what's inside of the if
part of the statement.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.010
The conclusion is the conclusion
from the then, or

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.670
it's the consequent
right here.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.770
Then that.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.105
That right there is
the conclusion.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.040
We could have labeled
this too.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.600
The conclusion here is this
statement right here.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.770
That right there is
the conclusion.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.370
That is what you conclude
if x is a real number.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.410
So you could say for all that is
the hypothesis right there.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.180
For all real numbers x, that
is the hypothesis.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.173
Either way you want to do it,
it's always easier to write it

00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:00.820
as an if/then statement.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.620
Now, the more interesting
question is whether this

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.810
statement is always, sometimes,
or never true.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.340
And the first thing that might
pop out at you is that the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.660
coefficient on the highest
degree term here, on the x

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.770
squared term, it's a positive
coefficient.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.675
So this is going to be an
upward opening parabola.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.530
Let me draw that.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.770
So if this is the x-axis,
whether this is always,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.230
sometimes, or never true rests
on whether the vertex, whether

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.300
the minimum point of this
parabola is above

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.820
or below the x-axis.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.780
Let me draw it for you.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.530
So if the parabola looks like
this, then for any x you pick,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.840
the value of the function, the
value of x squared plus 5x

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.800
plus 7 is always going
to be greater than 0.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.040
If the function looks like this,
then you're going to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.540
have some values for x where
it's greater than 0.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.060
But you're going to have some
values for x where it is equal

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.450
or less than 0.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.860
So we have to determine whether
it sits above or maybe

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.050
on or below, the x-axis.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.730
And that's the y-value
of the vertex.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.000
Now we know that it's
not never true.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.330
We know that it's not never true
because this is an upward

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.190
opening parabola.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.400
Even if your vertex is a
negative number, eventually,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.610
if you get far enough away from
it, you're going to get

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.810
the positive values
of this function.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.610
So we know it's not never true,
we just have to decide

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.760
between always and sometimes.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.110
And to figure that out, let's
figure out where the vertex--

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.910
and in particular, where the
y-value of the vertex is.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.980
But in order to get that
y-value, you need the x value.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.870
So the x-value of the vertex,
there's a formula here.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.880
I normally don't like giving
formulas, but we've shown this

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.100
in multiple videos before.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.140
It's negative b over 2a.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.800
And I can't help myself, if
you look at the quadratic

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.300
formula, it comes straight
out of that.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.330
The quadratic formula is
negative b over-- well, I'll

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.110
write it as negative b plus or
minus the square root of b

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.570
squared minus 4ac.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.970
All of that over 2a.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.340
Or you could write it as
negative b over 2a plus or

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.040
minus the thing over 2a.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.660
You normally just see it with
a big 2a in the denominator,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.430
but you could split
it up like this.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.110
And notice, this right here is
a formula, I just told you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.540
it's a formula for the x-value
of the vertex.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.779
Which makes complete sense
because the vertex is always

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.370
going to be along the line of
symmetry of our parabola.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.030
And it is going to be equal
distant from each of the 0's.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.930
So you get a 0 in the
plus direction.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.400
This is the distance
right here.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.170
This is one of the 0's in
the plus direction.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.610
And then you subtract,
that's the other 0.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.270
So it makes sense that negative
b over 2a is the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.130
x-value of the line
of symmetry or the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.650
x-value of the vertex.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.750
Now with that said, let's
actually figure out what the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.260
x-value of the vertex
is for this problem.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.510
So we have x squared--
oh, sorry.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.790
So negative b over 2a.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.290
So this is equal to negative
5 because b is 5,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.790
over 2 times 1.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.040
Over 2.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.410
So that's the x-value.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.730
Let's figure out
where it sits.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.300
Whether the y-value for
the vertex is below

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.640
or above the x-axis.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.800
So the y-value, we'll just have
to substitute into this.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.210
The y-value of the vertex is
going to be equal to negative

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.460
5/2 squared.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.680
Plus 5 times negative 5/2.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.230
And then finally, plus 7.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.620
Let's see if this is
positive or not.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.340
So negative 5/2 squared
is 25/4.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.540
Minus 25/2, plus 7.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.390
So we can add these.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.720
Let's put everything over 4.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.700
So this is equal to 25/4.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.550
25/2 is the same
thing as 50/4.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.400
Minus 50/4.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.500
Plus 28/4.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.790
This is equal to-- well,
we know our denominator

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.690
is going to be 4.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.500
And you have 25 plus 28 is 53.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.360
Minus 50 is 3.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.280
So it equals positive 3/4.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.070
So the y-value is positive.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.510
It is above the x-axis.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.160
So the parabola will look
something like this.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.590
The parabola will look something
like this where the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.140
y-value is 3/4 for the vertax.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.010
The x-value we just saw
was negative 5/2.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.940
And because the minimum point
of this upward opening

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.260
parabola is a positive number,
the minimum y-value is a

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.890
positive number, it's always
going to have values at that

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.470
level or above it.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.540
So this is true.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.470
If x is a real number,
then it is true.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.130
It is always true.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.170
It is always true that x squared
plus 5x plus 7 is

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.470
greater than 0.
