00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
Okay, Michael so enough of all
this hand-waving you like to do.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's actually write out some equations.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.614
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:09.489
&gt;&gt; There's no need to fear
the equations Michael.

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.459
So I'm going to leave our little picture
up so you can remember what it was

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.171
we're talking about, and
I'm going to leave out the definition or

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:20.554
the tuple part of what an option is so
that you remember that and

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.270
then I'm just going to write
an equation up here and here it is.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.412
So V sub t + 1 of s = max over O
of the quantity R of (s,o) plus

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:36.460
sum over s prime of s, o,
s prime times V sub t of s prime.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.520
What does that equation
look like to you?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.810
&gt;&gt; It has a lot in common
with the Bellman equation.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.420
&gt;&gt; Right and
in fact that's exactly what it is.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
It is a rewriting of
the Bellman Operator.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.180
So what do you think the various
constituent parts are?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.960
&gt;&gt; Maybe an easier thing to
do would be to explain what

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.280
looks like it might be different.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So for one thing, a has become o,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.020
because I guess actions have become
possibly temporally extended actions.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.900
&gt;&gt; Or options.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.140
&gt;&gt; Or options, good.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.630
Do we need to include
a in there as well?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.820
Why, how can we ignore all the a's?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.860
&gt;&gt; Well because the a's
are inside the o's.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740
&gt;&gt; The a's are inside the o's.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.860
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; There's actually an o inside an a.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.760
&gt;&gt; Well I think that depends upon
whether it's a lowercase or capital a.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.380
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; But i still don't quite understand.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.730
So, you're saying options
are made out of actions.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.100
&gt;&gt; Yes because there
may have little pulses.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.590
&gt;&gt; But can you have an option
that is just an action?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.600
&gt;&gt; Of course, right.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.498
So options are a journalization
of actions.

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:37.420
If I wanted to take an action and
I wanted to turn it into an option,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.890
then the initiation set would just be
everywhere where that action is valid.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.879
The policy inside that option would just
say for whatever state I'm in, take that

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:50.508
action with probability one and all
other actions with probability zero and

00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:54.558
then the termination probability
would be one for all of the states

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:59.200
that I can reach from that particular
state to particular action.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.290
Actually would just be one everywhere.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.830
&gt;&gt; One everywhere.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.930
I see.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.170
I say, that's okay.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.690
That's actually really cute.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.539
That kind of helps me understand
why these three quantities

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.360
are the way that they are.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.890
So it allows it to specifically say,
yeah,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.520
well we can always include an action
which is a primitive action, that just,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.360
you can use it whereever
you can use the action.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.810
It just does the action and
then it stops right away.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.920
&gt;&gt; Right exactly.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, good.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.400
So then the o, okay,
I get the o's generalizing the a.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.590
Then another difference is there's
no discount factor that I can see.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.160
And then the last difference is that
we seem to have spelled T as an F.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.000
&gt;&gt; Right well, F and T are the same for
an appropriate kind of thinking about.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.880
&gt;&gt; Only in logic.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.200
&gt;&gt; Only in logic?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah T and F are the same.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000
&gt;&gt; Actually they're
the opposite in logic.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.050
&gt;&gt; Whoops.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, T is true and F is false.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.530
I hadn't thought about that.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.800
That's kind of an interesting thing
that we could talk about for an hour and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.890
a half or
I could just explain to you what F is.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.960
So you did the right thing, you noticed
that we still have a reward function as

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.820
we did before in the Bellman operator.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.861
We still have value functions,
is what we're trying to do,

00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.510
trying to update value over states.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.068
We have little s's and the s primes,
the o's are basically a,

00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:13.218
so that doesn't seem different, but

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:17.734
the two big differences are a lack of a
discount factor which isn't quite true.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:20.371
We actually have a discount factor but
it's hidden and

00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.330
instead of a transition model we have F.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.130
So F is,
this really is a Bellman operator.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.080
F is sort of, I think, clearly playing
the role of a transition function.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.470
It's somehow telling you something
about states, options and next states.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.300
And what I really need to do
to make this clear, I think,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.260
is to just really write out what F is.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.430
&gt;&gt; That would be super helpful.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.350
&gt;&gt; That would be really nice, but

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.210
it turns out that I have to write out
something else as well and that is R.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.114
So R look sort of superficially like
the reward function that we had before,

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:52.713
although, in this case the reward is
from you know taking a particular

00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:54.178
option a particular state.

00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:58.813
But actually this reward function is
hiding a lot of complexity as well and

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:02.790
to see what the complexity is I
think it helps to draw a picture.
