00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.200
Welcome to Google Developers
Weekly for October 14, 2013.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.320
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.730
on the set and off.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.140
If you're building an enterprise
web app, you'll

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.230
want to use the Google Places
API to give your users the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.970
right information and
how to get there.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.460
Dylan Thomas and Dave McClusky
from the Geo team talk to us

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.550
about the best ways to find
yourself using this API.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.369
We're especially excited this
week to talk about the return

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.900
of Google Summer of Code.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.280
This is the 10th year we've
connected students with real

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.100
world open source software
development projects.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.360
Since 2005, Summer of Coders
have produced more than 50

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510
million lines of code,
with participants

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.210
in nearly 100 countries.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.750
From the open source team, Cat
Allman takes us through this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.220
year's plan.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.240
Also announced this week is
Google Code-in for 2013, a

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.710
global online contest
introducing pre-university

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.560
students to the world of open
source software development.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.390
Check out the program site
at google-melange, that's

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.740
M-E-L-A-N-G-E, .com
to learn more.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.870
The contest begins
November 18.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.610
Cat Allman and Stephanie
Taylor join us

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.370
on a special GDL.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.780
And a recurring theme in our GDL
weekly recordings has been

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.280
a focus on the cloud.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.960
Jonathan Simon says how we can
get started with the Google

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.310
Compute Engine load balancing.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060
And Dylan Thomas came back to
the studio to talk to us about

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.840
what's new in enterprise maps.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.630
Ajay Hemnani joined Dylan as
they discussed GME domain

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.730
provisioning, vector editing,
and other updates.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.040
Google Cloud platform is for
all developers, including

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.510
those working on iOS.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.320
This week, we announced
mobile back end

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.710
starter, or NBS, for iOS.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.630
NBS jumpstarts iOS apps with
cloud data stores,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.760
device-to-device push
notifications, and much more.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.330
And because NBS is based on App
Engine, you can scale to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.200
support hundreds of users
at no charge.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.640
This week, the Dart team
released a new tutorial that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.210
uses a Polymer web component
library.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.910
This tutorial shows you how to
create custom HTML elements

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.110
with Polymer.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.600
Along the way, you'll learn how
to include Polymer in your

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.820
apps for starters.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120
And then we'll show you
everything else you need to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.110
add to your custom elements.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.030
And to also make sure that you
never miss a thing from the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.530
world of Google Developers,
subscribe to Google Developers

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.080
on YouTube, and check out
the GDL schedule at

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.750
developers.google.com/live.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.140
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.
