Our story starts in Arkansas.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.291
<i> Little Rock, to be specific.</i>

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.726
<i> It's 1957.</i>

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.694
<i> The Supreme Court
 has just ruled</i>

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:31.164
<i> in the case of Brown
 versus the Board of Education</i>

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.765
<i> that separate is not equal.</i>

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:36.669
<i> So their local NAACP went out
 to the black community</i>

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.473
<i> and found nine kids to go
 to Central High School,</i>

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:43.643
<i> the premier high school
 in Little Rock, Arkansas.</i>

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.646
<i> So these kids are like,
 "We are the Little Rock Nine.</i>

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.450
<i> We are [bleep] nine visions
 of black excellence."</i>

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.719
<i> "We will go to school,
 and we'll change the world.</i>

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.421
<i> It'll be great."</i>

00:00:55.454 --> 00:01:00.460 line:0%
<i> So then the governor
 of Arkansas, Orval Faubus,</i>

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.196 line:0%
<i> finds out that these kids
 are planning to integrate,</i>

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.432
and this bitch,
Orval Fartbus...

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:07.834
- [laughs]

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.602
<i> - You can fart all you want
 on the Fartbus.</i>

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.504
Anyway, Orval Fartbus
was like,

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.607
<i> "Hey, if these kids integrate,</i>

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.610
<i> the streets will run red
 with blood."</i>

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.746
<i> Orval Fartbus is a bitch.</i>

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.383
Um...
[laughing]

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.651
- No, he's a bitch.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.353 line:0%
- So, then,

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:31.624 line:0%
<i> the kids show up to school
 on September 4th, 1957.</i>

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.327 line:0%
<i> The first day of school,
 the senior in the group</i>

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.263 line:0%
<i> of the Little Rock Nine
 is Ernest Green,</i>

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.865 line:0%
<i> and he is like, "Oh, my gosh.</i>

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.335 line:0%
<i> There is an ass-load
 of angry white people."</i>

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.738
<i> This angry white mob was like,
 "We don't like you.</i>

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:50.176
<i> "You need to go away.
 We are going to beat you up...</i>

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.479
and hang you from a tree."

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.483
That's not funny.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.152
<i> Meanwhile, on the other side
 of school,</i>

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.754
<i> Elizabeth Eckford, the ninth
 of the Little Rock Nine,</i>

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.624
<i> is like, "Oh, [bleep],
 I'm here all by myself.</i>

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.560
<i> "Oh, my God, there's a huge
 mob of white people.</i>

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.662
<i> This is terrifying."</i>

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.330
<i> They're yelling,</i>

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.332
and they have signs,
and they're shouting shit.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.835
<i> And they are like,
 "Hey. You're white.</i>

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:19.405
<i> "I mean, I'm white,
 and you're black,</i>

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.574
<i> so that means
 I don't like you."</i>

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:26.512
<i> So she gathers herself
 and this girl is G'd up,</i>

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:30.550
[bleep] face stone-cold,
and walking through

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.319
<i> these people who want
 to pick her up</i>

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.655
<i> and break her in two,
 just walking through like a G,</i>

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:40.560
<i> and she sees
 the Arkansas National Guard.</i>

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.495
<i> "They must be here
 to help me," she thinks.</i>

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.930
<i> She quickens her pace,
 and she goes,</i>

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.698
<i> "Hey, these white people
 are trying to kill me.</i>

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.433
<i> Please save me."</i>

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.868
<i> And they, like, block
 her entrance.</i>

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.537
<i> They are letting other
 white students in.</i>

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.306
<i> And she's like,
 "What is the deal?</i>

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.907
<i> "You are the National
 [bleep] Guard.</i>

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.443
<i> If anybody needs to be
 guarded, it's me, here, now."</i>

00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:00.413
<i> So she leaves school.</i>

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.616
<i> She sits down at the bus stop,</i>

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.484
<i> and the white people
 are surrounding her,</i>

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.486
<i> and they're like,
 "Uh, we don't like you.</i>

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.255
<i> You are poopy."</i>

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.958
<i> She waits several minutes
 for the bus.</i>

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:15.328
<i> The bus pulls up,
 and she's like, "Thank God,</i>

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.696
<i> "I can finally
 get out of here.</i>

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.531
<i> "This isn't the last
 I will see of you,</i>

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.334
<i> "but also, [bleep] [bleep],</i>

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.303
<i> can I just get
 a [bleep] education?"</i>

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:25.871
So...
[burps]

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:28.241
That was the first attempt,
and they lost.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.743
So attempt number two.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.946 line:0%
<i> They regroup.
 They go at it again in a week.</i>

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.249 line:0%
<i> They all got together
 this time,</i>

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.583 line:0%
<i> and they all entered school</i>

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.252 line:0%
<i> at the same place
 at the same time.</i>

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.886 line:0%
<i> The Little Rock police force</i>

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.388 line:0%
<i> escorts the children
 into school,</i>

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:43.723
<i> and they say, "Hey, look.</i>

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.524
<i> "Let me catch you
 out on the street</i>

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.460
<i> "any other day,
 and then who knows what,</i>

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.528
<i> but today,
 we'll take care of you."</i>

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.864
<i> They escort the children
 into school,</i>

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.267
<i> and they hold the line
 so that the crazy</i>

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.371
<i> angry white mob does not
 act a fool.</i>

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.473
<i> But the angry mob,</i>

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.042
<i> they break through
 the police line</i>

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.579
<i> and goes into the school,
 and they're like,</i>

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.881
<i> "Ah! We hate black people
 so much!</i>

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.550
<i> We're coming in this school
 to snatch you out."</i>

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:15.521
<i> So the cops are like,
 "[bleep]."</i>

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.590
<i> So they get away
 in the nick of time</i>

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:19.992
<i> because these people
 are so angry</i>

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:25.398
<i> that they, like, beat up cops
 and push them out of the way</i>

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.800
so they can get to
these children.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.302
White people.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.836
So they go to their houses.

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:33.572
<i> These kids are now like,
 "Oh, man.</i>

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:37.009
<i> "There's nothing we can do.
 I feel very discouraged.</i>

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.045
<i> "All of these white people
 are extra crazy.</i>

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.047
<i> They are very mad."</i>

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.983
Ernest Green turns
to the group and he says,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.585
<i> "You know what, we need
 to continue through to school</i>

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:52.792
<i> "because all of these
 white people</i>

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.495
<i> "are going to think
 we are to be [bleep] with.</i>

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:57.997
<i> We absolutely can't give up."</i>

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.433
So--ba-ba-da-doo--

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:05.338 line:0%
<i> the story of the crazy
 white people of Little Rock,</i>

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:09.542 line:0%
<i> Arkansas, finds its way
 to Eisenhower,</i>

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.478 line:0%
<i> and he is like, "This shit
 is [bleep] embarrassing.</i>

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:13.979 line:0%
<i> "These white people
 are [bleep] my shit up.</i>

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:17.383
<i> "How dare these people think
 that they can use</i>

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:21.387
<i> mob mentali...ty

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:28.627
[laughs]

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.062
None of these words are words

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.531
that have ever come out
of my mouth.

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.100
[bleep].

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.402
<i> So President Eisenhower says,
 "I'm gonna send in</i>

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.805
<i> 1,000 troops
 from the 101st Airborne."</i>

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:41.874
<i> Not a hundred of them.
 A hundred would have done it.</i>

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:46.645
<i> Not 200, not 300,
 but 1,000 of these people.</i>

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:50.449
<i> The Little Rock Nine arrive
 at school together,</i>

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:54.420
<i> and the 101st Airborne
 is there.</i>

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:55.821
<i> And they say, "Hey, look,</i>

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:57.456
<i> we are going to take care
 of you today."</i>

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:59.058
[car horn honks]

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.559
<i> "We're gonna take care
 of you today."</i>

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.027
<i> [horn honks]
 "We are gonna take"--</i>

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.464
[laughing]

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:08.434
Beep. Where were we?

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:09.769
<i> Oh, okay, so they were like,</i>

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.737
<i> "We're gonna take care
 of you today."</i>

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.973
<i> They escort the children
 into school.</i>

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:16.642
<i> They're holding back
 the crazy white people.</i>

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:17.843
<i> So the Little Rock Nine
 is like,</i>

00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:22.014
<i> "This is the shit.
 We did it.</i>

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:25.885
<i> We win everything.
 Hooray for us."</i>

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.488
<i> So they go into school,</i>

00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:32.625
<i> but once they get in
 the school, they realize,</i>

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.928
<i> "Oh, shit. Now we have to
 deal with these children."</i>

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:38.964
<i> These white children are like,
 "Aha!</i>

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:40.099
<i> "You finally made it
 into school.</i>

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:42.568
<i> "Now you belong to us.</i>

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.937
<i> We're gonna beat you up
 every chance we get."</i>

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.605
<i> She's like, "Why?"
 and they're like,</i>

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:48.941
<i> "We don't know exactly
 why we hate you.</i>

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:50.476
<i> "We just know
 that it's something</i>

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.877
<i> "our parents have handed down
 to us,</i>

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.679
<i> "and so we're just acting
 in what we believe</i>

00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:55.114
<i> are their best interests."</i>

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.016
<i> And Elizabeth is like,
 "Well, I don't know</i>

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.651
<i> "that that is
 their best interest.</i>

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.885
<i> Maybe if you just
 get along with me..."</i>

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.787
<i> And they're like, "No!"
 [Derek chuckles]</i>

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.690
<i> These children give
 the Little Rock Nine hell</i>

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:07.660
<i> for a whole year,
 and these little babies</i>

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.696
are being the blacketiest
black black that ever blacked,

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.999
<i> and it is blackening up
 my soul.</i>

00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:15.701
Okay, so,

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:18.237
<i> Ernest Green graduated,
 and he was like,</i>

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.872
<i> "Oh, thank God, these people
 almost killed me."</i>

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.741 line:0%
<i> So Ernest Green walks
 across the stage,</i>

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:25.644 line:0%
<i> grabs his diploma,
 looks out in the audience,</i>

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:29.815 line:0%
<i> and sees
 Dr. Martin Luther King!</i>

00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:31.650 line:0%
<i> Ernest was like, "Oh, my God!</i>

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:35.087 line:0%
<i> That is Dr. Martin Luther
 the King!"</i>

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.822 line:0%
<i> He's like, "These people
 almost killed me,</i>

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:38.591 line:0%
<i> but I did it,
 isn't this crazy?"</i>

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.126
<i> And then Dr. Martin Luther
 King was like,</i>

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:45.197
<i> "Well, there's nothing else
 you have to do</i>

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.699
<i> "'cause you've already gone
 through it.</i>

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.200
<i> Good job."</i>

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:49.835
<i> Oh, look at my nails.</i>

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:51.036
They're so beautiful.
Hi.

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.672
Hi, you're so pretty.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.775
<i> Um...</i>

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.812
What was I talking about?

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:05.217 line:0%
Oh, okay, then the 40-year
anniversary was in 1997.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.954 line:0%
<i> Oprah Winfrey had them
 on her show,</i>

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:11.590
<i> and Oprah Winfrey was like,
 "Hey, Little Rock Nine,</i>

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:13.125
<i> "guess who I have on the show?</i>

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:15.127
<i> The children
 that tormented you."</i>

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.664
<i> And the bullies were like,
 "Look, back in 1957,</i>

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:22.234
<i> "we were little punks,
 but now we're cool dudes</i>

00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:25.871
<i> "who love you,
 and we're sorry</i>

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:28.073
<i> "because we were mean to you</i>

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.776
<i> "and being mean to black
 people is not cool anymore,</i>

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:33.712
<i> so we just wanted to absolve
 ourselves of that."</i>

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:38.584
Their apologies were not up
to 2019 standards.

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.286
<i> Their apologies
 were frankly bullshit.</i>

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.121
<i> [Derek laughs]</i>

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:44.590
<i> But the Little Rock Nine
 forgave them</i>

00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:46.692
<i> for all of the terrible things
 they did,</i>

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:53.198
and, uh, that is more than
[bleep] I ever would've done.

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:57.870 line:0%
<i> Okay, so, in 1999,
 President Bill Clinton</i>

00:08:57.903 --> 00:09:00.739 line:0%
<i> gave each of
 the Little Rock Nine</i>

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:03.075 line:0%
the Congressional Gold Medal

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:06.779 line:0%
because what they went through
was [bleep] amazing.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.614
<i> It's shocking
 that anyone went through it,</i>

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.149
<i> much less children.</i>

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.651
Cannot point out enough
that they were children.

00:09:12.684 --> 00:09:15.821
- Mm.
- So.

00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:18.991
The Little Rock Nine wins.

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:21.226
<i> Everyone else
 is a piece of shit.</i>

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:23.329
<i> The end.</i>

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.664
Racism is fixed,
and everything's fine.

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.866
- Oh, cool.
Happy 2019.

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.902
- [laughs]
- Are you cool?

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:32.671
- Happy 2019.
- [laughs]

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:34.173
- Um, I don't know
what I was saying,

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.841
but I love margaritas.

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:37.474
And black people!
[gasps]
