00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.210
JAMES GRIME: One, two, three.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.150
Test, test, test.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.010
ROGER BOWLEY: If you're going
to do videos about numbers,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.280
these are the ones you
would love to do.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.690
JAMES CLEWETT: As far as the
computer's concerned, this

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.360
simply doesn't exist.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.480
JAMES GRIME: Don't ask me
to say it, we could

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.490
be until next week.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.190
RIA SYMONDS: 16's a very
special number to me.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.450
It's my actual favorite
number.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.575
JAMES GRIME: So this is called
a truncated icosahedron.

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:20.900
RIA SYMONDS: It's five sided.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.345
It's a pentagon.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.280
JAMES GRIME: Let's try it out.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.930
I'm going to try and
play this as well.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.040
You'll notice the difference.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.410
GERARDO ADESSO: I just realized
that there is a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.280
number that I see every day when
I enter my office, and

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.480
this number is 42.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.509
JAMES GRIME: And, well, if you
need to go to the toilet, you

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.280
get up and you have to move
past all the other people.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.340
MALE SPEAKER: I'm at the
southeast corner of England

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.230
today, and I'm talking to you
about a number with a bit of a

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.680
difference.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.370
JAMES CLEWETT: It is an antique
1980s television.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.274
[DRUMS]

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:51.738
[EXPLOSION]

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:53.690
[CHEERING]

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.750
ROGER BOWLEY: They get to
figgit, they get to 20 sheep,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.230
and they couldn't
cope with that.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.380
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, thanks
for pointing that out.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.740
Thanks for bringing that up.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.470
JAMES CLEWETT: And as a child,
I was fascinated by this.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.040
Absolutely fascinated.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.310
But it's taken me 15 years to
get to the point where I can

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.560
explain it to you.
