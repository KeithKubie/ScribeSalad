00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Because fluid dynamics is so hard,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
many people try to come up with toy models to at least get a glimpse

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of what's happening.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One of these toy models--a particularly interesting one--is the Lorenz system.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
By the way, this name is not to be confused with that of the physicist who spelled with "tz."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is what is described by this model.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There is a layer of incompressible liquid between a surface of constant high temperature

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and a surface of constant low temperature.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We've got some melting ice-cubes here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The velocity field in that liquid is described by three highly abstract parameters,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
called x, y, and z.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They describe the relative amount of different sorts of motion.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Even though this is a very sketchy and abstract description,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
some people have succeeded in implementing these equations

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with an actual water wheel.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The idea about studying these equations is that they may be telling us something

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about every system in which convection is present.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When we plot the solutions of the Lorenz system in 3D this is what we get--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a very intricate butterfly-like pattern.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Here we're seeing two solutions--one in green and one in blue--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
starting from almost the same point--something to explore in the next section.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The trajectories make some turns on one ring, then jump to the other ring,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
jump back to the first ring and so on.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The number of turns they take per ring seems to be almost unpredictable.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There is one more thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Even though both trajectories have almost the same starting point,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you can see that they quickly diverge in the course of time.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're going to study that in the next segment.
