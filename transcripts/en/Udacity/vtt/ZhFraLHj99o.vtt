00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.972
Let's take a look at how
to add ads to your site.

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:06.150
In order to serve ads on your site,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.040
you need an account with
one of the ads providers.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.090
We will use AdSense account for
our demo.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.090
We'll chose to show you how
to create responsive ad units

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.370
because you are building
a responsive site.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.500
Right?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.610
So use responsive ad units.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.940
Responsive ads automatically resize
based on the size of the device and

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.730
the width of the parent container.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.030
This will ensure that the ad works in
line with your responsive layout and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.440
the site will look great on any device.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.300
So, first step, we're opening the home
page of AdSense, and clicking on my ads.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.640
Then we'll click on new ad unit,
and we'll give it a name.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.270
For our purpose, we'll call it demo two.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.100
We're choosing the responsive size,
like we said before, and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.080
then we have the option
to choose the type.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's go with the default here.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.830
Then we could choose the style.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.220
I like this one.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.220
And of course you could do here the best
to match the theme of your site.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.510
And then we are just clicking,
save and get the code.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
Now all you need to do
is just to copy and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
paste this inline code to your html.
