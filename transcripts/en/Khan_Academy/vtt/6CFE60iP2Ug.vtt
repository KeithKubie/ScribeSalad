00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:01.606
- [Voiceover] We've already
looked at several ways

00:00:01.606 --> 00:00:02.998
of writing linear equations.

00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:05.410
You could write it in
slope-intercept form,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.400
where it would be of the form
of Y is equal to MX plus B,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.766
where M and B are constants.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.181
M is the coefficient on
this MX term right over here

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:19.617
and M would represent the slope.

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:22.171
And then from B you're able to figure out

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.888
the y-intercept.

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:25.190
The Y,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.277
you're able to figure out
the y-intercept from this.

00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:32.271
Literally the graph that
represents the XY pairs

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:34.987
that satisfy this equation,

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:37.496
it would intersect the y-axis at the point

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:40.793
X equals zero, Y is equal to B.

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:42.674
And it's slope would be M.

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.804
We've already seen that multiple times.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.222
We've also seen that you can also

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:48.892
express things in point-slope form.

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:50.401
So let me make it clear.

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.872
This is slope-intercept.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.803
Slope- intercept.

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:56.660
And these are just different ways of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.378
writing the same equations.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:00.979
You can algebraically manipulate
from one to the other.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.825
Another way is point-slope.

00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.079
Point-slope form.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.285
And in point-slope form,
if you know that some,

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.768
if you know that there's
an equation where the line

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:15.156
that represents the
solutions of that equation

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:16.968
has a slope M.

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:19.243
Slope is equal to M.

00:01:19.243 --> 00:01:21.774
And if you know that X equals,

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:25.280
X equals A, Y equals B,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.323
satisfies that equation,

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.226
then in point-slope form you
can express the equation as

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:32.961
Y minus B is equal to

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:38.303
M times X minus A.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:41.652
This is point-slope form
and we do videos on that.

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.788
But what I really want
to get into in this video

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:44.740
is another form.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.876
And it's a form that you
might have already seen.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.556
And that is standard form.

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:51.070
Standard.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.509
Standard form.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.063
And standard form takes the shape of

00:01:56.063 --> 00:02:01.054
AX plus BY is equal to C,

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.956
where A, B, and C are integers.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.325
And what I want to do in this video,

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.974
like we've done in the ones on point-slope

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:10.064
and slope-intercept is get an appreciation

00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:12.014
for what is standard form good at

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:14.637
and what is standard form less good at?

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:16.657
So let's give a tangible example here.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.980
So let's say I have the linear equation,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.652
it's in standard form,

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:22.977
9X plus

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:27.118
16Y is equal to 72.

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:30.165
And we wanted to graph this.

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:33.276
So the thing that standard
form is really good for

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:35.830
is figuring out, not just the y-intercept,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.475
y-intercept is pretty good if you're

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.285
using slope-intercept form,

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.375
but we can find out the
y-intercept pretty clearly

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:44.463
from standard form and the x-intercept.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:47.111
The x-intercept isn't
so easy to figure out

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:49.687
from these other forms right over here.

00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:51.128
So how do we do that?

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:53.147
Well to figure out the x and y-intercepts,

00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:55.213
let's just set up a little table here,

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:57.188
X comma Y,

00:02:57.188 --> 00:03:00.322
and so the x-intercept is going to happen

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:02.784
when Y is equal to zero.

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.920
And the y-intercept is going to happen

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.985
when X is equal to zero.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.471
So when Y is zero, what is X?

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:12.187
So when Y is zero, 16 times zero is zero,

00:03:12.187 --> 00:03:13.627
that term disappears,

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:17.783
and you're left with 9X is equal to 72.

00:03:17.783 --> 00:03:20.035
So if nine times X is 72,

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.682
72 divided by nine is eight.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.282
So X would be equal to eight.

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:27.232
So once again, that was
pretty easy to figure out.

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:28.905
This term goes away and
you just have to say hey,

00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:32.249
nine times X is 72, X would be eight.

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.733
When Y is equal to zero, X is eight.

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.614
So the point, let's see,

00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:39.423
Y is zero, X is one, two, three,

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:41.560
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.628
That's this point,

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:43.486
that right over here.

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:46.064
This point right over
here is the x-intercept.

00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:48.851
When we talk about x-intercepts
we're referring to the point

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.297
where the line actually
intersects the x-axis.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.646
Now what about the y-intercept?

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:57.526
Well, we said X equals
zero, this disappears.

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.823
And we're left with 16Y is equal to 72.

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:02.204
And so we could solve,

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:03.295
we could solve that.

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:07.752
So we could say, alright
16Y is equal to 72.

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:09.425
And then divide both sides by 16.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:13.674
We get Y is equal to 72 over 16.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.207
And let's see, what is that equal to?

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:17.691
That is equal to, let's see,

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.245
they're both divisible by eight,

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:23.496
so that's nine over two.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.120
Or we could say it's 4.5.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.500
So when X is zero, Y is 4.5.

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.593
And so, we could plot that point as well.

00:04:32.593 --> 00:04:34.869
X is zero, Y is one, two, three,

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.237
4.5.

00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:39.165
And just with these two
points, two points are enough

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:41.254
to graph a line, we can now graph it.

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:42.671
So let's do that.

00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.319
So let me,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.643
oops, though I was using the tool

00:04:45.643 --> 00:04:47.499
that would draw a straight line.

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.182
Let me see if I can...

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.087
So the line will look something like that.

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:55.853
There you have it.

00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.409
I've just graphed,

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.011
I've just graphed, this is

00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:01.611
the line that represents
all the X and Y pairs

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:03.492
that satisfy the equation

00:05:03.492 --> 00:05:08.285
9X plus 16Y is equal to 72.

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:11.308
Now, I mentioned standard
form's good at certain things

00:05:11.308 --> 00:05:13.212
and the good thing that standard form is,

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.070
where it's maybe somewhat unique relative

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.672
to the other forms we looked at,

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:19.431
is it's very easy to
figure out the x-intercept.

00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:21.265
It was very easy to
figure out the x-intercept

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:22.263
from standard form.

00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.444
And it wasn't too hard to figure
out the y-intercept either.

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:27.186
If we looked at slope-intercept form,

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:29.299
the y-intercept just
kinda jumps out at you.

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:33.083
At point-slope form, neither
the x nor the y-intercept

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.941
kind of jump out at you.

00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.263
The place where slope-intercept
or point-slope form

00:05:37.263 --> 00:05:39.375
are frankly better is
that it's pretty easy

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:41.534
to pick out the slope here,

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:44.089
while in standard form you would have to

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.506
do a little bit of work.

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:47.317
You could use these two points,

00:05:47.317 --> 00:05:49.105
you could use the x and y-intercepts

00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:51.357
as two points and figure
out the slope from there.

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:53.303
So you can literally say,
"Okay, if I'm going from

00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:55.870
"this point to this point, my change in X

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.637
"to go from eight to
zero is negative eight.

00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:01.660
"And to go from zero to 4.5,"

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:04.011
I wrote that little delta
there unnecessarily.

00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:04.926
Let me.

00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:07.880
So when you go from eight to zero,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.177
your change in X is
equal to negative eight.

00:06:11.177 --> 00:06:13.963
And to go from zero to 4.5,

00:06:13.963 --> 00:06:17.678
your change in Y is going to be 4.5.

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:18.899
So your slope,

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:20.576
once you've figured this out,

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.689
you could say, "Okay, this is going to be

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.033
"change in Y, 4.5, over change in X,

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:27.774
"over negative 8."

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:29.793
And since I, at least I
don't like a decimal up here,

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:32.395
let's multiply the numerator
and the denominator by two.

00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:36.760
You get negative nine over 16.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.356
Now once again, we had to do
a little bit of work here.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.657
We either use these two points,

00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:42.791
it didn't just jump
immediately out of this,

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.299
although you might see a
little bit of a pattern

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:46.855
of what's going on here.

00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:47.621
But you still have to think about

00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:48.861
is it negative? Is it positive?

00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:50.929
You have to do a little bit
of algebraic manipulation.

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:52.856
Or, what I typically do if
I'm looking for the slope,

00:06:52.856 --> 00:06:55.131
I actually might put this into,

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.757
into one of the other forms.

00:06:56.757 --> 00:06:58.963
Especially slope-intercept form.

00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:00.681
But standard form by itself,

00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:03.931
great for figuring out
both the x and y-intercepts

00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:06.551
and it's frankly not that
hard to convert it to

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.153
slope-intercept form.

00:07:08.153 --> 00:07:09.444
Let's do that

00:07:09.444 --> 00:07:10.813
just to make it clear.

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:12.717
So if you start with 9X,

00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:14.993
let me do that in yellow.

00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:19.283
If we start with 9X plus 16Y

00:07:19.283 --> 00:07:21.210
is equal to 72

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.765
and we want to put it
in slope-intercept form,

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:25.715
we can subtract 9X from both sides.

00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:30.373
You get 16Y is equal to
negative 9X, plus 72.

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.540
And then divide both sides by 16.

00:07:34.706 --> 00:07:36.587
So divide everthing

00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:37.957
by 16.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.464
And you'll be left with Y is equal to

00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:43.900
negative 9/16X, that's the slope,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.595
you see it right there,

00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:49.891
plus 72 over 16, we already figured out

00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:52.723
that's 9/2 or 4.5.

00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.789
So I could write, oh I'll
just write that as 4.5.

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:59.225
And this form over here, much
easier to figure out the slope

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.477
and, actually, the
y-intercept jumps out at you.

00:08:01.477 --> 00:08:04.671
But the x-intercept isn't as obvious.
