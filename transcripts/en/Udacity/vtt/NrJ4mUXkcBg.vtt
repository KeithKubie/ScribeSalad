00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.975
The first step we need to take to move toward getting x alone, is to subtract

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:10.275
1200 from both sides. Then, our last step is to divide both sides by 6.5. On the

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:15.575
left side, we end up with 690. And on the right side, we have just x. So, that's

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.759
our answer. Connecting this new piece of information back to our story, the

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:24.771
solution to this equation tells us that Grant manufactured 690 glasses wiper

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:28.444
sets in the first month. If you think back to where we were at the very

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:32.671
beginning of this lesson, you've made a ton of progress in learning about how to

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:36.883
solve equations. If there's anything that you don't feel 100% comfortable with

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:41.428
right now, go back and re-watch the videos covering it. Awesome job.
