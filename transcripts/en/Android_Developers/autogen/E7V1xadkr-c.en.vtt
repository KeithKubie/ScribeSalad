00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.639
our system under test so all that you
need to worry about is your android

android com it gives a good outline I

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:32.860
 
 

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.980

was rubbish werster I have a have seen
 

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.530
was rubbish werster I have a have seen
the developers Android site and I've

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:38.540
the developers Android site and I've
 

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.730
the developers Android site and I've
also seen the supporting multiple

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:39.740
also seen the supporting multiple
 

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.660
also seen the supporting multiple
screens and stuff but I mean when when I

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:43.670
screens and stuff but I mean when when I
 

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.400

when I act literally doing some

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.410

development and it's okay when we are

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:47.660
development and it's okay when we are
 

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.930
development and it's okay when we are
doing it via an emulator and checking it

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:49.940
doing it via an emulator and checking it
 

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.720
doing it via an emulator and checking it
over some quite a few test devices but

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:52.730
over some quite a few test devices but
 

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.640
over some quite a few test devices but
when we send the app over the market

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:54.650
when we send the app over the market
 

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.550
when we send the app over the market
where I mean Android devices are being

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560
where I mean Android devices are being
 

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.490
where I mean Android devices are being
in thousands of numbers and and and we

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:00.500
in thousands of numbers and and and we
 

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.470
in thousands of numbers and and and we
are not we are unable to figure the way

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480
are not we are unable to figure the way
 

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.950

where we we need to strategize the way
 

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.920
where we we need to strategize the way
so I mean in some cases we just need to

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:08.930
so I mean in some cases we just need to
 

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.290
so I mean in some cases we just need to

one in my building a bit confusion is

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.070
one in my building a bit confusion is
 

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.920
one in my building a bit confusion is
the difference between densities of

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:35.930
the difference between densities of
 

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.220
the difference between densities of
assets and screen sizes it's best to use

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.230
assets and screen sizes it's best to use
 

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.330
assets and screen sizes it's best to use
you think of those as two different

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:40.340
you think of those as two different
 

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.540
you think of those as two different
things so the density of assets is about

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:43.550
things so the density of assets is about
 

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.470
things so the density of assets is about
how much d

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480
how much d
 

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.870
how much d
one and the twin size is your layout

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880
one and the twin size is your layout
 

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.939
one and the twin size is your layout
that you want to incorporate so that way

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:48.949
that you want to incorporate so that way
 

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.230
that you want to incorporate so that way
when you come across something like an

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240
when you come across something like an
 

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.319
when you come across something like an
s3 it's using the high-density assets

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:53.329
s3 it's using the high-density assets
 

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:55.360
s3 it's using the high-density assets
but it's still using the right layout

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:55.370
but it's still using the right layout
 

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.980
but it's still using the right layout
for the its size screen right yeah

00:15:59.980 --> 00:15:59.990
for the its size screen right yeah
 

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.100
for the its size screen right yeah
exactly so as a lot of riff on what L is

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.110
exactly so as a lot of riff on what L is
 

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.120
exactly so as a lot of riff on what L is
saying basically you have see a visual

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.130
saying basically you have see a visual
 

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.949
saying basically you have see a visual
thing like a button background or an

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959
thing like a button background or an
 

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.230
thing like a button background or an
icon and you say I want this thing to be

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240
icon and you say I want this thing to be
 

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.329
icon and you say I want this thing to be
about you know two centimeters across

00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:13.339
about you know two centimeters across
 

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:17.259
about you know two centimeters across
and then you design a bitmap that

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:17.269
and then you design a bitmap that
 

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:19.720
and then you design a bitmap that
measures about two centimeters across in

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:19.730
measures about two centimeters across in
 

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.360
measures about two centimeters across in
each of you know say three or four

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:22.370
each of you know say three or four
 

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.389
each of you know say three or four
bitmap or pixel densities so you say

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399
bitmap or pixel densities so you say
 

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.420
bitmap or pixel densities so you say
this thing is is at 300 dots per inch or

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.430
this thing is is at 300 dots per inch or
 

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.910
this thing is is at 300 dots per inch or
two hundred dots per inch or 160 dots

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920
two hundred dots per inch or 160 dots
 

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.129
two hundred dots per inch or 160 dots
per inch this is how many pixels across

00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:33.139
per inch this is how many pixels across
 

00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:35.259
per inch this is how many pixels across
the image needs to be in order to

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:35.269
the image needs to be in order to
 

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:38.250
the image needs to be in order to
measure say two centimeters in real

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:38.260
measure say two centimeters in real
 

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.079
measure say two centimeters in real
distances and so you just have different

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:41.089
distances and so you just have different
 

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:45.220
distances and so you just have different
versions of every visual asset and let

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.230
versions of every visual asset and let
 

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.509
versions of every visual asset and let

you can then trust that when that thing

00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:00.949
you can then trust that when that thing

you can then trust that when that thing
is grown on the screen it is

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:02.649
is grown on the screen it is
 

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:05.250
is grown on the screen it is
approximately two centimeters across

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:05.260

of the different size buckets and then

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:10.819
of the different size buckets and then
 

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:15.850

the actual size so you say i want this
 

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.760
the actual size so you say i want this

480 and using this aspect ratio we are

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120
480 and using this aspect ratio we are
 

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.080

would be having the same screen

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:36.530
would be having the same screen
 

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.920
would be having the same screen
resolution so I think this is where I am

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:38.930
resolution so I think this is where I am
 

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.800
resolution so I think this is where I am
making a mistake yeah I've include the

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:41.810
making a mistake yeah I've include the
 

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.870
making a mistake yeah I've include the

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880
site if you've quoted other screen sizes
 

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.580

not the densities so I'll then define

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:48.590
not the densities so I'll then define
 

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.980
not the densities so I'll then define
your layout the densities are if you

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:50.990
your layout the densities are if you
 

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.550
your layout the densities are if you
look on the same page it'll say mdpi and

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:54.560
look on the same page it'll say mdpi and
 

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.540
look on the same page it'll say mdpi and
the range is about 150 to 200 dots per

the range is about 150 to 200 dots per
 

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.420
the range is about 150 to 200 dots per
inch right and that's what you used to

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.430
inch right and that's what you used to
 

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.460
inch right and that's what you used to

actual whole layout of the screen rather
 

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.860
actual whole layout of the screen rather
than designing your assets and how much

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:14.870
than designing your assets and how much
 

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.390

detail you want to appear in those
 

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.660
detail you want to appear in those
assets right I got it enough yes

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:21.670
 
 

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.210
 
dimensions as well like we talked but a

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.220
dimensions as well like we talked but a
 

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.680
dimensions as well like we talked but a
normal thing I guess the most common

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:26.690
normal thing I guess the most common
 

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.990
normal thing I guess the most common
thing out there is you know normal

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000

wouldn't ever think about it dimension

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:33.950
wouldn't ever think about it dimension
 

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.770
wouldn't ever think about it dimension
so it's always always always think about

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:35.780
so it's always always always think about
 

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.490
so it's always always always think about
how big that is in dips and when you're

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:39.500
how big that is in dips and when you're
 

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.610
how big that is in dips and when you're
doing it is mine use the value the depth

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:42.620
doing it is mine use the value the depth
 

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.030

basically you just look for the package

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.180
basically you just look for the package
 

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.560
basically you just look for the package
name after you said the lock feature

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:06.570
name after you said the lock feature
 

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.930
name after you said the lock feature
then you search the package name on the

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940
then you search the package name on the
 

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.150
then you search the package name on the
look at and then when the intent is

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:11.160
look at and then when the intent is
 

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.820
look at and then when the intent is
broadcasted them you showed wrong screen

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:13.830
broadcasted them you showed wrong screen
 

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.930
broadcasted them you showed wrong screen
instead of their apps me yeah whatever

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940
instead of their apps me yeah whatever

they don't get the pastor that you kill
 

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.860
they don't get the pastor that you kill
the application yeah yeah you don't kill

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:21.870
the application yeah yeah you don't kill
 

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.830
the application yeah yeah you don't kill
the application you just send it as a

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840
the application you just send it as a
 

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.830
the application you just send it as a
councilmember send their home intent so

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840

quick way to do it hosts the APK on a
 

00:50:32.389 --> 00:50:34.989
quick way to do it hosts the APK on a
web server and update the app so the NFC

00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:34.999
web server and update the app so the NFC
 

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:37.689
web server and update the app so the NFC
