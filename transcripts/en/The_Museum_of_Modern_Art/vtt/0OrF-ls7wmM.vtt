00:00:01.264 --> 00:00:03.017
Male: A stain is made
when you take a paint

00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:05.795
and you thin it out with a lot of solvent.

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.729
In the case of oil painting,
a lot of turpentine.

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.829
The paint becomes very, very watery.

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.363
It becomes very dilute.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.186
The color is reduced, and also because

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:15.968
it's so watery that stain
can actually penetrate

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:17.733
into the canvas itself.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:21.873
In the work of Rothko
we know that he layered

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.234
stain over, stain, over stain.

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:26.386
We're quite literally
seeing through these very,

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:29.482
very thin washes, if you will, of paint.
