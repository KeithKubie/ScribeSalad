00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.530
Now it's no secret, the Y chromosome is so

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.980
much smaller than the X chromosome. And there's an amazingly

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.730
cool story behind all of this. Please go read about

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.030
it. It's amazing. It's been going on for a long

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.400
time. The Y chromosome has been getting smaller and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.810
smaller for the last oh, I don't know 100 million

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.450
years or so. But the result has had dramatic implications

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.735
for genes that are expressed from the X chromosome and

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.740
they don't exist on the Y chromosome. Think about it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.800
for a second. Let's say we're interested in this gene

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.376
that causes red green colorblindness and it's on the X

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:39.860
chromosome. Well, females have two X chromosomes. So anytime we're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.030
looking at their inheritance patterns. It's pretty much the same

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.430
thing and straightforward as we've ever looked at for the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.380
autosomes, because females have two copies. They have two alleles,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.820
they can be homozygous they can be heterozygous, they can be

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.270
plus, plus, plus minus, or minus, minus. And for

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.960
recessive traits, when they're homozygous recessive, then they're going to show

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.810
the trait, let's say, for red green color blindness. But

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.530
for the sake of it, let's say that the female

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.840
is heterozygous, dominant recessive. So they're not actually red-green

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.610
colorblind, but they carry an allele for it. Males don't

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.120
have that luxury. It's almost like the females have a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.935
backup copy, functioning copy of the gene, so they aren't

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.590
red-green colorblind. But males sure they have one X

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.120
chromosome. The Y chromosome is missing the piece of information

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.300
that would correlate to the same region on the X

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.910
chromosome. They don't have this gene. So if the male

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.050
has the dominant copy grade, he's going to see color

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.660
vision just fine. But if he inherits even just one

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.790
allele, one recessive allele for red-green colorblindness, that's all it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090
takes. He doesn't have anything to counteract the effect, and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.450
so he's going to be red-green colorblind. So in our

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.225
pedigree up at the top here, we have an affected

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:51.880
great-grandfather. And if he is XY, we know that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.280
he has an affected allele. If he has any daughter,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.880
he must pass that allele on, because both daughters

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.480
are XX. They get one X from mom and one

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120
X from dad. And the X that came from dad

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.110
had to have been the one with the recessive alleles.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.199
So both of these daughters are carriers. They have to be,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.880
because we know they're unaffected. See they're not shaded, that means

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.370
they're not red green colorblind. It must have gotten the recessive

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.210
allele from their father. And then if we look at this individual's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
children here, these two. She had an unaffected daughter, we have

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.710
no idea if she passed on the recessive allele or not

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.390
because it's masked. But in the case of her son, we

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.850
see very clearly, he must have the recessive allele because he's affected.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.140
So, although the trait looks like it skipped a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.500
generation, right? It looks like it went from grandfather

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.900
to grandson. The allele didn't skip anybody, the allele

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.200
went right from grandfather to mother to son. You

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.150
can see it, you can track it in the pedigree. So the lesson from all of this is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.440
that, although phenotypes appear to skip generation sometimes, the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.760
alleles never skip. And in the case of sex-linked traits,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.186
when they're linked to either the X or the Y chromosome,

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:04.220
because there're some traits linked only to the Y chromosome. The

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.480
patterns can be a little bit more tricky to discern because

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.050
the males don't have another copy to complement their X chromosome.
