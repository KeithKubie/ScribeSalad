00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer here is that we need to say something about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the length of the formula, because as you know,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we are measuring running time as a function of the size of the input.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now if you have N variables,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I think it's very convenient to measure the running time as a function of N,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we can only do that if we know that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the length of the formula is also some function of N

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or if the length of the formula is polynomial in N to be more precise.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So just to be very precise, from now on

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we will always assume that the total length

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of this Boolean formula that we are given

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is polynomial in N,

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the number of variables.
