The answer is, the program would print, the first long word is and then nothing

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.614
after it. Because longword would still be the empty string it was initialized

00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:14.270
as. We would never encounter a word with length greater than nine. So longword

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.713
would never be updated.
