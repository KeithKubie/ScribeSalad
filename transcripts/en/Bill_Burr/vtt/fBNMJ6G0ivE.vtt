00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.890
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Ah,
just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.970
What's going on?
I'm here in New York City.
Be impressed,

4
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:20.350
boy.
Talking about second season of F is for family.

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.100
I want to thank everybody once again who's been watching it,
tweeting about it,

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.900
Instagram and about it.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.010
My space in about his Facebook and whatever the fuck you kids do.

8
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.600
I have no idea.
Um,
I had a long day of press yesterday,

9
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.070
but a great time and a great time.

10
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.340
Did Howard Stern show for the first time in like 15 years?

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.433
<v 1>MMM,</v>

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.820
<v 0>I had a great time on that one.
And then,
uh,
he was funny.</v>

13
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:48.410
I could barely sleep the night before.

14
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.740
I was just thinking about how much my life has changed in the last 15 years.

15
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.690
Plus I was on,
um,

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.710
west coast time plus I was nervous going in there.
You know,

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.330
you're going to do that show.
It's like,
oh my God,

18
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:03.920
what's this guy going to ask me?
And um,
it ended up going great.

19
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.400
Thank God.
You know,
that's one of those ones you leave.
It's like,

20
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.540
did he have a good time?
But it was it all right.
Did I do an all right job?
Um,

21
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.510
I did joke with them that I'll see him again in another 15 years,

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
but it was obviously fucking awesome to do the show and I had a great time.

23
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.650
I hope you had a good time to and uh,

24
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.240
then of course I did Jimmy and say,
am I did the ob show?

25
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:30.990
I'm going to try to do,
Anthony showed today.
Um,

26
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.690
I did Ron Ron show.
I did fucking,
uh,

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.170
what else did I do?
Barstool sports.
I was everywhere.

28
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.780
I did something for the m and m channel.

29
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.710
I did the trucker show just running my year.

30
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.830
I called in the major major league baseball channel.

31
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.900
<v 0>And I fucking,</v>

33
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.420
<v 1>yeah,</v>

34
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.290
<v 0>for whatever reason decided to talk about the Kevin Durant's rate</v>

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.360
on baseball channel.
We totally got into that.

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.290
Talk to somebody else on Toronto.
Um,

37
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.210
great game last night,
by the way.

38
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:15.211
Finally a nice competitive game between the Cavaliers and the warriors before

39
00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.000
the former league MVP that they signed.

40
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.660
They hit a fucking dagger three pointer.
Um,

41
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.400
I dunno,
gravy train,
gravy,
train,
jumping on the,

42
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.450
it's a gravy train championship.
That's what I'm going to call it.
Um,

43
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.460
and I've gotten into so many fucking debates.

44
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:34.960
A lot of people don't agree with me.

45
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.690
A lot of people go well abroad did at Miami saw.
And I keep saying,

46
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.830
I'm not talking about players,
I'm just talking about this as a fan.

47
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.680
Nobody seems to be able to hear me.
So last night I'm in a fucking diner.

48
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.170
Um,
and I get in this fucking debate with this dude.
You know,

49
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:55.180
one of these young guys,
you know,
they say,

50
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.840
I don't think the Beatles are that good or I think the Beatles overrated.

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.130
And always try to tell him like,

52
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.250
you really not going to find any musician with any sort of knowledge of music

53
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.100
that's going to say you're right.
I think why these kids say this,

54
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.090
aside from the fact that it's been so long since the Beatles were around,

55
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.360
that it's hard to go back and see the effect they had on the game.

56
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.130
It's like trying to look back at Johnny Unitas and see how he brought the

57
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.260
quarterback position into the modern era.

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.000
How the fuck are you going to do that in 20 high?

59
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.640
He out of these of these goddamn kids going to do it.

60
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.740
I also think the reason why the Beatles get so much shit from people like it

61
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.741
seems like age 38 and under is I think baby boomers are so fucking annoying and

62
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.140
that's all they talk about.
And they act like music ended,
you know,

63
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.690
in 1970 when they broke up.
But,
um,

64
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.270
I was arguing with this guy,

65
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.090
and this is one of the funniest things anybody's ever said.

66
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.960
He basically said that he didn't like the Beatles because when he puts on the

67
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120
Beatles,
it didn't make them want to get on an elliptical and workout.

68
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.270
That has gotta be one of the funniest fucking things.

69
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.460
And I immediately was just like,
dude,

70
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.520
how many fucking food courts do you sit in at?
Just like,

71
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.180
I don't even know what to say to that.
It's like,
dude,
you know,

72
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.220
everybody likes Mozart,
but you know,

73
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:24.210
it doesn't make me want to put on my leg warmers and get on the exercise bike.

74
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.250
Um,

75
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.870
but who the fuck am I to say how people should or shouldn't enjoy music?
But,

76
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.350
um,

77
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.920
I think a lot of the Beatles backlash just has to do with everybody blowing them

78
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.820
for the last fucking 50 years.
And people will be like,
dude,

79
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.730
yellow submarine.
That's a good song.
And it's like,
well dude,

80
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.000
Al Pachino has bad movies.
Does that mean he's not a fucking,

81
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.820
one of the greatest actors of all time?
You know,

82
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.110
every comedian has a fucking tough set.

83
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:53.750
Everybody comedian tells a joke that doesn't fucking work.

84
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.430
Richard Pryor did sets where he bond.
You know,
I,

85
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.170
I don't understand the,
whatever.
It was such a stupid fucking thing I got.

86
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:04.580
I just literally wasted,

87
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:09.440
I wasted like two hours of my life arguing about whether the Beatles were great

88
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:10.274
or not.

89
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.110
And whether or not what Duran was doing was,

90
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.590
you know,
a legit championship or not.

91
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.540
I wasted like at least two hours of my fucking life debating with that,

92
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.220
getting nowhere spinning my wheels.

93
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:29.660
The other person argue with any just fucking went nowhere.

94
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.280
And,
uh,
I dunno,

95
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.180
I got another birthday coming up and I really thought I was past this point in

96
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:39.980
my life.
I don't know why.
Fair enough.
Just didn't pop into my head.

97
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.350
Oh,
I know why.
I know why.

98
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:46.880
Because I was drinking as always when I'm on the fucking road.

99
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.620
And uh,
I decided,
uh,

100
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.060
this morning when I woke up and I was like,

101
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.860
did I really stay out until four in the morning?

102
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.493
<v 2>You know,</v>

103
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 0>trying to just tell somebody why the Beatles are better than a waste cysts in</v>

104
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.930
the foo fighters did.
I really just try to do that,

105
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
that I really sit there and debate fucking the Kevin Durant's rate sometimes at

106
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.940
the top of my lungs until four in the fucking morning.

107
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.970
So now I got to do press it to listen to this shit.

108
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.450
I'm not going to work out this morning.
I could've gone down the street.

109
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.270
I should've gone to fucking bed.
Go back to the room.

110
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.630
That's what I should've done.
I could have gone to bed.
I could have woke up,

111
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.990
gone to the gym.
I could've played drums this morning and I'm not.

112
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.400
It's fucking 12 noon.
Try to get my shit together.
And you know what?

113
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.163
<v 2>I've added.</v>

114
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.440
<v 0>I've had it.
I'm fucking shutting it down.
Shutting it down.
Yeah,
I,</v>

115
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.780
you know what?
No,
I'm no fun,
William.

116
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.920
That's all I'm going to be no fun.
Billy.
Billy.
No Fun.
There you go.

117
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.790
There's my new name.
Billy.
No Fun.
Oh,
Billy.
Back to the room.

118
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.120
I just,
I don't know what a fucking colossal fucking waste.

119
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:06.240
That's all I can think about this morning.
You guys have to do that.

120
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.080
You had to have,

121
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.080
am I the only person who does shit like that goes out and stays out way past the

122
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.920
time.
He should have stayed out debating stupid shit.

123
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.250
Why do I give a fuck if someone likes the red hot chili peppers over fucking,

124
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.130
I dunno.
Fucking poison.
Why?
Why?

125
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.280
And I'm 49 years old on Saturday.

126
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.130
I'm having arguments that I should've been having in like fucking junior high

127
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:37.964
and high school.

128
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.133
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

129
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.720
<v 0>I want to say I took a long,
hard look at myself,
but I didn't,</v>

130
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.810
I kind of laid here with the fucking lights off,
just going like I can't,
yeah.

131
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.080
<v 2>Uh,
I dunno.</v>

132
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.480
<v 0>Then I'm trying to like make excuses.
Well,</v>

133
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:55.630
I'm just upset because I'm not going to see my daughter for the next couple of

134
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.030
days,
so maybe that caused me to be a little more argumentative and then I had to

135
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:00.310
really look at myself and be like,

136
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:03.340
you know what belt now you kind of been a client for a while now

137
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.950
this predates the birth of your daughter.
Um,

138
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.800
so anyways,
no fun Billy.
Oh,

139
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.340
back to the room,
Roger.
That's what I'm going to be.

140
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.173
<v 2>MMM.</v>

141
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.780
<v 0>Yeah.
Tonight I think I'm going to have dinner with an old friend.
Right.</v>

142
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.310
Which sounds like code that I'm going to go out and go do some heroin,
you know?

143
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.320
Isn't that code in the junky world?
Where were you for the last six weeks?

144
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.060
I was having dinner with an old friend,

145
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.520
you know,
we eat standing up,
um,
sorry,

146
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.480
sorry for the heroin jokes considering it's a goddamn epidemic here in the

147
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:50.070
United States.
Um,

148
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.640
but what kind of a jazz are actually a functioning junking listening to this

149
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:57.600
shit right now.
Um,
do you think you could kick her?

150
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.870
Would you ever see people kicking heroin and you think like what?

151
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:05.550
I have it in me.
I mean,
I can't even lay up the booze.
I saw this video one time,

152
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:10.551
this guy just like literally on his knees folded down on top of himself in the

153
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.470
tub,
just feels like with water running over him.

154
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.530
And this woman was sort of giving them shit.
Give me like,
oh,
how do you feel?

155
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.410
Just sort of looks up like,
I can't imagine it,
but,
um,

156
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.540
I've read a couple of rockstars books and they talk about,
you know,

157
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.240
trying to kick heroin and all that stuff and it's,

158
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.890
I dunno why it sounds like fascinating.
Whenever I,

159
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.280
uh,
whenever around in your arms again,

160
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.820
dude,
that songs better than the Beatles.
I like,
I liked that song.

161
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:54.130
Makes me want to get up and go on a power walk.

162
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.350
<v 4>Uh,
no.
Um,
love you much better.</v>

163
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.303
[inaudible] head.

164
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.860
<v 0>Sorry.
Um,
um,
what was I talking about?
Kicking heroin.</v>

165
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:11.090
Who the fuck was that?
That I just think
that's not Spandau Ballet.

166
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.893
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

167
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.380
<v 4>Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh.</v>

168
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.670
<v 0>I know this,
that was spanned.
All right.
One,
two.</v>

169
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.290
Who,
that was a tough summer when that song came out,
you know what I mean?

170
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.220
You'd have a crush on a girl and she pulled up in a car and as much as you loved

171
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:33.420
her,
you just couldn't quite love her as much when she pulled up any,

172
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:34.650
she was listening to that song.

173
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.420
<v 4>Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.</v>

174
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.343
<v 0>You know,</v>

175
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.690
it's kind of impossible if you love music to start to start to sing that song

176
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:47.890
without beginning to cry.
It's such a bad song.
Right.

177
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.980
<v 4>Oh,
oh,
I know</v>

178
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.040
<v 0>this.
Sorry.
Um,
anyways,
I want to thank everybody once again,</v>

179
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.050
as I just mentioned that uh,
helped me come in.
I,

180
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.140
I can't even say I wasn't there from like eight 45 in the morning until four in

181
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:08.010
the afternoon,
just running my,
Yap.
About this show and,
uh,

182
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.830
I got to do it again this afternoon.

183
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:15.810
Then I have a little more in the morning and then I am done and I have like one

184
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.670
more pressing than I think I'm doing.
And then that's it.
That's it.

185
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.270
Then I washed my hands of it.
And if you fucking like it,
you watch it.

186
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:28.050
If you don't,
you don't.
I apologize for the click here and you go,

187
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.370
it's probably was overly loud.
Um,
I get to look at my fucking notes here.

188
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.900
I think Debbie,
buddy,
uh,
I guess I did.

189
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.100
I talked about the guy with the elliptical.
Yes,
I did.
Um,

190
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.490
I'm actually been paying attention a little bit to the Red Sox,
Yankees,

191
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.190
the red sox to new evil empire,

192
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:51.240
$210 million coming down and playing these upstart Yankees,
you know,

193
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.270
all from the farm system,
the Anti Golden State Warriors.

194
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.770
You know what I mean?
You know what the Yankees,
the Yankees in like 99,

195
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:04.330
2000 till,
I don't know,
2009,
2010,

196
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:09.190
right to the end of George Steinberg,
his life.
That was like when Hulk Hogan has,

197
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.300
you know,
he still has the blonde mustache,
but his beard is black,
you know,

198
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.510
he's the bad guy.
And right now what the Yankees are doing,

199
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.980
they're like Hulk Hogan when he has just the blonde mustache and he's a good guy

200
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.700
and he's wearing the red with the orange writing on his fucking ass shorts.

201
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.380
He's not wearing the black shit,

202
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.700
letting you know that for some reason he's in an evil place.
And the,

203
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.780
the red sox right now,
the red sox got the black beard.

204
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:42.400
We are the black bearded fucking blood mustache version of how Cogan coming to

205
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:46.720
town,
throwing a fucking money all over the place,
you know.

206
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.940
Um,
I dunno.
Well,
so we'll see.

207
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.150
But we gotta fucking asses kicked last night.
I think we won the night before.

208
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:59.980
I'm starting to pay attention.
I'm going to get the fucking MLB package.

209
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.180
I'm going to see what $210 million does.
Um,

210
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.160
you know,
I actually think it's,
you know,
it's probably going to be bad.

211
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.160
I'm going to sit there and thinking about having my daughter on my lap watching

212
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:16.960
those games.
I think there's not enough movement for a toddler to issued toddler,

213
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:21.250
I guess a baby to appreciate that.
So what's great about hockey,
by the way,

214
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:25.870
how about those predators coming back and tying up the series?
How about that?

215
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.960
You know,
I'd be very excited if I was a Predator is fan,

216
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.510
but I would still be nervous obviously playing the penguins.

217
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.810
And I'll tell you why was because of the way Crosby's celebrated that breakaway

218
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.040
goal the other night.

219
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.520
I loved that he just went in a fucking scores the goal and rather than flipping

220
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:46.680
out,
he just,

221
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.250
he puts his arms out to the side to bring in the teammates.
Like all right,

222
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:56.251
there's one like total fucking business look on his face.

223
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:56.741
You know,

224
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:59.640
every time the Predator score they're doing like the fucking mock arena.

225
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.140
You know what I mean?
They're doing the electric slide,

226
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.960
they've fist pump and they're going crazy.
They are Christ.

227
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.750
There are a bunch of Goddamn kids acting like they never been there before.

228
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:08.710
And you know what?
They haven't,

229
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.890
and I'm not saying that they're going to lose this series,

230
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:16.891
but I w I would be very concerned if I was to coach or the predators looking at

231
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.070
how,
you know,
cause we just had that fucking assess and look in his face.

232
00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:26.870
So what do you think?
Was it game five if you like competition?

233
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.610
I would watch the Stanley Cup final rather than finals or vinyl versus the NBA

234
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:32.210
finals.

235
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.210
I always forget which one's plural and somebody last year fucking goes,

236
00:14:37.281 --> 00:14:41.750
there's only one final.
There's not too.
And it's like,
all right,

237
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:46.220
well they call it the end.
They call it the NBA finals.
I believe one of them,

238
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:48.650
one of them is fucking plural.
Um,

239
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.190
but the cab game night was fucking great.

240
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.440
I was going nuts cheering right until the goddamn end,
until Duran,
that beast,

241
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.610
you know,
we get that fucking three,
but he really is a fucking monster.

242
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.340
Just a phenomenal player.
Oh my God.

243
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:07.370
Would it be great if he was still on the thunder?
Can you imagine the series,

244
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:10.190
the rematch they would have had,
you know,

245
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.060
they should do that with like a superhero movie.

246
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.940
It just have like superman join Lex Luther

247
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.740
and then they just fly around and run around.

248
00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:27.100
Just beating the shit out of people.
Can Lex was Lex Luthor tough?

249
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.480
What exactly was that guy?
He really had no super powers.

250
00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:35.980
He just was a really negative dude.
Right.
And you comic con people.

251
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:40.970
Can you help me out on that one?
You somehow,
I don't know.
What is the,

252
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.820
he was just sort of an asshole who had hookups to,
uh,
that green shit.

253
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:50.650
Superman doesn't like the fuck.
Is that algae?
Is it a Kale?

254
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.980
What is it that he kryptonite the Kryptonite.
Yeah.

255
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.770
You know what I mean?
I don't,
I don't get that like it comes from the planet.

256
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:03.220
Krypton right.
Isn't that as natural environment?

257
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:07.190
I actually think that that's lazy writing.
You know,

258
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
it comes to the planet Krypton and his one weakness is crip night.

259
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.350
Yeah.
I'm from Earth.

260
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.750
I have super powers in boat.
Just don't get me anywhere near Earth.
Earth.
Oh,

261
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:28.400
night.
Oh,
that's it.
Oh my freckles fall off.
I can't tell jokes anymore.

262
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.070
Maybe that's why this podcast sucks so bad right now.

263
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:35.780
Not because I'm fucking hating what I've done over the last fucking 12 hours to

264
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:39.420
myself.
Maybe it has to do with the fact that uh,

265
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.450
there's some earth at night here in my,
in my apartment.
I don't fucking know.

266
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.850
Anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

267
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.210
after I do the press today and after I do the press to Myra,
um,

268
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.470
I'm going up to Montreal doing two shows on my birthday,
you know,

269
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.490
this is the loneliness of the road.
I just have to like,
um,

270
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.150
you gotta steer into it sometimes and just see the humor in it.

271
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.010
I wanted to the drug store right.
And I was walking through the aisles,

272
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.540
they're trying to find some Burt's bees wax for my fucking dried out lips,

273
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.890
you know,

274
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.500
cause I haven't been drinking enough water or whatever the fuck being a goddamn

275
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.750
idiot out here.
And um,

276
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.320
I walked by this aisle and I saw that they had those numbers.

277
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.090
You know that you put on a birthday cake.

278
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.650
That's sorry I bought a foreign and nine and I'm going to buy myself on Friday

279
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.551
cause I'm not going to have time.

280
00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:38.551
I don't think on my birthday and I'm going to fucking buy myself light those.

281
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.670
And I'm going to take a Selfie of me with a sad look on my face with a little

282
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:45.880
piece of cheesecake.

283
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.250
Happy Birthday to me,

284

I don't,
Oh shit.

286
00:18:00.491 --> 00:18:02.590
I don't know how far into this fucking podcast I am.

287
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.030
This always happens when I go to do this.
All right,
let me,
uh,

288
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.960
let me read the advertising.
Okay.
And I've been getting a ton of shit.

289
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:14.640
Evidently I'm going to,
I'm going to fucking hard on these,
these advertisers.

290
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:16.440
So you know,
in the,

291
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.460
in the spirit of the fact that my daughter is going to go to that,

292
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.160
my daughter in there,
I like dod is going to go to fucking,
um,

293
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.650
college one day,
God knows what the fuck that's going to forget college,
right?

294
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.370
Forget Paris.
They fucking,
what are you going to do now?

295
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:39.430
Now you gotta you gotta pay the Vig to secondary and the like kindergarten

296
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.030
you've got his pay.
Like,
you know,

297
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.250
La schools are so bad if you don't get them in print.

298
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.910
And you've got to get him in private school in the very beginning.

299
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:51.450
You've got to start paying into the system and that gives you a better fucking

300
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:56.230
chance.
Just a better chance of them getting into,
I don't,

301
00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.120
elementary school or middle school is such,
such a rip off.

302
00:19:01.121 --> 00:19:02.830
I don't know what's happening in public schools.

303
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.910
Is it because of the overhead is like so much worse.

304
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:10.210
I was talking about this on somebody's,
Oh Pete Dominick show.

305
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.050
Thank you to him for let me in on a show.
Um,

306
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.330
<v 1>yeah,</v>

307
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.190
<v 0>Pete Dominick show the,
uh,
we were talking about that like when I was a kid,</v>

308
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.980
way back fucking went,
you know,

309
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.360
when you went to public school,

310
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:29.960
like they just had these fucking textbooks that they just kept giving people

311
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.930
year after year after year.
Like,

312
00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:35.150
I remember the late seventies and just seeing like,

313
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.120
like 78 you know,

314
00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:42.140
and you'd see this holistic kids who had it and they would just have like,

315
00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:45.260
you know,
77 78 would be me than somebody.

316
00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:50.120
The year before was 76 77 and it would go all the way back to like the early

317
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.470
sixties or mid sixties so they buy textbooks like once every 15 years.

318
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.023
You know,

319
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.510
your mother went out and bought me a new pair of sneakers and a couple pairs of

320
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.130
Toughskins right.

321
00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:04.340
You had hand me down shirts from the older brother and all you do show up with

322
00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:07.440
the fucking pencil and you are ready to,
and I don't know.
They had,

323
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.720
they had paper,
that's what they need.
They need the need paper or whatever.

324
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.180
And these just,
you know,
hand out these fucking old textbooks.
That was it.

325
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:21.490
That's all they had to do.
And I'm now the kids,
what do they got?
They gotta have,

326
00:20:21.491 --> 00:20:24.970
they gotta have the phones.
They got to have the fucking iPads,

327
00:20:24.971 --> 00:20:26.350
computers and all this shit.

328
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.483
<v 1>MMM.</v>

329
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.020
<v 0>Maybe that's what it is.
The overhead for each fucking kid is like,</v>

330
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.320
like the amount of money that they spend on like one kid who is probably what

331
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:40.650
they spent on like a hundred
well build.

332
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:43.230
Did you do any research to see if that math worked out?
Of course.

333
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:47.890
Now the fuck podcasts you'd think you listened to this on this podcast is not

I thought that that was pretty nice,
but I,
you know,

368
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.650
I think I can be even more pleasant

369
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.280
lift when you drive the right ride sharing app.

370
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.870
Every trip can feel like a walk in the park with Lyft.

371
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.520
I can't do this shit with Lyft.

372
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:18.160
You can pick your own hours and work when you want.

373
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.090
Live can make driving the best job in the world.
Lift.
You know,

374
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.110
I wish they had this one.

375
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:27.280
I was a kid because I would have done this and I had an 83 Ford ranger and I

376
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:31.570
would either have some Weirdo sitting next to me or I would just throw him in

377
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:34.420
the back of the truck.
Sorry ladies.

378
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.250
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating it's people better.

379
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.900
Lift believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun if you're having a

380
00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:47.140
good time.
So are the passengers.
Um,
if you choose,

381
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.630
if you're choosing a ride sharing company to drive for,

382
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.430
go with the company that treats you better.
Lift,
lift offers in APP tipping.

383
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.980
Okay,
but you drive for Lyft.
You could keep one unappreciative of the tips.

384
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.220
Drivers have been paid over $150 million in tips since the feature was

385
00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:11.680
introduced.
Isn't that amazing that that level of cash even exists out there?

386
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.370
Express?
Well,
I guess there's over 300 million people out there,

387
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.500
bill and every other person had a dollar.

388
00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:22.501
You'd have a 150 million express pay lets drivers get paid,

389
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.360
paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

390
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.960
A Lyft has taken the guesswork out of pickups.

391
00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:32.650
The new APP devices uses color coding to help passengers find their drivers.

392
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.670
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips,
want to make more money,

393
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.240
drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

394
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.560
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers being unhappy passengers,
man.

395
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.860
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 lift drivers get a perfect five star rating.

396
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.380
I wonder what happened to the other guy so that joy.

397
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.160

414

I don't design underwear and adventurous patterns.

421
00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:32.040
So you can tailor your undies to make your own personal style.

422
00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:34.620
They mean like banana hammock versus boxer style.

Dude,

469
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:25.850
I have to tell you,

Um,

472
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.710

That's,
you know something.

478
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.600

wife's eyes and say,

511
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:15.690
<v 5>Oh,</v>

512
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.350
<v 0>who's coming down the street?
Who's got freckled feet?</v>

513
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.530
It's Billy and he's having no fun.

514
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.750
That's who I'm going to be over the next fucking,
I dunno how long.
Oh Billy,

515
00:32:27.751 --> 00:32:31.230
no fun.
What can I do to improve my life?

516
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:36.240
I know have less fun.
That's how it works.
That's what aging is.

517
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.590
You know what my problem is?
Lately I've been having too much fun.

518
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:43.520
But the problem is,
is once you're a fucking adult,
you know,
and you,

519
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:46.670
once you move out,
your parents aren't,

520
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.660
your mothers are not there anymore to tell you to,

521
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.250
you know the fucking knock it off.
You have to have your own.

522
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.370
You gotta be your own fucking parent.
I think I used to do a bit on this.

523
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.000
Am I becoming a parody of myself?
Do you guys believe in that?

524
00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:02.190
Can you be a parody yourself?
Or is it does,

525
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:05.970
what it really means is you figured people and figured you out and they're used

526
00:33:05.971 --> 00:33:06.804
to what you do.

527
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.333
<v 2>MMM.</v>

528
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.420
<v 0>How can you be impersonating yourself?</v>

529
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.040
Didn't that guy from fucking Creedence Clearwater revival.

530
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.600
Then you get sued for sounding like Cleveland Credence.

531
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:22.310
John Fogarty is former managers sued him for sounding too much like Creedence

532
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.600
Clearwater revival and he actually,
he actually,

533
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.130
he actually had to go to fucking trial many times that I just say actually new

534
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:30.140
drinking game every time bill says,

535
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.820
actually you have to do a shot laughing my ass off while shaking my head.

536
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.220
Um,
yeah.

537
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:40.460
John Fogarty actually got fucking sued for sounding like too much like credence

538
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:42.230
clear one over providable.
Um,

539
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.250
I think that he had a first ballot hall of fame.

540
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

541
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.980
<v 0>Fucking piece of shit manager.
You know what I mean?</v>

542
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.150
He had one of the worst managers of all God damn time is what I'm trying to say.

543
00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:00.940
Um,
I'm turning this day around people.
This is the new silver me.
Who is that?

544
00:34:00.941 --> 00:34:03.330
Walking down the street?
That's a new,
my new theme sung.

545
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:07.180
Who's the guy with the freckled fee?
It's Billy and he's having no fun.

546
00:34:07.181 --> 00:34:10.810
I'm going to sing that to my wife.
That's how I'm going to wake her up.
Um,

547
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.390
she likes to silly song.
Do you like a silly song?

548
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.230
Do you like the songs that make the whole world sing?
I have a new song for you

549
00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:21.100
now.
You maybe heard of this band.
Okay.

550
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.500
Now I'm not saying there was good as a waste.
This,

551
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.330
I'm not saying there is good as Nickelback.
All right.

552
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.790
I don't want to start a fucking debate here

553
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.620
<v 2>but um,</v>

554
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.250
<v 0>mute.
Matt has a new fucking single lap.</v>

555
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:40.250
I believe it's called hit parade and a,

556
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:42.560
I think that's what you're going to be listening to.
Next mute.

557
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:46.430
Matt is who you met this,
this is amazing band that uh,

558
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.940
the Monday morning podcast on Andrew Stimulus.
Um,

559
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.470
he was the first guy that told me about them and I've seen them in concert two

560
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:58.370
or three times.
They're absolutely fucking amazing.
I mean,

561
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.220
I don't know if this is going to make you want to get on an elliptical.

562
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:06.430
I dunno if this band passes the leg warmer test that my buddies,

563
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.310
you know,
use when they listen to the bands.
Um,
I,

564
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:13.790
but I do think that this will actually make you want to at least,
I dunno,

565
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.320
maybe touch your toes a couple of times.
I have no idea.

is,
is,

569
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:33.230
is in all those fucking guys driving around the track.

570
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:36.140
It's going to be fucking amazing.
I cannot believe that I'm going to that.

571
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.700
And yeah,
that's it.

572
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.560
I'm continuing with my privileged white male life.
You know,

573
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.670
it's unbelievable.

574
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.860
And I only wish people who weren't white male heterosexuals could understand.

575
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.220
Just like,
do you have any fucking idea what it's like to be me right now?

576
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.010
I'm going to open my door.
Okay.

577
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.870
And this is going to be a little gold coin and a USA Today given to me by the

578
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:04.920
government.
I shouldn't tell you this,
but that's what,
that's how white I am.

579
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.230
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

580
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.240
<v 0>The government.
Thanks me every day for it.</v>

581
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.550
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

582
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:20.270
I just tried to touch my screen.
Like,
this is my iPhone.
I love Billy.
No Fun.

583
00:36:20.271 --> 00:36:23.240
Has to kick into overdrive.
You all right?
Enjoy the music.

584
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.840
<v 8>He is a final Straw.</v>

585
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.153
[inaudible]

586
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.573
<v 6>uh,</v>

587
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.893
[inaudible] [inaudible]

588

<v 7>happy birthday to me.

591
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.210
<v 6>me.
See</v>

592
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.120
<v 7>what's going on.</v>

593
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.860
Is built bird some Monday morning podcast that I'm actually doing on Wednesday,

594
00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:19.720
June 10th,
2009,
uh,

595
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.110
my 41st birthday.
And uh,

596
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.130
I'm on the road and I'm going to be on the road here for Awhile and,

597
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:33.970
uh,
I'm on the road for a month and I didn't bring my microphone.

598
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.990
I didn't bring my,
I didn't bring any of that shit.
So the next four podcasts,

599
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.670
they're going to sound like this,
which isn't too bad,

600
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:47.170
but it isn't too great either.
But,
um,
yeah,

601
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:52.350
it's my fucking birthday and I'm a New York City and I'm all by myself and,

602
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.470
uh,
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

603
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.430
I'm going to go eat some oatmeal and take a walk in the park.
Huh?

604
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:05.200
Like a fucking old bastard.
Jesus Christ 41.

605
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:09.280
What happened?
Um,
anyways,

606
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.170
for those of you new to my page,

607
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.830
this is the Monday morning podcasts that I usually do on Monday,

608
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:17.260
and then I can't figure out how to fucking upload it.

609
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.180
So usually it doesn't come out till Tuesday or sometimes until Wednesday.

610
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.140
And uh,
for my 14,
actually 13,

611
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.020
after that fucking chick flipped out on me last week,

612
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.970
my 13 listeners fucked at,
there's got to be still 14.
Somebody came on this week.

613
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.920
I like saint 14.
So for my 14 listeners out there,
um,

614
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.950
the reason why it's taken me till Wednesday to put this thing up is because I'm

615
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.270
on Monday.
Some of you might've seen,

616
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.300
I did the tonight show with Conan O'brien and I had the unbelievable honor of

617
00:39:55.031 --> 00:40:00.031
being the first comedian to be on the tonight show under the Conan O'brien

618
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:04.210
regime.
Um,

619
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.560
it went awesome.
I kind of felt like I was eating my balls up front.

620
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.460
But,
uh,
you know,
when your first joke,

621
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:15.700
the first punchline is that's what you get.
You dumb bitch.

622
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.830
I don't know how many laps you can expect.
If I could have done the set over,

623
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:25.831
I probably would have probably opened with the thing about the girl at the

624
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:29.380
restaurant commenting on how many Asians were in the restaurant.

625
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.150
But then that would have been weird because,
uh,

626
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.000
what would the first laugh be?
This is gonna seem oddly racist.

627
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.030
And then I was like,
well,

628
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.790
this is gonna be awesome.
And if I,
that was my first joke,
then they'd be like,

629
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:51.280
wow,
is this guy like openly racist?

630
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:56.590
Is this what the tonight show under the Conan O'brien regime is going to be
like?

631
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.730
But,
uh,
no,
it was,
it ended up going great.
Um,

632
00:41:00.731 --> 00:41:05.731
I finally got them on board right after I was trashing children and I started

633
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.970
talking about microchipping people and then they got on board and it went great

634
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:13.860
right after that.
And,
uh,
the setups incredible.

635
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.100
And,
uh,
it was,
it was awesome.
Man.

636
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:23.101
I'm looking forward to hopefully doing 9,000 more because it was a,

637
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.620
I dunno,
it was quite a rush.

638
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.160
And for those of you who aren't comedians and you want to know what it's like to

639
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:34.460
do something that,
um,

640
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.560
those sets are actually for me anyways,

641
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.940
I find those that there are a lot harder than,
um,

642
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.900
than actually doing half hour or hour specials because,

643
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.470
um,
it's only four and a half minutes.

644
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:55.840
You can't curse and it's so easy to bomb.

645
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.910
It's,
it's literally the standup version.

646
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.320
You just walking out there with a gun to your head for basically four and a half

647
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:08.030
minutes.
Go and have my funny,
ah,
my still funny about now.

648
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.630
Did you like that one?
Oh,
thank God.
Good night.

649
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.710
That's basically the way it is.
And this is the first time.

650
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.230
Um,
I've had to work out a four and a half minutes set in Los Angeles,

651
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.130
which is a difficult thing to do and I want to thank the,
uh,

652
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:29.120
the Improv and the comedy store for,
uh,

653
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.450
letting me run the set a bunch of times.
But,
uh,

654
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.750
it was la crowds are not New York crowds.

655
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.800
I don't want to start a little fucking biggie Tupac thing going on here.
But,
uh,

656
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.370
one of the last times I did my fucking set,

657
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.250
I went on in front of like eight people and I'm literally waiting to go on.

658
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.230
And this girl comes in bleach blonde hair,
she's talking on her cell phone,

659
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.300
walking right up to the second row is some poor bastards on stage.

660
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:03.350
Just eaten his balls or doing whatever you're doing in front of eight people.

661
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:05.990
Right?
And you know,

662
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.490
she's one of the eight and she's walking in on her phone completely oblivious,

663
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.500
not talking loud,
but you know,

664
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.110
and I was just laughing at myself going like that as a classic La moment right

665
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:18.944
there.

666
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.590
So then I went up to run my set and I'm thinking,
uh,

667
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.590
you know,
this was literally the night before I was going to do it.

668
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.020
And I was like,
alright,

669
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.720
don't like the fact that there's only eight people in the crowd.
Fuck with you.

670
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.390
You know,
just do your thing.
Just commit to everything.
This is no joke,

671
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.890
you know,
before we're doing it tomorrow night.

672
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.920
And I went up and I proceeded to ever so slowly just munch my balls for fucking

673
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.260
five minutes or whatever and uh,

674
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.960
to the end to to the point where I got to the final joke and I didn't even say

675
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:02.000
it,
I just said,
you know what?
You people suck.

676
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.300
And then I started ripping on the girl with the blonde hair and the cell phone

677
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.950
and she's like,
Oh my God,
I'm sorry.
And I'm like,
no,
you're not.

678
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:17.690
You're just embarrassed.
Okay.
I hate when people do that.
You know,

679
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.890
you call them out on their stuff.
Oh God,
I didn't realize.

680
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.740
How do you not know how fucking rude that is?

681
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:30.440
I think I said to wear it to the CRA,
the can't even say the crowd to the group,

682
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.280
to the family of seven,
the other seven fucking people.
I was like,

683
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:39.030
can you imagine being that good looking where you're not even aware that that's

684
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:42.050
rude to do something like that?
I'm,

685
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.720
I'm talking like walking right up to the stage on your cell phone.

686
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.730
She didn't seem to be talking to,
maybe she was just listening to messages.

687
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.780
Maybe I was just freaking out because,
uh,
every other time I did my set,

688
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:57.540
I was fucking bombing.
So anyways,

689
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.740
so I ended my set on the tonight show and I felt like I bombed.

690
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.390
I'm just cause up front,
you know,
they were a little quiet and um,

691
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.820
but I knew I pulled it out,

692
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:13.020
but everybody was nice at the show and everybody was thrilled.
So I was thrilled.

693
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:18.270
And um,
had a real embarrassing moment after I got off stage was,

694
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.070
it's weird when you do those things [inaudible] they just go by so fucking fast.

695
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.780
And I literally,
you know,

696
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:32.010
they wrapped up the end of the show.
And as always,

697
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:33.480
whenever I stand next to Conan,

698
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:38.481
I look like I'm five foot two and that half the emails I get are great set.

699
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.960
Wow.
Conan is really tall and yes,
he is really tall and no,

700
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.160
I am not five foot five.
I'm about five foot 10 just under.

701
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.140
And uh,
I don't know what the fuck he is,
but um,

702
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:56.790
he was a tall individual.
So anyways,
so I walk off stage in all my,
you know,

703
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:58.320
manager,
agent and

704
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.290
all these people in my girlfriend was staying there and I'm so like fucking
like,

705
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.800
was it good?
Was it good?
Everyone's going,
good job,
good job.

706
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.850
And I shook everybody's hand and my girlfriend literally goes,
great job honey.

707
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:16.770
And I shook her hand like she was a fucking a PA

708
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.480
and she literally goes,
just shaking my hand.
What the fuck?

709
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:28.410
And then everyone started laughing at me and I was really,
really embarrassed.

710
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.970
I felt like an idiot.
And I tried to explain how I was.
I was in my head and,
uh,

711
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.330
I don't know.
Then I realized that did go awesome and everyone was smiling and,

712
00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:42.630
and I knew it went great.
I could just tell just the way white people,
people,

713
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:43.230
you know,

714
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.230
when it doesn't go great that there's not a bunch of people standing there

715
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.950
backstage.
And when,
you know,
there are people,

716
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:54.270
they tend to be looking down at the floor or acting as though they have to get

717
00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:57.030
out of there.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It was good.
It was good.
And then they fucking beat it.

718
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.100
And then you want to fucking jump off a building.

719
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.470
So fortunately that didn't happen and I got a ton of great emails of people

720
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:08.460
complimented me on my set and I want to thank everybody who sent those in

721
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:12.540
because uh,
you know,
that was a,
that was a really,

722
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.530
you know,
first guy to be on the Conan O'brien tonight show.

723
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:21.450
I got to tell you guys that's his big as anything I've done.
So,
uh,

724
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:24.610
I'm flying pretty high right now and a,

725
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.020
and I want to thank all you guys for all the really supportive great emails that

726
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:32.710
you guys sent me.
It really,
you know,
I was definitely,
uh,

727
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.700
one of those points in your career where you sit back for a second,

728
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:40.180
make sure you take it in.
So I want to thank everybody and uh,

729
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:43.390
I'd read all the good emails,
but uh,
those ones are never funny,

730
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.360
but you know what are funny are the ones when I get trashed.

731
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:51.190
So why don't I read one of those?
Okay.
Um,
this is an email,

732
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:52.000
um,

733
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
that is about my tonight show set and it is titled in all capitals.

734
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.520
No more shiny suits.
All right,
here we go.

735
00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.910
So strap in for this one.
Bill,

736
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.790
I was so happy to see you on Kona tonight.

737
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:14.560
I am a huge fan for years and I was so excited to see you perform.

738
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.390
But what the fuck are you thinking with the shiny suits?

739
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:25.230
This shiny gray suit with the shiny purple shirt was positively all capitals

740
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.040
distracting.

741
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.450
Whoever is in charge of your wardrobe needs to be cut.

742
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.800
If it is your girlfriend.
She needs to understand the east coast,

743
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:38.320
west coast different difference.

744
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.920
La is pretty much a bunch of,

745
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.720
I don't know what this word is.
P R o g.
E n Y.

746
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.563
Prague.
Annie.

747
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:54.210
She tried to say phony anyways is a bunch of uh,

748
00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:59.030
somethings of Hollywood or Stanford or modeling companies.

749
00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:04.810
You are the Boston blue collar hockey loving reality spewing comedian,

750
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:06.523
comedian.

751
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:11.210
You are the dude who only wears a suit to funerals and maybe weddings.

752
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.900
Am I,
I didn't know that.
If it was Conan show,

753
00:49:14.901 --> 00:49:17.720
who made you aware that they are idiots?

754
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.670
Oh,
have you know sweetheart,
I love suits and I love wearing them.

755
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.090
I love that.
I'm the blue code blue collar.
I can fucking barely hammer a nail.

756
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.480
What?
Cause I say fuck a lot.
I love all people just,

757
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.800
they just think like you're this one dimensional individual.

758
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.590
I do love hockey,
but that doesn't mean I can't wear a suit.

759
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:43.560
I don't even know it.

760
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:49.180
Are you doing like a caricature of of of a person really?

761
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.870
He says fuck a lot.
That means he only weighs two.
All right,

762
00:49:53.871 --> 00:49:57.110
let's just read the rest of this.
All right.
If it was Conan show,
right?
Okay.

763
00:49:57.111 --> 00:50:00.950
The battery joke was great,
but otherwise I could not stop thinking.

764
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.510
Why is he wearing that shiny suit?
What's going on?

765
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.220
Was that really what you were thinking?
You were watching me.

766
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.610
I could see you going.
Why is he wearing that shiny suit?

767
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.370
But did you literally think what's going on?

768
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.100
Did you think something happened like they fucking,

769
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.010
they stuck a microchip in the back of my head.
What's going on?

770
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.800
What have they done to him anyways?

771
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.650
You dated yourself so much,

772
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.840
especially since you are growing your hair again,
which I think is a great idea,

773
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:42.781
sweetheart.

774
00:50:42.781 --> 00:50:46.230
I'm actually growing up because I am doing a small part in a movie and they

775
00:50:46.231 --> 00:50:50.670
asked me to grow it back out and the second it's over,
I'm shaving it again.

776
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:55.410
All right,
so,
uh,
when I'm glad you think it's a great idea.
Anyways,

777
00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.240
wearing a suit,
you did not look like yourself at all.
Capital Letters.

778
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.530
I have been a fan since I saw you on the Cam Neely special over 15 years ago and

779
00:51:06.151 --> 00:51:09.390
you have always been that guy who says what everyone thinks,

780
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.770
but please do not ever wear that suit on stage again.

781
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.230
Jesus Christ was it that bad?
Anyways,

782
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.920
your comedy is very street quotes,

783
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.040
every man quotes and socially and racially inclusive.

784
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:34.250
But to see you wearing an awful shiny early nineties outfit was almost

785
00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:37.350
heartbreaking.
But even even worse,

786
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.530
it was all capitals distracting.

787
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.690
I just kept thinking,
good God,
he is a cute guy.

788
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.270
What the Hell is he wearing?

789
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:54.570
You thought all this and four and a half fucking minutes if keeps going.

790
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:55.643
There we go.

791
00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:00.180
It is part of your routine to be the regular guy in quotes.

792
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.190
Quotes again.
Regular guys do not wear suits on Monday night.

793
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.133
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.780
<v 7>Get on your jeans and casual,</v>

795
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.750
buttoned down shirt and your audience will laugh again.

796
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:19.600
What did you have a feed to?
Everyone who enjoys my comedy anyways.

797
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.000
Uh,
she said I'm in New York City.

798
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.390
The opinion that La tried to start trends.

799
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:31.410
What the opinion that La tried to start trends but only New York City can do.

800
00:52:32.321 --> 00:52:36.160
It is true.
Bring back the real bill burr.

801
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.220
I love the real bill.

802
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:42.520
<v 2>How fucked up is that?</v>

803
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.040
<v 7>I just emailed her back and I just wrote,
you are out of your mind.</v>

804
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.660
Um,
God,
there was so much fucking hilarious shit.

805
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:57.170
I love that she felt it was so distracting.
I thought what it was over.

806
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.930
Please do not ever wear a suit on stage again.

807
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.350
You would think that at that point,
you know,
27 paragraphs,

808
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.300
she had made her point and she goes back into it again saying,
I'm very street.

809
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:11.180
Very every man sweetheart,
you don't know anything about me.

810
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:14.480
I grew up in the suburbs.
It was very safe.

811
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.490
My parents are professionals.
Uh,
we just happen to grow up in a blue collar town.

812
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:25.010
I lived on the east coast,
so all of us sound like we understand plumbing.
I,

813
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.020
I do have a little toolbox.
Um,

814
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.510
my knowledge of car engines are as a changing the oil in the air filter.

815
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.640
I tried to change a fuel filter.

816
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:40.260
I did that a couple times successfully and one time I actually at least snapped

817
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:45.261
it off and I had to have my truck towed down to,

818
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:49.260
uh,
to the fucking garage.

819
00:53:49.261 --> 00:53:54.261
And I told the guy I snapped it off and I left the fuel filter on the seat.

820
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:57.450
Evidently he didn't listen to me and one of his guys got in the car,

821
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.560
started the truck up,

822
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.680
gas when all over the engine and my truck burned to the ground.

823
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:06.510
And then the guy tried to call me up in guerrilla his way through it.
You know,

824
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:10.910
going,
what the fuck you told me you twisted it.

825
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:16.100
We just had a fire.
That's what he kept saying.
We just had a fire.
And I was like,

826
00:54:16.101 --> 00:54:21.040
no,
dude,
you just had a fire.
Okay.
I told you,
I twist.

827
00:54:21.041 --> 00:54:23.890
You said you snack.
Yeah.
You said you twisted.
I said,
no.
I said,

828
00:54:23.891 --> 00:54:28.210
I snapped it off I go,
I left the fucking fuel filter right on the Goddamn seat.

829
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.470
He goes,
you know what?
I'm so fucking sick.
You guys,
you know,

830
00:54:32.471 --> 00:54:36.010
you start the jobs and you fuck it up and then you bring it down to me.

831
00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.260
Yeah,
my truck is broken.
Fix it.
You fucking cunt.

832
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.610
You're a mechanic.
What did other people bring cars in that a totally fixed.

833
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:52.300
Ah,
that's a whole nother fucking story.
Um,
and now you're probably saying,
well,

834
00:54:52.301 --> 00:54:56.140
look it,
look it.
You drove a truck.
That means you're blue collar.
Now.
It doesn't,

835
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:02.170
it does,
it.
I just,
you know,
it was a car.
There was a truck and I,
I,
you know,

836
00:55:02.171 --> 00:55:05.290
I could afford it and I was 17,
so I bought it.

837
00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:08.950
And I also had this idea that I was going to deliver papers in the morning and

838
00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:11.080
make some more money,
you know?

839
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:15.250
And then I'd also have my afternoon job cause that's what I was into.
And uh,

840
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.710
when I told people at school that that's what I was going to do,

841
00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:22.390
they were all like two,
four,
you're going to be a paper boy.
What are you a fag?

842
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:27.870
And then I immediately ditch that idea cause I had no confidence in myself.

843
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.270
And,
uh,
then I had some stupid truck that I didn't use.

844
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:36.970
But that's a whole nother story.
Um,
and getting back to me,
uh,
in the suit,

845
00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.160
um,
shiny suit,
uh,
in real life.
It's not shiny.

846
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.740
I can't help HD television.

847
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:49.150
Hd Television makes everything look way more fucking vivid,

848
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.380
you know,
like colors.
I mean,
come on.
You know,

849
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.510
when you go to a baseball game,
can you see the pores of the players?

850
00:55:58.511 --> 00:56:03.130
I mean it's fucking,
it's too weird,
man.
I'm actually not a fan of HDTV.

851
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:07.570
I wish they had the big screen TVs and they just went back to regular TV.

852
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:12.430
Cause uh,
I'm not really a fan of that.
And as far as your New York City,

853
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.290
Los Angeles,
your big finger on the pulse of fashion.
That was actually,

854
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.360
I bought it at Barney's in New York,
in La.
I get,
what do they not have?

855
00:56:22.361 --> 00:56:26.800
The suits that they in New York.
And it was also,
I believe it was a Gucci suit,

856
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.420
which is made in Italy.

857
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.290
So that has nothing to do with Los Angeles and a,

858
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:36.200
I'm not street and I'm not every man.
Okay.

859
00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:41.060
You know,
you sound like a casting director.
Yeah.

860
00:56:41.061 --> 00:56:42.480
So I just wrote back to her,
uh,

861
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:47.570
you are out of your mind because I wasn't really gonna waste the fucking time of

862
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:52.680
,
uh,
you know,
I don't know.

863
00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:55.980
Trying to fucking explain all that,
but you know,
that's what happens.
People,

864
00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:00.270
that's what happens when you,
uh,
that's the internet.
You know,

865
00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:04.110
what the fuck was,
I don't give a shit.
You could fucking literally,
I dunno,

866
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.240
Cura disease and that would still be somebody going,

867
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.430
what the fuck were you thinking?
You know,

868
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.230
Karen Cancer,
do you realize what that's gonna do?

869
00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.520
The World Joe already overpopulated and what the fuck was with those shiny

870
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:25.420
scrubs?
Um,
anyways,

871
00:57:25.421 --> 00:57:28.840
who gives a fuck?
Who gives a fuck?
I got to do the tonight show.
Actually,

872
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.710
I actually,
when that email came out,
I got it,
uh,

873
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.150
probably about maybe three hours after I did the tonight show.

874
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:42.330
And it's really funny living on the West Coast because I'm obviously,

875
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:45.700
I'm used to living on the east coast and when you're on the east coast,

876
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.460
you take the show,
um,

877
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.300
just before 6:00 PM is when you go on,
they take from five to six,

878
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.340
so you've got five hours before anybody sees it.
But um,

879
00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.830
you know,
and then people out in La,
you know,

880
00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:02.230
it's eight hours and then you tape it out in La.

881
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:05.470
It's like you'd do it and literally three hours later people that are out

882
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:09.280
sending you emails about it.
So I had just,
you know,

883
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:12.820
I went out and I had a steak dinner and all that stuff.
Had a great fucking time,

884
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.170
felt like 1 million bucks.
And I was sitting there and uh,
when I got the email,

885
00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.160
um,
I actually,
I read it to my girlfriend and we got a,

886
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.610
we both had a really big laugh when we were reading it,
just,

887
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.740
just how long it was and uh,
and our description of me,

888
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.910
um,
I dunno,
Jesus Christ,

889
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:38.320
let me talking about this as almost as long as the fucking email.
Um,
yeah.

890
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:41.230
So they go with that email.
You actually learned some shit about me.

891
00:58:41.231 --> 00:58:45.440
I happen to love suits.
I love it wearing them and um,

892
00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.890
but not shitty suits,
you know,

893
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.190
I really don't like wearing shitty suits.
And to be honest with you,

894
00:58:52.191 --> 00:58:55.040
anytime I do a late night talk show,

895
00:58:55.041 --> 00:58:59.780
I always go out and I buy a brand new suit and I always go to Barney's and I

896
00:58:59.781 --> 00:59:04.640
usually spend three times what I'm making on whatever the talk show is.

897
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:09.420
And the talk show you get paid scale,
which is a,

898
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:14.990
I dunno,
what the fuck is it like 900 bucks.
So,
you know.

899
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.350
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

900
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.390
<v 7>I Dunno if that lady who wrote it,
if you're listening,</v>

901
00:59:18.391 --> 00:59:23.391
if you wonder why I wear a suit and it's the host of the show is wearing a suit,

902
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.880
you know what I'm saying?
You dress for the room.

903
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.570
I'm not going to come out there and look like somebody they just pulled out of

904
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:33.320
the crowd.
You know,
it's funny,
I really have to explain this every fucking time.

905
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:37.460
I do.
I do the,
uh,
I do one of these late night talk shows.

906
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:40.670
I don't understand why people,
you know,

907
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:43.670
don't you notice when the actress come out,
they're all wearing suits.

908
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:47.120
They're all dressed up.
They wear a jacket,
you dress nice.
Women come out,

909
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.350
you know,
dressed to the nines,
you know,

910
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.070
I guess people who are characters and maybe whores.

911
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.850
Didn't Madonna come out with like no panties on one time or something?

912
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.240
Was that will Ferrell or he just came out wearing leather panties?

913
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.750
I can't fucking remember.
I,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

914
01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:11.180
I Dunno what to tell you.
Um,
I love the suit and I love the shirt and uh,

915
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.770
you know,
I got quite a collection.
I think I've got like five or six of them.

916
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:21.320
Got a couple of navy blues.
I've got a nice brown one.
I got one other one.

917
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.240
I don't know what the fuck color it is.
And I said,
you know what,

918
01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:26.450
I'm going to go with a nice charcoal gray this time,
you know,

919
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.980
and then get a shirt on underneath to make it pop bags,
zoom,
you know?

920
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.820
But evidently it was unbelievably,
unbelievably distracting.

921
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.920
Um,
Jesus Christ believing in autumn 22 minutes into this fucking podcast,

922
01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:41.540
I was really worried that,
uh,

923
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.230
I wasn't gonna have enough shit this week because I'm,

924
01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:49.490
I can't get on the Internet here in my hotel room.
Um,

925
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.021
all right,

926
01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:55.010
so what can I talk about here to fucking flesh this out and give you a nice half

927
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.190
hour.
Got to give at least a half hour here.
Uh,
yeah.

928
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:01.970
So I'm in New York and I'm going to be doing,
um,
my next,
uh,

929
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.900
I think I got five or six more days shooting on this film and I'm,

930
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.950
I'm having the time of my life.
And,
uh,

931
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.100
even though I'm only shooting six days and I'm out here for a month,

932
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:20.600
I am going to go be going down to the set,
watching the other actors,

933
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:25.550
trying to learn that whole side of a,
of this business because,

934
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.950
uh,
I've obviously,
I don't know,

935
01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:31.400
I've never done a big movie before and it's pretty,
uh,

936
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:36.290
it's pretty,
it's pretty amazing.
It's pretty amazing.
So I'm trying to figure out,

937
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.910
um,
you know,

938
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.480
just go down there and watch the actors that know what the hell they're doing,

939
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.950
how they do different takes and they do all that type of stuff.
And,
uh,

940
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.400
I don't know.
It's pretty a pretty awesome time in my life.

941
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.380
It's the exact reason why I moved out to La.

942
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:56.210
I wanted to start getting bit parts in movies and,
um,

943
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:01.070
you know,
yeah.
And just keep doing standup and,
uh,

944
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.390
that's what the fuck I'm doing.
And uh,
I dunno.

945
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.300
I Dunno what the fuck to tell you.
It's my birthday,

946
01:02:08.301 --> 01:02:11.050
so I don't know what I'm going to do.
I wrote,
I'm going to do,

947
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.900
I've got a fucking workout.
I eat hay,

948
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.630
the worst God damn pizza last night here in New York.
I couldn't believe it.

949
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.230
I've had better pizza in La.

950
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.520
I ordered for one of those famous Ray's pizza places,
which,
you know,

951
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.730
aren't the best.
I know.
I'm going to get a ton of emails going or what do you,

952
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.210
out of your fucking mind?
Famous raised four constructs all with the,

953
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.730
you got to go down to Fuckin a with the fuck.
Is that place right off of,
uh,

954
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.800
sixth avenue down the village.

955
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.250
I know where that place is that literally Joe's pizza,
whatever the fuck it is.

956
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:47.310
Um,
I'm actually a fan of sudden pizza over on first avenue with just a couple of

957
01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:51.930
blocks north of,
uh,
danger fields.
I Dunno why I like it.

958
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:55.440
There's something about their sauce.
Gives a nice little zing.
Oh.

959
01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.000
And also I used to live up that way and that used to be my last spot of the

960
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.620
night.
Back in the day when I used to live in New York,
when,
uh,
they,

961
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:06.240
I guess nowadays they're booking the club's a month at a time,

962
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.490
but back in the day,
you know,

963
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:12.480
when I moved to New York in 1995 children,

964
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:14.190
um,

965
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.460
and they didn't have hybrid cars and they couldn't listen to your phone calls.

966
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:23.760
Um,
it was unbelievable to be a comedian,
to be a young,

967
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.830
young comic moving to New York City.
And um,

968
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:34.190
you basically on the weekend you could do anywhere from eight shows all the way

969
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:38.490
up to like maybe like 10 or 11.
Once you got up to 10,

970
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:39.720
it was pretty much pushing it.

971
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:44.490
And how you would do it is you would put your avails in with all the clubs

972
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:47.220
around the city.
And I used to work the comic strip,

973
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.450
that was the first club I got into and there was the Boston comedy club,

974
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.900
the comedy cellar stand up New York.

975
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.370
Um,
and then later on was danger fields

976
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:05.130
when I finally got into there.
And you just lead in each,
each club left,

977
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.930
you left your veils on different days.

978
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:11.160
So you could kind of set it up and you could just do a run all the way around

979
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:14.220
the city and you just leave avails a,
hey,
this is bill burr.

980
01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:17.880
I'm leaving my avails for this weekend.
Just to let you know,

981
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:22.881
I got a nine 20 at the comic strip and I got an 1125 spot at stand up New York.

982
01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:26.940
And then the seller would work around those spots.
Give you a couple more.

983
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.030
The Boston Comedy Club would give you a couple more and then you would just

984
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:34.680
start your night and you know,
you jump in a cab,

985
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.130
you do your spot,
you'd run out,
you grab a cab,
then you go down town,

986
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:41.550
backup town back downtown bay.

987
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.400
You know what the funny thing was is he ended up blowing and half you fucking

988
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:49.170
gig money on uh,
doing like a cab and all the comics.

989
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:53.880
You just be running around town doing spots and uh,
you know,
people,

990
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.390
sometimes your spots would be really close together and you'd call a buddy of

991
01:04:57.391 --> 01:05:00.270
yours.
Do what time's your next spot?
Can you do me favor?

992
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.300
Can you do the 1125 and then I'll do your 1150 spot.

993
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:07.140
Can you do that just cause I have a,
all right man.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll cover for you.

994
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.830
And it was just fucking amazing.
It was fucking amazing.
And like,

995
01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:14.370
and then the end of the nine,
you get 50 bucks a spot,

996
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.490
cash and then the end of the night you just,

997
01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:23.350
you'd have this big wad of cash in your pocket and you'd hang out with all your

998
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:24.520
other comedy friends,

999
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:28.390
you've comedian friends and you get a slice of pizza and then you just sit,

1000
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:31.270
stand around.
You know,
it'd probably be like two in the morning,

1001
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:32.110
two 30 in the morning,

1002
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:36.670
you do your last spot and then you just stand around breaking balls until like

1003
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:41.020
four or five in the morning as the sun's coming up.
And uh,

1004
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:45.730
at that point I was actually living in an apartment with a Robert Kelly,

1005
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.680
hilarious comedian,
one of my great friends in this business.
And,
uh,
I remember,

1006
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:52.720
you know,

1007
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.510
that was way back in the day and we become an home and the sun would be coming

1008
01:05:55.511 --> 01:06:00.250
up and everybody would be getting ready to go off to work.
And uh,

1009
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:04.450
you just felt like you were getting away with murder.
It was literally the,

1010
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:09.451
a standup comedy version of good fellas is the closest I ever felt like I was in

1011
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:14.470
Goodfellas was when I would come home when the sun was coming up.
And,
uh,

1012
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.780
you know,
that whole little,
uh,

1013
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.560
narration where,
uh,

1014
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:24.130
whatever ray Liotta talks about fucking what it was like to be in the mob,

1015
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:29.020
how they didn't pay for Shit and all the regular people who went to work where a

1016
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:29.860
bunch of saps,

1017
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.860
that's literally what you felt like you decide everybody going to fucking work

1018
01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:35.170
and you're just like,
Eh,
I'm not,

1019
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:39.440
I think I'm going to go fucking sleep till two in the afternoon,
get up,

1020
01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:44.380
play video games,
and then fucking do this all over again.
It was great.

1021
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.580
It was a fucking great time in my life and I swear to God,
I still,
uh,

1022
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.360
even with all the cool shit that I did this week,
I,
I swear to God,

1023
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:54.600
it's like that part of my career that's,

1024
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.610
it's still on par with everything that happened this week.
Uh,

1025
01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:03.190
I don't know.
Look at me.
I'm having a little touching podcast here.

1026
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:08.191
A little file should add like little fucking a man is not a du Du du.

1027
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.000
I left out a lot of shit,

1028
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:13.090
like all the fucking psycho chicks I used to date and the chick who fucking

1029
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.400
stocked me and all that type of stuff.
That was a fucking,
so it wasn't all good.

1030
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.670
But you know what I mean?
You tend to Romanticize the shit when you're younger.

1031
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.230
I'm actually sitting here right now looking at a picture of my dog,
Cleo,

1032
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.540
and I can't tell you how much I missed that fucking dog.

1033
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:33.580
I absolutely loved that dog.
It's ridiculous.

1034
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.960
Fucking dog was not even in my life like a month ago.
And now,
like,

1035
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:40.450
I'm already thinking about that.
You know,

1036
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:44.680
someday the dog's going to die and how fucking awful I'm going to feel.

1037
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.140
But,
uh,
it's a greatest fucking dog and the planet.
It's just,

1038
01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:52.420
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

1039
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.080
And my girlfriend actually took it out over to a friend's house who also had a

1040
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:59.560
dog and it's the first time it was off the leash and you know,

1041
01:07:59.561 --> 01:08:01.870
it's still a puppy.
So like a year and a half.

1042
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.450
And I guess once it realized it was off the leash,

1043
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:08.200
it was running around like a maniac,
Kevin,
the time of its life.

1044
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.970
And I missed it and I was unbelievably depressed that I missed it.

1045
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:18.090
I literally felt like I missed my firstborn taking his first steps and uh,

1046
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.300
yeah,
I don't know what to tell you.
I fucking love that dog.

1047
01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.890
And if you're thinking about getting a dog,

1048
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:28.430
if there's any way you can do what you gotta do it,
it's the greatest thing ever.

1049
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.590
And go down to the pound and grab one dude,
they're free.
Fuck all this,

1050
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:36.610
this rescuing shit.
I hate when people say that I rescued it.

1051
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.350
Like you pulled it out of a fire.
You know,

1052
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.040
you got it for free.
All right?
You're not a hero.
You're a cheap fuck.
Um,

1053
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.800
now I know it's a great thing to do.
Um,
you know what you like?

1054
01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.560
You like a Ann landers there in that show,

1055
01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:59.270
that movie a dead man walking Susan Surandon.
That's her name.
You know,

1056
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:01.700
that's what you like.
If you actually could have saved Sean Penn,

1057
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.040
that's what you like.
Uh,
but anyways,
I don't know what the fuck else to talk.

1058
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.120
I'll tell you about,
I told you a lot of personal stories,

1059
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:12.890
so I feel like I did my Goddamn job this weekend,
uh,
about those red sox.

1060
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.860
Huh?
Ah,
his Raleigh Yankee fans are like,
ah,
you motherfucker,

1061
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:20.480
you mother fucker.
I am a motherfucker.
All right.

1062
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.540
And we've beat new six games in a row.
How does that feel?

1063
01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.940
How does that feel with your $400 million on three people?
Uh,

1064
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:32.960
all Aga Burnett out there looking like he's in deliverance.
You know,

1065
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:36.200
he looked like he should have been sitting outside of fucking gas station in the

1066
01:09:36.201 --> 01:09:40.880
forties in the south.
Why does,
in his uniform fit?

1067
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:43.760
I want to send him a big long fucking email.

1068
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.870
I really appreciate you serving up all those meatballs to the Red Sox,

1069
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.840
but your uniform was so distracting.

1070
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.720
You're from the Toronto Blue Jays.

1071
01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:57.620
You're a hockey loving fucking pubic haired mustache.
I don't know.

1072
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.910
Um,
anyways,
I got a buddy of mine,
a comedian,

1073
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:04.430
he's a big time fucking Yankee Fan and uh,

1074
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.640
he keeps trying to get all excited about this team and I'm just like,

1075
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:09.320
I just keep breaking his balls going to,

1076
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.200
you guys spent four and a million dollars on three fucking guys.

1077
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.270
You should be in first place.

1078
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:18.830
There's no excitement when you spend that kind of fucking money,

1079
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:20.443
you know?

1080
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:25.340
That's what I can't stand about Yankee fans is they actually have the nerve to

1081
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:29.510
get excited about the team that they bought.
You know,

1082
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.840
it's obnoxious.
What you have is fucking obnoxious.
It's like,

1083
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:37.370
it's like a bunch of ninth graders playing a bunch of third graders,
you know,

1084
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.440
a GC to fork in yaggies.
Oh,

1085
01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:43.880
they fucking swept the royals over the,
yeah,

1086
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:48.800
they spend 90 times what the fucking royal spent.
You know,

1087
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:53.360
why don't you do with the Red Sox?
Do we add a couple of big time free agents?

1088
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:56.600
Then you let your farm too.
Oh that's right.
You're not a good organization,

1089
01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.400
but you got a lot of money.
Look at you and yet,

1090
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:04.850
Oh and six against the red sox.
You know,
that's got to hurt.
Hey,

1091
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:08.600
I saw somebody do a thing,
a this when I was in a,
this is,
there's a,

1092
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:12.050
there's a sports guy here in New York that I really like.
Uh,

1093
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.640
he used to wear sweaters all the time.
I don't know what his name is.

1094
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:18.450
He's got the white hair and he's got a really hardcore New York accent.

1095
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:23.590
He's on TV and uh,
I don't know.
He,
he,
you know,

1096
01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.460
talk about a regular guy.
He really seems like a sports bar.

1097
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:29.200
Like it Kinda guy hangs out in a sports bar.
You know,

1098
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:32.220
when he'd sit around breaking balls and that type of shit.
But you know,

1099
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.840
he's on TV wearing a suit.

1100
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.770
Why do you think that his sweetheart maybe cause he's on TV.

1101
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:41.790
He wants to look presentable.
I forget the guy's name,
but I really like him.

1102
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:45.420
You know,
he's like Yankees were up in Boston and they didn't do nothing.

1103
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.380
He literally talks like that.
He's fucking great.
But uh,
he was talking about,

1104
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:49.591
you know,

1105
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:52.860
what's the biggest rivalry in sports and people keep saying the Yankees,

1106
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.470
red sox and uh,
I dunno,

1107
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:01.830
I dunno if it is anymore.
You know,
it's weird.
It's weird.

1108
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.820
Somebody was trying to say,

1109
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.110
and it ended in 2004 but you know what's funny was people used to say before

1110
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:09.600
2004 like,
dude,
this isn't even a rivalry.

1111
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.020
A rivalry is when you've got two evenly matched teams for the most part.

1112
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.520
And they go back and forth.

1113
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:18.750
And I could definitely tell you before 2004 we did not go back and forth.

1114
01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.340
We got our asses handed to us.

1115
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:25.320
So now it actually is a rivalry because we do go back and forth.

1116
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:30.030
But the weird fucking thing is it was all about breaking the curse.

1117
01:12:30.031 --> 01:12:33.330
And now that we did it,
you know,
dad,
86 years of,

1118
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:37.300
of Shit talk and hanging over your head to be lifted.
I don't know.
It's,

1119
01:12:37.301 --> 01:12:38.880
it's really not the same thing.

1120
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.370
I was talking to a buddy of mine about that last night on the phone and uh,

1121
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.280
I dunno,
I think the after seen on Hbo,

1122
01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:50.190
I saw this thing about the Ohio state Buckeye,

1123
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:55.191
Michigan Wolverine rivalry and I challenge any Yankee or red sox fan to watch

1124
01:12:55.771 --> 01:13:00.771
that thing and t and you and to act as though fucking red sox Yankees is at that

1125
01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:03.690
level.
Cause I got news for you.
It isn't,

1126
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.370
those people are fucking maniacs out there.
I actually went to a Michigan,

1127
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:12.330
Ohio state game.
How great is my fucking life to hell was I doing,

1128
01:13:12.331 --> 01:13:15.180
I was doing some sort of road gig and I,
I got some,

1129
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:19.230
I got tickets to it.
This is back on.

1130
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:23.010
The only guy I can really remember was playing was that wide receiver a Boston

1131
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.300
for uh,
Ohio state was playing.
It was the late nineties.

1132
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:31.050
And um,
I don't fucking know.

1133
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:34.530
All I know is I've never been to a sporting of 100,000,

1134
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.610
like 105,000 people showed up,

1135
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.610
hundred and five fucking thousand people.

1136
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.440
And there was like another 30,000 people outside trying to buy tickets.
I,

1137
01:13:46.441 --> 01:13:47.274
you know,

1138
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.790
the only other thing I've seen bigger than that as the Indianapolis 500,

1139
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:54.240
which I don't know how many people that fucking holds,
but I mean

1140
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:59.550
you're talking about cars going 200 miles an hour.
So,

1141
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:04.560
and there's people surrounding the entire thing.
Um,
I kind of lost track there.

1142
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:05.820
I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say.

1143
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.000
Every time that time I went to fucking a the Indianapolis 500,

1144
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:12.130
it's a fucking great time.
You can bring

1145
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.370
<v 0>your own booze in there.
You bring it,
you get,
you get low.
This is what you do.</v>

1146
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.450
You just buy as much fucking beer as humanly possible.

1147
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:22.390
Don't get hard stuff cause you're going to pass out by the fi halfway through

1148
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.670
the race,
right?
And you're going to hit by some debris,

1149
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.810
but you bring a fucking cooler in there and it's all these fucking crazy redneck

1150
01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:32.530
fans.
And uh,
you know,

1151
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:35.830
the car's just go flying by.
He can't really see shit.

1152
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:39.190
All you do is hope that somebody crashes in front of you.
And then when they do,

1153
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:41.920
they hit the wall and then they just keep fucking going.

1154
01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.120
It's not like they hit the wall and just stop,

1155
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.020
<v 7>you know they hit the wall.
It's just,</v>

1156
01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:50.620
it's like a fucking cartoon and that's all you hear.

1157
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:53.260
You just stand there and you just hear him coming around the corner just here.

1158
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.633
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1159
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.160
<v 7>that she is usually either the first guy,</v>

1160
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:06.350
the last guy and then at their kind of bunched together.
You just here

1161
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.243
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1162
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.300
<v 7>it's pretty good,
right?</v>

1163
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:20.920
Cause I fucking heard it for about fuck God damn hours getting shit faced and

1164
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:24.300
there's nothing to do.
So what you do is you go in there and I dunno,

1165
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:26.170
there's like 40 cars or something like that,

1166
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:29.860
that race and everybody just starts gambling,
right?

1167
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.590
And if you're there with four other guys each,

1168
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.580
he gets 10 fucking cars and everybody throws in a 100 bucks and then you just

1169
01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:38.980
start looking for you guys,
right?

1170
01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:41.560
And all of a sudden they're going around next time to come back around.

1171
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.300
You notice one of you guys is a day like what the fuck happened to him?

1172
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.220
And then you're like,
ah,
God damn it,
he hit the wall.
Shit,
I'm down to nine guys.

1173
01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.850
It actually,
it actually stays interesting.
I went two years in a row.

1174
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:59.960
I went in [inaudible] 95 and in [inaudible] 96 and uh,

1175
01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:03.200
I definitely recommend it.
I know what the fuck I'm talking about here.

1176
01:16:03.201 --> 01:16:05.030
People I don't even know,

1177
01:16:05.031 --> 01:16:08.780
I don't have my fucking computers on because I'm in this hotel and I can't sign

1178
01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:13.720
up for the Goddamn,
uh,
the Internet.
So,
um,
I dunno,

1179
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm going to be in New York for a month and I'm going to be popping around the

1180
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.930
clubs doing spots.
Um,
I haven't left avails yet,

1181
01:16:20.931 --> 01:16:25.610
but if you're in the New York City area and you want to watch me and a bunch of

1182
01:16:25.611 --> 01:16:28.150
other great comics,
I'll probably be going up down the seller,

1183
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.160
maybe the comic strip,
Caroline's,

1184
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:35.630
I'll probably pop into a Gotham,

1185
01:16:35.631 --> 01:16:38.570
all these fucking places and uh,
I'll be doing 10 minutes,

1186
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:42.360
try out some new shit and um,

1187
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:46.360
I'll be in a great mood because,
uh,
that's what I always find.

1188
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.030
There's this euphoria after you do one of those late night talk shows,

1189
01:16:50.031 --> 01:16:53.810
because you got to do what you got the rush of doing it and it went well and the

1190
01:16:53.811 --> 01:16:58.070
pressure of doing it is lifted and uh,

1191
01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:01.280
you know,
and then it's your birthday and you're like,

1192
01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:04.550
I'm going to go buy a fucking slice,
a red velvet cake.

1193
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:06.680
That's what I'm going to do,
you know?

1194
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:11.000
[inaudible] and stick a candle in it and just singing happy birthday to myself

1195
01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.020
and just see if anybody else in the restaurant either joins in or if they just

1196
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:16.820
look at me like I'm a complete psycho.

1197
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.560
I wish I had the acting chops to start singing that to myself and then actually

1198
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:24.230
breaking down crying.
I want if I would,
uh,

1199
01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.340
uh,
fuck.
Alright.
So that's it.

1200
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:34.460
That's the Monday morning podcast I did here on Wednesday.
Sorry,

1201
01:17:34.461 --> 01:17:37.560
it took me a couple of days,
but I had a big week and a,

1202
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.480
sorry about the production value of a,
the podcast isn't going to be that good,

1203
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:46.700
uh,
over the next couple of weeks as I hang in here in New York.
And that said,

1204
01:17:46.701 --> 01:17:50.960
I hope all you guys have a great week and a,
and that is it.

1205
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.570
And a happy birthday to me.

1206
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.863
<v 6>All right.</v>
