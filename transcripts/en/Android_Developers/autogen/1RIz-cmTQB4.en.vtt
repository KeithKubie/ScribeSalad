like you know choosing weapons and they
 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.310
like you know choosing weapons and they
actually made really sure that the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320
actually made really sure that the
 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.650
actually made really sure that the
localization was for all of that all

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660
localization was for all of that all
 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.129

a gamer in that region would that take a
 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.670
a gamer in that region would that take a
sense enough like a machine language

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680
sense enough like a machine language
 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.310
sense enough like a machine language
like machine translation language yeah

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320
like machine translation language yeah
 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.839
like machine translation language yeah
is like as far as some of my Korean

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849
is like as far as some of my Korean
 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.430

even know it was developed by a European
 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.960
even know it was developed by a European
developer so that's a good sign mm-hmm

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970
developer so that's a good sign mm-hmm
 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.960
developer so that's a good sign mm-hmm
let's talk about a funnel layer in the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970
let's talk about a funnel layer in the
 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.810
let's talk about a funnel layer in the
Asian language you can see their eyes

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820
Asian language you can see their eyes
 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.570
Asian language you can see their eyes
their Asian language is pretty different

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580
their Asian language is pretty different
 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.270
their Asian language is pretty different
from the English within the game and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280
from the English within the game and
 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.270
from the English within the game and
then so you can see that layout is it's

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280
then so you can see that layout is it's
 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.990
then so you can see that layout is it's
pretty using the pretty weird font and

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000
pretty using the pretty weird font and
 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.450
pretty using the pretty weird font and
also their layout is pretty blocking in

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460
also their layout is pretty blocking in
 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.700
also their layout is pretty blocking in
the agent wonders so the one thing you

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710
the agent wonders so the one thing you
 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.770
the agent wonders so the one thing you
do have to keep in mind is that you know

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780
do have to keep in mind is that you know
 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.350
do have to keep in mind is that you know
a

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
a
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.029
a
languages do present a little bit

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039
languages do present a little bit
 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.149
languages do present a little bit
differently from what English or some of

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159
differently from what English or some of
 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.040
differently from what English or some of
the European languages can put into a

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050
the European languages can put into a
 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.270
the European languages can put into a
game so sometimes you really got to

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280
game so sometimes you really got to
 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.619
game so sometimes you really got to
watch whether your menu button is

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629
watch whether your menu button is
 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.990
watch whether your menu button is
actually big enough to fit that in Asian

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000
actually big enough to fit that in Asian
 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.550
actually big enough to fit that in Asian
language so this is definitely you

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560
language so this is definitely you
 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.629
language so this is definitely you
should take it in mind definitely

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639
should take it in mind definitely
 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.580
should take it in mind definitely
something to tell your QA teams to check

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590
something to tell your QA teams to check
 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.399
something to tell your QA teams to check
