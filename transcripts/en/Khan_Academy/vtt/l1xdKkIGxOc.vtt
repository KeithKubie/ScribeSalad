00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.058
- [Voiceover] A secant line intersects

00:00:02.058 --> 00:00:06.772
the curve y = 2x squared + 1 at two points

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.939
with x-coordinates 4 and 4 +
h, where h does not equal 0.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.902
What is the slope of the
secant line in terms of h?

00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:19.493
Your answer must be fully
expanded and simplified.

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:21.837
We know the two points that
are on the secant line.

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:23.661
It might not be obvious
from how they wrote it

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.213
but let's make a little table here

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:28.446
to make that a little bit clearer.

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:32.613
We have x and then we
have y = 2x squared + 1.

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:38.829
So we know that when x = 4,

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.696
what is y going to be equal to?

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:45.863
It's gonna be 2(4 squared) + 1

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:51.732
which is the same thing as 2(16) +1

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.712
which is the same thing as 32 + 1

00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.712
so it is going to be 33.

00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:05.153
What about when x = 4 + h?

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:11.569
Well it's going to be 2(4 +h)squared + 1.

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:17.852
That's going to be 2 times, let's see,

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:22.019
(4 + h)squared is going to be 16 +

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:26.745
8h + h squared

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.498
and then we have our + 1 still

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:32.963
and if we distribute the 2

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:37.130
that's going to get us to
32 + 16h + 2h squared + 1

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.090
and then we add the 32 to the 1

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.810
and actually I'm gonna
switch the order a little bit

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.490
so I have the highest degree term first

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.907
so it's going to be 2h squared + 16h

00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:55.165
and then + 32 + 1 is 33.

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:58.158
We have these two points.

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:01.421
We have one point (4, 33)

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.588
and we have the other point
(4+h, 2h squared + 16h + 33)

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.893
and we just have to find the slope

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:13.884
between these two points

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.853
because the secant line
contains both of these points.

00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:18.716
How do we find the slope of a line?

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.299
We do change in y / change in x.

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:24.608
What's our change in y?

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:25.944
If we view this as the end point

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:27.000
and this as the starting point,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.593
our change in y is going
to be this minus that.

00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:34.760
It's going to be 2h
squared + 16h + 33 - 33,

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.423
those two are going to
cancel each other out,

00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:47.317
and then over, what's our change in x?

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:49.887
If we ended at 4 + h

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:51.061
but then we started at 4

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.978
so it's gonna be 4 + h - 4.

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:57.951
These two cancel each with each other

00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.048
and we are left with

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:03.131
2h squared + 16h / h.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.768
We can divide everything in

00:03:09.768 --> 00:03:11.991
the numerator and denominator by h

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.471
and what are we going to get?

00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:14.951
This is going to be 1.

00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:16.216
That's just a 1.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.151
This is just an h.

00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.679
We have 2h + 16 / 1.

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.429
Or just 2h + 16.

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:29.683
And we're done.

00:03:29.683 --> 00:03:33.308
This is the slope of the
secant line in terms of h.

00:03:33.308 --> 00:03:34.829
Once again we just have to think about

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.883
well the secant line
contains the point (4,f(4))

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:41.467
or 2 times 4 squared + 1 right over here

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:43.772
and, well I didn't call this f(x)

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:46.045
but I think you get the idea,

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.598
and then when x is 4 + h

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:48.621
this is going to be y

00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:52.788
and we just found the slope
between these two points.
