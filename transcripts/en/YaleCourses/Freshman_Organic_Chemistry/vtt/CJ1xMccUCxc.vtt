1
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.970
At the end last time we asked the question whether molecular mechanics programs

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.720
are useful,
and the answer is yes.
In fact,

3
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:14.721
there really nowadays indispensable for evaluating the energy of molecules and

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:18.330
their shapes.
But are they true?

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.430
Are they really fundamentally correct?

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.450
The same way we believe quantum mechanics to be fundamentally correct?

7
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.340
And the answer to that is certainly no.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
We already saw how there they depend on so many arbitrary parameters that are

9
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.630
just adjusted to try to fit data from some molecules.

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
And then there's the hope that they'll fit other molecules and sometimes they do

11
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.510
and sometimes they don't.
They usually do pretty well,

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.560
but there can be special cases that differ for some reason and it's hard to

13
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.970
predict those ahead of time.

14
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.540
So one has to look at them with a certain grain of salt.

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.250
Okay.
Uh,
a good example of,

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.310
of where they're demonstrably incorrect is in the question of Vander walls

17
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:06.840
radii.
I,
for example,

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
the contact between two bromine atoms that are not bonded to one another.

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
So we're going to make a plot showing the bromine attached to carbon.

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.180
And we're going to do this in the same spirit that done,
it's in his grew,
uh,

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750
looked at,
uh,
means attacking carbon.
We're going to look at many,

22
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.600
many crystal structures and we're going to have,

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.890
we're going to rotate the various structures so that they have a CBR bond that

24
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.000
lines up right there.

25
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.790
And then we're going to see how far it is to the nearest neighboring bromine

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.790
from some other molecule.
Okay.

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.950
And now what would we expect?
Well,
there's a certain Vander walls,

28
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.210
radius for bromine.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.650
So the next neighbor should have it's bromine in contact with that one.

30
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.390
So we should go that radius again to get to a neighbor.

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.610
And there should be various directions of course,
where the neighbor could be,

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.500
but always at that same distance if they are in contact with one another.
Okay?

33
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540
So there should be,
uh,
uh,
an arc of a circle like that.
So if we,

34
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.321
if we make the,

35
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.680
if we rotate these various crystal structures that have been determined,

36
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.780
so the sea and Vr lineup there and the other br lies in the plane,

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.150
the neighboring br from another molecule,

38
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.010
then the closest they should get is along that dashed red line.

39
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.091
Now of course,

40
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.720
there could be others that are further away that aren't in contact,

41
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.720
and in fact there could be some that are a little bit closer.

42
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.270
You'd really expect something to be a little bit closer because there's Vander

43
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.070
walls attraction out to infinite distance at least to great,

44
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.060
to substantial distance much further than where they are actually in contact.

45
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.150
They're attracting one another.
So these,
these,

46
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:55.800
this bromine is part of a molecule that has many atoms in it and the other

47
00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:00.640
bromine is part of a molecule that has many Adams and all these other atoms are

48
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.880
attracting one another,
pulling toward one another.

49
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.660
Now of course that would just collapse except for the fact that the ones,

50
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.200
the closest ones run into one another.

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.620
But that means that they should get slightly closer than just precise contact

52
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.730
because they're being pushed together by all the other bollock Adam's in those

53
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:26.140
molecules.
So we would expect neighbors the be slightly closer.

54
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:30.520
Some of the neighbors at least to be slightly closer than this dander,
walls,

55
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.310
radius,
they're double the Vander walls,
radius,

56
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.300
whatever the van der walls radius means.
All right?

57
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.700
The question is where you get that.
But at any rate,
we could make that,

58
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.150
you can look up in a book and see what they say.

59
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.490
The van der waals radius of bromine is,
and make a plot like this,

60
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:49.990
and then you'll put points on it for all the different crystal structures of

61
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.940
where neighboring bromines are and they look like this.
I'll say,

62
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.390
here's what I just said,
the balance,

63
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.880
attractive and repulsive forces between neighbors.

64
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.070
The closest Adam's must be a little bit too close,
okay?
And here's what you see.

65
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.233
And indeed,

66
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.680
some of the atoms in some of the cases are a little bit too close.

67
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.490
And of course many are further because other atoms are running into one another

68
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:15.860
of these two molecules.
Okay.
Well,

69
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.050
what do you notice in particular that you find particularly,
uh,

70
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.430
curious about this plot?
Anything,

71
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.440
John,
you
can't hear very well.

72
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.990
It's not circular.
It's in the lips,
right?

73
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:39.550
There are many more inside the red dashed line at the top,

74
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.030
then out to the side.
So what do you infer from that?

75
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.770
About the shape of the bromine atom?

76
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.900
Correct?
It's not spherical.

77
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.020
<v 1>Right.
Okay.</v>

78
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.760
<v 0>So the bromine,
Adam seem not to be spherical,
right?</v>

79
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.180
But every molecular mechanics program calculates Vander walls interactions

80
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:10.960
between Adams as if they are spherical at the interaction depends only on the

81
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.660
distance,
not on the direction,
right?

82
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.820
So clearly molecular mechanics programs are not perfect,
right?

83
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:22.060
But still they're pretty good and you couldn't get interesting information at

84
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.800
them.
Plus from them.

85
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.610
Plus they can tell you something about why something might be the way it is,

86
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.990
right?
Tortional energy and things like that.
Okay.
And in fact,

87
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.450
if you're trying to deal with a big molecule,

88
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.450
it's hopeless to do quantum mechanics on it.

89
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.950
So here's a angia stat,
which is an anticancer drug.

90
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.850
And this is the large,
at least as of a couple of years ago,

91
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.260
I suspect it's still the case.

92
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.850
This is the largest molecule whose shape has been optimized by quantum

93
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:59.600
mechanics,
right,
and not a really high level of quantum mechanics.

94
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.710
It was,

95
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.710
here's a description of it from Mike Frisch from Gaussian incorporated in 2003

96
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.930
he said we optimize kringle one,
which is this thing,

97
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.680
I don't know why you call it kringle one with the am one method,

98
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.681
which is a very low level of quantum mechanics using Gaussian oh three

99
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.590
plasminogen kringle one contains 1200 atoms,

100
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.920
which are made up of 642 non hydrogen atoms and 578 hydrogen atoms.

101
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.680
The job takes about 650 optimization steps starting from the molecular mechanics

102
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.880
geometry.
So first they use molecular mechanics to get the approximate structure.

103
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.110
And then they started adjusting that with quantum mechanics step by step until

104
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:46.520
after 650 steps,
they got to a minimum of energy.
And that's this energy.

105
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.530
But obviously this is not an everyday occurrence to do something like this.

106
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.740
So if you're dealing with a big biological molecule,

107
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.740
you have to use molecular mechanics,
right?

108
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.870
But you know that fundamentally it's not right.
It may get a lot of things right,

109
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.980
but don't believe that it came down from Sinai on the tablets,
right?

110
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.560
Yes.
Lucas,
they,
uh,
I don't know.

111
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:15.080
We could ask him sometime.
He's around here from time to time.

112
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.460
I haven't set it up.
They come in.

113
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.110
Okay.
So quantum mechanics is pretty close as we believe to the truth.

114
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.710
Molecular mechanics isn't close to the truth.
For practical purposes,

115
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.760
it's indispensable.

116
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.660
Now we wonder whether the standard structural model of molecules that we have is

117
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:43.100
realistic and it's geometric detail things about bonds,
bond lengths,

118
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.510
bond angles and so on.
And how are we going to know whether it is,

119
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
we're going to use x ray de fraction to see just how regular bond distances are.

120
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.551
Okay.

121
00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.120
Now we're helped in this by what's called the Cambridge structural database and

122
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.160
Cambridge in England.

123
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.960
There's this a building where people sit and collect ex-ray structure data from

124
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.730
all over the world and,
and uh,
make it a computer searchable and so on.

125
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.840
So that you can look at many,

126
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:15.140
many structures and you see that many structures are available.

127
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.140
This is how many structures there are as of any particular year in the Cambridge

128
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:21.860
structural database.

129
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:26.861
And you see it's up to about a half a million x structures have been determined

130
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.600
and put in the Cambridge database.
As of now,

131
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.990
you can click on there and go to the website to see it if you want.

132
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.090
It's interesting.
Okay.

133
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:38.690
And they predict that there'll be half a million by 2010

134
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.360
okay.
Now how many atoms are there,
and this is how many structures,

135
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:49.160
how many atoms are there?
How many bonds in each structure?
Well,
as time goes on,

136
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.280
as Xray is able to do more and more complicated molecules.

137
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.110
So that at the beginning there were only about an average of 27 Adam's in a

138
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.944
structure,

139
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.190
but by 1982 there were 44 and by 1990 there were 54 and by after 2002 or

140
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:08.911
something like that,

141
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.090
there were 73 so the molecules are getting bigger and bigger.

142
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.230
And as of now,
as at least as of last January,

143
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.650
the last issue of the database,
there were 30 million,

144
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.260
30 and a half million Adam positions,
x,
Y,

145
00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:25.920
z coordinates available,
right?

146
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.240
And of course there are many more bonds than there are atoms because most atoms

147
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.440
for several bonds.

148
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.730
So there are greater than 40 million bond distances available.

149
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.970
Now the question is how regular are they?

150
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.360
Do Carbon carbon bond distances tend to be the same?

151
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.260
Well,
in 1987,

152
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.860
when the Cambridge data database was much smaller than it is now,

153
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.340
it was already large enough to do pretty good statistics on this thing.

154
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.150
And here's a paper published in that year that you could look at if you want to,

155
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.520
uh,
by people from the,
the,
uh,

156
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.570
crystal graphic data center in Cambridge that talked about this subject.

157
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.080
Now here's a table that shows how many different kinds of bonds they divided the

158
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:18.210
experimental data into.
So that within any given type,

159
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.840
the bonds would all be about the same length,
right?

160
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:25.470
It's not surprising that different types of bonds have different lengths,

161
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.520
but if you subdivide that like double bonds and single bonds will be different

162
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:32.160
lengths,
right?
So those would be at least two types.

163
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.720
But notice how many types they used.
So for example,

164
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.020
there are 119 different types of carbon oxygen bonds that they did statistics

165
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:48.780
on,
not bonds,
but types of bonds.
Okay.
Now here,

166
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.390
here are those 119 different types.

167
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.630
They're 60 types that are made up of an sp three carbon bonded to an o of type

168
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:04.161
two and there are 17 types of bonds,

169
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.420
which have s p squared carbon bonded to that type of,
of carbon.

170
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.140
Oh two means the oxygen is bonded to two different atoms.

171
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.810
Oh one it's bonded to just want Adam,
right?

172
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.760
There are four types where that's an aromatic carbon that's bonded to a dive Ala

173
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.860
Doxygen,
and they're 38 we're an SP squared car,

174
00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:28.230
but as bonded to an oxygen that makes bonds to only one carbon.

175
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:33.120
That is a CEO double bond.
So there are 38 different types of CEO double bonds,

176
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.000
okay.
Or in the case of CNN,

177
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:40.800
they're 97 different types of CN bonds in this,
in their tabulation.

178
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:46.050
And for carbon,
there are 175 different types of carbon carbon bonds.

179
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.290
And notice that there are 27 different types of carbon carbon bonds where both

180
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:55.540
the carbons are p cubed hybridized,
right?

181
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.190
So they're dividing this and the lots and lots of different categories in order

182
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:04.970
to get regularity within each category.
Now let's,
uh,

183
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.770
let's look here at,
at uh,

184
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.820
the one that those 27 different kinds of bonds that are carbon s p cubed to

185
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.150
carbon SB cubed.
Okay?
So for each,

186
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.210
for each type is given the mean and the median two kinds of average of the bod

187
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.930
distance.
What the standard deviation is,
how,
how many,
uh,

188
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.980
what the distance is that splits off the,
the,
the shortest one,

189
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.770
fourth and the longest.
One fourth.

190
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.810
And then how many different examples there were to do this,
this,
uh,

191
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.790
the,
to,
to make this statistics on,
okay,
so now in this table,

192
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.260
see,
with a pound sign means any sp three carbon.

193
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.920
So at the top there we see a ch a ch three bonded to ch two so that's the bond

194
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:59.881
distance we're interested in methyl to ch two but that ch two has some other sp

195
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:03.130
three carbon on it,
right?
So that's one type of bond.

196
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.020
And you notice the mean distance is 1.513 and if it's,

197
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.040
if there are two sp three carbons on the second carbon,

198
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.060
then it's 1.5 to four average.
And if there are three of them,

199
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.010
it's 1.53 for now.

200
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:23.011
Notice the standard deviation is about 1% of the bond distance.

201
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.880
So within that class,

202
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.410
they're all within about plus or minus 1% right?

203
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:32.980
So a very small deviations.
So they,
they wanted to get them,

204
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.250
they wanted to make the classes restricted enough that you'd have a predictable

205
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:42.730
bond distance,
right?
Within 1% okay?

206
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.170
Notice that crowding seems to stretch the bond.

207
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.310
As you put more carbons on that second carbon,
which is bonded to methyl,

208
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.370
the bond to methyl gets longer and longer,

209
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.980
longer by a little less than 1%.

210
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.180
As you put more crowding on the second carbon,
here's a graph of it,

211
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.250
right?
Of that,
uh,
the standard deviation and the mean,
right?

212
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:10.930
So you'll see it gets as you go from one are to two hours to three hours on the

213
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:13.690
second carbon,
the bond gets a little longer and a little longer,

214
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:17.200
although they can overlap.
Okay?
Now,

215
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.000
then we go down to here where both carbons are substituted.

216
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.640
So the first carbon has,
uh,

217
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.940
two or three carbons on it and the second car,

218
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:30.280
but also has two or three carbons on it.

219
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.810
And now you see there's still more crowding.
It gets,
they get longer and longer.

220
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.740
And in fact,
when you have three other carbons on each of the carbons,

221
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:40.330
who's bond you're interested in,

222
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.140
then those others repel one another by van der walls.
Repulsion.

223
00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.480
And it gets actually pretty long,
right?

224
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.200
It gets almost 10% L'Oreal 7% longer or something like that.

225
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.600
So anyhow,
you can get these kinds of regularities based on the,
the,
uh,

226
00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.610
statistics and if you want to just an overall average carbon carbon bond

227
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:04.300
distance,
uh,
it's about 1.53 angst rooms,

228
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.090
okay.
However,
if you have psycholo propane or cycle of butane,

229
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.190
then the bonds are in the case of cycle of wrote propane,

230
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.220
unusually short 1.51 and in the case of cycle of butane unusually long,

231
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.370
1.55.
Okay.

232
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.350
Now if you have sp three sp two as a carbon carbon bond rather than sp three sp

233
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:36.740
three,
then what would you expect?

234
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.210
Would you expect to shorter bond or a longer bond?
If one of them is sp squared,

235
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.633
just guess

236
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.120
sp squared means you'll get better overlap,
stronger bond,

237
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.070
probably a shorter bond.
This,
a little review for you here.

238
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.480
Okay.
And indeed,
1.5 is the average.
So there,

239
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.730
there are hundreds and hundreds of these as you can see in this,

240
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.230
in this particular paper.

241
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.520
But if you want just order of magnitude things,

242
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.240
actually it's better than an order of magnitude.
But for carbon,

243
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.050
carbon single bonds,
it's about 1.53 ons.

244
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:22.700
Drums for double bonds,
1.32 for triple bonds,

245
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:27.410
1.18 and for aromatic bonds they within a benzene ring,

246
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.720
these are one and a half bonds.

247
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.490
So not surprisingly they come between single and double.

248
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.250
Okay.
Notice there are a little closer to double than they are to single

249
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.610
1.3820000000000001 1.32 as opposed to 1.38 versus 1.53 does it surprise you that

250
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:49.670
they're a little closer to double than single

251
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.120
notice?

252
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.120
Even if they were single bonds but between carbons that were part of aromatic

253
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:04.190
rings,
it would be s p squared,
s p squared,

254
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.320
carbon carbon bonds and we've already seen that those would be unusually short.

255
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.070
Right?
So you don't expect it to be one and a half.

256
00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:16.760
The average between a normal single in a normal double if you think about it

257
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:19.700
with a little more sophistication.
Okay.

258
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.270
And then as we see here,
a single,

259
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:27.350
if it's sp three sp squared is 1.5 in a single.
If it's sp squared,

260
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:32.351
sp squared is 1.46 so the 1.38 is closer to being halfway between 1.46 and 1.32

261
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.020
than it is between 1.53 and 1.32.

262
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:43.370
So depending on how accurate your model needs to be,

263
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:48.610
you can get pretty good guesses based on values you advised in the table.

264
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.100
Now you

265
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.410
<v 2>can see some interesting,
uh,</v>

266
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.350
departures from regularity in a,
here,

267
00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.380
I'll show it in carbon to Matt in aromatic carbon to nitrogen bonds.

268
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.100
So there's a,
an anilin derivative.

269
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:08.430
Anaplan is Amino benzene.
Okay,

270
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:11.640
so there's that red bond is the bond we're talking about and there's the

271
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:16.350
distribution,
a histogram of distances.
What's funny about the Histogram,

272
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.140
Dana?
There's a hole in the middle,
right?

273
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.740
It's by modal,
right?

274
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.160
So it looks like there are two different kinds of bonds between nitrogen and

275
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.860
aromatic carbon.
Now let's split them out.

276
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:41.300
The ones that are in one and the ones that are in the other and see how,

277
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.140
why they have this difference.

278
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.030
It turns out that if you do once where the nitrogen and the benzene are coke

279
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:50.610
planer as shown above,

280
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.310
then you have one nice histogram.

281
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.910
And if the nitrogen is pyramidal rather than being a planer,

282
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.460
then it's another histogram.

283
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.760
So it depends on whether the nitrogen is playing or or pyramidal.

284
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.360
But when the nitrogen is plainer,

285
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.900
it's Cope Planar with the benzene and for good reason,

286
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.380
it's so that the unshared pair on the nitrogen can be localized into vacant

287
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:21.390
orbitals Pi orbitals of the benzene ring.

288
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.080
So that makes this carbon to nitrogen bond a little bit,

289
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.840
double bond like,
and shortens it.

290
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.440
Whereas if the nitrogen is twisted compared to the benzene,

291
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.240
then there's no reason for it to be flat,

292
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.770
to have a p orbital that will overlap with the,
with the benzine or bundles.

293
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.400
So it becomes pyramidal.
But more importantly,

294
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.630
there's no double bond character anymore to the carbon nitrogen bond.

295
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.640
So the bonds are longer than the ones that are partial double bonds.

296
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:57.760
So that's why it's by modal.
So you'll learn something from these,
uh,
uh,

297
00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.130
statistical analysis.

298
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:03.720
You have poor Pi overlapped when the nitrogen carbon bond is twisted.

299
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:05.821
Now,

300
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:10.821
how complex must've bottled B in order to predict useful structures.

301
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.790
So from the point of view of the Cambridge,
uh,
compilers,

302
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.920
they wanted to get standard deviations in bond distance of about 1% as you saw

303
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:22.650
from the table.
And in order to do this,
as you saw,

304
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:26.520
they needed a 175 different kinds of cc bonds

305
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.160
differing in these various ways as we've illustrated and 97 different types of

306
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:39.831
CN and 119 different types of CEO bonds and 682 different kinds of bonds all

307
00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:45.720
together in their tape in there tabulation.
Okay,

308
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:49.330
now we have,
uh,
uh,
ambitious goals.

309
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:54.040
We want to understand all stuff chemicals.
That is okay.
Uh,

310
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.650
we wonder how things behave,

311
00:20:56.651 --> 00:21:01.000
their properties and their chemical transformations as well.
Right?

312
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.070
And the key to doing this,

313
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.050
the trick we're going to use is to understand the basis of structure,

314
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.420
how the atoms are arranged and energy.

315
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.290
And we want to do this in terms of bonds.

316
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.720
You could do it entirely without bonds.

317
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.940
Just use quantum mechanics to minimize energies of,
of atoms,

318
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.940
of arrangements,
of atoms,
and calculate those energies.

319
00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:27.700
And you'd have that same information,
structured energy,

320
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.780
but you wouldn't understand anything.
You couldn't predict anything in your head.

321
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.610
With bonds,
you have a tool that will allow you to predict things.

322
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.550
Okay?
So let's just see how well bonds do.

323
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.470
Obviously they're going to be corrections having to do with confirmation and

324
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.270
strain as we've been talking about.

325
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.470
But is there an underlying energy for a given composition or a given

326
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:58.030
constitution,
a given set of bonds?
Can you predict energy as well as structure?

327
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.190
In other words,
how standard our bond energies,

328
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:06.070
if we're going to do our understanding in terms of bonds,

329
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.400
can you add up energies for all the bonds and get the overall energy for the

330
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:13.780
molecule knowing of course,

331
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:17.710
that they're going to be corrections for strain and so on?
Okay.
So,
uh,

332
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.780
this started in 1868 already in the very first issue.

333
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.290
The second paper of the first issue of the German,
uh,

334
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.450
chemical journal came Cheveria data,

335
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.520
which was the journal of the Chemical Society of Berlin.

336
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.550
The second paper ever in that journal was on the regularity and calculation of

337
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:41.800
heat,
of combustion,
of organic compounds.

338
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.140
So Herrmann was interested in this because he was a physiologist and he wanted

339
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:51.940
to know how much,
uh,
energy you get out of the food you burn up in your body,

340
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.430
right?
So could you predict on the basis of what substances you eat,

341
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.190
how much energy could be available?
Okay,

342
00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:05.191
so for physiology led him to study this and there was another paper very shortly

343
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:10.210
after that in the same journal by Oppenheim on the relationship of heat of

344
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:14.890
combustion with the constitution of substance,
right?

345
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.890
So could you look at the constitution?
He didn't mean it yet.

346
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:21.280
Constitution notices 1868 still pretty early days.

347
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.850
He didn't mean constitution to mean nature and sequence of bonds,

348
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:29.200
he just mean meant what was in there.
Okay.
So how did they try to do this?

349
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:34.240
Could we do it the way they did it?
Uh,
by predicting the heat of combustion,

350
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:36.160
how much hate you get out of burning a thing?

351
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.710
Say just by how much carbon and hydrogen,

352
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:42.310
we know you can burn carbon coal and get a certain amount of heat out.

353
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.980
We know you can burn hydrogen gas and getting a certain amount of heat out.

354
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.500
Could you take a substance,

355
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:52.670
know how much carbon and how much hydrogen is in it and predict how much heat

356
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:57.530
you'll get out of burning it.
Right.
It would be great if that were true.
Okay,

357
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.880
so let's see how well it works.
So you,
you're going to compare to graphite.

358
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.570
That's a carbon and hydrogen,
right?

359
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:10.150
So we'd have a certain number of atoms per mole and uh,
and,

360
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.790
and then we know how,
what the heat of combustion is for per mole,

361
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:18.791
you get 94 kilocalories out of burning a mole of graphite,

362
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.410
mole of carbon and graphite.

363
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.270
You get a 57.8 out of burning hydrogen.

364
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.550
Okay.
That's per,
uh,
Gotcha.

365
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.500
I'd love to see,
I think that's per Adam not per molecule.
We'll see.
Yeah,
no,

366
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.160
it's per h two.
Okay.

367
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.460
So it's 94.05 per carbon and 57.8 per age too.

368
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.061
Okay.

369
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:49.061
Now you take some other substance like ethene c two h four right?

370
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:55.511
So you should get two times 94.05 for the carbon and two times 57.8 because it's

371
00:24:57.681 --> 00:25:02.660
57.8 for every two hydrogens.
You got four hydrogens.
So two times that.

372
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.870
So you should get 303.7 out of burning a mole of ethene.

373
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.460
Right?
In fact,
you get 316 right?
Which isn't bad.

374
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.660
It's a,
it's a error of 12 kilocalories per mole,

375
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:22.661
but that's only 4% so you're pretty close already in predicting that now.

376
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:26.420
So we can be optimistic,
but let's try something else.

377
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.960
Notice we can even understand why you get a little more heat out than you

378
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:39.350
expected because one of the bonds in c two h four is not such a strong bond,

379
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.340
right?
The second bond to the double bond is so strong.
So you,

380
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.540
so you expect the starting material not to be as stable as it might've been.

381
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.810
It's a little higher in energy than it would've been if that second bond was

382
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.880
really good.
So when you burn it,

383
00:25:55.881 --> 00:26:00.080
you get more heat out because there was more in it to begin with,
right?

384
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200
It was less stable to begin with.
So we can understand that.

385
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.830
Now let's try to extend it to other things.
How about cyclohexane?

386
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.530
There we have six carbons and 12 hydrogens.

387
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:14.531
You'd predict 911 it turns out to be 881 it's off by 29 but that's only a 3%

388
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:20.780
error,
right?
Not Bad.
We're doing well.
Now,
how about cyclohexane?

389
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:25.400
All right.
There again,
it has,
since it has the same amount,

390
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.420
you don't expect to get anything out of oxygen because it's already,

391
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.190
you can know the opposite eyes.
Oxygen,
right?
In birding,

392
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.830
it's only the carbon and hydrogen that you oxidize.

393
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.960
So you predict exactly the same 911 it's the same amount of hydrogen and carbon.

394
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:39.860
Uh,

395
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.860
but you only get out 842 instead of 880 so now you're off by 68 kilocalories per

396
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:49.320
mole or 8% and if you take sugar,

397
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.710
which is again c six h 12 but oh six now,

398
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.070
now you get out only 670 you're off by 240 so you're making a 36% error.

399
00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:03.120
Now it's getting pretty bad.
Right?
Does that surprise you

400
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.910
that when there's oxygen in the molecule,
you get less out by burning,

401
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.850
less heat out,
by burning,
when there's already oxygen there?

402
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:19.770
What is burning?
What do you do?

403
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.450
You're oxidizing.
If these are already partly oxidized,

404
00:27:24.451 --> 00:27:27.590
if they have oxygen in them.
So you've already gone partway,

405
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.430
you don't expect to get so much out anymore.
Right.
Okay.
So that,
that,

406
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:36.360
that makes sense.
They're partially pre oxidized.
So you make bigger,

407
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.890
you make errors in this.
So for fuel purposes,
for physiology,

408
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.330
this isn't so bad,

409
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:46.290
especially you could include some kind of correction for every oxygen that's

410
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:49.200
already there,
part way to the product then.

411
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.550
Then you'd get numbers that you know within a five maybe 10% are going to be

412
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:58.230
right,
so you actually could add up the just from the composition,

413
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.980
add up what atoms are there and predict how much heat you could get out by

414
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:05.250
burning right now,

415
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.560
but might you need a more complex model if what your goal is is to predict

416
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:15.180
chemically useful energies rather than just ones that say how much energy you're

417
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:19.190
going to get by burning your chocolate bar or whatever.
Okay.

418
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.060
For physiology purposes,

419
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:25.920
you might be content with plus or minus 5% but for predicting the equilibrium

420
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.360
constant between Cyclo,

421
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:31.070
hexane and cyclohexene all suppose there were some reaction oxidation reaction

422
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.470
where you,

423
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.470
where you can convert one to the other and you're all going to be off by a 1%

424
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.200
say which would be nine kilocalories per mole,

425
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.570
so you're off by 1% how off would you be in the equilibrium?

426
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:46.404
Constant.

427
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:54.930
How big a factor and equilibrium would nine kilocalories B,

428
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.980
do you remember how to do that?

429
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.250
How do you go from energy to equilibrium?
Constant.

430
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.290
I'm going to keep it boring in on this until you remember it.

431
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:11.270
Cause it's certainly going to be on the exam gathered.

432
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.550
You do the three quarters tended the three fourths of that.
Okay,

433
00:29:16.551 --> 00:29:20.570
so three fourths of nine is about seven,
right?

434
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.740
So how by what factor would you be off and predicted an equilibrium constant if

435
00:29:27.471 --> 00:29:32.120
you were off by nine kilocalories per mole,
the name is

436
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.200
10 to the seventh right?

437
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.730
Is that good enough to be off by 10 million fold?

438
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.950
Not very good.
Right?
So you're off by 10 to the seventh.

439
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100
So a useful model clearly has to go to get better numbers than you can get just

440
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:53.200
from the composition,
just from what atoms are there.

441
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.120
You're going to have to consider bonds.

442
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.780
And that's what I said we were going to do to see how good it can be if you just

443
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:03.220
have certain energies for certain bonds.
So we need to go to constitution.

444
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.570
So now what?
We're going to talk about energy,
there's going to be a big,

445
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.190
a really fundamental question.
So here's cyclohexane.
It has a certain energy.

446
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.470
What number should I put on it?

447
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.930
Should I say it's 1328 562 million,

448
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.920
right?
The question is one of our fundamental questions.

449
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:28.360
What's that compared to what,
what are we going to call zero?

450
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:33.370
Okay.
Now,
for practical purposes of doing an experiment,

451
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.360
there's a very good reference and it's the one we've just been using without

452
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:37.751
saying.

453
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:42.751
So which is CO2 and h two o the same amount of carbon and CO2,

454
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.420
the same amount of hydrogen and h two o right?

455
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660
Why is that a convenient a reference point to take from an experimental point of

456
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:57.220
view,
Lucas.
Ah,
so all you have to have to do is burn it.

457
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:58.780
See how much heat you get out and you know,

458
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:02.000
the energy relevant relative to see co two and h two o.

459
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.090
So that's called the heat of combustion and it turns out to be 881.6

460
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:12.010
kilocalories per mole for cyclohexane.
We were just talking about that.
Okay.

461
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.820
Now,
so it's easily measured.
That's a good comparison.

462
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:20.080
But if I hadn't told you that we wanted an experimental comparison that we

463
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:22.960
wanted sort of a uh,
you know,
uh,
uh,

464
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.670
simple to think about comparison,
maybe if you couldn't even measure,

465
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.960
what might you think of as a point of comparison?

466
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.930
If you're going to talk about,
we've got a whole bunch of different compounds,

467
00:31:33.931 --> 00:31:36.970
we don't know how stable is compared to what,
what are we going to use as the,

468
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:39.880
what
one?

469
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:42.070
It could be unbounded atoms.

470
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.340
That would be a really good one because then when we start with atoms,

471
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.650
we put them together and make bonds.

472
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.680
And if there's a certain energy for each bond,

473
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.820
then we would be comparing our molecule or our model of the molecule with all

474
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.880
these bonds to the atoms.
That'd be a very good one.

475
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.210
But that's going to be a very hard with the deal with experimentally,

476
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.700
right to go to Adam's,

477
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.360
there's another thing that you could actually have in a bottle that might make

478
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:12.361
sense to compare it to and that would be the elements in their standard state.

479
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.380
So graphite,

480
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.480
how stable is it compared to graphite being the carbon and h two gas being the

481
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:21.430
hydrogen,
right?

482
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.900
So that if you're comparing to the elements in their standard states,

483
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.550
that difference,

484
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.790
notice that cyclohexene or cyclohexane is just slightly more stable than the

485
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.280
elements bonded to one another.
Right?

486
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.830
And that's called the heat of formation.
That's just the definition.

487
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:41.300
That's what the heat of formation is.

488
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.100
It's the energy compared to the elements in their standard state.
Okay.

489
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.220
Now,
but how could you measure that experimentally?

490
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.700
How would you get heat of formation?
You know,

491
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:57.701
the energy of cyclohexane relative to see co two and h two o by doing

492
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.810
combustion.
How would you know it relative to graphite and hydrogen?

493
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:06.260
You can't mix hydrogen and graphite and have it suddenly magically become

494
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:10.130
cyclohexane invasion.
The heat involved in that transformation.

495
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.980
But how could you get it?
Do you see?

496
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:19.560
There's a neat trick to use.
Ah,

497
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.830
you could burn the graphite and the hydrogen,
see how much he,

498
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.630
they get off and then take the difference.
Right?

499
00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:29.670
So that's what you do.
You,

500
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.380
you burn that and get 911.1 and the difference.

501
00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:39.381
Then 29.5 is the heat of formation of cyclohexane from the elements well done.

502
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:42.960
Okay.

503
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.960
But Andrew says it would be great for purposes of our Oh and in fact,

504
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.930
these heats of formation are available in tables for lots and lots of compounds.

505
00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:53.100
And this brings up a question.

506
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.330
This a payable is taken and there are several others,
spheres for alkanes,

507
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.060
Cyclo,
alkanes,
alkanes,

508
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.200
alkanes aromatic hydrocarbons and everything's,
you can look these up,

509
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:08.130
even find them on the web to all these uh,
uh,
heats of formation.

510
00:34:08.131 --> 00:34:12.590
So it's how stable the particular substances and it's not just,
uh,

511
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:17.340
molecules.
Notice they also have Adam's and radicals,
inorganic compounds,

512
00:34:17.341 --> 00:34:21.180
cad ions,
and an ions,
all of them relative to the elements.

513
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.710
So you can find tables like this.

514
00:34:22.711 --> 00:34:27.330
These particular tables I took from a book by Stripe,
wiser Hedgecock and Casar,

515
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.820
which we've often used as a textbook in the course.

516
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.180
I think it might be out of print.
Now they've met the publisher based,

517
00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:34.260
still have some copies.

518
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.680
But would you like to have a textbook for second semester so we don't have to

519
00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:41.670
continue with the wiki stuff now,

520
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.670
so if we're going to do that,
we have to make the decision.

521
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:49.910
Are we going to get us a slick new book that has a lot of nice color pictures in

522
00:34:50.101 --> 00:34:52.020
it and so on and the very latest thing?

523
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.070
Or are we going to get something like stripe wiser and Hedgecock,

524
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.760
which I think is a wonderful book,

525
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.320
but you're going to have to find second hand copies or maybe the publishers

526
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.490
still has a few words on these new books.

527
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.500
They charge an absolute arm and a leg for the visit.
You probably have found out,

528
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.680
so I want to do it however you want to do it.
Actually,

529
00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:14.430
why don't you think about it a little bit.
I like this book,

530
00:35:14.431 --> 00:35:17.400
but there are plenty of other books that are just fine for our purposes and we

531
00:35:17.401 --> 00:35:21.230
won't be 100% in the book.
You won't be surprised to hear,
but there'll,

532
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.630
there'll be a lot of stuff that could be useful in having a textbook genu

533
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.163
<v 1>okay.</v>

534
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.990
<v 2>Somebody in instruction,
clarity stuff,
how to make a lot of difference.
In fact,</v>

535
00:35:32.991 --> 00:35:36.050
we could probably get one of these,
you know,
uh,
uh,

536
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.010
outlines of organic chemistry,
you know,

537
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.050
the little paperback books and so on that we'd probably have the stuff we
wanted,

538
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:46.950
but then you probably couldn't hold your head up against your roommates and so

539
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.290
on if you have a little dinky book like that.
Uh,
so when,

540
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.960
when I took organic chemistry,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

541
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:59.820
the professor was professor fees or who wrote lots and lots of textbooks and he

542
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:03.000
had just written one for nurses for a one semester course.

543
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:07.260
So we took two semesters and use the book that was about that thick.
It was,

544
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:08.820
oh,
a do embarrassed.

545
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:12.270
I didn't know enough to be embarrassed at that time and it was a good book.

546
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:13.380
I don't have that anymore.
I don't,

547
00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:17.460
somebody borrowed it from me then give it back and they said the book.
But uh,

548
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.780
anyhow,
we can talk about this a little more than next time,
but thank,
thank over.

549
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:25.770
Whether you want to fork out for a shiny new book or would rather have a book,

550
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:27.870
which I think is equal in quality,

551
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:32.370
maybe better even that you'd have to go buy a second hand copies or something,

552
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.640
but it'd save you some money.
So think about it.
We'll talk about it next time.

553
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.780
Okay.
And yeah,
that's where I got this table.
Uh,

554
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:43.790
now let's look at the heat of formation from this book of Cyclo Alkanes.

555
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.700
And so cyclo alkanes are ch two groups in a ring,
right?

556
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.040
Six Ch,
two groups of Cyclohexane,

557
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.340
two ch two groups is cyclo ethnic cyclo ethane or ethylene,

558
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.720
right?
So now here's the heat of formation there.
There,
uh,

559
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.440
how big the ring is,
two carbons,
three carbons,
four carbons and so on.

560
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.460
And what the heat of formation is.
Now let's try to make sense out of this.

561
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:17.750
We could look at the heat of formation divided by how many carbon or ch two

562
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:20.910
units there are in there.
It could be,
they'd all be the same.

563
00:37:20.911 --> 00:37:22.320
That would be the simplest thing.

564
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.640
If all we had to do is take how many ch two groups there were there and that up

565
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:31.320
and we would get what the,
uh,
what the stability is and it's,
it's uh,

566
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.690
it's,
uh,
they're not too bad,

567
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.890
but again,
compared to what?
Right.

568
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.720
So you're going to be the biggest error is six that I see there.

569
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.710
And the more typical error is about four say or something like that.

570
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.920
So for that would be if you are off by four kilocalories per mole.

571
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.350
Ah,
but it's per ch two group.
Uh,
so it gets worse,
right?

572
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.080
If you have a lot of cs two groups,
there's a lot of energy.
So it's,

573
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.070
if we're only one ch two group,
you'd be off only by a factor of a thousand.

574
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:13.020
If you had that kind of error.
Okay.
Uh,

575
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.480
oh,
wait a second.
This isn't an error.

576
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.560
This is just what it is per per group.
Right.

577
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.710
So it's uh,
well let's go one step further here.

578
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.940
The minimum is 4.9.
That's for cyclohexane our old favorite,

579
00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:29.600
which isn't a strange,
remember,
at least not very strained.

580
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.760
This chair cyclohexane okay.

581
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:37.790
So let's suppose that that's the standard and everything else is a little bit

582
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.640
higher in energy,
more positive because there's some kind of strain there.

583
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.080
Okay.
How big is that strain?
Well,
let's compare what it would be.

584
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.910
So we'll call that four.
You'd get,

585
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:53.911
we'll say you'll get 4.9 reduced compared to the elements if you're have

586
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:59.890
unstrained brain and now we're going to look at the others and see how strained

587
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:03.510
they are.
Now notice down at the bottom here,
1314,

588
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:07.540
50 and 60 and he's big rings have almost exactly the same energy.

589
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:09.520
So they're not strained,
right?

590
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:14.521
We would get a very good prediction of what their heat of formation is.

591
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.270
If we just multiply,
uh,
from the value we got from cyclohexane.

592
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:21.370
But the others here are a little bit off.

593
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.760
So of streamless theory is n times minus 4.9 predicts our heat.

594
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.190
So you'll see that we have a strain energy,

595
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:35.191
which is the experiment that column shown versus theory that at the end times

596
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:40.670
4.9 and here,
here are the strain energy.
We see,
nope,

597
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.470
almost no strain energy down at the bottom with just a few kilocalories per
mole.

598
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:48.700
That's not going to hurt us very much.
But up at the top we have strained.

599
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.900
The first one is bad ethylene.
We know because of the double bond is so strong,

600
00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:56.170
okay,
that's fine.
But then we have all single bonds,

601
00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:59.050
but small rings strain because you don't have such good overlap.

602
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:01.540
We talked about that.
Okay,
so,
uh,

603
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.340
six to 27 kilocalories of strain there.
We already understand why that is.

604
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:11.500
But here's an interesting one.
These ones which are bigger than six,

605
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.700
right?
But bigger than six members in the ring,

606
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.760
but they have strain and that string as a strain is called Trans annular across

607
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:23.980
the ring.
And you can easily see why it is.

608
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.180
There is a view of a model of Cyclohexane at the top and below is cyclo octane.

609
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.290
Now,

610
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:36.160
of course you buyer thought it would be strained because you'd have to bend the

611
00:40:36.161 --> 00:40:38.710
bonds out.
Busops he says,
you don't have to bend the bonds out.

612
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:41.560
All you'd have to do is pepper,
right?
And,

613
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.880
but if you start puckering too much opposite sides,

614
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:48.370
we'll run into one another and you can really see this.

615
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.520
If you look at space filling models of these here,

616
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.510
the repulsion between those two that are across the ring,

617
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.780
you can see the hydrogens really crunch into one another.

618
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.610
So these intermediate sized rings suffer from Trans annular strain.

619
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.850
So you can see this by comparing heats of formation,

620
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.460
which remember,
how do you,

621
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:12.160
what experiment do you do to measure heats of formation?

622
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:14.560
What actually would you do when you went into lab?

623
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.290
You have these substances,

624
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:20.380
what do you do with them in lab in order to vacation there?
He's a formation.

625
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.440
You burned them,
right?

626
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.490
You measure what you actually measure is the heat of combustion,
right?

627
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.200
But then if you also know,

628
00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:34.160
if somebody out there has for you measure the heat of combustion of and the heat

629
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:35.510
of combustion of hydrogen,

630
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.560
then you have the numbers that Abel you that enable you to work up your data and

631
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:42.800
find out what the heat of formation of your substance was.
Right?

632
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.170
So now this,

633
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:49.970
this book at the end in the appendix three of this book has Everage bond

634
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:52.520
energies.
And this is what Andrew Wanted,
right?

635
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.840
He wanted to be able to start with the Adams and up all the bonds and get the

636
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.350
energy.
And in fact,
here is a table that purports to do that,

637
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.250
that says that these are energies you can add up to get what the heat of

638
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:07.400
atomization would be.
Uh,

639
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.630
and you'll notice that it makes a little distinction among carbon carbon bonds

640
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.900
that gives different values for double and triple bonds.
Then for single,

641
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:19.190
that's certainly sensible and same for nitrogen.
So the question is,

642
00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:23.420
does this work?
Can one sum up bond energies to get useful heats of atomization?

643
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.290
So how well can bond energies predict the heat of atomization?

644
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:30.260
And where does the heat of atomization come from?
So again,

645
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:32.060
you're going to do these heats of combustion,

646
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.840
but you're going to need somebody to measure a new value for you,

647
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.560
not just the heat of combustion of graphite and the heat of combustion of

648
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.800
hydrogen gas.
And you'll see what you need here.

649
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:46.880
Because we're going to now compare not with graphite and hydrogen,

650
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:48.620
which is something you could have in a bottle.

651
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.960
But we're going to compare with the Adams,
which you can't have in a bottle.
Now,

652
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.060
how are we going to measure the heat of atomization?

653
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:02.390
We're going to do it indirectly by,
uh,
by this line,
right?

654
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:05.450
We know the heat of combustion of our substance,
or we measure it,

655
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.300
we know the heat of combustion of graphite and hydrogen.

656
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:13.400
So all we need to know is the heat of atomization of graphite.

657
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:14.830
How hard is it to,

658
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:19.831
to get a carbon atom out of graphite or a hydrogen atom out of h two.

659
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.130
If we knew that,

660
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.400
then we could figure out that that's going to be 650.6 kilocalories per mole.

661
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:33.610
That's to get out six carbons from graphite and 12 hydrogens from h two gas in

662
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:38.900
order to make the c six h 12 of Cyclohexane,
right?

663
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.360
So if you knew that number,

664
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.900
the 1650 0.6 the heat of atomization of graphite and hydrogen,

665
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:50.290
then you can add all those together with the proper sign and get that at 680.1

666
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:52.820
the heat of atomization of cyclohexane.

667
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:57.740
And then you could try to parlay that into what the bond strengths are in

668
00:43:57.741 --> 00:43:58.610
cyclohexane.

669
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.170
So what you need is the heat of atomization of graphite and the heat of

670
00:44:03.171 --> 00:44:08.120
atomization of hydrogen.
But how can you know the heat of formation for an Adam?

671
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.760
You do it by spectroscopy.
So we've seen things like this before,

672
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:16.880
a more type curve,
and we know that you have an x,
y,

673
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.620
a diatomic Adam down in the bottom there.
And if you,

674
00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.090
it takes a certain amount of energy to get to x plus y to get to the atoms.

675
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.490
If you knew that energy,
that's what we want to know.

676
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.790
How hard is it to break these apart?
H Two for example,
into two h atoms.

677
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:38.210
But you notice that you could do this with light and if you knew what the

678
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.970
minimum amount of light is to go up,

679
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.610
of course it's going to be quantized right.

680
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:49.611
They're going to be given levels until you get to the level where it associates.

681
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.700
And then as you'll remember from from Arabic meets Goldilocks,

682
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.850
it's not quantized anymore.
You can have any energies that you want.

683
00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.180
So if by spectroscopy you can see when it's changes from being individual lines

684
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.620
to being a continuum where any energy goes,

685
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:12.710
then you know what that energy is so you'd know how much energy it takes to go

686
00:45:12.991 --> 00:45:17.130
from the molecule to the addict.
So you could do that by spectroscopy.

687
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.100
And within the case of hydrogen molecule,

688
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.250
it turns out to be 104.2 but from that you get two hydrogen atoms.

689
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.440
So it's 52.1 is the heat of formation from the gas of a hydrogen atom.

690
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.220
So we know that we,

691
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.290
because the heat of formation of h two is defined to zero,

692
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:39.510
that's the element in its standard state already.

693
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.060
You can do the same thing with oxygen and you get that it's 59.6 to make an

694
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.060
oxygen.
But how do you do carbon?

695
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.960
Because the standard state of carbon is not c two

696
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.000
right?

697
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.440
And and indeed you can't buy c two in a bottle to do the experiment either.

698
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:04.100
But what you can get in a bottle is CEO carbon monoxide.

699
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.280
So if you did the experiment on CEO,

700
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.670
you find out that that number is 257.3 and now you have what you need because

701
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.770
that's the difference between CEO and a Seattle plus an oh Adam.

702
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:25.550
But you know where CEO is compared to graphite and oxygen by burning CEO and you

703
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:34.821
know where oxygen is relative to oxygen and its standard state.

704
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.590
Because we just did it with o two,
right?

705
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:42.950
So there's burning graphite is 26.4 uh,

706
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.880
got graph graphite to a single oxygen atom.
Is,

707
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.970
is that heat of formation of the oxygen out.

708
00:46:49.971 --> 00:46:52.410
And so all we need to have to have is that difference.

709
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.440
And we know what the heat of formation of carbon is.

710
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:59.130
It's going to be 171.3 okay.

711
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:02.580
So we were able to do it by doing spectroscopy on CEO,

712
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.070
but this was done.

713
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:10.250
People got the number 171.3 but then they began to worry and there were two

714
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:14.970
Nobel laureates plus Edward Teller who the,

715
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.660
who was big in the atomic energy community in the United States.

716
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:20.600
You may have heard of him,
uh,
who,

717
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.610
so we're big time physicists who absolutely disagreed with 171.3 because what

718
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:32.391
they said was that the was misleading that actually it was giving one of the,

719
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.160
this,
the light that was going in was giving one of the Attos,

720
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.270
not in its normal state,
it's low energy state,
but in the higher state.

721
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.420
So the number that you predicted that,

722
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:51.550
that you measured is 171.3 was not to a normal carbon atom,

723
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.270
but to an excited carbon atom.
Right?

724
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:58.630
So that the true energy of a carbon atom would be lower than that.

725
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:04.060
And so they thought one set up and thought it would be 141 kilocalories per
mole.

726
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.510
And another thought it would be a 125 so these numbers are all very precise.

727
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.320
You can measure these positions of spectral lines very accurately,

728
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.380
but you don't know how to interpret it.

729
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:22.650
It could be way off by 20 or 20 or almost 50 kilocalories per mole.

730
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.720
So you need some other way of doing this.
And for many years,

731
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:32.770
I brought in a guest lecturer to explain how he did it,
but unfortunately,

732
00:48:32.771 --> 00:48:35.830
he died a year and a half ago.
So,
uh,

733
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.290
I'll have to tell you what he would have told you and I,

734
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.480
but we'll wait next time for that.
