♪Music Starts♪

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.259
Air pollution is one of the most
urgent and critical problems

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.344
that humanity faces today.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.847
Many activities that
are essential to our

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.349
progress, our economy,
and our well-being are

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.478
very unfortunately
associated with
generation of pollution.

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:24.190
These are manufacturing
industries, chemical industries,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.361
oil and gas refining industries,
they all generate

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.364
a lot of pollutants
that need to be 
removed or

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.535
destroyed before
they release their
exaust into the air.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.039
To remove these pollutants,
catalytic converters are

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.833
currently introduced into the
exhaust lines.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.837
In the heart of the catalytic
converter is a catalytic coating,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.423
which contains precious metal
nano-particles, 

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.550
which are the active ingredients
of the system.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.930
The problem is that not all of
these nano-particles are
efficiently utilized.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.186
Only a fraction of the nano-
particles are being exposed
to the exhaust pollutants,

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.606
and this is the most costly
ingredient of the system.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:11.696
Catalytic converter producers
spend about 70-90% of their
total cost on precious metals.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:16.242
Within, probably even
50 years, main sources

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:22.999
of platinum, palladium,
iridium, metals that are
used in catalytic
converters,

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.960
would go down or maybe 
disappear completely.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.966
So what we try to do is
to think about how to
optimize materials,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:39.265
based on biological design, based on something 
that nature has developed through millions
of years of evolution.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:45.605
The Wyss Institute is supporting a broad range
of bio-inspired materials, devices, and approaches.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:53.196
The design of our coatings is definitely 
inspired by butterfly wings and it has the same
porous architecture.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:58.701
If you look at its micro-
structure, it is structured in a
way that will allow the wing

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:07.460
to be aerodynamic, hydrophobic,
and not become heavy or sticky
in the rain.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.215
And it also creates the
beautiful coloration of the
butterfly.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.802
The butterfly actually doesn't
produce any pigments.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.931
We realized we don't have to
invent any new chemistry,

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.351
or new materials, we can just
structure our materials

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.771
in a way that will allow much
more efficient use of the

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:31.276
precious metal nano-particles,
based on these bio-inspired
principles.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:34.612
We can precisely put them at the
interface of the pore

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:38.324
and make them fully accessible
to the exhaust gasses.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.536
This drammatically improves the
performance of these coatings,

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.164
making it much cheaper and
accessible.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.917
What is really unique about our
technology is that it provides

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:53.256
a "plug and play" solution.
There is no need to modify
manufacturing processes,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:58.678
our technology can be easily
adapted to the current
manufacturing processes.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:04.142
I do think that this is a really
good example of an approach

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:10.982
that does both, that improves
cost and economic considerations

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:15.403
and actually purifies air
as the outcome of that.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.198
We applied for the President's
Innovation Challenge and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.369
have been preselected from over
200 teams to compete with

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.497
15 other teams within three
different categories. 

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.583
It's a validation of your
business vision,

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.419
it's a validation of your
technology, already,

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.630
without even winning this prize.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.591
And now we have "Open-
Track Runner Up":

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.344
"Air Crew"

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.804
♪Applause♪

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:50.480
And it's capable of bridging
this very difficult gap between

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.818
the conception of the idea, and
being able to commercialize it.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:59.280
So, that process, being able to
connect that, to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.368
build this bridge is the mission
of the Wyss Institute.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:07.580
If we will see that this
technology has transferred into

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.752
products that make a substancial
positive influence

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:19.008
on the environment and society,
this will be the real
recognition.
