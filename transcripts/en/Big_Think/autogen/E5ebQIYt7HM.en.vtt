well several things one we look
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.810
well several things one we look
historically the greatest advances have

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
historically the greatest advances have
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.640
historically the greatest advances have
been made in medicine in the last 50

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
been made in medicine in the last 50
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179
been made in medicine in the last 50
years and the drugs which we have great

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
years and the drugs which we have great
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740
years and the drugs which we have great
pride in because they really help

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
pride in because they really help
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.349

patients other 30 drugs that are being
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.089
patients other 30 drugs that are being
abused by athletes if we look forward we

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
abused by athletes if we look forward we
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709
abused by athletes if we look forward we
will continue to develop new drugs and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
will continue to develop new drugs and
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.340
will continue to develop new drugs and
new technologies and there's no question

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
new technologies and there's no question
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.979
new technologies and there's no question
that we already know factually that

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
that we already know factually that
 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.270
that we already know factually that
there are those who are already trying

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
there are those who are already trying
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.600
there are those who are already trying
to get a hold of the new technologies

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610
to get a hold of the new technologies
 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.540
to get a hold of the new technologies
now when isolated from medical school we

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
now when isolated from medical school we
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459
now when isolated from medical school we
didn't have diuretics we don't check

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
didn't have diuretics we don't check
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010
didn't have diuretics we don't check
people with mercury who sounds kind of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
people with mercury who sounds kind of
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.069
people with mercury who sounds kind of
wild that wasn't that long ago we had

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
wild that wasn't that long ago we had
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.869
wild that wasn't that long ago we had
very limited number of antibiotics and

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879
very limited number of antibiotics and
 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.189
very limited number of antibiotics and
if you need it or get somebody's blood

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
if you need it or get somebody's blood
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.360
if you need it or get somebody's blood
count up you had to give them a lot of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
count up you had to give them a lot of
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579
count up you had to give them a lot of
transfusions things have changed

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
transfusions things have changed
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.859
transfusions things have changed
dramatically

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869
dramatically
 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.219
dramatically
well if we take several of those changes

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
well if we take several of those changes
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.120
well if we take several of those changes
and see what's happened for example for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
and see what's happened for example for
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190
and see what's happened for example for
years people took anabolic steroids

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
years people took anabolic steroids
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320
years people took anabolic steroids
because they had anemia for a variety of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
because they had anemia for a variety of
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.130

courses get their red cells over well we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
courses get their red cells over well we
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.980

realized that if you can give them a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
realized that if you can give them a
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.520
realized that if you can give them a
substance called EPO erythropoietin you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
substance called EPO erythropoietin you
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649
substance called EPO erythropoietin you
can stimulate somebody's bone marrow to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
can stimulate somebody's bone marrow to
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.090
can stimulate somebody's bone marrow to
make more red cells and so to be a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
make more red cells and so to be a
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.170
make more red cells and so to be a
decreased need for transfusions and so a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
decreased need for transfusions and so a
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.510
decreased need for transfusions and so a
pill was developed now it turns out as

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
pill was developed now it turns out as
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.050
pill was developed now it turns out as
one can anticipate EPO was immediately

abused in fact I reported an epidemic of
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.429
abused in fact I reported an epidemic of
deaths in four Scandinavian countries

out all these deaths occurred right

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
out all these deaths occurred right

after Ipoh was introduced into Europe

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
after Ipoh was introduced into Europe
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.789
after Ipoh was introduced into Europe
and although I can never prove it all

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
and although I can never prove it all
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.139
and although I can never prove it all
the evidence suggests it was probably

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
the evidence suggests it was probably
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.970
the evidence suggests it was probably
related to EPO now EPO typically for

less injections well sure enough we

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
less injections well sure enough we
 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.970
less injections well sure enough we
develop that and comes along in the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
develop that and comes along in the
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.099
develop that and comes along in the
Olympic Games in Salt Lake and only

family the people are abusing the
long-acting EPO now there's technology

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
long-acting EPO now there's technology
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.869
long-acting EPO now there's technology
being developed so that you wouldn't

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879
being developed so that you wouldn't
 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.699
being developed so that you wouldn't
have to inject the EPO at all but

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709
have to inject the EPO at all but
 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.550
have to inject the EPO at all but
there's Dean therapy technologies rub a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
there's Dean therapy technologies rub a
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.460
there's Dean therapy technologies rub a
cream on it can turn on a switch in your

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
cream on it can turn on a switch in your
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.460
cream on it can turn on a switch in your
body to make your own EPO and then turn

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
body to make your own EPO and then turn
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.940
body to make your own EPO and then turn
it off by removing the cream and you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
it off by removing the cream and you
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.940
it off by removing the cream and you
know we know that's probably not too far

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
know we know that's probably not too far
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.789
know we know that's probably not too far
down the road just like in many other

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799
down the road just like in many other
 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.640
down the road just like in many other
forms of therapies we try to make it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
forms of therapies we try to make it
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.280
forms of therapies we try to make it
easy easy for patients and so that's a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
easy easy for patients and so that's a
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.819
easy easy for patients and so that's a
good example of that kind of technology

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829
good example of that kind of technology
 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.550
good example of that kind of technology
now human growth hormones a whole other

some things but people who needed human
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.339
some things but people who needed human
growth hormone they were dependent on

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349
growth hormone they were dependent on

grinding up pituitary glands of cadavers

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919
grinding up pituitary glands of cadavers
 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.439
grinding up pituitary glands of cadavers
well it turns out that these cadavers in

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449
well it turns out that these cadavers in
 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.680
well it turns out that these cadavers in
many cases contain a virus and produces

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690
many cases contain a virus and produces
 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.869
many cases contain a virus and produces
it produced a disease called Jakob

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879
it produced a disease called Jakob
 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.759
it produced a disease called Jakob
kreutzfeld disease which is like a kin

to an Alzheimer's dementia well so

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419
to an Alzheimer's dementia well so
 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.050
to an Alzheimer's dementia well so
obviously but can be used clinically

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
obviously but can be used clinically
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.180
obviously but can be used clinically
because some of the athletes were using

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
because some of the athletes were using
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.520
because some of the athletes were using
it well but with the development of

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
it well but with the development of
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.219
it well but with the development of
recombinant DNA technology the same kind

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229
recombinant DNA technology the same kind
 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.159
recombinant DNA technology the same kind
of technology we use to develop EPO they

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169
of technology we use to develop EPO they
 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.319
of technology we use to develop EPO they
developed a synthetic human growth

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329
developed a synthetic human growth
 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.059
developed a synthetic human growth
hormone and so we now are able to treat

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069
hormone and so we now are able to treat
 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.990
hormone and so we now are able to treat
patients with human growth hormone

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
patients with human growth hormone
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.830
patients with human growth hormone
safely but as you can expect human

safely but as you can expect human
 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.539
safely but as you can expect human
growth hormone is now become one of the

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549
growth hormone is now become one of the
 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.120
growth hormone is now become one of the
mainstays of doping now if it turns out

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130
mainstays of doping now if it turns out
 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.420
mainstays of doping now if it turns out
you are

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430
you are

AIDS wasting disease we use human growth

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910
AIDS wasting disease we use human growth
 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.690
AIDS wasting disease we use human growth
hormone to treat those people then

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
hormone to treat those people then
 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.120
