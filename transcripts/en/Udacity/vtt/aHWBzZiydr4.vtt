00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.926
Let's try working through 1 last problem with motion and a current. In this

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:08.910
problem, a riverboat averages 12 miles per hours in still water. It takes the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.760
boat an hour and 4 minutes to go 6 miles upstream, and then come back. What I

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.308
want you to do, is to find the speed of the current. Before we find the speed

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:22.268
of the current, let's set up our information. I want you to fill in each of

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:25.184
these parts of our table, and be sure to use the variable x for your

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:30.440
expressions. Think carefully about which of these should be numbers, and which

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.032
of these should be expressions.
