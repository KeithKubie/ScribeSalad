3-D computer graphics uses an interesting concept to speed up object display

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:09.058
called backface culling. Imagine you're looking at a box. Here's the side view

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:12.947
in 2-D. Only the sides of the box that face toward you are visible. The

00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:17.817
backfaces here and here do not need to be rendered. The fastest polygon to

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.653
render is the one you don't ever have to render at all. Backface culling can

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:26.097
throw away about half the faces in an object, so it's a worthwhile optimization.

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:30.574
For example, here's a real live box. If you look at it from any angle, you're

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:34.051
only gong to see a few of the faces of the whole box, and the rest of the faces

00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:39.128
can be thrown away. Backfaces can be culled for any solid object. This V-shape

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:44.424
seen from the side has only two sides facing towards the camera, outlined green.

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:48.345
These other two faces can be thrown away without further processing. It turns

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:53.070
out this green face here is hidden from view by this front face, but we let the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.236
z buffer take care of hiding that. We can set whether backface culling is

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:01.205
enabled or disabled, but how do we determine if a triangle is a frontface or a

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:06.108
backface? There are three points defining each triangle, and there is no flag

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:10.182
stored for additional information. What determines front or backfacing is the

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:14.100
order of the vertices after they are protected on to the screen. In WebGL, if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.455
the order is counterclockwise, the triangle is frontfacing. If its clockwise,

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:23.100
its backfacing. Going counterclockwise like this is often called the right-hand

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.924
rule. The fingers of your right hand wrap around the edges of the triangle in

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:32.323
order. If your thumb points at you, the triangle is then frontfacing.
