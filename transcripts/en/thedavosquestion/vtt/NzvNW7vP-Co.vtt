Kevin Taylor, Managing Director for the BT
in Asia Pacific. It's a great question. I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.219
believe China is half the bridge towards recovery,
the investment. The Chinese government has

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:21.580
made into the infrastructure in China has
helped also increase growth by 30% or- which

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.940
is excellent. But half the bridge only, the
other half of the bridge is the US. I'm definitely

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.390
seeing early signs of recovery in terms of
planning over the last three or four weeks

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.960
and feel very confident that as we see the
next six months to one year we'll see much

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.260
more positive environments for doing business.
China has played its part; it's also supported

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.430
the dollar in the process. I know their dollar
is finding lower pressure at the moment same

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.249
as-- situation so let's pray to pass in the
world economy and I think we can look forward

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.799
to better times. Thank you.
