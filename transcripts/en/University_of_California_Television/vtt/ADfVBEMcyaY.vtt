00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.182
(whoosh and beeping)

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:08.544
(electronic music)

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:25.715
- I tend to get unsolicited feedback,

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:28.584
such that should be a very short talk.

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:29.767
(audience laughing)

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:31.319
Isn't that a contradiction of terms.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.195
You mean they found one.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:34.763
(audience laughing)

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:38.141
And there's like a book a
month that sort of piles on

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.885
these unflattering
portrayals, The Primal Teen,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:43.594
that's actually not too
bad, but Mom, I Hate You,

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:47.205
Get Out of My Life, But First
Drop Cheryl and I at the Mall.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.892
Now I Know Why Tigers Eat Their
Young is right to the point,

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:52.267
Yes, Your Teen Is Crazy.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:56.767
But with the technology such
as magnetic resonance imaging,

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.314
we can for the first
time look under the hood

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.284
of the living, growing brain.

00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:06.241
And what we've found is that
not only do teens have brains,

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.978
(audience laughs)

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:09.606
but they're good brains,

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:13.439
they're as they should
be, they're not broken.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.080
And I'd go so far as to
say if they weren't the way

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.783
that they are, we wouldn't even be here.

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:24.950
And evidence from that comes
from kind of unlikely source

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.471
I'll get to in a minute.

00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.629
So the teen brain's different
than the brain of a child,

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.236
it's different than the brain of an adult,

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.520
it's not just half way between,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.603
it's kind of its own distinct entity,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.553
and it's been exquisitely
forged by evolution

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:42.559
to have certain features.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.726
Behaviorally, the big three
are increased risk taking,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.618
increased sensation seeking,

00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:52.178
and a move away from parents to peers.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.537
And I think these are deeply
rooted in our biology,

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:55.568
because it's not just humans,

00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:58.629
all social mammals have
these three features.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.120
And so we're probably
fighting Mother Nature

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.381
by trying to eliminate these.

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.807
And this is always very
speculative to argue these ways,

00:02:07.807 --> 00:02:11.974
but one idea is that it
helped us get out of the home,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.782
which is a really irrational
thing to do, okay,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:17.746
Why, people loved us,
they feed us, protect us,

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:20.267
it's a good gig, right?

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:24.163
But it turns out it works better if we do.

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:27.467
Less inbreeding, it just
sort of, you know, morally,

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:32.231
right around, it just works
better if this happens.

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:35.156
And so these features,
they involved at a time

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.572
without firearms, without
high-speed motor vehicles,

00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:39.955
without designer drugs and stuff,

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:43.269
so some of these issues are
kind of this stone age brain

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.149
in computer age world aspect.

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:50.316
But I think that these
behaviors have virtues as well.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.673
When I was at the NIH,
the Smithsonian Museum,

00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:57.315
sort of close, they had this exhibit,

00:02:57.315 --> 00:03:00.246
the Hall of Human Origins,
which I really liked,

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.635
but kind of not strictly featured

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:05.540
a little placard on the floor,
looked at the relationship

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.711
between brain size and climate change.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.243
And the last big increase

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:13.009
in brain size 500, 800,000 years ago.

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.527
But what I thought was intriguing was that

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:18.349
what was correlated was
the change in climate,

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.921
not the degree.

00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:21.724
Before seeing this I thought,
yeah, it got really cold,

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:24.123
you had to be supersmart just
to stay alive long enough

00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:25.957
to get food and reproduce.

00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:28.011
But this is subtlety different.

00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:30.769
Everybody in this room had ancestors

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.852
whose brains were good at adaptation.

00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:38.167
And we're really good at it in terms of,

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:42.307
even compared to our quite
close, genetically close,

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:46.024
rather in the Neandertrumps,
or Neanderthals,

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:48.579
(audience laughs)

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.454
I'll pause, we can edit that later.

00:03:51.454 --> 00:03:54.454
(audience applauds)

00:03:56.457 --> 00:03:58.907
We can tell enormous amounts from teeth

00:03:58.907 --> 00:04:01.038
and fossilized teeth, which
actually we've done it.

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:05.211
Everybody's teeth right now
are fossils, calcified cells.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.827
But they work like trees
so they have rings.

00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:12.267
So tree rings, this was a wet
year, a good year of growth,

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:13.894
the rings are wider.

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.776
And across many different species,

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:18.839
the rings get closer and
closer as you mature.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.391
The rings stop and you're done growing,

00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.869
it's done maturing.

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:26.017
And so when you find
these fossilized teeth,

00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:30.387
if you find a fossilized
Neanderthal tooth of a 12-year-old,

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:31.599
and then check the rest of the cave,

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.572
he's gonna be with his
children, not his parents.

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:38.836
And this is often portrayed
as surprisingly rapid growth

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:40.079
in the Neanderthals.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.769
But I think that's the
wrong way to look at it.

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:45.603
What's surprising is
our protracted growth.

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:47.751
We're the outliers, by far,

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:50.162
it's one of the most
distinctive things about us.

00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:54.329
And even across like crows
and many other species,

00:04:55.402 --> 00:04:58.277
the longer you're under
protection of your parent,

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:00.064
the more complicated your food gathering,

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:02.381
your communication, problem solving.

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.894
Crows are actually really
smart as an example.

00:05:04.894 --> 00:05:09.405
But similar crows, in
size and, that don't have

00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:10.642
this protected maturation,

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.157
don't have those abilities as well.

00:05:13.157 --> 00:05:14.725
It doesn't work to just keep your kids

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:16.070
at home until their 40.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.949
I don't think on an individual
basis it doesn't work,

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.165
but it's an intriguing trade-off I think

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:24.260
that we keep options open, we
keep our brains changeable,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.717
see what the environment's gonna be like.

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:27.627
We can live on the North Pole,
we can live on the equator,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.010
or everywhere, we can even live

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.288
in outer space for a little while

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.688
with technologies that
have been developed.

00:05:32.688 --> 00:05:34.834
And so this is a good thing, I think,

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:39.156
in terms of this ability
to keep options open

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:42.048
for a long time, but it's
really being put to the test

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:44.381
with the digital revolution.

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:47.441
And this is, just in my

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.197
short career is a game changer.

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:54.172
The way that we interact
with like what we're doing

00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:57.704
at this moment with ones
and zeroes and the lights,

00:05:57.704 --> 00:06:00.818
the projector, it's changed everything,

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:03.735
it's changed the way that we learn,

00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:10.291
content that's on internet
and the greatest minds

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:12.941
on the planet are a click
away, you know, for free.

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:15.355
It's just amazing, it's magical.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:17.836
The way that we play and the way

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.955
that we interact with each other.

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:23.393
And so I've been fascinated
by this interaction

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:27.820
in terms of the biology
of this changeability

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.320
and the technologies that have

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.028
taken over in a sense,

00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:37.492
so, of almost 11 hours
a day of screen time,

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:40.794
and 30% of that time more than one device.

00:06:40.794 --> 00:06:43.553
And so the usual question
is is it good or bad or

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.117
that's the wrong question, right,

00:06:46.117 --> 00:06:50.364
almost any interesting
question is it depends

00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:54.251
in terms of in what ways
and how it depends and

00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:55.732
what it depends upon.

00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:58.723
But I think that this is an opportunity

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:01.806
in terms of to influence adolescents.

00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:07.265
One of the tragedies of
my profession is that

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:08.712
it's almost a 10-year gap

00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:11.962
between onset of illness and treatment.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.490
We need to do better.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.832
And I think perhaps the
technologies can help us get there

00:07:18.832 --> 00:07:23.342
in terms of by monitoring things
like social media activity,

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.561
maybe even just movement, GPS data,

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.202
harnessing these technologies

00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:28.974
in an ethically appropriate way

00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:32.023
to help us recognize mental illness

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:33.544
so that we can intervene

00:07:33.544 --> 00:07:36.570
while the brain is still more changeable.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.737
And so a lot of the debates
around this that there's

00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:43.700
it's just not natural, right.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.473
We evolved to talk to each
other, to be with each other,

00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:48.780
to share smiles and touches and every,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.992
and now we're looking at screens
for a big part of the day.

00:07:52.992 --> 00:07:55.412
But a kind of argument to that

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:58.060
is reading's not natural either.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.060
Reading's only about 5,200 years old.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.539
So most humanity, nobody read.

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.598
So I don't think that by
itself is a good argument.

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:11.176
It kind of makes the point
that the whole aspect of this

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.345
is the changeability.

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:15.550
10,000 years ago hunting,
gathering berries,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.883
it's the same brain in terms of

00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:19.697
that's a blink of an eye
in evolutionary terms.

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:21.846
But our brains are amazing.

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:24.777
We can adapt, you know, a lot
of us spend a lot of our day

00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:28.944
with symbols, you know,
words, and that's so different

00:08:29.978 --> 00:08:33.473
than you know, what our ancestors did.

00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:36.610
And so my career's basically been this

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.142
in terms of trying to
understand this plasticity

00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:44.309
in terms of how to optimize
the good and minimize the bad.

00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:48.175
And this kind of,

00:08:49.437 --> 00:08:52.297
how do you help people with mental illness

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:54.667
is the fundamental question.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.531
And so kind of that notion
of like what do we know?

00:08:58.531 --> 00:08:59.561
How do we know what we know?

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:00.521
What don't we know?

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:01.675
Why don't we know?

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.314
That, but, you know,

00:09:03.314 --> 00:09:05.695
my first assumption is
the brain's involved.

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:06.886
I hope so.

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:08.395
It's like a spleen or something,

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:10.712
I'm gonna feel like a
complete fool down the road.

00:09:10.712 --> 00:09:14.879
But I think, you know, it's
a reasonable assumption.

00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:19.150
And professor Jernigan began this journey,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.558
B.J. and I started together at NH

00:09:21.558 --> 00:09:25.850
and following down that path
of looking at the brain,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.084
and how the brain changes

00:09:28.084 --> 00:09:31.616
in both typical development
and in illnesses.

00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:34.241
It's kind of a noncreative,
started to design, actually,

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:37.828
but scan kids, you
know, when they're young

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:40.630
and follow them as they go through life,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.794
see how they're doing at school, at home,

00:09:43.794 --> 00:09:47.961
see what sort of influences
on the brain for good or ill.

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:53.272
And at the NH, we did about 10,000 scans

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.869
of half the kids healthy,

00:09:56.869 --> 00:10:00.064
half the kids with different illnesses.

00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:01.981
And what we found were,

00:10:03.782 --> 00:10:06.319
it's nuanced, but like
the brain doesn't mature

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:08.460
by getting bigger and bigger.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.732
By first grade it's
already 93% adult size.

00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:15.494
It matures by being more
connected within itself

00:10:15.494 --> 00:10:17.826
and more specialized.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:21.448
And this idea of being more connected,

00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:24.350
there's many ways you can approach this,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.748
but white matter is one of them.

00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:29.753
So, this insulating material
that you get one to 2% more of

00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:32.184
into the fourth or fifth decade,

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:36.848
the brain is able to communicate
amongst itself faster.

00:10:36.848 --> 00:10:38.380
It's not very subtle,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.576
it's like 3,000-fold increase in bandwidth

00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:46.037
I think underlies a lot of
the remarkable behaviors

00:10:46.037 --> 00:10:47.287
that we can do.

00:10:48.172 --> 00:10:51.586
But it's not just a matter
of maximizing speed,

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:53.396
it's all about the timing.

00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:57.210
And so the fire together
wired together the meaning,

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.999
the information's in these patterns.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:02.875
But more and more we're understanding that

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.065
that's the progression.

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:05.770
If we look at different parts of the brain

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.783
like letters of the alphabet
as you go from an infant

00:11:08.783 --> 00:11:12.814
to child latency, teenagers,
emerging adulthood,

00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:16.287
that these letters become words,
the words become sentences,

00:11:16.287 --> 00:11:19.523
the sentences, you know,
paragraphs, metaphorically.

00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:22.617
And this all goes up in adolescence.

00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.912
The brain, no matter how you measure it,

00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:28.162
whether the molecular, EEG, blood flow,

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.189
it becomes more connected.

00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:35.835
And this is kind of a fresh look in terms

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:38.311
of this idea of Graph Theory Networks,

00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.229
it gives us a whole new look.

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:41.324
So, for something like

00:11:41.324 --> 00:11:44.238
schizophrenia, before we'd be like,

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:48.670
is this chunk bigger or smaller
or different shape or size?

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.449
But looking at the same
MRI scan, the same data,

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:54.587
and looking at how it's interconnected,

00:11:54.587 --> 00:11:58.810
then we can discern old from
young, healthy from ill,

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.796
'cause their brain,

00:11:59.796 --> 00:12:03.682
not perfectly, but it's really
exciting for someone like me

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.925
I can't do the math, but
to be a consumer of it

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:08.342
in terms of that,

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.763
by looking at this connectivity,

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:15.876
it gives us a whole new
perspective on these illnesses.

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:18.435
The other processes,
the gray matter process

00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:22.146
and the one-two punch is
overproduce and then war,

00:12:22.146 --> 00:12:22.979
or fight it out.

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:26.747
It's almost all complexity
in nature arises,

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.097
engine of evolution,

00:12:28.097 --> 00:12:31.953
overproduce something nonrandom selection.

00:12:31.953 --> 00:12:33.480
And it has great potential.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.578
So it's constantly on-going,

00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:37.900
it's not like you only
overproduce during childhood

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.039
and only prune during adolescence,

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:43.667
but that we see this
upside down U-type of curve

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:47.834
where as we specialize, the
brain actually becomes smaller.

00:12:49.098 --> 00:12:52.947
So after around 10, 11, 12,
your brain doesn't get bigger,

00:12:52.947 --> 00:12:56.027
it gets smaller, but leaner,
meaner, more specialized

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:59.642
based on what you're demanding of it.

00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:02.083
But it's not all parts equal.

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:05.964
The prefrontal cortex involved
in controlling impulses,

00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:09.757
long-range planning, it's
particular late to settle down.

00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:12.104
Some, you know, 25 to 30,

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:16.104
and that combined with
the hormonally-activated,

00:13:17.545 --> 00:13:21.364
puberty-activated limbic
system, the passions of words,

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:24.281
this imbalance creates a lot of the

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.170
specials of teen behavior aspects.

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.663
But again, this is how it should be,

00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:34.894
if the prefrontal cortex is already done

00:13:34.894 --> 00:13:39.203
like 11 or 12 and stuff, then
we wouldn't be as adaptable.

00:13:39.203 --> 00:13:42.570
And so I think this is the
tension or the trade-off.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.158
The other place to start in terms of that

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:49.325
is illnesses happen at different times.

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:51.142
Not perfectly, there's always variation,

00:13:51.142 --> 00:13:53.478
but Alzheimer's doesn't
happen when you're three,

00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:55.921
and autism doesn't start when you're 60,

00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:58.304
that characteristically certain illnesses

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:01.706
tend to emerge at certain ages.

00:14:01.706 --> 00:14:04.667
And that's puzzling,
you know, why is that?

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:05.942
In terms of.

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:08.057
And when you start looking at this,

00:14:08.057 --> 00:14:12.057
so much happens in
adolescence, not a lot, most.

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:14.377
It's up to 75%,

00:14:14.377 --> 00:14:16.390
and I still don't know the answer,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.560
that's been for 25 years,
and we're like why?

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.831
Because the early answer is
oh, teenagers are stressful,

00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:24.593
it's a stressful time of life.

00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:27.621
You know, kids have their
parents killed in front of them,

00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:30.227
or they're starving to death
or there's war in 20 countries,

00:14:30.227 --> 00:14:34.329
enormous stresses, but they
don't get schizophrenia.

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:37.053
And so that never rang true.

00:14:37.053 --> 00:14:38.500
And I still don't know the answer to this,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.333
why do things happen when they do?

00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:46.138
And so just one example
is for schizophrenia,

00:14:47.563 --> 00:14:49.361
all of the findings you
see in adult schizophrenia,

00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:53.528
you can predict what if typical
teen changes went too far?

00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:57.035
It's not causal, they
already had schizophrenia,

00:14:57.035 --> 00:15:01.532
but so far without
exception, in terms of both

00:15:01.532 --> 00:15:04.312
the MRI changes, but also
the molecular changes,

00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:08.028
and so it's just this
point, it's intriguing.

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:11.036
It doesn't help me help
families with schizophrenia,

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.423
but I think these are the kind of clues

00:15:13.423 --> 00:15:15.644
that we're starting to understand.

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:18.343
So, in this specialization process,

00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:22.510
in typical development, it's
about 7% from ages 12 to 17,

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:26.689
in schizophrenia, 28%.

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:27.660
So it's not subtle.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.112
You know, four-fold difference.

00:15:30.112 --> 00:15:34.030
And so, understanding
the typical development,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.271
I think, is key, but about
half of what I deal with

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.447
as an analyst isn't illness.

00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:44.132
All right, pregnancy is not an
illness, but it's a big deal.

00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:46.855
Relationships, car
accidents, incarcerations,

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:49.684
you know, life decisions, this
happens during adolescence.

00:15:49.684 --> 00:15:53.109
And it's frustrating as a physician,

00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:55.537
it's like there's no
insurance forms to check

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:57.604
in terms of for these very real issues

00:15:57.604 --> 00:15:59.875
that aren't an illness.

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:01.564
And this kind of notion

00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:04.405
is the glass half empty or half full?

00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:08.137
Because this changeability
could be a great opportunity,

00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:11.595
making it even more tragic
that we aren't recognizing

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:13.931
the illnesses when they occur.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:18.352
And my final sort of analogy
is to use Michelangelo

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.783
in terms of this is a very
famous painting of his

00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:23.626
that by design should look like a brain,

00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:26.297
a cross-section of the brain, he, no,

00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:29.202
he wrote about it himself and stuff,

00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:31.715
and it's sometimes called
the original synapse,

00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:32.820
you know, the.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.842
(audience laughs)

00:16:35.842 --> 00:16:37.694
But it's not like that,

00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:41.861
it's much more like his other
expression of art, sculpting.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.908
We start with this block of marble,

00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:49.431
and life experiences and so,

00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:50.727
then we eliminate part.

00:16:50.727 --> 00:16:54.249
So we might be born with
different chunks of marble,

00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:56.427
sizes from genetics, you know,

00:16:56.427 --> 00:17:00.250
but within each, if we
knew what we were doing,

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.076
if we could guide this process,

00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:04.380
you know, there's masterpieces.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.630
And you know, I think almost everybody.

00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:10.746
We don't know very,

00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:13.235
we don't know what we're
doing yet very well.

00:17:13.235 --> 00:17:16.201
And it's like most of
the illnesses emerging

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:20.160
less than 1-1/2 % of the
funding has been adolescence,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.353
until now finally, now,
we have this project,

00:17:24.353 --> 00:17:28.520
that for the first time is
going to really do this right.

00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:34.763
11, 12,000 kids, 19
sites across the country

00:17:36.427 --> 00:17:38.677
to understand what matters.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.757
How does the brain grow
in health and illness,

00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:46.116
looking at, you know, everything
we can think of, frankly,

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.699
in terms of influences on this.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.483
I'm gonna brag for San
Diego a bit in terms of

00:17:54.499 --> 00:17:56.370
there's these 19 sites across the country,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.672
but the coordinating center
for the quantitative core

00:17:59.672 --> 00:18:03.899
and the neuropsyche core
coordinating all the centers

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:05.879
are both here in San Diego as well.

00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:08.908
What a good deal for us,
you know, in terms of

00:18:08.908 --> 00:18:12.794
the opportunities to try to understand

00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:15.859
what matters in teens' lives.

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:18.893
And so the technologies
is a big part of it,

00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:20.962
how can we get a better sense

00:18:20.962 --> 00:18:22.964
of internal and external environments

00:18:22.964 --> 00:18:25.464
with the sensors, with devices

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.477
they're already using, already wearing.

00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:30.062
'Cause this is the crossroads in life.

00:18:30.062 --> 00:18:33.329
This is where people make big decisions

00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:36.110
about their direction in life.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.339
And there's this kind of notion

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:42.320
that teens are messed up and
they're misguided and stuff,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.687
and it's dangerous.

00:18:43.687 --> 00:18:45.885
And I feel bad, 'cause I've,

00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:48.219
(audience laughs)

00:18:48.219 --> 00:18:49.589
Oh, I see.

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:50.868
I don't know, people
will be honest with me.

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:53.201
But this is in the crossroads.

00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:55.560
And what happens is even teens themselves

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.136
buy into this, right?

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.163
And like stereotype, thread and stuff,

00:18:59.163 --> 00:19:00.763
if you think that you're,

00:19:00.763 --> 00:19:03.074
you know, not capable and
stuff like that, it matters.

00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:05.709
Most teens do well, you know,
they'll get through this,

00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:06.836
they'll do well.

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:09.644
But I think we do a disservice
by selling them short

00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:13.409
and I think that we
really need to recognize

00:19:13.409 --> 00:19:17.078
the huge upsides of this,
much more than the downsides

00:19:17.078 --> 00:19:20.287
that if we can figure out what
we're doing, what matters,
