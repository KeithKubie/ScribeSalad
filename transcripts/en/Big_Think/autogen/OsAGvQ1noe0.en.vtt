major newspaper or op-ed type writer to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
to say that because I said it even
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210
to say that because I said it even

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
before the even before the 2000 election

to columns from from the summer of 2000

that I think foreshadow at least

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
that I think foreshadow at least
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200
that I think foreshadow at least
foreshadowed of the way most people now

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
foreshadowed of the way most people now
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520
foreshadowed of the way most people now
think about the Bush administration

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
think about the Bush administration
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.599
think about the Bush administration
before there even was a Bush

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609
before there even was a Bush
 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.220
before there even was a Bush
administration I knew some things that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
administration I knew some things that
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.599
administration I knew some things that
most journalists don't like arithmetic

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609
most journalists don't like arithmetic
 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.860
most journalists don't like arithmetic
and so I was looking at the policy

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
and so I was looking at the policy
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.090
and so I was looking at the policy
proposals and I just said they're lying

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
proposals and I just said they're lying
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430
proposals and I just said they're lying
there they're they're not being honest

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
there they're they're not being honest
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.779
there they're they're not being honest
about what it is they're proposing and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
about what it is they're proposing and
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.180
about what it is they're proposing and
that was a pretty good guide to me it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
that was a pretty good guide to me it
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.680
that was a pretty good guide to me it
seemed to me that was that was much

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
seemed to me that was that was much
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209
seemed to me that was that was much
better evidence than whether Bush seemed

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
better evidence than whether Bush seemed
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.380
better evidence than whether Bush seemed
like a guy that you wanted to have a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
like a guy that you wanted to have a
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.760
like a guy that you wanted to have a
beer with

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770
 
 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.950
 
Social Security which was basically

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
Social Security which was basically
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350
Social Security which was basically
counting the same couple of trillion

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
counting the same couple of trillion
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750
counting the same couple of trillion
dollars twice he was saying we can have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
dollars twice he was saying we can have
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340
dollars twice he was saying we can have
it available to pay benefits but we can

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
it available to pay benefits but we can
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810
it available to pay benefits but we can
also invest it and you'll get lots of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
also invest it and you'll get lots of
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.950
also invest it and you'll get lots of
money out of it and it didn't that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
money out of it and it didn't that
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.770
money out of it and it didn't that
didn't make sense taxes he was claiming

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
didn't make sense taxes he was claiming
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100
didn't make sense taxes he was claiming
that his tax cuts favored the middle

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
that his tax cuts favored the middle
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840
that his tax cuts favored the middle
class and you could do the math they

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
class and you could do the math they
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.220
class and you could do the math they
didn't they were very much tilted

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230
didn't they were very much tilted
 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.660
didn't they were very much tilted
towards the top and and there were a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
towards the top and and there were a
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460
towards the top and and there were a
bunch of other things smaller things but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
bunch of other things smaller things but
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.680
bunch of other things smaller things but
just the the clear dishonesty about what

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
just the the clear dishonesty about what
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.870
just the the clear dishonesty about what
was actually in his own policy proposals

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
was actually in his own policy proposals
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.050
was actually in his own policy proposals
and being the kind of guy I am if you're

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
and being the kind of guy I am if you're
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.750
and being the kind of guy I am if you're
lying about the numbers that to me is

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760
lying about the numbers that to me is
 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.400
lying about the numbers that to me is
you know the it's not really the worst

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410
you know the it's not really the worst
 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.020
you know the it's not really the worst
offense but it's the clearest sign that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
offense but it's the clearest sign that
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.890
offense but it's the clearest sign that
you're not a man you should be published
