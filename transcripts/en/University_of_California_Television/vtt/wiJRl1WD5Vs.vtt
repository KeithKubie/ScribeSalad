- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:39.290
master of fire, tools, and language but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:48.640
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.550
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.360
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here; an exploration made possible

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.092
by the generosity of humans like you.

- [Pascal] Welcome to this 24th CARTA
symposium. My name is Pascal Gagneux. I'm

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.430
the Associate Director of CARTA. Among the
oldest questions that humans have asked

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.740
figure questions such as, "Who are we?"
"What are we doing here?" "Where did we

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.330
come from?" "How did we get here?" and
"Where are we going?" Anthropogeny is the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.930
scientific quest to address two of these
questions, "Where did we come from?" and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.010
"How did we get here?" that we at CARTA
believe are addressable with scientific

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.920
data from a great number of disciplines.
Anthropogeny, it turns out, is a very old

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.690
term that has vanished and we have
resuscitated it. The Center for Academic

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.500
Research and Training in Anthropogeny is
an enterprise between UCSD and Salk, and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.480
it spans the general campus and health
sciences as well as Salk. It is

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.800
co-directed by Ajit Varki, Fred Gage, and
Margaret Schoeninger. Our MSO is Linda

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.090
Nelson. Our Community Director...
Relations Director is Ingrid

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.550
Benirschke-Perkins. Kate Kaya is in charge
of all our computer and computer

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.210
analysis, Jesse Robie, our Program
Coordinator, and Stefi Petit, our

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.510
Administrative Assistant. As I mentioned,
trying to answer these two age-old

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.470
questions will only be possible if we draw
on the humanities, on biological sciences,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.630
engineering and computing sciences, as
well as physical and chemical sciences,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:46.140
biomedical sciences, social sciences. Many
of the people involved in these venues of

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.500
studying humans are not used to talking to
each other, at least not on a daily basis.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.310
So we really try to encourage regular
interactions between scientists from very

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.290
different fields. Our mission statement is
the following: "Use all rational and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.340
ethical approaches to seek all verifiable
facts from all relevant disciplines to

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.600
explore and explain the origins of the
human phenomenon, doing so while

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.150
minimizing complex organizational
structures and hierarchies and avoiding

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.980
unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy."
Unfortunately, there is also electronic

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.130
bureaucracy these days, and we also try to
do so, "In the process, raise awareness

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.920
and understanding of the study of human
origins within the academic community and

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.550
the public at large," which is why these
symposia are free and open to the public.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.430
I would like to point out that this is
only possible due to many people who

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.540
support us, first and foremost the G.
Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Charitable

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.490
Foundation of New York and Howard Chester
the Executive Director. I would like

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.390
to take a moment to remind you that we've
lost a very, very valuable friend and

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.460
supporter who always supported our
initiatives and really contributed greatly

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.590
to the spirit of these symposia, but much
more so of everything CARTA does, and this

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.560
Jim Handelman, who we lost earlier
this year. He has come to many of the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.800
symposia. He has had an important role in
shaping how we do the symposia. He was a

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.500
very strong force behind the idea of
involving a small group of highly

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.930
motivated grad students to include them in
the symposia, and we will miss him dearly.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.180
We have established a memorial symposium
fund in his honor. We need to thank, and

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.860
if you'd like to read more about Jim
Handelman, our latest Tracks, CARTA

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.760
Tracks which is a newsletter, you can find
as a PDF online or pick up copies outside,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.730
has a very nice, conscise, two-page story
that will convince you very rapidly how

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.530
crucial Jim was in the development of
CARTA from a very long time ago when it

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.150
was a small group of scientists on the
mesa here interested in explaining

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.600
human origins. The UC is the project for
explaining human origins to CARTA. That

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.780
started eight years ago. We need to thank
many other supporters, including Liz

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.383
Lancaster and Eli Shefter, that make
possible the closed captioning on the

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:34.100
recordings, and of course Annette
Merle-Smith for the support that she

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.680
provides for the graduate specialization
in anthropogeny at UC San Diego. And we

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.470
have a growing list of individual
supporters who make these events possible.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.030
Thank you to all of them. And of course,
none of this would be possible without a

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.690
big team, a crew of people here at
UC-TV, Rich Wargo, Matt Alioto, Marci

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.010
Bretts, Jacob Parker, as well as, of
course, the Salk Media Services, Kent

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:08.690
Schnoeker and Krys Schempp. So
without further ado...one last thing. Some

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.730
of you might not be aficionados of genomic
or genetic sciences. If you hear acronyms

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.920
that sound strange, you might want to pick
up this two-page glossary that the

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.510
specialization students tried to generate
to help you navigate the many acronyms

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.290
that you usually hear in genetics and
genomics talks. So with that, I welcome

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.200
you all and I'll pass the podium to Ed
Green who will chair the first half of the

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.547
symposium.
