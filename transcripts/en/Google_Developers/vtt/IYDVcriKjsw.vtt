Ever found yourself writing a build method

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.745
and wished you could know
how big your widget was going to be

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.616
before you decided how it would look?

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:15.486
Well, <i>LayoutBuilder</i> can help.

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:18.045
Its builder function
has parameters for build context

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.527
and the incoming box constraints--

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:23.307
those are the valid width
and height ranges for the widget.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.967
Your build logic
can check those constraints

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:29.286
and then make smart decisions
about how to compose itself.

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.745
