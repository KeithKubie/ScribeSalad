once upon a time all of Britain was

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.650
covered in wild wood a hunting ground

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.460
for kings an ancient home for many

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.970
beasts few places remain where this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.040
landscape can now be found in the new

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.750
forests that world still exists

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.410
[Music]

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.199
it is an old world full of life where

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:48.210
common creatures live side by side with

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:51.360
the last of the medieval monsters the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.579
new forest contains many unique habitats

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.089
here there are trees over 600 years old

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:04.830
for some their time is up but death

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:17.100
brings new life beneath this fallen

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:21.750
giant the earth is stirring a male stag

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.450
beetle he has spent the last six years

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.609
as an underground grub feeding on the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.789
dead wood now his quest begins to find a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:37.560
mate before the end of his short adult

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.100
life whilst beetles use the trees for

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.149
food

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.249
another creature uses them to build

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.060
amongst the conifers there is a kingdom

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.060
of Millions

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.430
[Music]

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.430
southern wood hands

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:07.009
this fortress may host a hundred Queens

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.280
all busy producing the next generation

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:16.580
of workers they might seem like an easy

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:22.220
lunch for larger predators but the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.340
battlements are well defended when

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:32.980
threatened the ants fire Jets of formic

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:37.660
acid enough to make a Robin think twice

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.880
drama over the ants return to business

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.209
with an army to feed the workers are

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.319
always on the lookout for dinner nothing

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.319
is off the menu

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.299
the oldest ants roamed farthest they

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.549
know this terrain inside out but this

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.330
worker may have overestimated her

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.290
abilities

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.260
it's a dung beetle this Goliath is far

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:16.430
too powerful for a single ant it escapes

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:22.910
onto the heath where the woodland has

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:26.540
been kept at bay for centuries equine

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.489
teeth have shaped this world but the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:34.480
ponies create something much more

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.480
attractive at least for a dung beetle

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:54.130
his path is filled with many obstacles

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:56.420
but at the end of a hard road the beetle

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:12.280
finds a feast

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:12.280
[Music]

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:26.910
we're gorse replaces grassland another

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:32.660
monster stalks the heath the tiger

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:37.140
beetle with excellent eyesight and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.740
massive jaws it will pounce on anything

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.740
that moves

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.810
fierce though he is nearby there is a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.730
place where even monsters fear to tread

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:58.740
dry Heath merges into saturated bog

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:05.150
these sundews have a deadly secret their

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.150
sweet nectar is a lure and a sticky trap

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:19.380
the victim is slowly digested the soil

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:32.310
here is low in nutrients and sundews

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:37.140
need these supplements to survive this

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.740
butterfly is too big for a Sun due for

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.240
him the bog is just a feeding ground

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:50.900
but the reeds are also battlefields and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.900
every stagnant pond is a dragon's lair a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:02.750
keeled skimmer ready to duel clashes are

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.750
fast paced and frequent

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.490
with the Challenger repelled he can mate

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.320
without competition there is no

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.890
courtship among dragons

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.890
the male seizes any female in his domain

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:40.160
mating is brief now the female lays her

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.160
eggs

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.030
[Music]

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:52.530
she flicks them underwater whilst the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:54.870
male guards her from above the more eggs

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.820
she larry's the more chance some will

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.870
survive

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.870
[Music]

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.890
this dragon will be dead by winter

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.380
during his brief reign he will mate as

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.440
often as possible so that in the years

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.220
to come it will be his descendants who

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.220
rule the air

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:32.000
back in the woodland the Stags quest is

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.000
at an end

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:47.420
he has found a female so has another to

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.420
win her they must jest

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:29.969
the stack has proved his worth now it is

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:34.279
time to claim his mate this is the stags

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:49.260
last act his genes will be passed on and

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:52.380
in a few days he will die with mating

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.889
over the stag does not release his grip

00:08:52.380 --> 00:09:00.660
but the female has good reason to break

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:05.130
free she must find a safe spot to lay

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:12.240
her eggs and ensure the future of her

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:17.160
offspring the new forest has been

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:24.060
unchanged for a thousand years ancient

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:26.279
life still clings to an old world this

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:31.430
patchwork of habitats provides a

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:31.430
stronghold for creatures of a bygone age

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:43.620
the Dragons the Goliath the soldiers of

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:46.490
