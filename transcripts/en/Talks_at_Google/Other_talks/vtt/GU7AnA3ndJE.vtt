00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt;presenter: Charisma is like magic.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.920
Charisma is kind of the last actual form of
magic that we have in the world and people

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.170
traditionally react to the fact that there's
still magic in the world in one of two ways;

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.080
some people pretend that there is no magic,
there is no charisma, it doesn't actually

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.670
have affect.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.430
A lot of the tech world would like to believe
that technology moves the mountains, but really

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.690
the charisma, that magic moves bigger mountains
than technology ever has and maybe ever will.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.600
There are other people who love charisma because
it's magic and they kind of want it to stay

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
magic.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.050
But what I'm excited about today, is that
Olivia who's come here to speak to us has

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.899
been laying that patient out on the table
and really kind for the first time dissecting

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.710
it to look at what makes it magic.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.290
In some ways it's kind of sad, but also really
brave and tremendously exciting to take one

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.050
of these things, which we don't understand,
and to make it apparent and understandable

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.050
to us.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.600
And I think this is an incredibly exciting
frontier; Olivia's at the front of it.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.790
Her book is in its second printing maybe headed
for its third and hasn't even come out yet.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.110
It's already been a huge success in the schools
where she's been teaching it.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.280
We're very lucky to have her here.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.680
Please help me welcome my good friend Olivia.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140
[Applause]

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.440
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Thank you.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.840
The question I am always asked when I start
speaking is of course because of the book

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.060
title what is the charisma myth.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.520
And the first and easy one to bust is that
charisma is not innate.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.240
It can be learned and here's how.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.989
So the fact that charisma is not innate was
the first one that kind of took us by surprise

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.260
but I can tell you that in controlled laboratory
experiments researchers were able to lower

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.989
or raise people's level of charisma like turning
a dial.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.499
Just by instructing them to display certain
specific charismatic behaviors.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.340
This is what the research has found.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.800
Charisma is nothing but a set of specific
behaviors.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.569
So of course, the next question is, “What
are these behaviors?”

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.980
Turns out that there are three main components
to charisma.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.140
The first is presence.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.310
This is the foundation upon which all else
rests.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.519
If you speak to people who've met Bill Clinton
this is one of the first things that they

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.900
talk about.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.280
Clinton has an extraordinary presence right.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.370
What presence means is simply that.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.090
The ability to fully focus on the person that
you're speaking to, the ability to make them

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.580
feel that they are the only person in the
room.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.480
And of course Clinton is known to do that
to an extraordinary degree.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.180
And I met hardened Republicans who told me
Bill Clinton I hated him before I met him,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.510
I hated him after I met him, when I met him,
man, I love the man.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.510
[Laughter]

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.359
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Without presence everything
falls apart.

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.810
Have you ever been in a conversation where
only half your mind was present and the other

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.569
half was busy doing something else?

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.779
Raise your hands if that's ever happened to
you.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.779
[Hands raising]

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.389
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Awesome.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:56.489
When that happens you may think that you are
getting away with it.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.480
We think we can fake presence.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.620
We think we can fake listening.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.139
We think that as long as we seem attentive
and kind of pay attention to what's going

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.689
on, we've done enough.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.150
But we're wrong.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.879
In that conversation when only half your mind
was present and the other half was busy doing

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:23.030
something else, there is a good chance that
your facial expressions were split second

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.150
delayed and your eyes got a slight glazed
over look, tiny, and yet people will catch

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.550
that because people will read your face in
as fast as seventeen to thirty-two milliseconds.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.030
At a gut level when there's that slight delay
it gives a feeling that there's something

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.660
not quite right, something doesn't quite fit.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.430
At worst they get the feeling that you are
inauthentic.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.690
Nothing kills charisma faster than appearing
inauthentic.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.160
The used car salesmen approach does not work
well, not recommended.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.940
So presence of course the question you're
going to ask me is how do you get it?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.229
How do you ensure that you are present in
the conversation?

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:18.340
My favorite trick is also one of the most
simple you could find; focus on your toes.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.610
And the reason I mean that is that your toes
are about as far from your brain as possible.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.270
It makes your brain so sweep through your
entire body at high speed to feel all the

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.819
physical sensations up and down.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.470
It gets you physically present in the moment.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.750
You can do that right.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.590
Despite focusing on your toes, you will have
upped your level of charisma right away.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.590
[Laughter]

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.030
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Didn't know your toes
were going to be crucial to charisma.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.880
By the way something I should mention is that
there is no Q and A period at the end of this

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.080
talk.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.250
The time to ask questions is now.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.270
Stop me at any time, raise your hands, and
shout out, I'll be fine with that.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.009
So your toes, right, that's number one.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:03.639
Technique number two is to focus on the pupils
of the person that you are speaking to and

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.070
you'll be surprised to see how in their irises
and pupils there are an extraordinary array

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.319
of colors that can deep you quite captivated
and better yet they will give you that deep

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.080
soul searching eye contact.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.889
This is absolutely fantastic; a true Clintonesque
approach.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.020
Consequences of course, but we will not go
into that that today.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.020
[Laughter]

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.020
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Yes.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.520
&gt;&gt;male#1: When people do this to me I find
it really creepy.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.490
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: When they do this thing
to you, you find it really creepy, the deep

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.620
soul searching eye contact?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.979
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Yeah, don't overdo.

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:33.979
[Laughter]

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.080
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: So when two human beings
stare deeply into one another's eyes there's

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.220
an adrenaline like substance called PEA or
phenyl ethylamine that goes gushing through

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.060
your bloodstream and theirs.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.569
It is the same hormone that produces the phenomenon
we call love at first sight.

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.060
So it's a very useful hormone.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.639
Throughout this talk what I'm actually going
to be teaching you to do is how to play chemist

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.689
with your own brain to get a more charismatic
brain.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:01.639
However, in studies where rows of two strangers
were asked to stare intently in one another's

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:07.120
eyes, within just a few minutes, participants
reported increased affection and some even

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.719
passionate feelings for one another.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:09.719
[Laughter]

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.220
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: So clearly you don't
want to overdo it.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.360
They can be very effective.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360
[Laughter]

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.360
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: This is only to keep
yourself present and if you think that this

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.180
is not going to feel comfortable switch to
the third one.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.879
Here's the third; you know how in independent
movies and indie movies the main character

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.289
even if he is completely uninteresting I'm
thinking a clerk, small rats, any Kevin Smith

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:34.590
movie, yet they become fascinating to you.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.569
Just because they are the hero of the movie.

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:37.569
Yes?

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.909
Do that with the person you're speaking to
pretend that they're the heroes of an indie

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:42.930
movie.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.830
All right, so that's presence.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:58.490
So the next is power and there's a misconception
about power, which is that someone who's powerful

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.099
that power is like the power to command an
army.

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:02.990
That's actually incorrect.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:11.260
The way we perceive power in someone is through
signs of status, such as of course expensive

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.750
clothing, titles, corner office, or how other
people around that person react to them.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.159
But most of all, it's in body language.

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:29.270
If someone appears confident we will assume
that they have something to be confident about.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:38.820
The key thing to remember is that in general
people will accept whatever you project.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:47.290
So one of the main things to talk about here
because very few people ever do is what kills

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.130
confidence?

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.240
What kills that projection of power?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240
&gt;&gt;male#2: Self-doubt?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.160
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Yeah, self doubt.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.089
Specifically self criticism.

00:08:57.089 --> 00:09:03.010
And in one of the manifestations of self doubt
known as the imposter syndrome competent people

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.880
feel that they don't really know what they're
doing and it's only a matter of time before

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.110
they're found out and exposed as a fraud.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.540
The interesting thing about the imposter syndrome
is that the higher up the intelligence ladder

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.870
you go the worse it hits.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:24.589
I know that every time I speak at MIT at Harvard,
at Yale, at Stanford you could hear a pin

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:26.320
drop, the room goes silent.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.400
Every year the incoming class of Stanford
GSB is asked, how many of you in here feel

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.300
that you are the one mistake the admissions
committee made?

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.160
Every year two thirds of the students immediately
raise their hands.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.050
So the original researchers estimated that
it hits about seventy to eighty percent of

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.050
the population.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.100
It can have pretty unfortunate effects are
our creativity because the imposter syndrome

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.940
tends to launch the threat response of sympathetic
nervous system which I'm sure you've heard

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.540
about; that's the fight or flight response
which launches adrenaline and cortisol through

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:07.180
our veins and when you're in a threat response
there's a fantastic podcast on iTunes on Stanford

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.950
U called Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, which
I highly recommend.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.350
When you're in fight or flight mode your body
wants you surviving the next ten seconds;

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.940
it doesn't care about the next 10 years.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.500
So, it's going to put all its resources towards
the important stuff, like muscle reaction,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.740
like breathing rate, like heart rate, and
it's going to shut down all the superfluous

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.510
functions, such as cognitive reasoning; really
not important at that moment, free association

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.560
and all the stuff that's kind of important
for innovation.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.649
So in the work I've been doing on the mental
side of innovations, the psychology of innovation,

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:43.570
we found that things such as the imposter
syndrome, self doubt, and self criticism and

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.149
of course the inability to handle uncertainty
kills you innovation potential it's pretty

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:50.010
dramatic.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.660
So of course the next question is: “how
would you handle the imposter syndrome?

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.010
How do you handle self doubt?”

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.800
There are three steps.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.889
We're going to cover one right now and hopefully
we'll have the time to cover the next two

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:04.360
under the warmth heading.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:10.690
The first one you've actually just done right
now, destigmatization, lifting the stigma

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.480
off the experience.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:21.060
Because one of the hardest burdens for the
human being to bear; one of the emotions that

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.970
kills us faster than anything else is shame.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:30.130
There's a fantastic TED talk by Brené Brown
on shame and vulnerability that I would highly

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.770
recommend.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.720
All you need to know is that just by knowing
that the impostor syndrome has a name that

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.740
it's normal you can see it as simply a legacy
of your genetic heritage.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.290
Just like our appendix.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.829
Sometimes the appendix gets inflamed and we
get appendicitis.

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:53.230
Sometimes the imposter syndrome acts up and
we get an attack of the imposter syndrome.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.199
Same thing, no big deal.

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:57.290
That's step one.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.380
Step two and three, which is detach and rewrite;
we will hopefully have the time to see that

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.750
in the warmth section.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:11.380
But for now what I'd like to do is give you
a sense of how broadcasting confidence and

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.320
power through your body language works.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.970
This is called learning to display alpha gorilla
body language.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.970
[Light laughter]

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:24.470
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: So if you think of a
gorilla, right; imagine a gorilla owns half

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.470
the jungle.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.709
Rival comes in and breeches his territory.

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:29.380
Gorilla is annoyed.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.490
What would the gorilla do?

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.990
Beats his chest, right, inflates, makes big
noises why is he doing that?

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.890
&gt;&gt;male#3: To create fear

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.959
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: To create fear how?

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.139
&gt;&gt;male#3: By looking bigger.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.509
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: I think I heard.

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:48.250
By looking bigger.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.530
And what Sanford research has found, is that
guess what, humans do the same thing.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:58.110
High status confident people tend to use furniture,
quote unquote, wrong.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.769
They will sit on the table, they'll drape
their arms on two chairs, they'll put their

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:03.860
feet on the table, and they'll put their feet
on three chairs.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.830
What they're doing is that they're claiming
more space as theirs.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.530
They're being alpha gorillas.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.430
So what you need to learn is, think of the
opposite, right, which is the nervous kid

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.160
who's kind of hunched over huddling over is
not alpha gorilla body language.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.579
So if you wouldn't mind, put down laptops,
books, whatever, stand up.

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:21.579
[Audience stands]

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:24.509
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: They didn't tell you
it was a physical exercise to wear comfortable

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:27.310
clothing and good shoes?

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.960
All right.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.640
Stretch your arms toward the ceiling and try
to touch the ceiling with your fingertips.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640
Thank you.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.640
Awesome.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.190
Now put your fingertips towards the side of
the wall.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.149
Sides of the wall people, it should not be
this difficult.

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:43.589
I see that math is not math is not your forte
clearly.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:46.740
All right, you can just let your arms drop.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:53.360
Your shoulders back and now I want you to
inflate, puff up, take about as much air as

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.459
you can.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:55.949
You can exhale.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:14:00.231
Put your arms behind your back and now what
I want you to do is imagine that you are a

00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:02.710
five star general reviewing his troops.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.380
So have that look like, right, you get your
feet a little bit wider, you're going to tilt

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.410
your nose up a little bit because; imagine
a troop of GI Joes passing in front of you

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.480
and your kind of reviewing them as they pass
by.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.570
All right, do you feel a physical change through
your body?

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.780
[Audience member answers]

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.390
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Yes.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.390
Excellent.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.620
What is happening is that when people take
expansive poses, which are what this is called

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.920
you, get a flood of assertiveness promoting
hormones through your veins.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.019
You are learning to play chemist with your
own brain.

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:35.190
Thank you very much ladies and gentleman,
you can sit down.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.930
[Audience sits down]

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:42.949
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: So this is a virtual
cycle because the more you take on an expansive

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:46.820
pose, the more you'll get those chemicals
flowing through your body which of course

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.570
is going to affect your body language which
gives yet another boost, et cetera.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.600
All you have to do is get the cycle going.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.759
So what I'm often asked is it's great if I
can look powerful and confident; that's fantastic,

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:02.880
but how do I avoid appearing arrogant?

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:11.120
If you think back towards the pose you were
taking; when people are considered to be arrogant

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.290
or snobbish, it's often said that they were
looking down their nose at someone.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.709
Yeah?

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:22.779
What this means is that their head was tilted
too far up so in order to appear non arrogant,

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:25.300
you just bring your chin down.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.450
This has the added benefit of opening up your
eyes wider which is going to make you appear

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.790
more thoughtful and more intelligent.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.420
Just kind of nice combination.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.750
The other thing is to pause for two seconds
before you speak.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:46.850
This will again give the impression that you
are giving such consideration to their statement

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.453
because it is so important that you can't
just answer back that that, you've got to

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:52.040
absorb it.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.319
And one of my good friends who is here in
the audience today said that when he was here

00:15:55.319 --> 00:16:01.319
at Google meeting Clinton for the first time
and he was so excited to meet the former president

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:05.540
comes up to him; he's so nervous that he doesn't
know what to say and he finds himself saying:

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.790
Mr. President, thank you for your service
to this country”.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.730
And the minute he said that he was like “Oh
god”.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.510
But Clinton takes him saying “Thank you
so much”.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.981
It was like the most amazing thing [laughter]
someone had ever told him.

00:16:19.981 --> 00:16:22.870
And my friend says that he nailed it.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.360
I have never seen anyone take a compliment
that way.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.510
So pausing for two seconds before you speak.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.350
You can actually try to alpha gorilla exercise
as you're walking down the street and what's

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:40.389
fascinating is that realize that when we're
moving through an environment, subconsciously

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:47.100
our brain is constantly scanning our surroundings
for anything that we need to deviate around.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:53.329
Whether it be inanimate or whether it be animate,
i.e., human, and we are constantly reading

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:57.940
one another's body language to decide how
to react and in this situation whether to

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.240
move aside or not.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:05.089
If they seem like a bigger alpha gorilla than
we are, we're going to move aside.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:09.439
But if we are broadcasting the stronger alpha
gorilla body language they're going to move

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:10.709
aside.

00:17:10.709 --> 00:17:17.789
So one of the assignments that I give to my
clients; which I actually first heard from

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:24.370
a young Stanford boxing student, their coach
had given them this assignment of go to a

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.510
crowded environment be the alpha gorilla.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.190
And your job is to make people move aside
for you.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.309
I don't care if it means a collision.

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:33.990
You'll learn to apologize later.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.990
[Laughter]

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.150
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: For the moment be the
alpha gorilla.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.810
And some of my clients who've tried this told
me it's amazing.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.840
It was like Moses parting the sea [laughter].

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.370
They could see people as they were walking
around with that alpha gorilla body language

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.350
they could see people parting way for them.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.470
So try that and of course a non dangerous
situation.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.470
[Laughter]

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.400
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: All right.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.620
So that's power.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.460
We've seen presence, we're seen power, remind
me what the third one is.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.240
[Audience member answers]

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.620
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Warmth.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.620
Excellent.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.990
They're paying attention.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.990
Fantastic.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.730
Warmth is not comfortable for many of us.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:22.720
For many of us warmth is that category of
messy uncomfortable feeling range.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.570
We'd much rather stay in the nice well organized
space of our heads.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.270
Unfortunately warmth is absolutely critical
to charisma.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.000
All three components, presence, power, and
warmth are critical to charisma.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.299
You cannot delete any one of them entirely.

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:47.990
The only thing that will change is depending
which element of charisma is strongest, which

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:54.460
element whether it be presence or power, or
warmth, you'll get different kinds of charisma.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:01.039
High warmth or high your warmth is for example
kindness charisma what the Dalai Lama has.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:06.720
Higher power is your authority charisma, which
is our classic you know dictator charisma.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.830
They all have different benefits.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.190
Authority charisma is super useful when you're
a crisis situation and need people to obey

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.100
and react fast.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.710
Terrible for brainstorming.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.740
It kills critical thinking and feedback.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.390
Warmth charisma is wonderful when you've got
someone who's coming to you with a big problem

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.760
it kind of wraps them around in a pink fluffy
blanket cocoon.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.929
Not so useful when you trying to get people
to move and get out of the fire fast.

00:19:34.929 --> 00:19:42.840
So the important thing about warmth to know
is that you cannot fake warmth.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:49.539
The reason for that is that warmth is evaluated
entirely and completely through body language

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:57.809
and the thing is there is far too much body
language for us to control consciously.

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:01.789
Were you aware of your eyelids fluttering
in front of your eyes until I mentioned at

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:04.520
right now.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.740
How about the weight of your tongue in your
mouth?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.090
What about the position of your toes?

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.200
Had you forgotten your eyelids again?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200
[Laughter]

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:21.850
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: It is impossible for
us to control our body language entirely.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.620
Even when we control the main expression on
our face, sooner or later, what's called a

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:32.620
micro expression will flash and the problem
is that even if it's as fast as seventeen

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:39.040
to thirty two milliseconds, as you know, people
will catch that, and on a gut level if the

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.440
main expression of the micro are incompatible,
incongruent is a technical term, they'll get

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.309
the gut feeling that there's something that's
not quite right; something doesn't quite fit

00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:53.130
and you'll come across as inauthentic.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:21:00.419
This is why great actors were exhausted after
great performances because they had been working

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:06.450
so hard to get their entire body language
in congruence and even with years of training

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.770
it was impossible to get it perfectly in congruence
because, think of it every minute you had

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.049
tens of thousands of units of body language
pouring out of you.

00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:19.409
So did Hollywood do?

00:21:19.409 --> 00:21:22.429
What form of acting did they come up with?

00:21:22.429 --> 00:21:23.770
&gt;&gt;male#4: Method acting

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.770
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Method acting.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:25.770
What's method acting?

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.770
&gt;&gt;male#4: Having the emotion.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.140
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: You have the emotion.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:34.940
What that means is that you don't try to control
the body language you actually try to control

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.540
the source, which is your subconscious mind.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.580
In Hollywood this is called method acting.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.570
In sports it's called sports psychology or
visualization and eighty six percent of American

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.270
Olympic athletes use this tool.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:54.331
Golfer Jack Nicklaus used to say he would
never hit a shot, even in practice, without

00:21:54.331 --> 00:21:56.370
visualizing it first.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.870
So you're going to try it for yourselves.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.540
Could you please find someone in the room
that you do not like.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.540
[laughter]

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.080
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: I am kidding.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.430
Turn towards your neighbor.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.640
Find your neighbor and turn towards him or
her.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.100
Just look at each other, that's all you need
to do.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.710
[Audience chatter]

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:21.550
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: All right people.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.990
Just look at each other, not me.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.350
Look at each other's eyes.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.919
Look at each other's eyes.

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:28.690
Close your eyes.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.150
Close your eyes.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.539
I want you to think about a problem at work.

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:37.400
Something annoying, irritating, embarrassing.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.669
Something uncertain.

00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:41.799
Something the outcome of which is a real problem.

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.100
Get into that problem.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.419
Open your eyes.

00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:47.799
All right.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.990
I think you got the message.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.890
Close your eyes again.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.760
Close your eyes again.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.240
Now I'd like to think of one person in your
life that you have great affection for.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.030
Whether this be a human being or a pet or
even a stuffed animal.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:15.419
Find one being that you could have great affection
for and just think of feel your affection

00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:20.910
for them and their affection for you.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.910
Open your eyes.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.910
[Laughter]

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:27.550
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Did you see a difference
in their face?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.850
Where you see the biggest difference?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.900
[Audience chatter]

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:42.970
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Where do you see the
biggest difference?

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.340
[Audience chatter]

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.600
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: The eyes.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.600
All right.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.710
What are the eyes?

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:55.350
How many of you are thinking the windows to
the soul?

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.350
Yeah.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.070
You are absolutely right.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.220
The area around the eyes is the most mobile
of the entire human face and therefore also

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:11.230
the most expressive, which is why poker players
wear sunglasses.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:16.039
Shipping magnate Onassis to also wear sunglasses
when he was negotiating shipping contracts

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:19.720
so that opponents could not see what he was
thinking.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.570
So your eyes is one of the biggest tellers
of warmth.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.669
The other one is yours voice.

00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:29.840
Voice is critical.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.690
One of my favorite stats to quote is that
the MIT media lab was able to predict with

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:42.180
eighty-seven percent accuracy the outcome
of sales calls, negotiations, and business

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:48.890
plan pitches without listening to a single
word of content.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:55.450
Only by analyzing the voice fluctuation and
the facial expressions of the person pitching.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:01.990
So with voice what you'll want to get is a
highly fluctuating voice.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.320
Think of someone speaking to a baby; you know
how your voice goes all sing song when you

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320
do that?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320
That's what you want to do.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.820
Not that exaggerated but that's the direction.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:17.049
What you'll want to work against is anyone
with a nasal voice; you are at a disadvantage.

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:20.620
Nasal voices just tend to sound colder.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.750
They're less easily pleasant to listen to.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.270
So if that's the case…

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.620
&gt;&gt;male#5: Could we have an example?

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.340
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: This would be a nasal
voice.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.539
I'm of course exaggerating, but taking it
from the example, my voice tends to fluctuate

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:39.950
off the charts; I'm a professional speaker,
this is what I do.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:46.360
You don't need to have a voice that is that
fluctuating, but think of playing with speed,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.029
pitch, tempo, intonation.

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:58.570
The worst -the opposite would be a flat monotone
voice that is also cold and nasal.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.070
&gt;&gt;male#6: Can it be controlled?

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.070
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Yes.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.070
Oh completely.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.170
You can learn to tweak your voice at will.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.450
The same thing for voice, though you cannot
control, again, you can't control directly

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.480
your facial expressions and body language
because if I were to tell you exactly the

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.070
kind of body language you want for charisma
you'd have to be controlling ten thousand,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.549
at least, ten thousand different pieces of
body language at the same time.

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:24.520
Much faster to go straight to the source.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.549
Get the specific image you want and that will
affect the entire body language.

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:33.289
So again to recap tell you what you've learned
today.

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:34.289
What is charisma?

00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:35.460
[Audience member answering]

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.399
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Presence, power, and
warmth.

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:39.399
Thank you.

00:26:39.399 --> 00:26:40.399
What else?

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:41.399
[Audience member answering]

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.690
&gt;&gt;Olivia Fox Cabane: Body language is important.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.450
All right, I think we've got that one straight.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.630
Body language is absolutely critical.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.760
Charisma is a whole lot of body language.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.679
There is of course a whole lot more to it,
which you will find in the book.

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:59.030
I have not quite enough time for that today,
but here are two good ways to reach me for

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.740
all the questions that I haven't answered
yet.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:10.840
My email is olivia@askolivia.com and the website
is of course askolivia.com.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:17.090
On the website you'll find many freebies,
including a breakdown of how Steve Jobs methodically

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.910
learned charisma step by step.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.929
Because I have news for you Steve Jobs is
one of those who learned charisma.

00:27:23.929 --> 00:27:25.950
He was not born with it.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.679
With that said ladies and gentleman, it was
absolutely a pleasure speaking with you today.

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:30.679
Thank you very much.

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:30.820
[Applause]
