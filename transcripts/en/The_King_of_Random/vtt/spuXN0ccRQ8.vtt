00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey guys welcome back and thanks for joining us today on The King of Random

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.160
In the history of inventions, one  of the greatest of all mankind

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.020
is the ability to harness and control electricity.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.660
Some of the old experiments that taught us how electricity works are really incredible.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.620
In 1745, an early  version of a capacitor was invented by Ewald G. Von Kleist,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.180
when he accidentally gave an electric charge to a medicine bottle.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.400
A year later a man named  Pieter van Musschenbroek came up with the same invention while living in a city called Leyden.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.600
His version of the invention became a lot more popular and was named after the city and is now called a Leyden jar

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.420
Its most basic a Leyden jar is an insulated container with an inside and outside holding opposite charges

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.930
When something bridges a connection between the two the charges equalized and it creates an electric shock the purpose of today's video is to learn

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.840
how to build our own

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.279
Leyden Jar charge it up using electricity and then discharge it to get that electric shock the materials we need for this build are pretty

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.649
Simple we need a plastic bottle some aluminum foil a nail and some tape to build up our static charge

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.839
We're also going to want some paper towels and a length of

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.419
PVC pipe this one's about three feet long the exact length isn't important. We've gathered up all of our supplies now

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
Let's get started. You can use most any type of plastic bottle for this experiment

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.299
I prefer the type that has straight walls because we're going to be wrapping aluminum foil around the bottle and it's easier to wrap evenly

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.579
With straight walls than if it has a lot of curves in it

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.350
First empty your bottle

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.960
Next let's remove the label from the bottle it might work

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.169
Just as well with it still on, but I think it gives it a cleaner look if we take it off

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.980
Next let's tear off a piece of aluminum foil approximately the same length as the straight portion of our bottle

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.609
Let's see if some of the glue residue on the bottle will stick to the foil oh

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440
It does that's brilliant

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.979
If your bottle doesn't have sticky residue you can roll it up. Just the same way

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.479
It doesn't need to be stuck to it like that. We have a little bit extra foil. I'm just gonna trim it off

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.949
With our foil wrapped around our bottle, let's secure it in place with a couple of pieces of tape

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.820
There you have it we now have a nice conductive coating on the outside of our

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.890
Insulated bottle fill your bottle almost all the way with water leaving a gap at the top of about an inch or two

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.509
100% pure water actually won't conduct electricity but most tap water has enough minerals and impurities in it that it will but just to be

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.959
Sure, let's add a pinch of salt to make sure that our water conducts electricity very easily

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.420
It should only take a pinch you really don't need much

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.580
There you go with the salt mix it into the water

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.070
We now have a very conductive liquid inside the bottle now the last step in building our Leyden jar is to drive our nail down

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.790
Through the center of the bottle cap so that a portion of the nail is sticking up above the bottle

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.399
But some of it is also sticking down into the salt water

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.580
You can see that the bottom of the nail is submerged in our salt water

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.330
This will allow a good electric current to flow from the nail to the water

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.518
And just like that your Leyden jar is built

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.569
This is now a device that for some time can hold an electric charge unless something conductive

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.660
Connects the nail to the foil with our Leyden jar complete

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.320
it's time to charge it up using static electricity a very easy and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.229
Consistent way to build a static electric charge is using paper towel and PVC before we start using our PVC

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.030
Let's clean it off using some high grit sandpaper to be sure that it's free of any oils or dirts or residue

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.909
You can see that the sandpaper is so fine that it doesn't even actually take off any of the printing on the pipe

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.870
But it is removing some extra residue

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.439
Now take a piece of paper towel and run it along the length of the PVC pipe quickly this will help build up a static

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.439
electricity charge I

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.609
Don't know if you can hear that but

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.730
It's building up a charge fast

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.939
All right with a static charge built up in our PVC. It's time to transfer it into our Leyden jar

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.049
We'll do this by just passing the PVC pipe very close to the nail it

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.539
Sounds like if you rub the balloon on your hair

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.859
Or if you've ever had one of those old see our TV screens right when you turn it off makes that crackling noise

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.699
I've now charged up the PVC and put that electricity into our Leyden jar five or six times now

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.069
So I think it's time for a test to see if it will discharge

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.859
The nitrile gloves are gonna be too much of an insulator

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.419
So I'm gonna take them off try grabbing the foil and then touching nail to see if I get a shock oh

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.709
I got a shock just from the foil

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.859
That's not how it's normally supposed to go, but it's probably good side. We'll find out I know that

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.538
Was a little bit a little bit of a shock

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.739
And I jumped too hard just because I was nervous about whether or not it was powerful

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.579
I think it was probably not a good idea to keep the PVC pipe so close to the bottle it might have still

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.109
had some interference with the electric fields and it also is possible that I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.560
Had just inadvertently built up an electric charge in the foil itself

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.089
And then when I first touched that it discharged a little bit, so let's try this again

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.329
All right, and it shocked me again wonder what's going on here. Well. I'll still try touching the nail

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.670
Yeah, it still got me again. It is working to some extent

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.610
I'm able to hold the foil and I get a zap when I touch the nail

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.300
But it's also zapping me a little bit when I grab the foil in the first place

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.030
So I'm going to try taking the foil down by a button

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.729
It's just in case the static charge from the PVC is also jumping onto the foil as I pass it next to the nail

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.129
I'm gonna try and move it away from the nail a little bit

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800
Okay, let's try charging this up again

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.370
There's five charges and this time when I grab the foil it's not doing anything to me

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.560
Let's see what happens when I touch the nail oh

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.610
That was definitely a bigger shock all right

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.700
I
think what's been happening is the foil itself has been building up something of a charge and since I'm standing on the ground when I

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.039
Touch the foil that charge runs through me

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.069
But when I hold the foil every time as I charge it it keeps the same charge as me which is a greater difference?

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.289
From the charge inside the water that makes it so when I touch the nail it give us a bigger shock

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.950
Last time I charged it five times this time. I'm charging it ten

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.030
All right

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.429
Here goes nothing let's see what it does to me

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.389
Girl oh

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:37.879
Boy, okay

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.349
So last time I felt in my arm that time I felt it in my whole body like it went

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.109
Like I felt it in my other arm and down through my legs and just still there's big ole jump alright

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:54.319
That's pretty fun. It doesn't actually hurt. It's just like a pulse that goes through you alright well

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.169
That's working pretty well something else. I want to try though

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:02.299
I'm gonna turn down the lights and see if we can actually watch the electric spark jump oh

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.129
I

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.709
Saw it I hope it was on camera. That was another good Joel tiny little spark

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.699
It didn't have a big gap to jump over, but it was there something

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.769
I'm going to try to see if we can make it a little visible

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.099
I'm going to hold another piece of metal before I touch it

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.299
Instead of touching you directly with my fingers it might jump the gap a little bit better that way

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.580
Good

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.139
Well, it didn't really jump the gap I still had to touch the foil to the nail

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:41.879
I think but I still did see a spark and when I touch it with my finger it looked like a yellow spark touching with

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.719
The foil looked like a blue spark no idea what the difference is there we go

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.570
We've charged up our Leyden jar using some PVC and paper towel

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:54.239
But I want to try and take it to the next level in a previous video we shattered a plasma globe while it was running

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:00.299
Now we're going to try using this plasma globe to see if we can charge up the Leyden jar with it when this is turned

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.770
On if a piece of metal gets near the bulb you can still see that purple spark showing up

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.770
I'm gonna try touching it with my glove oh

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.690
It's like doing pretty much nothing well. It's still getting the spark though, ooh

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.359
It's starting to heat up just took my finger, let's see if it

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.710
It doesn't really give you a shock it gets warm

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.149
But it doesn't like just this is a lot more of a feeling of electricity well

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.970
Let's see what happens if we touch this to our Leyden jar

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.839
well, it's sparking kind of like when I touch my finger to it I

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.010
Don't know if that's building up the charge or not

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.539
Let's just let it go for a second and see what happens. Oh, it smells like ozone

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:50.440
Wow, that's kind of powerful. Well that seems like plenty of charging to me see if it did anything

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.280
No shock from touching the foil

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.669
Nothing nothing whatsoever I

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.169
Thought it would do something. Oh well well whatever electricity is coming out of that

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.210
It doesn't seem to charge our Leyden jar

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.820
So I think the best way to do it is just stick with the PVC

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.499
I was kind of hoping you would be like a quick-acting charge. Just this is full oh

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.590
well

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.500
Whoa my favorite thing to do is you get this bottle charge it up pretty well about 10 passes

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.650
Then you get a group of people have one person hold the bottle on the aluminum foil and have everyone hold hands in a circle

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.199
Then you have the last person in the circle touch the nail and everyone in the circle will feel the jolt run through them

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.830
It's pretty entertaining

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.580
There you have it now. You know how to build yourself a Leyden jar

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:46.150
Which is an early type of capacitor a capacitor is similar to a battery except that instead of discharging its electricity slowly?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.900
It dumps all of it at once

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.679
This Leyden jar capacitor is made just by using a plastic bottle some aluminum foil held on with tape and a nail

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:59.259
It's then filled with water with a little bit of salt added for conductivity and charged up using the static electricity

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.869
generated with PVC and a paper towel

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.540
This is something you can easily build an afternoon and have fun experimenting with or you can just use it to prank people and tell

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.719
Them to touch it and see if you can get them to do that without knowing what's gonna happen

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.190
They'll be in for a surprise

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.599
We tried charging up our Leyden jar using our broken plasma globe because it does discharge

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:22.330
Electricity in some form but apparently it's not anything that will charge this out if you know of a good experiment that you can do

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.599
With a Leyden jar let us know down in the comments, and we might try it out

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.349
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.770
This might be a very dumb experiment

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.470
I've charged it a little bit just in three passes, and you see what happens if I lick the mail

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.460
It's a tiny little

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.610
Zap on the surface of my tongue didn't do much. I don't really want to do much more than that it sounds painful

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.330
Hey guys. I hope you're having a great day. You are awesome

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.110
You are appreciated, and I know everyone over here on my team is really grateful for you

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.769
Thanks so much for choosing to watch and support our videos. We'll see you in the next one
