00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.890
We are used to thinking of many of the psychological
problems of adulthood as stemming from a lack

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.410
of adequate love in our early years. We grow
mentally unwell – prey to underconfidence,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.020
anxiety, paranoia and shame – because, somewhere
in the past, we were denied the necessary

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.760
warmth, care and sympathy. But there is another,
more curious, and more subtle problem that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.530
may arise from childhood years: what we can
term the Golden Child syndrome. We may wind

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.590
up mentally unwell not so much because we
were ignored or maltreated but because we

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.910
were loved with a distinctive and troubling
over-intensity, because we were praised for

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.730
capacities that we did not possess and could
not identify with and because we were asked

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.629
– with apparent kindness but underlying
unwitting manipulation – to shoulder the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.230
hopes and longings of our carers rather than
our own deep selves. There are childhoods

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.900
where, upon arrival, the infant is quickly
described by one or more of its parents as

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.080
profoundly exceptional. It is grandly declared
uncommonly beautiful, intelligent, talented

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.460
and resolutely set for a special destiny.
Not for this child the ordinary sorrows and

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.480
stumblings of an average life. While perhaps
still no taller than a chair, the offspring

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.290
is firmly described as a figure whose name
will reverberate down the centuries. On the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.420
surface, this could seem to offer a route
to enormous self-confidence and security.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.750
But to place such expectations on someone
who still struggles with their coat buttons

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.290
can, paradoxically, leave a child feeling
hollow and particularly incapable. Unable

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.390
to sense any resources within itself to honour
the hopes of those it loves and depends on,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.670
the child grows up with a latent sense of
fraudulence – and a consistent fear that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.700
it will be unmasked. It winds up at once grandly
expecting that others will recognise its sensational

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.940
destiny – and entirely unsure as to why
or how they might in fact do so. The Golden

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.580
Child cannot shake off a sense that it is
very special – and yet can’t identify

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.640
within itself any real grounds why it should
be so. Its underlying longing is not to revolutionise

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.670
nations and be honoured across the ages; it
is to be accepted and loved for who it is,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.110
in all its often unimpressive and faltering
realities. Image result for john singer sargent

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.490
It wishes, as we all do, to be seen and accepted
for itself; to have its faults and frailties

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.910
forgiven and acknowledged, rather than denied
or glossed over. It is in the end as much

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.740
of an insult to one’s authentic reality
– and as psychologically painful – to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.490
be praised for great things one hasn’t done
and could never do, as to be attacked and

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.580
blamed for sins one is innocent of. The phenomenon
suggests that true love should involve an

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.010
agnosticism around a child’s eventual level
of worldly success. It should ideally not

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
matter to the parent where a child ends up
– or rather, it should matter only in so

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.760
far as, and no further than, it matters to
the child. Parents who see their child in

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.680
golden terms are not – of course – consciously
cruel. They are merely, with tragic fervour,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.210
misdirecting energies that have failed to
find a better destination, the child covertly

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.880
being asked to redeem a career that did not
go as expected, a depressed mood that did

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.890
not lift or a marriage that proved unusually
intolerable. The Golden Child is, over time,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.500
destined for a moment of breakdown when the
hopes invested in it fail to be realised.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.440
The Golden Future will, it starts to be clear,
never materialise, but a bigger prize awaits:

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.380
a feeling of liberation from expectations
that were always disconnected from reality.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.030
The Golden Child is freed to enjoy a momentous
truth: that a life does not need to be golden

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.310
in order to be valuable; that we can live
in baser metal forms, in pewter or iron, and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.050
still be worthy of love and adequate self-esteem.
And, even though this has nothing to do with

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.660
the original expectations one was asked to
shoulder, that realisation will be the truly

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.120
exceptional achievement.
