00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:07.400
In the circle below,
central angle GOH

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.540
has a measure of 3/2 radians.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.000
What is the length of arc GH?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.719
So let's define
some variables that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.760
will help us manipulate
them a little bit easier.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.520
So where is central angle GOH?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120
It's this angle right over here.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.580
Let's call that theta.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:36.750
So let's say that theta is equal
to the measure of angle GOH.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.880
Now they're asking us,
what's the length of arc GH?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.110
Well, arc GH is this
right over here.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.950
And let's call that s.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.520
So let's let s be equal
to the length of arc GH.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.490
And they also give
us the radius is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.340
6 centimeters for this circle.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.930
But let's just call
that r for now.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.280
So the radius is equal
to 6 centimeters.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.112
So the first thing
that we should

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:07.570
think about when we're dealing
with arc lengths and radians

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.880
is how do angles measured in
radians relate to arc length?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.960
In particular, how does an
angle measured in radians

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.800
relate to the length of the
arc that subtends that angle?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.670
And in this case, the length
of this arc right over here,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.470
arc GH, subtends angle theta,
subtends central angle GOH.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.010
So what's the relationship?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.120
Well, the definition
of radian measure

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.060
says that an angle
measured in radians

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.450
is the ratio between
the length of arc

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.210
that subtends that angle, so s,
and the radius of the circle.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.830
If this was a unit circle,
then it would just literally

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.420
be equal to that arc length.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.530
If it's not a unit circle--
or, I guess, in all cases,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.750
unit circle or
not-- it's the ratio

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.400
between the length
of the arc that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.130
subtends the angle
and the radius.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.380
Now given this definition,
really, of what a radian is,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.710
let's see what we know
and what we don't know.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.800
And we can manipulate
this however we see fit.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.570
You could see this written as if
you multiply both sides of this

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.020
by r, you get r
theta is equal to s.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.760
Or another way of
writing it is you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.170
could get s is equal to r theta.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040
And we could have solved this
equation or this equation.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.817
But for this problem,
this one's actually

00:02:44.817 --> 00:02:46.650
going to be a little
bit useful because this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.540
is the unknown,
the length of GH.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.840
We want to know what this is.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.130
This is the unknown
that they're asking for.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.010
And this explicitly
solves for the unknown.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.030
So this has essentially
solved it for us.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.420
So what else do we know?

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.700
Well, we know the radius.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.870
We know the radius
is 6 centimeters.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.860
We multiply that times
the angle in radians,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.260
which is 3/2 radians.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.470
And we are left with, so s
is equal to 6 centimeters

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.390
times 3/2.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.720
And so we are left with, this
is going to be equal to 6 times

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.910
3 is 18 divided by 2 is 9.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.060
It's going to be equal
to 9 centimeters.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.455
And we are done.
