[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.240
NELSON BOYCE: I want
to welcome all of you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.330
all to Google and to
the YouTube space.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.950
I can't imagine
that anybody doesn't

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.720
know who these people are.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.688
We've got Chris Webber,
Lisa Leslie, Nate Robinson.

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:29.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.590
Four-time Olympian, five-time
All-Star, three-time Slam Dunk

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.130
champion.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.729
The list of
accomplishments goes on--

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.520
LISA LESLIE: Three?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.040
NELSON BOYCE: --and on.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.280
LISA LESLIE: Nice going.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.330
NELSON BOYCE:
Nate's the only one

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.690
to have ever actually done that.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.378
CHRIS WEBBER: And
stand up, Nate.

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:43.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.390
This is the guy that won the
3-point league dunk contest.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.931
No, stand up.

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:50.200
And this is the guy that--
that's a bad man right there.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:52.795
LISA LESLIE: Three times--

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:54.590
NELSON BOYCE: We're going to
talk about a number of things

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.089
today.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.060
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.300
I'm Nelson Boyce, by the way.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400
I work here at Google.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.410
And I'm thrilled
to have the best

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.960
seat in the house with these
lovely folks up here today.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710
So everybody knows, I
think, that "Uncle Drew,"

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.210
in theaters
nationwide on Friday,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.787
of which all of these
folks are stars.

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:12.870
It's going to be exciting.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.120
I saw the movie last night.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.280
It was incredible
and very, very funny.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530
And all of you did your thing.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.480
I will tell you that, for sure.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.890
Just to give you
all a little bit

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.950
of the premise of
the movie, there's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.720
a gentleman who, under
unfortunate circumstances,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.302
is unable to field his
team at the Rucker.

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:31.760
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.790
Rucker is a playground
tournament up in Harlem

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.790
that happens every year.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.870
It's incredible.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.069
A number of historic players
have come out of that.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.610
But there's one
player in particular,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.820
played by Kyrie Irving,
who has the opportunity

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.400
to go ahead and field a team
from the past, if you will,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.190
to come back and play the
Rucker once again in hopes

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.090
of winning the championship.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420
And that's when all these
folks come into play.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.790
It's based on the character
Uncle Drew some of you

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.640
may know based on a
Pepsi-created digital episodic

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.010
that was very popular
and ultimately became

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.699
a movie with our
friends at Lionsgate.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.580
So to that end, this
question is for everyone.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.020
How did this come together?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.390
How did it go from an
episodic to a movie?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.620
And did your agents
reach out to you,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.064
or did you guys
actually audition?

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:22.730
How did it work?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.880
NATE ROBINSON: Well, Lisa
definitely auditioned.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.546
I'm going to let her
tell you the story.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:26.630
It's awesome.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.090
Her story is pretty
cool than mine.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540
But I just bugged Kyrie
until he told me yes.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900
Every game that we had,
I played against him,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.730
he's at the free throw
line, and I'm like,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.771
"'Uncle Drew,' what's up?

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:39.934
Can I be down?"

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:41.350
I was just bugging
him every time.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.070
We checking in the game--

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.100
"Bro, I'm serious.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.530
What's up?"

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.480
Then he hit me on
Twitter, was like,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.610
"Were you serious about
being in the commercial?"

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.460
And I was like, yeah, of course.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.460
And that's how I'm here.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.043
NELSON BOYCE: The
origin [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:55.786
Nice.

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:56.660
Lisa, what about you?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.390
LISA LESLIE: For me, my
agent called and said

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.260
that they were shooting
for "Uncle Drew,"

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.450
and there was a part
for Betty Lou, who

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.540
plays the wife of Preacher-- and
Chris Webber plays Preacher--

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.480
and he hadn't had the
part at that time.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.060
But I was going to be the wife.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.140
And Betty Lou, obviously, has
to get buckets at some point.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.600
NELSON BOYCE: That's right.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.050
That's right.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.550
LISA LESLIE: So I wasn't
concerned about that.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.633
But I'm like, OK, so tell
me more about Betty Lou.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:23.390
Betty Lou has to be in her 70s.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.820
And I'm like, OK, got it.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.040
So I get off the phone with my
agent, and I go in my closet,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.570
and I go shopping a little bit.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.720
And I came out, and
I was like, babe--

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.550
I was telling my
husband, who I call babe.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.383
I said, babe, in order
for me get this part,

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.810
I'm going to have to go
in dressed as Betty Lou.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.340
They have to believe
I can do this.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.227
So I went in, full--

00:03:42.227 --> 00:03:43.310
NELSON BOYCE: Oh, full on.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.490
NATE ROBINSON: Yes.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.760
Dressed the part.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.170
LISA LESLIE: I was Betty
Lou when I walked into--

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.586
when I got off the elevator,
I was bent over and hunching.

00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:49.340
"Hey, baby, how you all doing?"

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.450
I came in talking to everybody,
"Oh, yeah, Betty Lou is here,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.684
and can you just let the
producer know I showed up,

00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:56.350
'cause they said they
needed me to come.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.362
Fool, please!

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.070
You better move."

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:00.110
NICK ROBINSON: Perfect.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.693
LISA LESLIE: So I
just walked in being

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:05.950
Betty Lou, full everything,
with my Bible toting.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.241
NATE ROBINSON: Job on the spot.

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:07.670
Job on the spot.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.170
LISA LESLIE: An
hour later, my agent

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.720
called and said I got the part.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.320
NELSON BOYCE: She is a fiery
character in the movie,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.000
I will tell you that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.115
And what about you, Chris?

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:16.073
CHRIS WEBBER: And she
didn't tell you about her

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:17.594
thigh-stockings that she--

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:19.040
and the old lady pearls.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.040
LISA LESLIE: The nylons,
they got to stop short.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.844
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah,
yeah, exactly.

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:25.190
LISA LESLIE: Put
a run on the side.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.420
CHRIS WEBBER: Exactly.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.420
I got a call, and I think that
the part was already cast.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.510
And I knew that they
were part of it.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.010
And of course I'm
a big fan of Nate.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.450
And I know Nate and
Lisa is probably,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.190
out of all the
athletes, has probably

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.290
been acting the
longest, and modeling,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.290
all the stuff she did.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.644
And so I've been in the
church my whole life--

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:44.810
NELSON BOYCE: And I was
going to ask you about that.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.980
Because you did it.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.039
You got down with it.

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.080
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.850
My father was a
deacon in the church.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.020
My mom was a choir director.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.910
So I'm one of those kids would
get whoopings in the church

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.412
and come back and have to sit
up there and all that stuff.

00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:58.280
And so it wasn't a
better role for me

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.040
than to be a basketball player--
which, I played basketball.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.550
And then to emulate some of
the passes I knew growing up.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.100
So I tried to take them,
along with some great movies,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.910
like all the other
guys that have done it.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.794
And hopefully it's-- when
you said a good movie,

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:14.210
I'm thinking that the audience,
they're like, yeah, right.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.740
Because that's, I think--

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.810
we all knew it had the potential
to be super corny, super

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.374
bad, terrible.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:22.540
LISA LESLIE: That was the
scariest part, by the way.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.230
Did you want to know
the answer to that?

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.220
I was like, what did
I get myself into?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.466
I try to keep my
brand real on-point.

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:31.450
And this could be
a true downfall.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.946
CHRIS WEBBER: This
could take you down.

00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:32.446
Yeah.

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:35.090
Yeah, but they got it
turned out all right.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.080
The script was funny.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.450
And when I read the script,
I was laughing out loud.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.800
And I was like, you know what?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.940
This Is going to be funny.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.440
So you've seen the
movie the other night,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.270
it was good that
it came through.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.150
NELSON BOYCE: Oh, for sure.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.680
I had the benefit of
being at the premiere.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.310
And you brought a little
extra something to it.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.130
I will tell you that.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.190
I'm not going to give
it away, but there

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.960
is a scene in the church
that you all will remember.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.290
NATE ROBINSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.490
Forever.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.795
NELSON BOYCE: It's pretty good.

00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:52.320
LISA LESLIE: Amen.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:53.496
NELSON BOYCE: Amen.

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:55.150
Amen to that.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.010
So a little bit more
about the movie.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.620
I think the
underlying foundation

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.390
about what's there is the
pure love for basketball.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.430
Can you share with the
audience and the folks

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.270
here today the moment that you
fell in love with the game?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.740
LISA LESLIE: Well, I didn't
fall in love with the game

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.310
initially.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.110
I was not a sporty girl.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.190
I was really more into, like,
I don't want to get hurt.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.804
I have amazing girl
cousins who were tough.

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.470
They were running,
they're kicking butt,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.000
they're playing
football with the boys.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.990
I was on the side like,
do you guys need water?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.474
I was just not
really into sports.

00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:34.890
NELSON BOYCE: I
can't belive that.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.220
LISA LESLIE: Really.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.480
No, this is a true story.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.630
I was the cry baby
of the family.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.290
I wasn't really tough.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.080
But basketball, for
me, really found me.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.390
I think it was more my destiny.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.410
Because I started playing
in the seventh grade.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.060
And I only played
basketball because there

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.768
was a girl who was in
the ninth grade who

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:52.184
was so popular, I'm like,
why does everybody know her?

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:54.600
And her name was Shay, and she
was on the basketball team.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.377
And I thought, I
want to be popular.

00:06:57.377 --> 00:06:58.710
So I'm going to play basketball.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.650
But I had one rule-- if
I fall down, I'm done.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.170
Thank god I did not fall down.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.160
Our team went 7 and 0.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.220
I won my first trophy,
smaller than this cup, no lie.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.670
And that trophy, I was
like, you get a trophy?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.040
I fell in love with basketball
once I got the trophy.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.310
NELSON BOYCE: You've had
a few more since then.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.540
LISA LESLIE: Yeah,
it was a trophy.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.343
CHRIS WEBBER: A few
gold medals, too.

00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:17.640
LISA LESLIE: Yeah.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.350
The fact that you win
something, that was it.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.910
And I really fell
in love with it.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.490
And I put in so much work.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.650
And I realized that it
would open up doors.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.210
I could get a
scholarship to college.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.190
My mom was not going to be able
to afford a Division I school.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.012
And so then it started to
make sense, having good grades

00:07:35.012 --> 00:07:35.970
and playing basketball.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.070
I was really into
education, very nerdy.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.930
I know.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.870
Didn't look like it.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.989
No, I'm just kidding.

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:42.030
I was really into school.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.890
I really loved school.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.754
But basketball just
opened so many doors

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:46.920
that I had to stick with it.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.652
NELSON BOYCE: Beautiful.

00:07:47.652 --> 00:07:48.152
Beautiful.

00:07:48.152 --> 00:07:50.210
And that is your
championship ring, is it not?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.710
What's that?

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.918
LISA LESLIE: This one is not.

00:07:51.918 --> 00:07:53.130
NATE ROBINSON: Probably MVP.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.581
LISA LESLIE: This one is my Top
20 WNBA Players of All Time.

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.456
NELSON BOYCE: Mm-hmm.

00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:58.428
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:01.066
NATE ROBINSON: Bam.

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:02.316
LISA LESLIE: Isn't she lovely?

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.286
NELSON BOYCE: And a Hall
of Famer, by the way.

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:05.130
And a Hall of Famer,
on top of all that.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.880
LISA LESLIE: They sent
me one that's cute.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.342
The other ones are too bulky.

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:10.800
NELSON BOYCE: Nate,
what about you?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.520
When did you fall in love?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.300
Do you remember the moment?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.966
NATE ROBINSON: For
me, I was brainwashed

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:16.530
at a young age, man,
watching Michael Jordan.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.560
As a kid, that's all you saw
on TV, for the most part,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.420
was watching guys like that.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.860
That helped me
believe that there

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.740
is a way for me, a
little guy from Seattle,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.150
to make it to the league.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.730
And I'm a different animal.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.780
I was just hungry.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.990
As a young kid, 10
years old, I just

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.400
knew what I wanted
to do since that day.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.128
And after that, I just
never looked back.

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:42.669
NELSON BOYCE: Yeah,
you still hungry.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:43.039
You still hungry.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:43.659
NATE ROBINSON:
Yeah, still hungry.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.490
NELSON BOYCE: I told you, we
could use you on the Knicks.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.557
I'm a diehard fan,
so we could use--

00:08:46.557 --> 00:08:47.640
and what about you, Chris?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.090
CHRIS WEBBER: He was killing
when he was on the Knicks, too.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.425
NELSON BOYCE: Yes, sir.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.310
CHRIS WEBBER: He
was doing his thing.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.226
Well, first of all, Nate
is being real humble,

00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:54.391
too, because he could
have gone pro in football.

00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:55.890
That's why I wanted
him to stand up.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.367
Because I think basketball shows
you it's not about your size,

00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:00.450
but it's about your heart.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.840
You look at AI, small athlete,
one of the nicest killers

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.250
I've ever known in the game.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.470
And this guy's one of the
best athletes the league

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.520
has ever seen.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.371
He's won three dunk
contests, a great DB,

00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:13.870
and could have gone
into the league.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.720
So he definitely was
a different animal.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.494
For me, I wanted
to play football.

00:09:18.494 --> 00:09:20.410
That's what I wanted to
be, a football player.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.910
And I fell in love playing
sports in the street.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.520
We had a neighborhood
that had a bunch of kids.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.670
So in the summertime, it was on.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.930
Two square running
bases, playing games.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.555
And so I just fell
in love with sports.

00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:36.420
I just fell in love with
friends and competition,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.280
that camaraderie.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.520
And I've been this
height since ninth grade,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.354
so my body told me,
you better do this.

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:44.020
Don't go over there
in football, they're

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.015
going to break your legs.

00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:45.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:45.515 --> 00:09:47.839
So it came natural.

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.380
But I always wanted
to be an athlete.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.170
NELSON BOYCE: That's awesome.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.230
And didn't you try out
for Seattle, the Seahawks?

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.313
NATE ROBINSON: I tried out
for the Seahawks, yeah.

00:09:54.313 --> 00:09:55.710
They gave me a little--

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.000
I wouldn't call it a full--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.483
NELSON BOYCE: Semi-combine?

00:09:57.483 --> 00:09:59.280
NATE ROBINSON: It was a semi--
yeah, it was pretty cool.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.760
I got to work out in front
of Pete Carroll, the owners.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.536
And Russell Wilson was there.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.410
That was pretty cool.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.493
He gave me a football,
signed the football for me.

00:10:06.493 --> 00:10:08.430
So yeah.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.240
I'm more of a fan
a lot of the time.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.530
I get geeked out seeing
different athletes.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.164
It's pretty cool.

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:16.400
NELSON BOYCE: Good stuff.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.840
Speaking of players, as the
movie came together, were there

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.530
any other NBA or WNBA
players that tried to join

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.589
the cast that didn't
work out, or would you

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:31.130
have liked to have
seen in the movie?

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:35.170
LISA LESLIE: You mean
as in take our spots?

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.878
NELSON BOYCE: No.

00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:36.417
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:37.458
Not in taking your spots.

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.060
LISA LESLIE: Nah, I'm good.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.230
No, there weren't
any other players.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.940
We played against other players.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.530
But there weren't, other than--

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.965
I think Gordon was the only
other NBA player, right?

00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:48.756
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah.

00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:48.940
That was it.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.430
NATE ROBINSON: That was it.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.496
LISA LESLIE: Yeah, that was it.

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:52.370
NELSON BOYCE: And assuming
there's a sequel--

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.350
and I hope there would
be one-- who would

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.620
you want to see join
you all in the movie?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.450
CHRIS WEBBER: Well, Kevin Durant
was at the premiere last night.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.610
NELSON BOYCE: I did see
him last night, yeah.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.870
CHRIS WEBBER: And I told
him after the movie--

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.416
because before, I was like,
I know what you're thinking.

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.040
I was like, it's not
going to be corny.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.600
Trust me.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.810
He was like, all right then.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.880
After, he was like,
"Oh, man, I love it.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.570
I'm in part 2."

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.690
I was like, all right,
don't tell anybody.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.610
I'll be your agent.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.276
I'll negotiate--

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:13.831
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.280
--that for you.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.610
But it would be fun
to have Kevin Durant.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.430
To dress up-- we're all 70
years old plus in this movie.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.220
So to dress up and
have some older guys,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.100
it'll be fun, definitely.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.630
But I think our crew,
the fact that we

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.420
were all athletes, the fact that
we're used to being vulnerable,

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.270
we're used to working hard,
we're used to asking for help--

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.110
that really made it a
collaborative effort,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.068
the fact we didn't want
to let each other down.

00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:41.910
I didn't want to
let Betty Lou down.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.285
Boots didn't want
to let us down.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:45.460
And so it was really unique.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.080
They say when you retire, you
miss the locker room and not

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.580
the games.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.720
And I think that's true.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.000
And I got the locker
room with these guys.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.060
And I feel sorry for our
director, Charles Stone,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.730
because I'm sure it was
like a professor teaching

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.720
a kindergarten class.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.220
Because we were having
fun every second.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.800
NATE ROBINSON: For
the whole year.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.320
CHRIS WEBBER: Every second.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.125
"All right, let's hurry
up, take the take."

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.416
And after that, he would
pull out a backpack

00:12:07.416 --> 00:12:09.290
with music and all the
extras and be dancing.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.416
NATE ROBINSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:10.860
CHRIS WEBBER: He was
like, "Oh, no, slow down.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.420
Stop."

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.979
But we had fun, definitely,
on set the whole time.

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:15.270
NELSON BOYCE: That's wonderful.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.160
So you mentioned two things I
want to talk about a little bit

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.030
more.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.422
So the makeup.

00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:20.380
NATE ROBINSON: Oh, man.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.171
NELSON BOYCE: Talk a
little bit about that.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:26.345
It was full-on transformation
for all of you.

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.470
NATE ROBINSON: For the
first time, I called my mom.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.386
I'm like, mom, I'm sorry
for making fun of you

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:31.880
for putting on makeup for hours.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.440
It sucked.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.840
Literally, it's sitting
there hours doing the makeup.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.740
I'm like, man, so this is
what takes women so long.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.230
Tell my girl, I feel you.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.770
So it was tough.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.161
It was difficult. Four
hours for my makeup,

00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:48.660
because they had the cover all
the tattoos and stuff for me.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.294
But it was still fun.

00:12:50.294 --> 00:12:52.210
Once I got the four hours
out of the way and--

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:52.600
NELSON BOYCE: Four hours.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.433
NATE ROBINSON: --I'm
in character, I'm like,

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.270
yeah, when do we start?

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.552
Yeah, so it was long for me.

00:12:57.552 --> 00:12:59.010
NELSON BOYCE: Same
experience for--

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.551
LISA LESLIE: I think,
for Betty Lou--

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.177
yeah.

00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:03.260
Women, we're a little bit
more accustomed to being

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:03.980
in the chair.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.135
Not quite two and a
half to three hours.

00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:08.750
So to get ready to
be Betty Lou and have

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.430
the prosthetics put on--

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.810
I try to think of it
as being in the spa.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.450
NELSON BOYCE: You're
trying to relax through it?

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.442
LISA LESLIE: And
calm down and relax.

00:13:15.442 --> 00:13:16.366
NATE ROBINSON:
That's a long spa.

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:17.470
NELSON BOYCE: That's a long spa.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.830
LISA LESLIE: And then
I would put my headsets

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.110
on, the wireless ones, and
take it behind my neck.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.720
And then I watched "Insecure"
and "Game of Thrones."

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.070
So this was last August.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.460
So I had to finish
up the season, right?

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.450
So I just watched that every
day until I had to have my eyes

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:30.950
shut.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.650
And then I was good.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.119
I think the hardest part
is probably taking it off.

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:38.160
NELSON BOYCE: Oh, really?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.480
NATE ROBINSON: Well,
yeah, the wigs--

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.610
LISA LESLIE: Yeah, well,
because we had to wear wigs.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.485
NATE ROBINSON: I did.

00:13:41.485 --> 00:13:42.980
LISA LESLIE: We
all had wigs, also.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.570
I'm like, listen,
edges are really

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.790
important in this lifestyle.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.386
So I'm like, listen-- because
they want to put glue.

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:49.760
I'm like, OK, listen.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.540
This is a movie.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.950
But I need you to just pin
this down and pin this down,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.220
and Betty Lou will be fine.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.170
But the take off is
a little strenuous

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.374
because they have to
basically exfoliate your face.

00:13:59.374 --> 00:14:00.290
NELSON BOYCE: Oh, wow.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.956
LISA LESLIE: Yeah,
and that's scrubbing.

00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:03.830
And I'm like, listen,
we need to look good.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.560
Chris had some little
bit of reactions.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:05.940
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.100
LISA LESLIE: Actually, I
think you had the biggest

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.780
struggle of everybody.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.300
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah,
it felt like I

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.967
was getting burned with
acid during the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:13.300
LISA LESLIE: His face was like--

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.020
CHRIS WEBBER: I'm trying to
act, I'm like, I'm burning,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.853
and it really hurts.

00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:17.150
And my neck is coming off.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.195
But it was three hours.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:20.690
And we weren't used
to the makeup chair.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.380
LISA LESLIE: I had to switch
him to my face cream, actually.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.740
NELSON BOYCE: And this
was an everyday process?

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.666
CHRIS WEBBER: And took some
beauty lessons from her.

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:26.130
LISA LESLIE: Yes.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.990
NATE ROBINSON: Every single day.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.490
CHRIS WEBBER: Every day, yeah.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:27.706
LISA LESLIE: Yes.

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:28.920
I'm like, you guys
have to moisturize.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.440
Boys, you need to moisturize.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.455
CHRIS WEBBER: I didn't even
know what moisturizing--

00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:31.775
LISA LESLIE: They didn't know.

00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:33.275
They were like,
what does that mean?

00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:36.006
We're like, when you leave here,
you need to put more cream on.

00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:38.256
And I'd come back fresh
faced, because you've got to--

00:14:38.256 --> 00:14:38.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:40.210
NELSON BOYCE: Right, right.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.680
LISA LESLIE: And they're like,
you don't have any irritation?

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.860
I'm like, no, guys.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.910
You have to moisturize.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.150
It's so important for your life.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.590
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah,
yeah, for sure.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.090
LISA LESLIE: Rodan
and Fields, guys.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.103
Look me up on Instagram.

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:50.140
NELSON BOYCE: She's got her
green juice working here, too.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.160
CHRIS WEBBER: Our makeup
coach, that's right.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.550
NELSON BOYCE: So
that's her product.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.810
CHRIS WEBBER: Our
healthy makeup coach.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.080
NELSON BOYCE: Indeed.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.490
LISA LESLIE: We had a
green juice every morning.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.040
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah, we did.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.600
We did.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.060
LISA LESLIE: Spinach,
kale, blueberries.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.460
NATE ROBINSON: For skin.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.610
CHRIS WEBBER: Lisa kept
us-- you know what?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.101
Thanks for keeping us right.

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.267
LISA LESLIE: I got you guys.

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:02.870
I'm the mom.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.370
NELSON BOYCE: And
you also mentioned

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.880
the fun that you all had
on set, and the dancing.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.750
I'm not going to give
the whole thing away,

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.180
but there is a dance
battle in this movie.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.620
And I just wanted to
get the real scoop.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.050
So who's got the most skills?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.050
CHRIS WEBBER: Nate and--

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.850
LISA LESLIE: Nate, by far.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.284
CHRIS WEBBER: Nate--

00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:19.718
LISA LESLIE: Nate.

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:20.152
And Kyrie.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.020
CHRIS WEBBER: Nate and Kyrie.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.500
NATE ROBINSON: See,
with me, I just

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.850
couldn't wait to start the day.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.290
Like, man, can we hurry this up?

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.480
Like, this is my
thing, right here.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.441
The music, the fun.

00:15:28.441 --> 00:15:28.940
It was fun.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.606
Who surprised me most
was Reggie Miller,

00:15:30.606 --> 00:15:32.300
because he couldn't
dance a lick,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.910
and he got out there, really
showed that he could do it.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.480
LISA LESLIE: No,
Nate taught Reggie--

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.940
NATE ROBINSON: It was awesome.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.860
LISA LESLIE: --how to dance.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.780
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah, you
taught him how to dance.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.860
NATE ROBINSON: We were
literally practicing

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.650
throughout our lunch
times, because we

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.240
didn't have that much time.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.900
NELSON BOYCE: Because he's
got to start the routine.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.160
NATE ROBINSON: But
the funny thing

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.260
is, during lunch, we're
literally in our makeup.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.916
We can't take our makeup off.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:48.540
So we're literally
having conversations

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.623
like this with old people.

00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:51.200
So it was funny.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.227
I was telling C, I was
like, bro, this is funny.

00:15:53.227 --> 00:15:54.810
You're guys are
telling an NBA story--

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.726
"Man, I remember when I
used to dunk on Shaq."

00:15:56.726 --> 00:15:59.210
And I'm looking at him like,
he look like a real preacher.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.938
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:02.982
A preacher out here, looking--

00:16:02.982 --> 00:16:04.940
it was pretty cool, just
the whole dance scene,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.587
and getting Reggie
ready to dance.

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:08.420
LISA LESLIE: Reggie
started with zero moves.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.700
NATE ROBINSON: Because he
was nervous the whole time.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:09.900
LISA LESLIE: Zero moves.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.600
NATE ROBINSON: Like, bro,
just enjoy yourself, bro.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.050
I said, you're in a mask.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.330
LISA LESLIE: I'm like,
have you ever danced?

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:13.600
NATE ROBINSON: You're good.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.755
Nobody even knows.

00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:15.722
Just do your thing.

00:16:15.722 --> 00:16:16.680
But he did a great job.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.460
NELSON BOYCE: So you put
him through a clinic.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:17.680
NATE ROBINSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.730
LISA LESLIE: Yes, daily.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.440
NATE ROBINSON: I had
to get him right.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.490
LISA LESLIE: I've got
to post those videos.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:20.893
NATE ROBINSON: I had
to get him right.

00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:21.161
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah.

00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:23.100
Reggie's ready to go to
weddings and stuff now.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.660
Because before--

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.582
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:26.261
--he was socially
dancing awkward.

00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.552
Like, you don't want-- he'd
probably hit you with the--

00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:28.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:29.878
You know what I mean?

00:16:29.878 --> 00:16:31.204
NELSON BOYCE: With
the sprinkler.

00:16:31.204 --> 00:16:31.960
CHRIS WEBBER: Oh, he's terrible.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.270
LISA LESLIE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.890
CHRIS WEBBER: But now,
his back straightens.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.670
NATE ROBINSON: Dancing
the whole time.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.620
CHRIS WEBBER: Like,
want to dance?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.495
Anybody at the party?

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:37.427
What?

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:38.010
Happy for Reg.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.010
NELSON BOYCE: I love it.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.270
LISA LESLIE: Nate's
dance class, 101.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.010
NELSON BOYCE: Too funny.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.300
In terms of anxiety--

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.740
and all of you have done
some level of acting, right?

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.484
First pro game or
first day on the set--

00:16:51.484 --> 00:16:52.900
which one was more
nerve-wracking?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.274
CHRIS WEBBER: Oh,
first pro game.

00:16:54.274 --> 00:16:56.137
NATE ROBINSON:
Yeah, first for me.

00:16:56.137 --> 00:16:57.970
LISA LESLIE: Yeah, first
pro game, for sure.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.500
CHRIS WEBBER: At least
you get a second take,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.340
and you can mess up.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.165
But you're checking Hakeem
Olajuwon your first game,

00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.050
you're going to get
embarrassed, period.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.258
That's what it's going to be.

00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:09.859
So yeah, I'd much rather do that
than a first game, any time.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.942
NELSON BOYCE: I hear that.

00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:11.770
I hear that.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.780
So we'll pivot away from
the movie for a second

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.599
and talk a little bit more
about career and life stuff.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.540
What was the most challenging
time in your career,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.958
and how did you overcome it?

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:26.749
NATE ROBINSON: Man.

00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:27.710
LISA LESLIE: Oh, wow.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.253
Now he's just dug deep, huh?

00:17:29.253 --> 00:17:30.275
NELSON BOYCE: I'm
going to keep going.

00:17:30.275 --> 00:17:32.233
LISA LESLIE: Most
challenging time, probably, I

00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:33.890
would say, in my
career, was when I was

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.610
at USC as a college student.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.260
And I would say it was
challenging because--

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.530
I went to USC.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.800
And it's a school that is a
private school that students

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.830
are known to be a little bit
wealthier than the average.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.470
And so I remember
there being times

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.930
where I didn't have a lot of
money, as a student athlete.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.481
And you'll have $5,
and you're like, OK,

00:17:56.481 --> 00:17:58.480
I'm going to order a
burrito and cut it in half,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.280
and eat this half at
this point, and eat

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.180
this half at the other time.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.220
There were times
where I remember that.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.680
But I also remember
thinking, this

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.790
is not the way it's
always going to be.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.219
But I really--

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:11.760
I wouldn't say I
enjoyed my struggle,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.610
but I understood, when
I was in moments when

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.640
I didn't have that, it was
up to me to figure out ways

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.840
and to find a way to make it.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.220
And it wasn't my mom's job--

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.990
once you get to college,
it's like, you've

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.560
got to figure it out.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.760
You've got to figure out
how you're going to make it,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.176
how you're going
to be successful.

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.780
And that's why I leaned so much
on my education and getting

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.155
my master's in
business, and just

00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:34.154
really wanting to make
sure that I would never

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:35.820
be in that situation
again, financially.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:35.895
NELSON BOYCE: That's right.

00:18:35.895 --> 00:18:38.452
So it makes you appreciate these
times now a lot more, right?

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:40.160
LISA LESLIE: I'm so
blessed and thankful.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.700
I love-- I just feel like we
have so many opportunities,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.770
and you have to
keep taking them in.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.440
Now, with social media and
just so much information

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.120
at our fingertips,
there's no reason

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.752
why people should not be
doing what they love to do,

00:18:52.752 --> 00:18:53.960
their job that they love to--

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.610
I just happen to have five jobs.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.020
I overdo it because of,
probably, my struggle.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.909
But that's the compensation,
I think, I make.

00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:01.700
NELSON BOYCE: Sure.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.850
Nate, Chris?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.300
Anything to contribute to that?

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.322
Most challenging time?

00:19:07.322 --> 00:19:08.780
NATE ROBINSON: I
would say mine, it

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.464
didn't come until I got to the
league, to the NBA, really.

00:19:11.464 --> 00:19:13.130
Because everything
had been hard for me,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.130
from being a little guy.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.830
But the hardest, I think,
when I got to the NBA was,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.177
they wanted me to be
somebody that I wasn't.

00:19:21.177 --> 00:19:23.010
And now, for me, that
was the hardest thing.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:28.160
Because as a kid, I just
wanted to play basketball.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.534
They were big on attitude and
the way you act, behavior.

00:19:32.534 --> 00:19:33.700
And it was just hard for me.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.330
I'm like, bro, I
just want to hoop.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.546
I'm happy to be here.

00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:38.420
Every game was like some
different superstar.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.290
Vince Carter today?

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.100
Oh, word.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.240
This is crazy.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.310
So I was just
enjoying the moment.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.620
I was enjoying the moment.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.202
So my biggest
struggle was every day

00:19:47.202 --> 00:19:49.160
it was like, all right,
Nate, you got to chill,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.580
blah, blah, blah.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.990
I'm like, you guys
are so worried

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.300
about everything
other than basketball.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.700
And I didn't understand that.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.220
So for me, that was the
hardest thing-- dealing

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.439
with being a starter,
and a player that you

00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:03.980
play all the time, your whole
life, and coming to the league,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.521
and you're just
coming off the bench.

00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:07.040
Some games you don't play.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.980
That was hard.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.620
That was really hard for me.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.420
But I enjoyed the ride.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.620
I enjoyed the ups and downs.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.240
The roller coaster was fun.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.490
It was challenging.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.870
And I had the best seat
in the house every night.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.181
So I had to switch how I thought
the process of not playing.

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:23.180
I'm like, you know what?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.710
I'm going to just embrace this.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.422
I'm going to just
embrace me not playing.

00:20:27.422 --> 00:20:29.630
And then I'm going to just
get on everybody's nerves,

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.710
asking for jerseys.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.180
"Shaq, I need your jersey."

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.950
I was going to ask
every different person

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.780
for their stuff to keep me
right where I needed to be.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.020
NELSON BOYCE: Absolutely.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.050
Chris, what about you?

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.860
CHRIS WEBBER: Man, like
you just said, it's

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.151
been a journey, roller coaster.

00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:46.790
And I think that for me,
it was my rookie year.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:51.350
Because I was having
success, but at home,

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.820
people in my neighborhood
was going through things

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.380
that I couldn't help them with.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.950
NELSON BOYCE: Back in Detroit.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.741
CHRIS WEBBER: Yeah.

00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:00.785
So it was a little bit
of survivor's remorse.

00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:04.640
And you have to take
responsibility for the choices

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.490
that you make.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.760
But some of my
friends at that time

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.900
made choices that, I'll
never see them again--

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.365
where they were killed,
or where they're in jail

00:21:14.365 --> 00:21:15.490
for the rest of their life.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.461
And so here it is.

00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:18.460
You're reaching the dream,
and you're making it,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.510
and you're loving it.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.177
And when you're young,
you're sensitive.

00:21:21.177 --> 00:21:22.718
You should be
sensitive all the time.

00:21:22.718 --> 00:21:24.840
But you're young, and
you're wondering why you

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.280
and why not them.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.410
And I just remember
the whole season,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.990
I don't think I enjoyed
it as much because I

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.815
was living at home in my mind,
wanting to bring them with me

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:37.200
and wanting them to see all
of this stuff and things

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.880
I've never seen.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.588
It's the most exciting
time in the world.

00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:41.340
And you have people
that can't see it

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.540
and don't realize-- listen,
you can do whatever you want.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.550
I just met somebody out
here that's doing great,

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.530
and they didn't even
finish second grade.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.400
They just had the hard work.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.250
And look, you can do it.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.458
More stories and inspiration.

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.780
I wanted to take that to
them and let them see it.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.631
But it was really hard, at that
time, to find that balance.

00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:00.130
You want to save the world and
all your friends at one time.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.780
And it takes a while.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.150
So for me, that was
tough-- having success,

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.580
reaching a dream, and then
the kids that I dreamed with--

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.260
we veered off at a
point of a dream.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.700
And it was like, dang, I wish
we could bring them with me.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.750
So that was tough.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.610
That was tough.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.693
NELSON BOYCE: I hear that.

00:22:16.693 --> 00:22:18.805
I can relate to that very well.

00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.555
LISA LESLIE: That was
so well said, Chris.

00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:21.090
NATE ROBINSON:
Yeah, that was dope.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.090
CHRIS WEBBER: Thank you.

LISA LESLIE: I like that.

00:22:24.892 --> 00:22:26.560
NELSON BOYCE: Man, I've
got four or five questions

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.400
I wish I could ask you.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.300
But we're going to
make sure that we

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.012
spend enough time letting some
of the folks in the audience

00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:31.970
ask you some questions.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.640
But before we go there, we're
going to do a little speed

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.729
round with you guys.

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:36.770
LISA LESLIE: Here you go.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.510
You want to play games.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.550
NELSON BOYCE: Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:38.650
I'm sorry.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.520
LISA LESLIE: You know
we're competitive, now.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.690
NELSON BOYCE: I told you.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.470
I told you.

interesting, because all of you

win in this one.

be a function of--

fair, because she always

to-- don't think about it.

CHRIS WEBBER: To
play against, for me,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:08.284
I would have to say
it was Michael Jordan.

00:26:08.284 --> 00:26:10.200
One time, we were playing
him in the playoffs.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.730
He had 54 points, maybe--
something like that.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.780
And I looked at
Juwan, my teammate.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.750
And in front of Jordan,
we would work out,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.390
we would always, like, "Oh,
he sold his soul to the devil.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.610
He's not supposed to
be making these shots."

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.170
And I was trying to get him off.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.835
And I really thought he sold--
like, he made stuff, man,

00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:28.220
that is not humanly possible.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.370
So it was great trying
to take him down,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.762

probably wasn't a chance

00:26:32.762 --> 00:26:33.970
that you were going to do it.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.500

Michael Jordan.

LISA LESLIE: Yeah.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.960
I think I would
say Lauren Jackson.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.350
I enjoyed playing against
her, because she was really

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.620
a tough player to
guard and to stop.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.750
And we had so many battles.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.130
And she's the real deal.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.280
Between her 3-point shot
and her ability to score

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.130
inside was the most
challenging to stop their pick

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.070
and roll and stop her inside.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.236
And she could block my
shot-- only on one side.

00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:01.610
I had to finally
figure that out.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.620
I'm like, how did
she get in my shot?

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.180
So I had to go left.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.020
But she was the most
challenging player,

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.040
I think, I played against.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.370
NATE ROBINSON: For me, it
would probably Iverson.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.570

little guy growing up

change the whole league.

what he brought to the game.

He made it OK for
people to be themselves.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.520
And then for me, I hit a
game-winning shot over him.

such a great answer.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.530
Well, I thought basketball
initially, when you asked.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.970
So basketball, just in
terms of highlights--

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.700
it's one thing to represent
my city and state,

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.980
to play it in Los Angeles
for the Los Angeles

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.030

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.100
But to have
represented our country

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.600
is definitely the
highlight for me--

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.058
to put on the red,
white, and blue.

00:28:38.058 --> 00:28:39.724

in the service,

going to war when you

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.930
play against other countries.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.599
And to come out on top--

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.640
just a little back story.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.440
Our USA team actually lost to--

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.710
we lost in a world
championship to Brazil.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.930
And as you know, Brazil,
like even in soccer,

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.990
they're very animated.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.540
They cheer.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.640
So they were so
animated-- and this

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.070
is the problem-- they put us
on the same bus to the game

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.760
and back.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.889
NATE ROBINSON: Oh, wow.

00:29:03.889 --> 00:29:04.680
LISA LESLIE: Right.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.430
Yeah, that part.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.790
CHRIS WEBBER: Who does that?

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.000
Who does that?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.987
LISA LESLIE: So on
the way back home--

00:29:10.987 --> 00:29:11.820
NATE ROBINSON: What?

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.690
LISA LESLIE: --Team
USA-- and it was

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.830
one of the first times I
got to the national team.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.160
So I was one of the younger
players at that time.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.990
They had made a bet
with their coach

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.440
that if they beat Team USA,
which is a really big deal,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.460
that they could shave his head.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:24.960
Yeah.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.270
So they shaved his
head on the bus,

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.400
while we rode back with them.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.950
So that level of disrespect--

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.584
I vowed we would never lose.

00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:36.250
Not only to Brazil,
but we would never--

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.458
because we ended up with a
bronze medal for the world

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:39.960
championship, which is--

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.376
I don't even know
where that medal

00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:43.140
is, if I accepted that or not.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.697
Never talk about it.

00:29:44.697 --> 00:29:47.280
But the highlight, then, is to
go on and win four gold medals.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.782
I also have two gold
world championship medals

00:29:49.782 --> 00:29:50.990
that nobody ever talks about.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.270
But to go on and win gold
for the rest of my career

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.310
wearing the red, white, and
blue is the highlight for me.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.210
Go USA, right?

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.085
CHRIS WEBBER: Go USA.

00:30:00.085 --> 00:30:00.608
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:01.107 --> 00:30:02.586
That's a hard story to beat.

00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:04.335
That would have been--
we'd have had beef.

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.760
LISA LESLIE: Oh, it was awful.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.860
CHRIS WEBBER: I would have taken
the clippers out of his hand,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.620
thrown them out the window,
or something like that.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.203
It would have been
a fight on the bus.

00:30:11.203 --> 00:30:12.210
LISA LESLIE: Terrible.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:12.960
CHRIS WEBBER: Wow.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.760
I'd have to start with,
maybe, playing in college.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.430
Playing with the group of guys,
the fab five at that time.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.550
And the reason why--

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.409
Nate talks about his mentality.

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:28.950
And if you get to
know Nate, you know

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.230
he's still that 10-year-old.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.110
He's still a beast when it comes
to sports and his mentality.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.440
But to be at that age, I
think all you guys understand,

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.140
or maybe you're in that space
now, to be free mentally,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.470
to know that the world is
against you and to embrace it

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.250
and to take it on, but
not be bitter enough

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.770
where you've experienced
a thing and it turns sad.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.740
It's more so like an embracing
of taking on the world.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.100
And playing with those
guys was just so much fun,

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.000
because we were
on the same page.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.610
We all were dumb,
young, and naive,

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.080
and believed we could do it all.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.170
And that's a great place to be
when you work hard, you know?

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.770
And so I would just say being
with those guys every day,

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.460
having them affect my
life and who I was,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.290
and building those
true friendships.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.400
And then the highlights,
dunking on people, too,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.780
with those guys.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.187
That was a lot of fun.

00:31:17.187 --> 00:31:18.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.220
CHRIS WEBBER: Thank you.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:18.510
LISA LESLIE: Thank you.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.176
NELSON BOYCE: Speaking
of dunking, Lisa,

00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:21.780
I'm surprised you
didn't say the dunk.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.530
LISA LESLIE: Yeah.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.020
That's other
people's highlights.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.260
NELSON BOYCE: Yeah.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:24.760
That's true.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:26.830
True, indeed.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.955
LISA LESLIE: That's not
the highlight of my career.

00:31:28.955 --> 00:31:30.050
NELSON BOYCE: Right.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys for
coming and stopping by here.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.310
So fast forward 50 years
from now, 100 years from now.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.625
If you could have one game that
your great-great-grandchildren

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:45.422
could watch of yourself, which
game would you pick, and why?

00:31:45.422 --> 00:31:46.380
NATE ROBINSON: Oh, wow.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.220
CHRIS WEBBER: Wow.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.678
LISA LESLIE: That
was so deep, man.

00:31:48.678 --> 00:31:49.714
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:49.714 --> 00:31:51.040
CHRIS WEBBER: I've never
been asked these before.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.373
NELSON BOYCE: Welcome to Google.

00:31:52.373 --> 00:31:55.620
LISA LESLIE: I would
say that I have not

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.240
a lot of games in
my whole career

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.420
where I have triple-double,
but I do have one in particular

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.010
where I had 10 blocks.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.040
And I won Defensive
Player of the Year.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.225
I loved playing defense.

00:32:06.225 --> 00:32:09.090
It was playing both ends
of the court, of course.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.660
And people know
about the scoring.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.045
But I really love defense.

00:32:12.045 --> 00:32:16.780
And so I had one game
where I had 10 blocks.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.430
And for my son and daughter,
who plays sports and plays

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.740
basketball, I would like
for them to see that game.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.530
Because I think that
game is just so complete,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.680
whether it was scoring or
rebounding and blocking shots.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.780
But the defensive effort--

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.270
and it was a championships,
so that was really important.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.295
But, yeah, 10 blocks is--

00:32:35.295 --> 00:32:36.670
that's pretty
good, right, Chris?

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:36.930
For real.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.425
CHRIS WEBBER: That's great.

00:32:37.425 --> 00:32:38.216
No, I'm like, damn!

00:32:38.216 --> 00:32:38.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:39.974
I'm like damn, shawty.

00:32:39.974 --> 00:32:41.390
LISA LESLIE: Get
that out of here!

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.010
Yeah.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.745
That game was pretty cool.

00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:46.560
CHRIS WEBBER: 50,
100 years from now.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.390
We want our kids
to see, you said?

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.480
AUDIENCE: Great grandkids.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.060
CHRIS WEBBER: Great grandkids.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.830
AUDIENCE: Great-great
grandkids, whatever.

00:32:53.235 --> 00:32:54.360
CHRIS WEBBER: I would say--

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.590
I think I had 28 points
and maybe 13 rebounds.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.080
But it was in a game I called a
timeout at the end of the game.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.500
And I would show
them that, because I

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.000
would want them to
know you're going

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.050
to go through
things in your life

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.810
even when you did your
best and you won't win--

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.770
maybe you'll make a
mistake, maybe you'll lose.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.254
But look how good
of a game it was.

00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:16.670
Look how it turned
out at the end.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.140
And hopefully they
would see, wow,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.440
that was a messed up moment.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.023
Hopefully they would
ask the question,

00:33:22.023 --> 00:33:23.294
what did he do after that?

00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:24.710
And so hopefully,
that would teach

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.690
them to have a great
game, do your thing,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.410
kill it, be yourself.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:34.007
But if you run into a big
speed bump, go ahead and cry.

00:33:34.007 --> 00:33:35.090
Get it out of your system.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.250
Get around some people
that love and support you,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.540
forget it, and keep moving.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.586
Even the best games-- like Lisa
talked about her 10 blocks.

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:43.460
I bet it's fun for her
to think about it now,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.450
because when she
was a player, she

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.510
was so competitive, she didn't
think about her best games

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.720
then, because she
could always know,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.424
I could get 11
blocks or 12 blocks.

00:33:49.424 --> 00:33:51.340
And so hopefully through
that, they would see,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.820
there was a bad man.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.260
He made a mistake.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.840
And look at that and then
wonder how you get through it.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.420
And hopefully that would
inspire them to never worry

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.730
about their worst
moments, even in the best

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.676
times of their lives.

00:34:03.676 --> 00:34:06.300
NATE ROBINSON: Yeah, I'm
going to say for me, when

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.449
I played with the Knicks,
I had a coach named

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:10.970
Mike D'Antoni who sat me down.

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:12.469
He didn't play me
for a whole month.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.425
I'll never forget this.

00:34:15.425 --> 00:34:16.800
He sat me down
for a whole month,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.199
didn't give me a
reason or nothing.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:22.840
And I remember one New
Year's, I called my mom.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.750
I'm like, Mom, I
need you to come.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.810
I need somebody
there with me, just

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:30.469
to see a familiar face,
somebody that I love.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:31.770
And my mom's my best friend.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.219
So I flew her to Atlanta
and I took her to dinner.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:35.909
We went and ate.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.814
And I ran into the coach.

00:34:38.814 --> 00:34:40.230
I ran into an
Atlanta Hawks coach.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.360
And he was like, "You
playing tomorrow?"

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.409
I was like, no, I haven't
been playing for, like,

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.050
a whole month.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.855
It was like 14 games he sat me.

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:50.020
And he ended up putting me
in the game the next day.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.530
And I ended up having,
like, 41 points.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.600
We won the game--
went to overtime.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.481
And the whole time, I can hear
my mom cheering so loud up

00:34:58.481 --> 00:34:58.980
there.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:59.685 --> 00:35:00.439
Over everybody.

00:35:00.439 --> 00:35:01.897
"That's right,
Nate [INAUDIBLE]!"!"

00:35:01.897 --> 00:35:02.691
She was going hard.

00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:03.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.990
CHRIS WEBBER: She called
you by your full first name!

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.130
NATE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.900
I'm like, yeah,
that's what moms do.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.170
As a kid, you hear
that reassurance

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.240
that mom is there for me.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.240
So I just played
that game for her.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.670
And it changed my life.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.290
Because it was a big story--

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.790
"SportsCenter," a coach
sent you down for a month.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.800
I worked out hard before the
game-- ran bleachers, still

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.757
did my work out.

00:35:27.757 --> 00:35:29.590
So that would be something
that I would love

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.580
for my grandchildren to know.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.320
Even through-- you
go through adversity.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.120
You just stay ready
no matter what.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.675
Because when your
number's called--

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.300
I could have easily
just not been ready

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.070
and just said
"whatever," or even told

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.500
him, no, I don't want to go in.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.490
I just said, I'm going to
take full advantage of this.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.950
I'm going to see
where it gets me.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.847
I said, God, just don't
let me make the first shot,

00:35:46.847 --> 00:35:47.680
because it's a wrap.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.170
I'll make this first one
after sitting down a month?

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.186
So for me, that would
be part of the game,

00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:54.310
coming in, helping my team.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.337
And we won, too.

00:35:55.337 --> 00:35:56.170
That was a big deal.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.782
And all my teammates
supported me.

00:35:57.782 --> 00:35:58.990
They showed me a lot of love.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.529
It was pretty awesome.

00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:01.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.570
CHRIS WEBBER: Thank you.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.911
NELSON BOYCE: We're going
to take one last question.

00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:05.830
AUDIENCE: Hey, y'all.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.300
This is awesome.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.630
LISA LESLIE: Hi.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.960
CHRIS WEBBER: How you doing?

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.950
AUDIENCE: So it looks
like "Uncle Drew"

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.830
is a movie about old school guys
teaching the youngings what's

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.760
up, right?

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.470
So when you were
young, what's a bit

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.170
of advice that you received
from somebody older, wiser, that

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.449
helped you in your
success in life?

00:36:19.449 --> 00:36:21.490
CHRIS WEBBER: With me,
the first day of practice,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:22.940
I was drafted by Golden State.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.150
And I was so excited
to meet Chris Mullin.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.670
So he's one of the best
shooters I've ever seen.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.240
New Yorker, talked like this--

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.740
""[INAUDIBLE] Webb,
come over here."

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.050
I can't understand him.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.130
I'm excited.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.920
And I wanted to
just be around him.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.810
I bought a place where he lived.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.430
I wanted the car that he had.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.670
I wanted to be around him.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.750
And the craziest thing
is, more than shooting,

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.120
more than anything else,
after practice, he brought me

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.506
into the training room.

00:36:47.506 --> 00:36:49.630
And he said, "This is what
I want to do every day."

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.744
It was a hot tub and a cold tub.

00:36:51.744 --> 00:36:54.160
He said, "I want you to go two
minutes in the hot tub, two

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.660
minutes in the cold tub,
two minutes in the hot tub."

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.497
I'm like, come on.

00:36:56.497 --> 00:36:58.330
You don't need to stretch
when you're young.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.246
You can do everything.

00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:01.540
And then I found myself
doing that every game.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.420
And through all the injuries,
I found myself, 15 years later,

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.057
doing that-- what he told me.

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.140
So he really taught me how
to take care of my body

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.820
with nutrition.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.153
He was at the end of his career.

00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:12.130
And telling me all that
in the beginning really

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.630
helped me at least
focus my mind and be

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.620
ready to listen to my body and
stay prepared the whole time.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.321
And I think he had
a big influence

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.820
on how I take care of my body,
how I prepared in the summer.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.000
Because he was relentless
in his training.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.760
And I think that was
the basis for having

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.820
a pretty good career for me.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.150
LISA LESLIE: For me,
as a kid, I think

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.036
my mom was my
biggest inspiration,

00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:37.660
and she shared a lot
of things with me.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.430
Being a single parent
raising three girls,

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.770
and then just being so tall.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:45.919
I've been tall all my life.

00:37:45.919 --> 00:37:47.710
My second grade teacher
called home and was

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.220
like, "Do you realize
Lisa's taller than me

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.705
and the rest of the children?"

00:37:51.705 --> 00:37:55.459
And my mom's like, "Yeah,
well, what's the problem?"

00:37:55.459 --> 00:37:56.500
My mom's like, "I'm 6'2".

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.330
Her dad's 6'4".

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.400
And she said, "Oh, OK,
well, excuse the call."

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.250
So being this tall all my life,
having my mom be so positive

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.610
about my posture, and
sitting up straight,

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.059
and that some people
grow on the inside

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:13.600
and some people grow
on the outside--

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.640
and our family's been
blessed enough to do both,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.370
so don't be ashamed
of being tall.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:19.790
And you have to stand up tall.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.110
And there was a lot of
that-- when you're tall

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.750
and people ask you every single
day, "Do you play basketball?"

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.740
and you're like, no.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.570
Why do you--

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.050
I don't understand
the association

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.940
with my height and basketball.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.060
So for me, just
through grade school,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.230
it was always this constant
barrage of questions and people

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.230
talking about my height.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.880
And it was really annoying.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.771
When you're a kid, you don't
really get the whole comments

00:38:42.771 --> 00:38:43.270
and stuff.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.760
So my mom was always
constantly dropping

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.490
in these seeds of
building me up and making

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.140
me feel confident and
comfortable in my own skin.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.830
And I think that the
biggest takeaways

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.740
that she would tell
us was small things,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.050
like "you can't receive
anything with a closed fist,

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.080
so always have an open hand
in helping other people."

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.430
"We're all God's children."

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.770
Just, really, a voice of
love and positivity that,

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.052
eventually, my
sister and I-- we're

00:39:11.052 --> 00:39:12.760
always like, we're
our mother's daughter.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.411
Because all we do
is, if somebody says,

00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:16.160
"Oh my god, this
headache is killing me"--

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.250
"No, don't say that, because
it's not killing you.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.720
You just have a
headache this moment,

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.660
but you're going to be better."

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.010
And then--

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.300
--everything is this whole
positive affirmation.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.740
But I love it.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.770
And the other thing she would
tell us was the seven Ps.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.700
The seven Ps are Proper Prior
Preparation Prevents Piss-Poor

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.390
Performance.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.300
So the seven Ps was
simply, whatever

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.567
you want to do, whatever
you want to get out of life,

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:40.400
you've got to do it.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.320
You've got to work hard.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.986
But you're got to get
out of it whatever

00:39:42.986 --> 00:39:43.950
effort you put into it.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.880
So if you're going to do
it, what did your mom say?

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.296
Do it right or
don't do it at all,

00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:49.930
because you're going to go back
and do it anyway, in our house.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.660
So it was all of these
positive affirmations

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.200
that my mom kept giving my
sisters and I that I felt

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.960
helped mold me into
being able to accept--

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.450
God knows I didn't know I
was going to get to 6'5".

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:02.250
This is ridiculous.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:02.710
I'm like, Lord--

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.236
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.236 --> 00:40:03.990
CHRIS WEBBER: Stop.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.990
LISA LESLIE: Stop, yeah.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.514
Like, what are we doing here?

00:40:07.514 --> 00:40:08.830
Because six foot was like--

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.010
six foot in the sixth grade.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.660
I know.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.290
I know, right?

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:11.579
CHRIS WEBBER: What?

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:12.790
You were taller than
me in sixth grade.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.390
LISA LESLIE: Sixth grade.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.350
I was six foot.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.380
Thank god my teacher was 6'2".

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.740
And this other Wonderboy,
Samuel, he was 6 foot.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.710
So I'm like, perfect.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.990
And the tallest people got
to be the line leaders.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.830
I was so excited.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.720
Because it's usually the
tallest are in the back.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.178
You guys don't feel
me, but listen.

00:40:27.178 --> 00:40:27.931
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:27.931 --> 00:40:30.154
When you're tall, this
is a struggle, here.

00:40:30.154 --> 00:40:32.070
NATE ROBINSON: Those are
tall people problems.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.570
LISA LESLIE: Tall people
problems, exactly.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.125
Exactly.

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:36.750
You were always the
line leader, right?

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:37.240
NATE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.730
LISA LESLIE: Yeah.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.355
It's not right.

00:40:38.355 --> 00:40:40.180
Who made up that rule?

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.610
So anyway, so all
of that was just,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.879
I feel like my mom being so
positive and knowing ahead,

00:40:45.879 --> 00:40:47.920
having the [INAUDIBLE]----
because her growing up

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.190
in the '60s, being tall was
just like, what are you doing?

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.600
Like, who told you could grow?

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.030
We're going to have to get
shoeboxes for your shoes.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.100
It was a negative thing.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.680
And parents and people
made negative comments

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.520
about tall women.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.580
So I'm thankful that
my mom gave me all

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.320
of that positive affirmations.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.140
And for all the tall
women in the room,

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.850
feel good, represent,
keep your head up high.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.070
We are just Queens
amongst the people.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.530
NATE ROBINSON: Well, I don't
got tall people problems.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.830
LISA LESLIE: What's the
other end of the spectrum?

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.895
NATE ROBINSON: So mine will
come from my mother, as well.

00:41:24.895 --> 00:41:26.350
She really wasn't that vocal.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.900
She led by just showing.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.480
Three jobs, took care of
three kids all on our own.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.730
And I just watched her
hustle and grind every day.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.360
And she smiled doing it.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.159

for Boeing for like 30 years.

NATE ROBINSON: She's been
a janitor for 30 years.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.960
And she's never complained
a day in her life.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.740
And she just goes.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.840
So I think that's where I get
my hunger and drive from, is

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.780
