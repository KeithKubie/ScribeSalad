00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:15.776
Take a moment to read the following.

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:23.772
How was that?

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:24.469
Frustrating?

00:00:24.493 --> 00:00:25.298
Slow?

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:26.946
What were those sentences about?

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.518
They're actually a simulation

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.734
of the experience of dyslexia,

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:33.612
designed to make you decode each word.

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:36.545
Those with dyslexia experience
that laborious pace

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.299
every time they read.

00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:40.000
When most people think of dyslexia,

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:43.676
they think of seeing letters
and words backwards,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.879
like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa,

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:47.877
or they might think people with dyslexia

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.965
see "saw" as "was".

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.170
The truth is people with dyslexia

00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:55.612
see things the same way as everyone else.

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:59.679
Dyslexia is caused by a phonological
processing problem,

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.137
meaning people affected by it

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.347
have trouble not with seeing language

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:05.013
but with manipulating it.

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:08.432
For example, if you heard the word cat

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.134
and then someone asked
you, "Remove the 'c',"

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.791
what word would you have left?

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.045
At.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.584
This can be difficult
for those with dyslexia.

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:18.176
Given a word in isolation,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.554
like fantastic,

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.876
students with dyslexia
need to break the word

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.513
into parts to read it:

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:24.253
fan,

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:24.982
tas,

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:26.034
tic.

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:28.708
Time spent decoding makes it hard

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:30.051
to keep up with peers

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.274
and gain sufficient comprehension.

00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:33.982
Spelling words phonetically,

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.602
like s-t-i-k

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:36.389
for stick

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:38.109
and f-r-e-n-s

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.104
for friends

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:41.100
is also common.

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:44.143
These difficulties are more
widespread and varied

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.890
than commonly imagined.

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:49.014
Dyslexia affects up to one in five people.

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:50.651
It occurs on a continuum.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.789
One person might have mild dyslexia

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:56.576
while the next person has
a profound case of it.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.877
Dyslexia also runs in families.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:00.956
It's common to see one family member

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.488
who has trouble spelling

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:03.798
while another family member

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:07.702
has severe difficulty decoding
even one syllable words,

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.610
like catch.

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:12.370
The continuum and distribution of dyslexia

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:15.052
suggests a broader
principle to bear in mind

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:17.675
as we look at how the brains
of those with dyslexia

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.742
process language.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.846
Neurodiversity is the idea

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.344
that because all our brains
show differences

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:26.478
in structure and function,

00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:28.492
we shouldn't be so quick to label

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.723
every deviation from "the norm"

00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:32.693
as a pathological disorder

00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:35.187
or dismiss people living
with these variations

00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:37.394
as "defective."

00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:40.812
People with neurobiological
variations like dyslexia,

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:43.402
including such creative
and inventive individuals

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:44.620
as Picasso,

00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:45.404
Muhammad Ali,

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:46.493
Whoopi Goldberg,

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:47.574
Steven Spielberg,

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:48.455
and Cher,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.038
clearly have every capacity

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:53.634
to be brilliant and successful in life.

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:55.082
So, here's the special way

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.460
the brains of those with dyslexia work.

00:02:57.484 --> 00:03:00.343
The brain is divided into two hemispheres.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.178
The left hemisphere is generally
in charge of language

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:04.876
and, ultimately, reading,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.307
while the right typically
handles spatial activities.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.453
fMRI studies have found

00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:12.464
that the brains of those with dyslexia

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:15.961
rely more on the right
hemisphere and frontal lobe

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:18.144
than the brains of those without it.

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:20.068
This means, when they read a word,

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:22.152
it takes a longer trip through their brain

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:24.989
and can get delayed in the frontal lobe.

00:03:25.013 --> 00:03:27.623
Because of this neurobiological glitch,

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.739
they read with more difficulty.

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.288
But those with dyslexia

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:32.957
can physically change their brain

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.142
and improve their reading

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:38.082
with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:39.786
that breaks the language down

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.707
and teaches the reader to decode

00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:44.621
based on syllable types
and spelling rules.

00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:46.450
The brains of those with dyslexia

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:48.180
begin using the left hemisphere

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:50.306
more efficiently while reading,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.228
and their reading improves.

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:53.472
The intervention works

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:56.286
because it locates dyslexia appropriately

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.813
as a functional variation in the brain,

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:01.147
which, naturally, shows
all sorts of variations

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:03.371
from one person to another.

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:06.111
Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:08.348
of brain function in all humans

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:11.550
and suggests that to better
understand the perspectives

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:13.230
of those around us,

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:16.016
we should try not only to see
the world through their eyes

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.661
but understand it through their brains.
