Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast said, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking in on you. Just checking in on your fucking red line in the goddamn levels. Here you bring this down here. Ah, Jesus. I got shit to do today, so let's fucking get right to it.

Speaker 3:          00:00:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       Do you see these goddamn things? Fuck it by him. I found that youtube clip the other day member on the fat kid. We'll review food. That was my favorite one. Fat Kid reviews, girl scout cookies. He goes, sees a girl scout mint chocolate chip cookies and I fucking love them. Like me. Sits there and he ate some looks up in the air and then he goes up some. You see somebody selling these goddamn things, fucking buy them. It's one of the greatest food reviews ever. I totally believed him and I want to girl scout cookies. But anyways, I'm not here to talk about this. I'm not in it. Talk about that. I'm here as a casual fucking fan of the NBA. Meaning, I've probably watched seven whole games in the last seven fucking years. And I watched the second half of last night's Cleveland Cavaliers, first the fucking Golden State Warriors, um, in a bar with the sound out.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       Now here comes my analogy, my favorite fucking moment of last night and this thing, I don't have a dog in the fight. I'd love to see Lebron win a championship for Cleveland. And, um, I always like the golden state warriors because they, they stunk, you know, and their fans fucking hung in there. And I liked their floor and all of that shit in that old piece of Shit stadium they play. And I went to a game there. I went to a game there about fucking 10 years ago, and there was like nobody there. And they had these sickest fucking live band. They're the old plane. Herbie Hancock. What does that sound? Wild AOD or what? Barrow do Ruby.

Speaker 3:          00:02:02       Wow. Deep that did do that

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       fucking sickest shit ever, right? It was way better than mine. I just did the fuck was the name of that song? I got that on my fucking phone somewhere. Oh, Jesus. Uh, you know, and I'll play it for you here in a second. Maybe you guys understand what this one is. Herbie Hancock. It wasn't watermelon, man. What the fuck was it called? Headhunter her be head cock. I'm going to hit pause while I look this up so I don't torture you here. All right, good. I got, they were playing. They were playing Herbie Hancock Chameleon. I met a professional basketball game. There's nobody there. There's fucking live band is crushing this song right here. Come on, play it for fuck sakes. Me. Just look around like, just fucking game sucks. Listen to this band though. The killing it. Harvey Mason.

Speaker 3:          00:02:57       All right. Alright.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Black people all start moving around. White people start getting uncomfortable and the guitar player comes in. Maybe it comes in in the next [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       very comfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       I felt like it was in a fucking movie, so I was like, you know what? I love this franchise. You know what this is? This is if you shot, this is what you should be doing. And saying, listen man, we're only going to win eight games a year. Let's fucking get a killer band to come in there and people can leave to have a good time. It was a fucking party and they lost by like fucking 30. So anyways, I got, I don't have a dog in this fight and I watched this game.

Speaker 4:          00:03:46       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       I watched this game with the fucking sound on that was Herbie Hancock Chameleon by the way, before you try to shit Zammit point your phone at your fucking dashboard while you're driving down the street. Killing a fucking mother is six. Um, I have to tell you this over the last couple of games that I've watched, like the NBA has fucking changed so much the way Steph curry just runs around the court. Like it's his, like the whole thing is his, it's his fucking showcase when he was sitting on the bench and that dude hits the three pointer and he did that little jazz hand thing.

Speaker 4:          00:04:21       Yeah. Whatever

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       the fuck he was doing, you know, dribbles out the game and then looks at the crowd, goes [inaudible] fucking screaming. I'm just looking at him. Okay, now I know this guy could fucking body slammed me. I'm just a comedian, but I'm talking about NBA player, Nba play at this fucking guy is, he's built like an honor roll student. All right? And I know he can shoot the fucking lights out from behind the three point line. Fine. You know, you do the best she can back there, but you let that little mother fucker just glide down the Goddamn Lane like clear, clearer path to today's NBA. Don't touch him. Don't fucking touch him. That guy needs to get his head taken off. Get one of those fucking giant white dudes from fucking eastern Europe. Some Transylvania guy. Get him out there. He's got six files. Just, you know, you know what would happen?

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       He'd do fucking one. They'd be like, Ooh, 32 channel with e trade or whatever the fuck they call it. Was that a hard foul? Was he trying to hurt his feelings with that foul? Oh, let's go over and look at the tape. What do you think was, was, was his face snarl too much when he did that? Uh, we can have that. Get him out of the game. You know, it's still worth it to fucking do it because I can see it back in the day. You know the Rick, my horns that John Sally's all at all of these fucking guy, John Sally passed away unfortunately. But all of those fucking old school NBA guys gotta be this fucking kid and just be sitting there going like, yeah dad, that that wouldn't happen. Rightfully that guy would have got his fucking head taken off. Do you know if you watch highlights of Jordan all you young millennial fucking Yolo people out there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       If you fucking watch him, it's like he's skinny, he's skinny, and then all of a sudden he's filled out. That was because the Pistons beat the shit out of them. EPFL like fucking two, three years in a row in the playoffs. He finally had enough guy had to go to the gym because the NBA reps weren't protecting them. They keep come down there. They'd fucking do remember one time fucking bill and beer, one of the, it's always like, I'll, Sam is sin without skates out there who hilariously in the 30 for 30 used to be like, we used to like to try and get in people's heads. It's like, like he was playing this high level fucking mind game. It's like, no dude, you were just out there waiting for people to leave their feet and you'd take their fucking legs out. How'd you come up with that?

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       It's your major in Calculus. Um, so I remember one time he was hacking the Celtics so fucking bad. Robert Parish finally couldn't take it. And the players go on up the court and he just fucking gave him two, four. I'm smashes over their head. He chopped them down like a fucking, do you ever see like when a guy who does not to chop down a tree chops down to train, it falls into his house? That's the way he was hacking away at Lam beer and land beer. Just put both his hands up like, oh, you know, like George Michael when he was with wham and he just fucking went down. All right. He gave him to fucking ruin your friends. Right. And he went down, the refs didn't see it. It was like wrestling. And then when they back they went back and looked at the tape.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       You're like, yeah, well, you know, we should've called the fall and there was no fines. There was no objections, there was no nothing. He just, you know, live by the sword, die by the sword. Um, there was so many of those. I just was thinking another one that I saw, they just, it just nowadays you just covered is out there just fucking gliding around. He's built like a muppet. I just don't understand in this day and age how that has happened. And the only thing that I can come up with is that the leagues is so fucking guilty that not guilty greedy is that they realize that, you know, um, that offense sells tickets to the casual fan. You know what I mean? Like, let's take the most boring game ever. And I'm not talking about horseshoes. I'm not talking about shuffleboard. I'm not talking about darts.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       I of course am talking about soccer. Okay? Which the entire world has embraced except for us and when you really look at it, that's probably why we're number one. You know what I mean? The rest of the world is too stupid to realize how boring that fucking game is despite the fact that it's so fucking boring that even their fans have to have campfires singalongs as they wait for something to happen. I want some added with Agn Hayes all Righ, right? Just sitting there, they're fucking scarves and shit. This is the thing about, Oh man, I'm going to get some fucking emails in this. This is the thing about fucking soccer, right? If they just let the forwards run past the final line of defense, like in any other competitive fucking game where it's like, hey, I'm faster than you. I understand like offsides to a point, but it's got to be a, just a line like in hockey and then after that, if I'm faster than you, if I can see the play developing before you do, I get by you. I don't have to fucking wait for you. If they would just adjust that and you'd start to have some fucking 10 to eight games, I'm telling you that game would blow up.

Speaker 5:          00:09:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       Blow up here in the United States we would sit down and fucking watch it. You know why? Because we don't understand the game, you know what I mean? If I was watching cricket right, I guess they score a lot in that fucking thing. That's a good one to just sit around and booze with, but any fucking game then I'm not into, if somebody is crushing it and everybody's flipping out, I'm going to be like, what's going on? I'm going to actually going to sit there and watch it. Like nobody, like when I walked by, you know in soccer is on, I don't even look at it, but if I hit this guy go,

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       he's doing that. I stopped and I watch, you know, and I read all the fucking advertising's all over there fucking uniforms. I got to tell you, the premier league has the worst fucking uniforms I've ever seen in my life. You can't figure out who to fuck anybody. It doesn't say man United, it doesn't say Liverpool. It just says Exxon and fucking Joey's fish and chips fucking banks. I heard they're going to do that in the NBA. But anyways, I think that that's what happened to the game. And I know, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm too fucking busy to pay attention. And at the end of the day I never really excelled in sports anyway. So who better to break down? What's wrong with the fucking NBA than some stuttering fucking prick like me? Um, I think you got an entire generation of people that grew up playing Madden football and all of this shit and everybody was the globe trotters.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       And now that just doing like the real version of it. All right. I love Steph Curry. He's the greatest shoot I've ever seen in my life. But watching him just glide down the fucking lane is ridiculous, which is why last night after the fucking whistle blows, he just decides like, Oh, I'm just gonna fucking yell. I'm going to take a little lay up here, you know right next to Lebron James, and I loved that Lebron blocked it and looked at him like, fuck Outta here. That's what they need to do. All right, you're not going to beat these fucking guys play in their Goddamn game trying to outshoot fucking three pointers or whatever the fuck it is they're doing. Granted, I watched it with the sound down in the second half. Um, they need to fucking, they got it. They got you. I'm telling you, they got to give him the right Dave for it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       That's what they got to do. Okay. That's what you do. If the other team is faster, the other team fucking you get, you have to play physical. I'm not saying play dirty Pittsburgh Penguin fans. I'm not saying you hire a fucking knee breaker and and the career of the best player on the other team. I'm not saying that. All I'm saying is when the guy comes down the leg, your whole team should be yelling, Clara path. You know, when this guy looks like he's in the fucking globe trotters. Um, now, now that I'm done with that, a little fucking Soliloquy, most of that was based in what happens is you get older, you know, and you start realizing your own mortality. And there's a couple of panic thoughts that you have is, you know, the world is churches. Oh, I'm gonna die and it's gonna keep going.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Part of it was that, that the game has changed. You know what I mean? I am kind of the old man going, why can't they have short shorts again and close lines. It's amazing. Somebody balls didn't come out like during that Rambus play. It's unbelievable that his junk didn't come out the side. He fucking literally did. Like, you know, like, uh, he did, he was doing like a Thomas flair in the air. And Dude, I actually retweeted the other day. It was in a game. Jack [inaudible] elbows, Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the fucking like right in, right in the right inhale, solar plexus used to say in wrestling and cream had to like fucking just run it off like fuck. So whatever happened on the play where the sea, uh, the sonics hit the shot or not, they're going back up to court or whatever. No, they didn't cause what's his face?

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       Sigma was still setting up. Corinne walked back into the play and just got a little in front of Jack Sigma turned around and punched him right in the face. It's sick my head, that great hair, you know, that hair that like moves around if he get hit, you know, he had whip lash hair, the white version of it where Thomas Hitman Hearns had the black version when he fought, uh, when he fought. Um, Marvin Hagler, you know, if a black guy who's going to get punched in, they hadn't a boxing match, you want them to have a Jerry curl because it just adds to it when all that liquid just shoots off his fucking head. And Jack Sigma had the white version of it where he had basically a Beatles haircut. So it just enhances, you really get to see like how much you know, whiplash somebodies enduring. Um, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       There we go. That's just the end of it. I, I, you know what it is selfishly I want to see seven games. Um, and uh, I would like to see, all right, one teams, a finessed team, the other teams of physical team, I don't want to say it, he 30 play, but I don't see one team, you know, putting on their Tutus and trying to out fucking spin the other team. Right. Isn't that what I'm saying there and Nino, sorry, I'm trying to plow my way through this podcast. So they got to go a do a table read there. You want to join the podcast? You just coming in to say hello. I just called Tuesday as a day. Not Today. I got one more day and I'm 30, but tomorrow it's your birthday. Oh yeah. Where are you taking me? Chucky cheese.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       I get to work to come here. I do. I feel about it. How do you feel about your birthday? Um, this is a weird one. Why? Because usually at my advanced age, I start going like, Oh God, and I was this number. Now I'm that number, right? This one. I, I don't, I've just sort of, uh, you know, somewhere when I went during my year of being 47, I realized it's over what's over my sex appeal. My, uh, my dream of being one of people magazine's 50 most beautiful people. Uh, yeah, that one might be a little batteries, but his sex appeal I think is getting strong. Oh, Jesus. Everybody gets a ribbon nowadays. Um, so I just have settled into a, I went and I got glasses the other day. Yes, you did. Cleo. Get out of there. That was a grape nuts. Those are not for you. Go Fat. She's getting, she's not that fast. She's fat. You're fat and you're not going to get a date. No one's going to love. You know, I've been so busy, I've been able to work. Grab a microphone to, cause you're gonna drive people nuts off off the thing. Go get a court people not to drive. You can drive me nuts cause a microphone in the closet. Huh? I feel like the narrow and knock and I'm good fellas now keep going right down there.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Yeah, it was scaring me, Karen. Um, no, this one I'm, I'm just now like, I'm Kinda like, all right, I'm old now. It's all about, and because I had psychiatric, uh, Erica, um, I realize now that all I give a shit is that if I just can sit down and not have pain, I'll be fine. And I want to thank everybody that have given me all their, their, you know, remedies and all of that stuff. You know, it's funny. It's, yeah, it's funny as hell how they fucking do it where it's done with love, but in a Twitter way like, hey fuck it. Just if you have Sayada just do this, get over and get on one of those foam rollers and roll out your para us. And it's like, I did that. I did that. I've done all of that shit. I actually went to the chiropractor again yesterday and he said that the swelling on my spine has gone down tremendously.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       I am now on the next level of healing. Well now I don't have pain. I just feel like, uh, it's a little tingly sometimes my foot falls asleep. I've been doing these stretches, body mind at work got in this, you know like do of those things where you hang upside down. Yeah. He got one that's actually not legal in this country. Um, but do they sell it in Canada, Canada and you just basically, uh, you're more hanging from like your waist as opposed to your ankle. Dad was talking about, my dad was talking about the one where you hang from your ankles. Yeah. And what my chiropractor was saying was that that one, it puts stress on your joints cause you got your whole body weight, puts like your ankles, your knees and your hips because your whole body weight with this other one loves that thing though.

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       Yeah. I don't know. A lot of people love it for whatever reason, but I've been using the other one and that one would be like, uh, say like you were at the zoo and you're at the gorilla and closure and you want to bend over and look for the dime. You just fucking lost. This is a very timely, yeah, just imagine that except you don't fall in, I use the thing it'll fit adult if an adult fell in there. Yeah. What did they have shot at? What? The tranquilizer thinking that maybe the adult could handle the fucking thrashing that he was going to get. I think that the adult would have had the presence of mind to like slowly try to back out of this situation as opposed to a baby that's just kinda like sitting there. Can you give us an example of how you would slowly back of a situation with the gorilla?

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       Alright. You Fall in God, what would you say? Hey Man, like easy, easy. Well, you know, I'm terrified of primates. Like they just freaked me out in general, so I don't really know what I would do because I just feel like, oh, I know what I would do common like Dna wise or something with a chimpanzee than they do with a gorilla. Like they, that freaks me out. I know, I know exactly what I would do. I don't like it. Actually, I would curl up in the fetal position and I would cover up my face so he wouldn't rip it off and I would just be like, if I got to take some gorilla fucking kidney shots, I would much rather take the ASV comes over and just fucking whales on me, like from fucking ankle to the side of my head. I will take that before I will.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       I will just stand there with my face out waiting for you to rip it off. Well I do they, yeah, I mean I feel like that's probably the best way to go. So they don't see you as like a threat or something like you just sort of submit to them or something? I don't know. But then I don't want them to be like, I'm sure this information is on the Internet now. Like it's just so weird. I don't know. They just, they really freaked me out. Remember when we went to Australia, you know they're going to grab you by your ankle and just drag you around like a fucking, they did that little kid. I haven't watched it. Oh remember when we went to Australia and I was telling you a video of it. I don't want to watch that. I did. I did watch still one of the naked guy that walked into the line and closure and he's trying to kill himself.

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       Oh. And the fucking is his neck is in the guy in the fucking things naked. I mean, I was talking about that on TV. Oh my God. Yeah, it's a little, yeah, it's like, go ahead, grab my neck, but I still got a cup of my junk. You still got to keep your boxes on, right? No, but that's the thing. The thing was just handled by his neck and survive. Yeah. But cause I, they must've just fed the fucking thing. So it just had him around the neck. It's in the guys, literally, he's got his arms around the things that lions neck and then he's basically in any wrapped his legs around his body. He basically had it in the guard, like a Jujitsu guard and the fucking lion and around his throat, but he wasn't shaking them or anything. And everyone's like, you know, going, Oh my God, Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       And you know, in whatever fucking language, whatever country it was in their film and the guy goes completely fucking naked. And um, yeah, he obviously had like mental issues because if you're in sound mind and you kill yourself, you just like jump off something, right? Yeah. You don't wander into a land on somebody's know naked Volkswagen Passat. Wait, but I wanted to say when we went to Australia that time, were you with me when I was in that monkey exhibit or whatever and it looked like planet of the apes and it was freaking me out. And then we went into that other little side room and there was a monkey behind the glass and everyone was looking at it and taking pictures and he started rocking back and forth and I was like, that thing is about to freak out. And then it threw itself up against the glass and like screamed and yelled and everyone was like all, then the other chimp came in?

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       Yes. The campaign and like tried to come and I did. Yeah, we thought they were going to fight and then they embraced each other and then they like put their bags toward the glass with one of them's arm around the other. Like it's going to be okay. Like we're going to get out of here some day. Like it was so emotional and it was so scary. I just, I can't, I don't know. I can't deal with it. Like that scene in the trailer for Tarzan, the legend of Tarzan or the monkey comes in and like see is the Tarzan in the bassinet and then picks it up and then leaves with it as just like, I don't know. I don't like that shit. Yeah, I think it's really weird. I mean, if that was in the wild, they would, they would eat that baby and they would actually leave it, keep it alive as long as they could because they enjoy the screaming cause it fucking is that true that they get off on it, man.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       Two chimpanzees are fucking evil. Gorilla is a chill. Gorillas don't have anything to prove. Champ champ. The short man's disease. I feel like gorilla in our little more chill and then he got those tweaks are monkeys. Yeah, right. The meth head ones. Yeah. Those ones that throw their shit at you. The chimpanzee was the one that like threw itself up against the glass and was like really loud and screaming. The other gorillas seem a little bit more peaceful. Those are the ones that are handsome. Like you saw that one gorilla that everyone was freaking out about in the zoo in Japan because everyone thought it was like a good, it's actually a very good looking gorilla, but yeah, that was weird. It a weird here. It was really weird. You will never find another gorilla like me. I, yeah, like sexy gorilla. That's why they freak me out there.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       Just so human like that is just, it's unsettling to me and I don't like when they make gorillas have agendas like that commercial where the little girl is deaf and she's doing sign language with the other gorilla. It's like all very surette orangutan. What? Tam? My hope that that's the ones that, look if I was a fucking chimp, that's what I would look like. The ones with all the stringy hair, orange ones look like old men but they're like sign language in each other and it's like, oh that's sweet. Like they're communicating through sign language and then all of a sudden that orangutan is like, oh, but like the way you live is destroying my life. And it's like wait a minute. And it was like for about palm oil or peanut oil and it was like don't get the monkey eyeball. Everything just shocking. Cause now did you see, I told you this morning I didn't see that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       I get it, but don't bring the animals into it. And deaf children, like I just felt like that was his fucking monkeys with their agendas. I didn't, um, I didn't see the clip, but I just, I just read about it. Some reporter as Bernie Sanders, the fact that he's staying in the race, they asked him if he was being sexist by staying in it. Like he couldn't handle lion two way Hallman. Why is that sexist for him to stay in there? A lot of us, the reporter wants Hillary Clinton. They want him out. They want him out. They want Trump out. Even Republicans like where the money's at. They, they are gonna except Hilary Clinton before Trump and before, um, uh, Bernie Sanders. And what I love about Trump and Bernie Sanders was it showed that enough Americans are sick of this standard Republican Democrat. Like Hillary Clinton is the standard fucking Democrat. She's got the same money in our pockets.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       The Republican [inaudible] general Republican candidate would have had any of those other fucking guys that was running basically. Um, and it's, you know, it's just, that means just the 1% is going to get more fucking rich and they're going to push down the middle class, the same fucking bullshit. They're going to stay the course. They don't want somebody that's off to the side. I got to, uh, I just had a scary thought. What was that Trump president? No, I was thinking about, I don't know that around its residents know that orangutan thing. And I just literally got a picture of an orangutan like in the way I said Tang, like the drink my whole life, isn't it? Orangutan? No, it's a ring. A Tan. It is. Nobody's said. We don't think that's true. Well, oh wait, is it rang a Tan. I just, it was making me think of planet of the apes where it's like, oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       Yep. And I got met. Everybody made fun of what's his face, just fell and potato with the knee. I always did potato Po. Tay told, I think I used to smell, I mean spell tomato with an e at the end. Cause the toe. Yeah. It's like does it toe. So we're both done. Well that's why we found each other. That's right. Cause there was no one to be on the day going like, oh my God, this person's an idiot. We were both gone like, wow, this person gets me. I'm excited for your birthday tomorrow. You'll never find Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Yeah you are. You're very resigned this year. I've noticed even now talking about it as much because I'm in the writer's room. I know what's going to happen. My birthday. I'm going to fucking go to the writer's room and stare at a computer all day. Yeah. What if this person says this and then called back to that story til still track. But they'll probably give you a cake at the office. No, cause there's somebody whose birthday was yesterday. That was the oh yeah. You guys have somebody's first day. Today's the ninth in mind is Friday. Yeah. If they get a cake, if they get me a cake, it's because they all want cake.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       Um, no. I know what I wanna do for my birthday. What do you want to do for your birthday? Um, tell me. Well, you know, in a perfect world my back would be fine and I'd take you up in the helicopter with an instructor. Of course, you know. Oh, that'll be fun. Yeah. And we'd fly over the ocean and I'd be singing where no more nurture our [inaudible]. I would do that. My name is John Dacre. I name is John Dacre. That's my favorite fucking thing ever. I just doubled more than any question in the world. [inaudible] Mori, what's the first religious song you sing? So, oh, um, [inaudible] I like when he's feeling good. He goes, when he entered his skull,

Speaker 6:          00:28:37       oh

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       hey. Had a fucking meltdown. She was on TV and he just got in his fucking head and I don't think he'd ever been in his head in his life. I bet he's a really cerebral guy and he couldn't understand that for the first time ever. His head, his brain was failing him. He was really looking around like, I'm just as confused. Spot this as you are. Then he choked and I feel like in church or wherever it is, because the woman playing the piano, she is like, I guess she gives lessons in that town. And I, I'm sure that insurance, he kills it. But then he's in that public access studio. I don't think it kills a camera. I think he can change his legs. He just, he can carry a tune and they bury them in with like 40 people around them. Right, right, right. He's probably still weird. What kind of car are you think he drives? It's something very old and something like tragically unhip Brown, Brown. He drives a brown, a brown interior. Like it's this brown on Brown. Yeah. It's like an old Pontiac Bonneville [inaudible] then old Napoli. Oldsmobiles [inaudible] my name is John Dacre.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       My name is John Dacre. Let them fuck. There's so much. You guys have to see this. No, no. I already, I already talked to him. I do love it. We got a table read, so I got to go over my lines here today. They're Nino. Um, Bebo. Let me a, I gotta do a little, some reeds here. All right. Helix. Helicase I don't know. Uh, your helix, probably helix. Helix. Your unique. You don't walk like anyone else talk like anyone else or sleep like anyone else. So why is your mattress one size fits all? I don't know cause we're all basically the same height. You know, unless you're like an NBA freak because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10 10,000 bucks until now. Now my name is John Dacre. Go to Hu calyx, sleep.com answered. He looks sleep.com I keep thinking of the band for a answer, a few simple questions and they'll run a three d biochemical model of your body through the proprietary algorithms they've developed with the help of the world's leading ergonomics and biomechanics.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       It's like just to troll me biomechanics experts as a mistake. You know why? Because my brain is already going. All right, so they take a three d image of your body and then that's on the Internet somewhere, right? It's a custom mattress. Yeah. But any information goes on the Internet. People can hack in. So someone hacks in and see what that, they take that five 11 now and then they make some blow up doll of your body and then someone's fucking a rubber version of you will here in the Pacific with the bill birthdays. All again.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       Yeah. This is, I have a theory about the internet. I don't give a fuck what it is. Somebody's jerking off to it. I don't care. Yeah. There's somebody that gets excited about a, a kid getting dragged around by his ankle, by a fucking gorilla. I used to say that about the goodwill to like, you didn't like it because you just assume that everyone just, just on that thing, like all the clothes and all that, like really cool vintage stuff. You're like, I don't want something that somebody just on. And I'm like, why do you automatically go to somebody just on something? Cause if people are animals, cause people show go out to public events in their bare feet. That's why you want this sweatpants. You want somebody old couch, everything's been fucked on or it's just, that's gross animals. All right, let's continue with the advertising helix.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Yeah, I doubt the band was called Helix also, by the way. Yes, they were. Oh, are you sure? Like you've heard of like a double helix, like that's not what they're talking about. Oh No, it wasn't that deep. Oh, give me your door. Oh, she, okay. And what'd you're gonna do? Rock. They don't remember. There's deep lyrics back in the 80s. Helux Helix, Helix customers report a 30% improvement in overall sleep quality. I should really do this with my site.

Speaker 8:          00:38:45       Hey, what's going on? It's still the Monday morning podcast and uh, same in Raleigh, Durham airport, which I don't know if it's, I think they actually have the balls to call us an international airport. I'm not sure. I don't think it's international cause the lines went that long. Uh, yeah. That's one of the dumbest things I've ever fucking said. Let gets her lash and the lines went that long. Really? He didn't see anybody on a fucking Jeannie rug. So you don't think that flies anywhere else? You idiot. All right. I'm not in a good mood. Why Bill? Why aren't you in a good mood? I'll tell you why. Because, uh, your cousin in Raleigh, North Carolina, there's no fucking connected, no direct flights to Los Angeles. So for some fucking reason I asked, Oh God, the lady with the voice [inaudible] hang on a second. Every five seconds. Yes. Okay. All right. Okay. Correct. Phone message. What? You don't have a cell phone with friends? We have that number, right? Unbelievable. Pick up a courtesy phone.

Speaker 8:          00:39:58       That's so fucking stupid. Everybody has cell phones. Why would you use that archaic form in an airport? Okay. Whatever. Uh, anyways. Yeah. So I'm in Raleigh at, uh, I want to get to La for some fucking reason. I have to fly to Cleveland first. And uh, it's annoying enough when you have a connecting flight, but you know, why can't it be in a city that's at least going in the direction that I want to go? I'm going to go fucking West. I want better. They're making me fly north a little bit west. But you know, at the end of the day, it's fucking north going north of the Mason Dixon line, you know, Mason Dixon Line just to keep, uh, yeah. What does that leave the ladies fucking so fucking loud over there.

Speaker 8:          00:40:46       Why is it, you know, in society, why can't I just, why can't you just lean over to her right now and just be like, hey, Hey lady. Hey. Yeah you do. Could you shut the fuck up please? Or at the very least get you talk a lot quieter because no one gives a fuck about whatever the fuck it is that you're yelling about it much. You stupid fucking board meeting. You know what I mean? Who the fuck are you talking to? It's fucking, I guess it's 10 25 in the morning. You know what's annoying me as she's talking really loud and her eyebrows or it's full fucking mast. Uh, Jesus. Is there anybody even listened to these announcements? How? Look at this person coming, buddy. She's got the, uh, the p diddy syndrome or the Shaquille O'neal Syndrome. You know those, you know those people. Uh, okay. As on a Cosby shirt.

Speaker 8:          00:41:46       You know those people who fucking, their mouths are open even when they're not talking. Can I call that P diddy syndrome? Is that what you call a bill? Yeah, that is what I call it. All right. I have a flask of time on Rpm that I'm going to be, I'm going to be taking, but I can't take it because I have a connecting flight, so I'm going to stay awake till I get to Cleveland. By the way, my flight to Cleveland is delayed, you know, they said because of wind, you know what I mean? Really rough wind, which I don't really understand. You know, it's like, isn't that how the fucking plane gets off the ground? You wait for Augusta wind and your drive into it. You know? I mean, granted, I never took a physics class. I was getting you. I don't even know how to fucking plane gets off the ground, which is one of the reasons why I have such a fear of flying pick of, I actually understood it.

Speaker 8:          00:42:37       If anybody listening to this could actually explain in layman's terms how a fucking 10 ton piece of metal with a bunch of people and various forms of physical condition condition can get off the goddamn ground, actually get out, gets off the ground. I just don't understand how it stays off the ground. Like I can get off the ground, I can take a running leap, you know, and for good 0.8 seconds, I am actually airborne, but I quickly come crashing down to the ground and roll my fucking ankle. You know, it's kind of like a boat to how the fuck does a boat that sank. You know what I mean? Dave, he just displaced the weight across the water and spill. I don't, I don't, you know, then a bunch of people get on and then it still doesn't sink. It just goes down into the water a little bit more. All right. I think we've established that Jesus Christ will on this guy is dressed, he's got some guy he looks like he should be yodeling. He has on khaki shorts that about five inches above his knee from sort of brown, low cut suede hiking shoes with ankle below the ankle. Black socks. He just needs like, I think, what do you call it? A shaft. One of those sticks with the, with the curl on it.

Speaker 8:          00:44:02       Jesus Christ. He's probably going to a whore house and this looks like he has some sort of twisted fetish. I wonder what's in that briefcase. He's drinking coffee, but he's trying to appear normal. Um, anyways, if you're a new to this page, uh, this is the Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every single week. I hype upcoming gigs. I rant about both ships and people send me questions and I tried to answer to the best of my ability. And uh, yeah, that's about it. And I gotta admit my computer is tucked away in my bag and I don't know what the fuck the questions off for the second, second week in a row. You know what it is? I have one of the, I have one of those g four Max. I met my, uh, laptop was about four years old and uh, actually have legs on it, like an old TV and a in an antenna fucking older, right.

Speaker 8:          00:45:01       And the battery Evidentaly is defective. So, uh, when I turned it on, it loses battery power about nine seconds. Actually. We'll say I have 75% battery power and then it says, um, um, two seconds. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All right, let's just get to the shit I have coming up in my career. I had stand up on the guys' choice awards, uh, for Spike TV and that is going to be a, it's going to be airing on June 22nd Sunday night on Spike TV. Uh, it's actually a pretty big award show. I was very amazed at the, a level of a celebrity that was there. It's like Harrison Ford. Cameron is Jeremy Pivot, you know what I mean? Spike TV, no offense. But I thought it was going to be like Lee majors and Micky Dolenz and me, you know, that's what I thought I was going to be.

Speaker 8:          00:45:58       And then I showed up. I was like, Holy Shit. You know that Steve Carell's? Yes, it is. Isn't that amazing? And uh, I was not sitting seated at his table. I was uh, I was seated at a table. I don't know what the fuck one guy was, a reality show director. And the rest of them were a seat filling horse. I think. Um, at least that's what it said on there. Uh, the name tag. Um, so anyways, all right, let's get to the podcast questions that, uh, that I can remember. Uh, buck with the announcement. Can you maintain she please fucking airports they make you hate. I mean, Goddamn flight is delayed. I'm actually looking, uh, first horrific thought I had at a day. I have the USA Today paper in front of me. And, uh, one of the pictures they have as of, uh, this guy looks like he's in the bowling Joey.

Speaker 8:          00:47:02       I can describe them all right? He's got a checkered shirt on with a t shirt underneath it. And, uh, he's about up to his man tits and water hanging onto a rubber raft that has some, a coastguard looking guy in it. He's basically too fat to get in the fucking boat. Um, and he's walking along and it said Midwest storm turns deadly and says a seven reported dead at the tornadoes and heavy rain pound states in the heartland. So I'm like, wow, that's, you know, at least I'm not fucking up to my man tits and a rain water, you know, it's probably eels and fucking water moccasins and shit. But then there's a part of me because there's so many goddamn people is a kind of happy, you know, wash away a few, like the traffic go down a little bit. There's not a fucking terrible thought, but I actually, I actually think that shit underneath that it says a FDA's tomato warnings grow.

Speaker 8:          00:48:06       This is all the happy news I've looked at today. Outbreak of Salmonella from raw tomatoes spreads to 16 states with up to 150 people reported ill. You know, now a lot of people would look at that like that's a bad thing. But I look at it like, look, those 150 people fucking die from eating tomatoes or at the very least get some horrific cases of diarrhea where they're not going to get into a car. Uh, you know, the roads would be a little bit clearer. You know, somebody, I guess, uh, this is the only happy news. They don't have one fucking happy thing on the front page. What do we got here? US gas average $4 and rising and then they have a cartoon picture of a hand squeezing a house with money falling out of the bottom.

Speaker 8:          00:49:01       You know what the funny thing is is if they didn't even bring this shit up, I wouldn't even know it was happening. Who would know that housing houses were fucking, uh, the values dropping? How would you even know that if they didn't bring it up? Why don't they just stopped talking about it and we're all walking around like happy idiots will continue to spend our money in malls and there won't be a recession. You know what, that might be the second dumbest thing I've ever said. You know something I really resent the way fucking pilots got to dress like they were on the love boat. You know what I mean? What is this? What is an awful fucking uniform? Now? Of course he's going to sit next to me so I can't make fun of them. You know what I mean? I hate like the, the, the, the shoulder pads with the stripes on them, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          00:49:49       If they just came back from battle as opposed to a round trip to fucking Seattle, you know what I mean? I don't know. As a shops at target, it's going to go shiny golf shirts on and those Seinfeld white sneakers, you know what? There isn't one well dressed person in Raleigh, Durham airport. I keep thinking everybody has on a Cosby show, but it's the same fucking guy. He just keeps pacing back and forth. So every time, you know, I look up, he's on my right and then I look, looked down, I looked up, he's on my left and I think it's a different guy ladies. Definitely a mother. You here with the little personal size pizza, mothering hips swinging to and fro guys a psycho. Look at him, get a backpack. Probably tried to hike the Appalachian trail. Get fucking Ricketts. Umm. All right. So, uh, yeah, the fuck was I talking about? My girlfriend wants to see Kung Fu panda. That's what I have to look forward to when I get back to la. She wants to see it. God damn cartoon about some fucking martial arts.

Speaker 8:          00:51:05       Why would a fucking pants, I need to learn Kung Fu. You know what I mean? Why would I need how to throw kicks when everybody knows that a bear naturally just has that like you. Have you ever seen like a watch discovery channel and show up? They're killing like a, uh, I don't know. Fucking Yak, whatever. What, what the fuck did they kill an elk or deer? They don't come up and grab it by the throat. All right. All messy. Like all those other creditors, they have the bears come up. They have like that, that fucking, how do you describe it? Got fucking bionic bitch slap. You know what I mean? Just Bam. Just breaks their neck. So right there, that's the grizzly bear fruit. The equivalent of the one inch punch. Will you stop yelling?

Speaker 8:          00:51:56       I think she kind of heard me on that. She's literally looking at me screaming. Can you hear a voice? She one of those fucking women. I hate women who are like 40 years old and they talk like they ate probably like guys killer wise. So while they just get sick of their voice, this guy, what a stupid fucking thing to say. You know what? This is the bills. A more on podcast today. I'm just in a bad fucking mood. Fucking plane was supposed to take off at 10 1510 45 I got some 40 year old lady with a kid's voice screaming and then I got the the pie. Oh fuck my plane's here. That, you know, it's funny, the plane that I'm flying from Raleigh Durham International Airport, Esquire is uh, actually looks like the kind of plane that Tom Cruise flies crying himself. You know, I was getting excited when I see those, cause I imagine that, you know, I'm a fucking rock star and I'm getting on it by myself as opposed to the fact that I'm getting onto it with 40 other people.

Speaker 8:          00:53:04       This is how fucked up Raleigh, North Carolina is as far as a, uh, airport goes the plane. I actually flew down here from New York City and I flew down here on a, a, a plane that had propellers. I'm not even lying to you, but it was a new plane and I was like, wow, they still going with this. You know what I mean? And it was one of those deals, there was so few people on the flight that I was sitting in like feet five a and they go, sorry, excuse me, excuse me there. And I'm like, bitch, fucking bitch. What? Excuse me, bitch. And she's like, sir, I don't need to listen. Okay. I didn't say that. That's what I was thinking. I just said, I said, uh, I said yes, but the underlying, the way I said it was like, what? And she's like, I need you to move to the back of the plane so we can redistribute the weight.

Speaker 8:          00:53:58       You know what I mean? And it's like, really? You're basically telling me if I don't go to the back of this plane, that it's gonna like what fucking tip over when we go, when we go to take off. I think that makes me feel as a customer, you know what I mean? But you know, they don't give a shit fucking hilarious. She makes me move back, but she sits up front, you know what I mean? And when that stupid little fold down stewardess chair, it's like, why don't you sit in the back? I'm a customer. Okay, I want to stay here. And this lady dressed like my fourth grade teacher. Wow. Black on black suit with Bruce Lee Kung Fu shoes and a shiny pink blouse underneath it. I don't know if she's dressed like my fourth grade teacher. When Nancy Reagan one or the other hand. She did.

Speaker 8:          00:54:57       He's dressed like a first lady. Uh, fuck me. All right. Wow. Ooh, let's get with these fucking, oh, you guys in the planes. That's why he's shirts so bright. So I assured so Brighton, his mustache is so short. That girl does not trim her Bush. You can just tell. Just tell. She's going all natural. I don't know what it is about her. That lady there has an above ground swimming pool and her hug. Yeah, look at that shoulder tattoo. I fucking nailed it. I know it. Above ground swimming pool made stuffed crust pizza guy there was good at basketball because he's in shape. He's black and he has dreadlocks right there, which means he's like the sixth man. You haven't noticed that. The black dudes with the dreadlocks, they like rebound guy. You know what I mean? There's never been a Michael Jordan style player with dreadlocks.

Speaker 8:          00:55:51       You got dreadlocks and you play in the NBA. You, uh, you get like fucking 12 rebounds a game and uh, you can knock out 12 old ladies with your fucking elbow. I don't know what. All right. I ran out of references there. Wow. Pre Pant Khakis of pretense. There you go. You're married. There's no reason to give a fuck anymore. Why would you dress like that? Look at this black guy. Hey. Go. Huh? He's still going with the extra baggy shit. Wow. That look was like 10 ago. Remember that one? Fuck guys would go to footlocker and they would find those a quadruple fucking XLT shirts even though they were five foot six. I always thought they look like a, you know, like at the, a bang of broad over there in the next morning. Now she gets up and put some money, a tee shirts. Um, all right.

Speaker 8:          00:56:45       I'm just making fun of people. Not because I'm like, well, I am kind of a concept, but I'm just making fun of me because I don't have my podcast questions in front of me. So, uh, why don't we hide some upcoming gigs and lady looks like Robert Plant from behind. Oh, it's the same fucking lady. She's got all kinds of lists going on. What happened to Robert Plant? Man, Jesus Christ, that kind of a great write up to age 46 and all of a sudden now he looks like he should be in like a children's book. Like, like one of those, uh, like a troll. I don't know. What about a fairy tale? That's what it looks like. Robert Plant looks like. He looks like he's in a fairytale. You know what I mean? Is this is, this is a cruel thing about life is even if you stay in shape, life is still going to make you look awful because for some reason, even if you stay at your high school, wait, you fucking head never stops growing. So if you don't get a little out of shape, if you look fucking ridiculous, you look like a, I just lost my train of thought. The finest stuff taking this time on a PM.

Speaker 8:          00:57:54       No, you're not. You look like if you've seen that fucking guy. Uh, he's like 45 years old and he shredded, I might've talked about this last week again with the Mike Epps had um, you know, the guy late, late at night, he does all the physical fitness shit. He's like 46 year old years old and he shredded, but for some reason he still looks weird and it's his head because his head, I know it's not the head, it's your fucking knows it's your ears or something like that. Something about your head. It just keeps getting bigger. Like classic example is Ted Kennedy. Okay. Ted Kennedy has been in the news lately, has got a fucking brain tumor or something. Right. If you will get that guy's head in the sixties Brandon, all those Kennedy's had big heads. You know what I mean? It's one of the reasons why two of them got, got, got assassinated. It's like there was no way to miss.

Speaker 8:          00:58:57       That's just fucking me. It really is. But I got to tell you something, man. I saw Ted Kennedy, I shook his hand one time and his head is as big as the seat that I'm sitting and he has been the biggest fucking head I've ever like. It wasn't, it was, I believe I was just staring at it. I couldn't fuck and I got a big hit, but this guy's fucking hap was pretty huge. And uh, you probably want to, how did I meet him? I actually, uh, I fucking shook his hand and Bill Clinton's hand, the long fucking story. Just remind me, I'll tell it to you next week. Let's stay on track you with how big his fucking head is. I just kept looking. I just could not believe the size of like, I just want it to like, ah, I wish there was a way to just like hold his head just to see how much it weighed.

Speaker 8:          00:59:48       You know, I, I'm not even joking. I bet his head ways, like, like 27 pounds, 27 fucking pounds. When you think about that, you know who out there lift weights, you know that when you're doing your warmup set and he grabbed like, yeah, well let's, let's go with 35 to 35 pound plates. You know, plan you can do with one hand. You know what they should have. They should have like part of the strong man competition. Instead of those little kettle balls there, they should have like little Kennedy hats and each one of them gets a, it's a stupid idea, you know, that's why I don't have a fucking show on TV. All right, let, let's, let's get to skip the hype in the upcoming gigs. Um, first of all, I just was in Raleigh, North Carolina at a good night's comedy club. I want to thank everybody who came out to the shows.

Speaker 8:          01:00:40       I had a great time and, uh, I got drunk every night down at the bar downstairs and I watch myself x go up two games to none and a, I'm not gonna lie to you. I didn't know watch one selfie game all year. I fucking hate pro hoop fro who is the worst. Like, it's just too goddamn long. You Watch college basketball, it's exciting. The crowd's into it and it's over. It seems like it's over in an hour pro hoop with, with the fucking files and the timeouts. And I mean that final five minutes, final five minutes, it takes like 45 minutes to play to the point. You don't even give a shit anymore. But I'm a little test to Phil Jackson for bitching about the files. You know what I mean? Fucking baby. I can tell you right now, if you gamble, would definitely bet on the Lakers.

Speaker 8:          01:01:32       Definitely done on the Lakers on game three because they are going to call 9,000 files on the fucking Celtics because Phil Jackson's a fucking baby. You know what I mean? Give me a goddamn break. Well, what about that guy in the Lakers who stop dribbling at half court, ran the west rest of the way and dunk the ball and they didn't call traveling. What about that? Okay, you're getting calls too. I don't want to hear it. Um, and also that two, three, two playoff system is bullshit. You know what I mean? You give home court advantage to the fucking visitor through game five. They keep saying the Celtics have home court. They don't. The next three games are in la. We get to spend a fucking weak out there, man. Have you maintain chain please with the person who wears their current next to the deal jail please report to the fucking front office.

Speaker 8:          01:02:25       All right. I'm starting to talk way too loud with Tourette's. Um, I dunno man. I thought the Lakers were going to beat us and like six games. I thought they were going to crush us. I'm really impressed. Ray Allen keeps hitting his shots. Uh, we're just going to have to weather the storm. I think Colby is going to get 30, 40 every game and if we can just somehow weather that storm, uh, I dunno. I still think it's going seven games and uh, I dunno, it's gun. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. I just don't watch ESPN anymore. Fucking jackets. So overhype everything. Look at this lady, Jesus Christ. She's never committed a crime in their life and gay. My taxis, I go to church every week. I have a little tote bag like, hey, and I packed the exact perfect amount of clothes.

Speaker 8:          01:03:20       I don't swallow. I'm a man. I'm getting crude on these podcasts. I got to stop with this. Okay. All right, well that was a good 25 minutes. There you go.

I think he's, I think he's a fucking genius. So anyways, um, I go, I go to the airport and I'm taking the red eye, taking this 10 55 flight, nine fucking stop. Cause that's how I do it.

Speaker 11:         01:07:25       All right.

Speaker 10:         01:07:27       I'm on a good plane. Why would I want to get off it and switch and roll the dice and get on another one? You know, let's just fucking get there. When, when I drive up to San Francisco, I don't pull over and fucking, uh, Burbank and then get hit new, another cup. We get it bill. All right.

Speaker 11:         01:07:45       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:07:46       So I get on the fucking plane, right? I use my miles, bumped myself up like a fancy person, you know, maybe, maybe I invented that cheesecake factory. People are thinking and then they see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no, he didn't vent the cheesecake factory. Um, and I go to go to sit down on my seat and I go to set my bag down. I was going to set it down right in front of me. And the nice fellow sit next to me, he goes, why don't you stick it in the middle of this room? And he moved his bag out of the way. I'm like, all right, this guy's a solid dude or whatever. And then all of a sudden the waitress by a stewardess, whatever, she comes by, um, flight attendant, whatever the fuck you supposed to call him, she comes up and she's, uh, can I get you [inaudible] to Drake?

Speaker 10:         01:08:24       And I was like, yeah, can I get out? Let me get a water please. Ice or no ice. What? However you make it. Stop acting like it's a fucking Martini. It's war, right? Just give me a water with ice. Thank you. Um, and the, the guy next to me, he orders the doers. Neat. No Irish, no nothing. Just put it in there. So they bring our drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty. So I start sucking mind down and he just throws his back. Like, it's nothing like fucking John Wayne right before he's going to turn around and beat up three guys, three mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right? So, um, I'm just sitting there and everybody's getting on the flight, you know, when I'm looking around at the passengers, you know, fucking doing whatever I'm doing and all of a sudden the guy next to me, Mr Doers, goes to me, uh, he goes, excuse me? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I looked at him, I was like, what? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I go, no, no, I'm not. And he goes, he goes, all right, but you know, it's, he goes, it's okay. You know, if it's okay to tell me if you're afraid to fly,

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:09:40       And it's immediately getting weird. And I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly. And, and I'm thinking in my head, wait, is he afraid to fly? And that's why he's drinking the way he just drank. And now he's hoping that I'm going to be afraid to fly. So he, you know, he just wants to open up. That's what I'm thinking. And I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

Speaker 10:         01:10:03       And he won't leave it alone. He goes, all right, cause you know, you're, you're, you're fidgeting, you're looking around at other passengers. And I'm sitting there looking at it like, is this guy fucking serious? And I go, no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly. So now I'm like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking scaffold rest of flight. This guy's weird, man. It's like 30, just get painted pictures like 32 year old. Why are in shape? But like, why are we white? Dude, he's got a skully cap on with fucking glasses. Um, you know, and uh, he goes, uh, like there's like a minute of silence and people still getting on the plane. And then he goes, hey, sorry about that. So we, we just, we just got off on the wrong foot. He's like, my name's so and so. He goes, what's your name?

Speaker 10:         01:10:54       And then I'm thinking in my head like, what's my name? My name's frank. I wanted to give them like a f by just some reason I just wanted it's bill. And he goes, oh, hey, bill. And he goes, nice to meet you. So we shake hands and I'm just looking at, I don't have any poker face. I'm looking at the guy like, what the fuck is your problem? I'm not even trying to, not my trying to be pleasant. I'm already done with this guy. So then the guy goes, oh hey bill. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right? Like he's fucking interrogating me and I, I'm like, is this guy fucking serious? And I start doing the math in my head going, when is this guy like an air marshal? It's something. And I'm like, no, he's not. He's fucking slamming bows over here. Fuck this guy. So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I don't have to answer your questions. Let's sit. And I just looked straight forward. He goes, okay, now I'm concerned. Okay, I am concerned. And I'm looking at him like concerned about what he goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you, you have issues with other passengers and blah blah, blah, blah. He sucks Peyton like, like this. Like he's been, I don't know what the fuck, like psychologically breaking me down. All right, so now at this, by this point, they've closed the fucking the door to the fields collage and we're starting to taxi.

Speaker 10:         01:12:17       And I just finally looked at the guy, uh, ag and I go, I go, you know, I came up with the FY one point. I literally stick my hand out cause he kept saying I was nervous and I stick my hand right in front of his face and I hold it level. Oh, that's what I did the first time. Yeah. I hold it level. I'll go, I'm not nervous. And he goes, well, anybody can do that. And that's when I was like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry. Fuck this story up there. And then he, then he came back, got my name, now he's going, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I find looking at him, I say, listen pal, I'm drinking waters. You're drinking doers. Okay, there's no issue over here. And then he goes, it wasn't doers. What she gave me wasn't doers really.

Speaker 10:         01:12:58       What was it? Some sort of spy juice, you fucking jerk off this point. I want to punch him right through his fucking stupid wirey glasses, right? So he's going like, you look around hostels and I said something that just ticked him off. I was just, yeah, that dude. I go, I don't have to answer your questions. All right, leave me alone. And then he goes, uh, he goes to, he goes, he starts going like, okay, now I am really concerned right now. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I just looked at him, you know, when I start doing, I start doing like this Ryan Gosling, you know that little smirk that fucking Mona Lisa smile he has is he smirks his way through all this fucking movies. I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling. Now I'm not talking to this guy and I just keep looking at him and I gave him that little half of smirk and I just shake my head.

Speaker 10:         01:13:43       That's my game now. That's, this is Mike. It's like if you're going to be a Dick Right now with your fucking delusional authority, right? That you're going to like, we're in fucking Guantanamo and you're gonna waterboard me, Huh? There's no water, there's no board. Go Fuck Yourself. Here's my smart and I'm just going to shake my head at you like you're a fucking pathetic human being. This is what I'm doing, right? And this is the funny thing. I'm such a Dick. All they have to say to the guys, I'm a comedian, I'm going to do a sold out show there and that would make them back off, but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this guy. I want to see what this is going. So now he's all fucking amped up and he starts droppingF , you know she's saying the f word. He sitting there going funeral. He goes, if you don't fucking answer my question right fucking now I'm going to hit that call button was sitting there, taxi and down a fucking getting in line.

Speaker 10:         01:14:30       I'm going to fucking hit this fucking button if you blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa smile going to shake in my head like you are a fucking retard, right? So now he sees saying the f word so much. The lady who's sitting in front of me diagonally in front, right in front of him, turns around and looks at us, and now my heart's racing. I'm like, where's this going? This is going to be great. I am a hundred percent fucking innocent. This guy's drunk and I think he's going to hit that button. Oh, I got a feeling he's going to hit that button. What's going to happen? Right? I want to see what the pilot looks like. Let's see what the fuck this is going. Right? So he goes, if you don't fuck you, he starts, he starts bringing his heading up to the button going, I'm going to hit that button.

Speaker 10:         01:15:10       You don't think I'll fucking do it. I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there smirking and I'm thinking in my head, go ahead and hit the fucking button. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Right? So finally, now he wants to hit the button and he can't fucking find it, and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't find it either. I was looking up there, I half wanted to hit it myself. Then he finally, he finally finds it and he hits it right? And now I'm just like, Holy Shit, what's going to happen? And he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh, you want to fucking play this game? How you want to fucking play this game? And I'm surprised. I mean it took like fucking like 30 seconds before a flight attendant, the one who gave him the booze, whichever gently wasn't boozed comes over.

Speaker 10:         01:15:50       And at this point we're like doing that shit where we're behind the plane, we're almost ready to take off, like we're pulling up and then stop and pull it up. Then stopping as planes are taking off. So she goes, yeah, what's the problem over here? And he goes, ah, I'm not comfortable to fly with this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting, he's looking around at other fucking people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He's doing all this thing right. And then the stewardess looks at me and I'm just sitting there and fucking my little smart, just shaking my head. And I just looking at this dude just shaking my head like, this guy's out of his fucking mind. I don't say a word. And this guy goes on and on and on about his fucking psycho babble about how I'm the security risk. So she goes to, so she goes, okay.

Speaker 10:         01:16:29       Um, any other passengers? Have you noticed anything? She talked to everybody first class at this, is anybody notice anything odd about this guy? And The lady who was sitting right in front of the dude diagonally from me turns around, she goes, yeah, I've been listening to this guy brewery, right? Berating this other passenger. She's on my side and I haven't said a fucking word. This is great. And I'm just sitting there smirking. Then they'll let the students look to me and I shrugged my shoulders like, I don't know what to tell you. So finally she said, sir, did you have anything to add to this? And I just said, look, I'm just a guy trying to go to Indianapolis. This guy over here. He started slamming his doors. I kind of felt like a rat when I said that. I go slamming his doors. Next thing you know, he's dropping the F bomb to me.

Speaker 10:         01:17:20       Then I'm thinking, oh fuck. I just said bomb. Right? Fortunately nothing happened. So now another fucking the male stewardess comes over right now. He's going like, what's going on? And the captain of the fucking now at this point we pulled over in the plane has stopped. Do you want a 50 people trying to get to Indianapolis and jerk off over here? Can't hold his fucking alcohol. Who just watched a person of interest every, every, I guess evidently I have no fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped, is fucking jerk off, has stopped the plane interrogating a Goddamn comedian. Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and like he works for the CIA, right? So now we're just sitting in the captain is up front in the plane like saying to the stewards is going basically relaying, do I really have to fucking come back there? This is the last flight of the night. Is there really a God damn problem. And that was the vibe when they finally said to the dose, sit next to me, are you going to be okay to fly with him? And at that point it appeased his fucking ego that he was somehow in control. And he goes like, you know what? Okay, it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

Speaker 11:         01:18:37       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:18:37       So they go, okay. So now the plane's going again and now we're now we fucking come around and he's sitting there fucking, he's in my ear. And at this point I am lab like to fucking laugh. You hear me doing the podcast? That's what I'm doing. And he's sitting there going, I, he goes, you don't, I'm glad. I'm glad you, I hope you fucking do. I hope you fucking try something. I'll be fucking try something one up there. I really hope you fucking try something. And I'm just fucking like God. Boston laughing, shaking me like, what are you going to fucking do to me? What are you going to do to me? How are you gonna Punch me in the face? You fucking wirey jackass, but your fucking glasses on, you know, that's a federal offense. You're going to go to jail if you do that or something.

Speaker 10:         01:19:19       I Dunno what, right. So I'm just sitting there fucking laughing at the guy going, I actually, at one point I put my fucking little eye pillow thing on. Do you know, like I'm going to sleep. Oh, I had that out too in the store. This was talking to me. I was like putting it on is this total mind fuck. Like I don't know what this guy is. I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis. I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got, I got my fucking eye thing on, right as he's sitting there threatening me. Just I was going with total passive aggressive. It's like, dude, I'm so not concerned with you. I'm literally putting a blindfold on. All right, so this fucking guy, like he starts going, he goes, yeah. He goes, you think you're fucking one this dude, he fucking won this. He goes, Mike, you know my dad is my dad.

Speaker 10:         01:20:03       He started saying his dads, some major CEO in Indianapolis. Doesn't sound like a fucking made story. I swear to God, this is all true. He Goes, Mike, my dad is a major CEO in Indianapolis and I'll have you fucking arrested. And The lady turns around again, I'll have you fucking arrested the second we get on the ground, I'm thinking like, for what? For what? Sitting here, you fucking loser. Learn how to hold your alcohol. Right. And he starts describing the view that I'm going to have when I go to jail, like some fucking law and order episode. Oh you're gonna love it. You'd be able to see Lucas oil field and bad, the bad blah blah. And I'm just sitting here cracking up laughing and then there's this pause, right? And I'm thinking finally he finally shut the fuck up. It's like a three, four minute pause. He finally just gave up because I wasn't giving them anything. I was just laughing and shaking my head. I was being a dick to them. I was cause I was enjoying it. And then there was like a three minute pause and then all of a sudden he just goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill.

Speaker 12:         01:21:03       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:21:07       So we're like 20 minutes into the flight and am I going to be honest, he's, my adrenaline was so going during all of that because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, but I thought we were literally going to go back and there was going to be fucking cops there. And they'd be like, if, if, if, if the fucking stewardess or the pilot asked me who I am and where I'm going, I'm going to tell them I respect your authority. You're just some, Gee, I don't, you don't have any fucking authority. I don't have to answer your questions. It was pro was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with another human being. Like when somebody thinks that they have power and you know, they don't, and all they can do is try just keep bluffing and raising their voice and start cursing at you.

Speaker 10:         01:21:56       And if you just start laughing at them, the look on their face is fucking priceless. So the last thing he said, he said, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right. And I fucking started howling, just fucking holding my stomach, shaking my head and with my fucking eye pillow thing on right. And I know I'm going to get a ton of shit that I wear one of those eye, they're fucking underrated. Get the one at Brookstone where it's literally a pillow. I'm telling you, you can fall asleep 12 noon facing the sun. It's awesome. So anyways, like after he, he asked me what, what, you know where you're going bill? You're like, there was like a 10 minute, like probably 10 minutes had gone by and I can't fucking sleep because it's so fun. And to me I can't wait to tell the story to every comic. I know. I can't wait to try it on stage to see if it's funny or whatever. Uh, so finally I just like got fuck it. Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I bring up my eye pillow and I like, I got to look at the guy cause I know he's fucking staring at me waiting for me to do something right. So I lifted up, I get my Mona Lisa smile going and I look over at the guy and dude he is fucking passed out.

Speaker 10:         01:23:14       He looked like he got shot. He was sitting there like his head was just hanging straight down and anytime the plane move like his head was Amy, he little at you got knocked out and for the rest of the fucking flight all fucking uh oh. What's Matt Damon's character? Jack Ryan. Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here is just, you know the sky marshal, the fucking bows bag and God knows what else he was on. He was just completely out passed out for the rest of the fucking flight. And this is why I'm want to Dick. I am. I was having so much fun with this guy. I start, I can't sleep. So I start slamming waters because I want to have to get up and take a piss. Just to see if this guy's going to freak out because this security risk is getting up. And there's, the joke was on me, he never regained consciousness and then I really had to take a Piss, but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

Speaker 10:         01:24:10       I was holding it because I wanted to make sure he was awake when I got up, cause that was going to give him a little smirk and then I was going to get out to sea at the call button again. Um, but he didn't, he didn't wake up till we hit the ground. And um, yeah. And it's funny. Then he woke up and it was like four hours later, so now he'd kind of slept off, whatever the fuck this guy was on. And I'm sitting there SmartQ and wait for the guy who start talking and he won't look at me and I, and I think at that point he kind of fucking realizes that maybe he got a little, uh, a little extra little too patriotic. So we stop. We stopped at the gate and everything and we're going to get up. So I grabbed my shit.

Speaker 10:         01:24:53       I get up and I'm just kinda looking at him and he won't look at me. And then the lady who was sitting in front of me, I had this big smile on her face. She goes, how are you? She goes, how are you doing? I don't want good. I go, there I go. That was an interesting one. And I said it really loud. So the guy heard and didn't say anything and to, this is what he did to try to save face. His pillow was kind of stuck behind this kind of stuck behind his shoulder and like a weird place. So he was frustrated with it. So he ripped it out from behind him and kind of threw it down on the floor. Went like, tried to do some caveman grunt to try to still have some sort of, yeah. Uh, I don't know what, so, so that was my flight to Indianapolis people. Um, you don't want how, how far into the fucking podcast are we? That was a long, that was a long fucking story.
