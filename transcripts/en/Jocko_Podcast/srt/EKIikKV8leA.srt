1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,850
This is Jocko podcast number
one 85 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,670
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,380
You get one shot

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,553
and that's it.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,960
And in the end you're
going into the ground.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,263
Okay.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,170
Regardless of what you believe the
afterlife consists of or what it doesn't

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,150
consist of as far as what you
get to hold on to once you leave.

9
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,100
Here is nothing.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,570
And I implore people all the time,

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,783
okay.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
To make it count.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,170
Cause this is it. This is the finals.

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,620
There are no re dues.

15
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,780
You can't hit the rewind
button. And even worse,

16
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,370
you can't even hit the pause button.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,800
There's no way you can stop
the clock from ticking.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,440
Okay?

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,870
No possible way the countdown is on

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,130
and the days are finite.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,430
Do you only get so many?

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,503
Okay.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,513
And then it's over.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,950
So until them make them count,

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,040
make all of them count.

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,440
And on the podcast today, I
have a guest, a fellow frogman,

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,490
whom to the best of my knowledge is
doing his best to make his days count.

28
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,280
His name is Mitch Aggie, R
and we just met each other.

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,130
But like I said, he's a frogman. He
likes Jujitsu. He likes to get after it.

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,870
So my guess is we should have some
things to talk about. So Mitch,

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,220
welcome to the podcast. Thanks for
having me. Good. Good to meet you. Yeah.

32
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:30,390
Good to meet you as well. 10 minutes
ago. Yup. Picked you up at the airport.

33
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,130
I think we are linked up some
way on social media. Correct.

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,080
And you are in the EO doing some
training and so here you are. Cool.

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,173
Where'd you grow up?

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,810
I grew up in Virginia Beach and then uh,

37
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,210
was there till about 11,

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,960
then moved to Maryland
and uh, live with my dad.

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,670
Was there till about 16 and
drew up in Virginia Beach.

40
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:00,400
Parents in the military. Yup. My
Mom and dad were both in the navy,

41
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,940
both in the Noun. That's
right. Shaq. And uh,

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
my mom was an o s and my dad was a
combat camera man with a Dev group.

43
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,170
Okay. Right on. And, and so then you
were there until you said you were 11?

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,180
Yeah, it was in no Virginia
Beach till I was 11.

45
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:22,800
They were divorced and my dad had gotten
out of the navy and was living up in

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,490
Maryland working at the
Aberdeen proving ground. Okay.

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,460
And doing high speed photography
there and, uh, you know,

48
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:34,461
filming tank rounds and all kinds of
cool explosives and stuff like that.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,860
And he had like a wicked cool job he had
before. It was cool. Wicked cool. Jack.

50
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,360
And, uh, so I went up there and lived
with him for awhile and then, uh,

51
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,100
around 16, um, moved
up to Ohio. My mom had,

52
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,960
uh, moved up to Ohio. My stepdad
was also in the navy and, um,

53
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,190
he had gotten out and they'd started a
business up in Ohio and I went and lived

54
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:03,110
with her up there and, uh,
finished out high school in Ohio.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,320
Um, 10th or, yeah, 10, 11,

56
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:10,610
12th grade and then joined the
navy from there. What, what uh,

57
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:14,750
what was high school like? What sports
were you playing? I was playing football,

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,280
basketball, Lacrosse, and
uh, yeah, that was it.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,350
Were you good? Were you
a good athlete? I was a,

60
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,520
a good athlete and I was
also into, uh, some, uh,

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,060
sports that weren't at
our school. I was on, uh,

62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,270
arm wrestling team or run
on Dad Dodge ball team,

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,020
like a traveling dodgeball team,
traveling dodge ball team. It was,

64
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,790
it was by far my favorite. Wow. Like how,

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,320
how many games would you play
in dodgeball in a day? No,

66
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,150
in like a season. What's the season?
The dodge ball season? Well, you know,

67
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,850
there's practice obviously and
uh, if you'd take it serious,

68
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:59,600
like we did a, we, we practice like
three times a week and then we, we would,

69
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,640
uh, travel on the weekends for
tournaments. What balls do you use?

70
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,250
Uh, we would some, some
leagues are different. Um,

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,370
but mainly it's those kick balls
and you see red rubber ones.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,270
Yeah. How many people are on the
team, each side? Um, there was,

73
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,410
it was like six or seven
people per team or,

74
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,110
and then we had like a
couple substitutes, you know,

75
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,450
in case there was injuries, injuries,
you know, just like any other sport, man,

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,220
you had your first string
starters and then you,

77
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,660
but you didn't wrestle. I
did not wrestle. I didn't,

78
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,810
you didn't restaurant that light it
into run cross country. I didn't swim.

79
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:44,960
I didn't do anything in
high school that would, uh,

80
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,330
be useful in my ongoing
adventures. Well, football,

81
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,370
basketball, I mean, you're
becoming an athlete.

82
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,960
You're coordinating your treasure. Like
just in general, I would say, well,

83
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,920
I would say that competition
mindset, you know, um,

84
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,480
that and just, yeah, being
an athlete overall, uh,

85
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:10,400
that was always something that was
just ingrained in me. You know,

86
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:14,150
my, both my mom and dad,
they were really competitive,

87
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:18,710
like always had us in sports growing
up, my brother and I, and um,

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,260
you know, I always loved the competition
side of things, you know, and I,

89
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,920
I actually like hate working out
still to this day. Like, I just,

90
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,660
I don't really enjoy it,

91
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:34,661
but if there's some sort of comp
competition involved in it or you know,

92
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,450
competitiveness, that's, that's
what I really like. True work.

93
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,750
So you get done with high school year
and you, what makes you join the navy?

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,630
Um, honestly I was, I was just bored. Uh,

95
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,610
I was living in Ohio and it
sucked there and, uh, the,

96
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,630
I there was just nothing
there that I wanted.

97
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,410
How long after you graduated high school
did you join the navy? A couple months.

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,270
Did you,

99
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,590
did you go in the dye fair program to be
in the teams or did you just want to be

100
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,520
in just in the navy?

101
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,030
No, I originally, um, I mean, it, it,

102
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,710
it wasn't planned out at all. Uh, I
was, I was working three different jobs.

103
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,350
Uh, I was a, uh, um, a Roofer,
which I really, really loved.

104
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,880
That was, that was a great
job. And, um, I worked at my,

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,530
my parents, like they owned a deli
slash convenience store kind of thing.

106
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,450
I worked there and I was, um,

107
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,400
a lifeguard at Kalahari and I,
and I was a surf instructor.

108
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,860
And you said Kalahari. It's an India.

109
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,780
It's the world's largest indoor water
park. And they have waves there. Yeah.

110
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,380
They have a flow rider, like a
couple flow rider machines. Oh,

111
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:50,530
the thing that you've seen
[inaudible] plastic. Yeah, yeah, Yup.

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,320
Creates an artificial
wave. So I would, uh,

113
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,570
I was on the competition team and I
would like give people lessons on how to

114
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,823
right that thing.

115
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,100
So between that and dodge ball,
we were kind of dialed in first.

116
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,150
First of action. That's a
good setup. So you recommend,

117
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,370
if someone wants to get a
career special operations,

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,440
they focus on dodge ball and
arm wrestling and surfing.

119
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,140
Awesome formula for success.
Formula for success. And so you're,

120
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,920
you're, you're doing
these jobs and you're,

121
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,950
you're not having a good
time with yeah, I ever,

122
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,000
oh, I was, you know, I'm not
a very good, uh, uh, studious,

123
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,290
uh, student in high school. Um, you know,

124
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,490
high school is more of like
a socialization for me. Like,

125
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,990
I really enjoyed going there to
socialize. I really enjoyed, you know,

126
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,410
making friends and I liked sports and, uh,

127
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,910
and I was always, I always loved
working and making money, you know,

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,600
like school is just kind of a, in
the way I had kind of, you know,

129
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:05,601
at the time I just had zero interest
in any sort of classwork whatsoever.

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,200
And, um, I don't even understand how I,

131
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
somehow I had graduated and, um, then,

132
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,000
you know, I was like, yeah, I'm
definitely gonna do something in life.

133
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,960
I don't know what I'm, I'm assuming
it'll be good though, you know,

134
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,980
I just don't know what it is. And, and
my teachers were kind of in that same,

135
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,070
uh, mindset. They're, you know, half
of them were just like, man, they're,

136
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,130
you're hopeless. Like there's, you're
just going to work at Burger King,

137
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:40,890
whatever. And then the other
half were just like, yeah,

138
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,490
you're going to do something great. It's
definitely not going to be in school,

139
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,850
you know, who knows what it is. And
I was just kind of in that, you know,

140
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,890
glass half full. Uh, I was
thinking the same thing. And, uh,

141
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,720
I didn't know what it was.
Honestly, like I said,

142
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,980
I was roofing and I
really loved, uh, roofing,

143
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,690
but you know, I was making
minimal money and, um,

144
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,550
I knew that that wasn't going
to be it. So I was in the area.

145
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:15,930
I knew that nothing around the
area interested me, you know,

146
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,310
there was nothing that I wanted to
pursue around there. I was young,

147
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,430
I was 18, you know, my,

148
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,020
my mom and dad were both and my
stepdad where we're all in the navy at,

149
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,930
at points in their life. And you know,

150
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,930
had talked about the
benefits of the military.

151
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:37,980
My Dad was always trying to get me to
go in the military and I just wasn't

152
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:41,910
interested at all. And um, yeah,

153
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,950
that was never really even a
consideration until quite literally,

154
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,240
like I was just bored.

155
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,410
And the recruiter happened to walk
in and catch me and it was like, Hey,

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,330
you want to join the navy? And I was
like, sure, why not? And uh, and uh,

157
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,070
I was, at first I was going to
do, um, mastered arms. Like,

158
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,660
I was like, Oh, you know, I've always,

159
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,740
I've always had like a kind
of respect for police. Um,

160
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,990
my grandfather was a police officer,

161
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:14,991
my uncle's still a police officer and
that was something that I felt like,

162
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,830
you know, it was a courageous
job and, and uh, a helpful,

163
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,120
useful one or whatever, you
know? And I figured that I could,

164
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,010
I've always been real protective as well,

165
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:30,330
so like I figured that job would
kind of maybe be fitting for me.

166
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,510
Um, so he, he had asked me, you know,
hey, yeah, you want to join the navy?

167
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:40,710
And I was like, okay. Then I thought
I'll, I'll go that route. And a,

168
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:43,320
he was like, well, you look like
you're in good shape, do you want to,

169
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,940
you want to be a seal? And I was
like, ah, this, there's a sneaky guys.

170
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:52,200
You know, the, the, the only
thing I knew about seals was, uh,

171
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,370
from that, where the,

172
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,770
where the there on the
beach or it's a scene on,

173
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,240
it's on the beach and the clouds
roll over the moon and then they,

174
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,570
they pass and there's footprints. Yeah.

175
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,570
And so that's all I knew about
navy seals and, and I was like, oh,

176
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,720
this guy's [inaudible] this was 2007.

177
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,690
So you're watching the wars are
going on all through high school.

178
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,880
You're seeing all that stuff take place.

179
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,810
Nine 11 happened when I
was in seventh grade. Yeah.

180
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,550
You were probably boots on ground or
something on there. Well, I mean I was,

181
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,110
I was um,

182
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,770
yeah I had been in for like 11 years at
that point because I joined in 90 so I

183
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:38,970
was born in 89. Yeah. So I'm,

184
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,650
I'm a little bit older
than you are apparently.

185
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,900
Yeah. So did you not,
did you realize like, um,

186
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,940
so this was your first kind of connection
because for me, when I was growing up,

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,270
like every time some kind
of war event happened,

188
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I was all bummed out that I wasn't there
cause I was too young and that's just

189
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:07,070
the way I was. I was always thinking about
that. I was always into the military.

190
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,510
But you were kind of like not,

191
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,540
I was the total opposite. Like I wanted
nothing to do with, with the military.

192
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,330
I wanted nothing to do with like
I'd never even thought about it. Um,

193
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,630
my dad was just, you know,

194
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,470
he was in and he was a combat cameraman
with Dev groups. Obviously he was,

195
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,070
you know, really involved
with, with it. And uh,

196
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,610
anytime he would try and talk to me about,
I'm just like, I'm not interested in,

197
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,930
I'm not gonna join the fucking
military. What flipped the switch?

198
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,360
She was mega boredom. Yeah.
Just, I just, you know,

199
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,550
I was like, well worst case
scenario, I know. I don't know.

200
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,510
I'm in for, in the navy for four years.
I'll go see the world a little bit.

201
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,290
I'll, you know,

202
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,290
gain some life experience and worst case
I get out and I'm fucking 22 like who

203
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,460
cares? I'm not going to college. I
know that, you know, high school was,

204
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,830
I barely made it through that and just
not, cause I'm stupid just cause I just,

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,410
man wasn't your seeing Oh my God,

206
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,820
I'd rather do hell week 10 times in
a row than write an essay, you know?

207
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,030
So you get in the navy
and do you prepare at all?

208
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,500
Like four?

209
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,840
I had never run like further than
a mile and like I all my sprint,

210
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,620
all my sports stuff was all sprinting.
I mean those dodge balls are only,

211
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,160
you know, dodge ball courts are small.
Yeah, they're cool. They're short.

212
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,450
So it was just, I was always
a really fast sprinter and uh,

213
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,610
that was kind of all I really cared
about. I, I didn't even, I was also,

214
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,120
I also like now looking back how stupid
I was and just how dumb you are at 18

215
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,150
like you think you really like know
when you're 18 you really like,

216
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,130
you're like man, you know, you look back
at when you're 10 and are like, man,

217
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,540
I know so much now.

218
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,710
I just compared to my seven year old self
compared to compared to my eight year

219
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,400
old self. Like I didn't even know what
I was doing. Now I'm a, I'm a man,

220
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,940
you know, I know what life's
about. But at that point,

221
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:15,080
obviously now I'm 30 looking back at
that, I'm just like, man, you're so dumb.

222
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,970
But I really was and I'm just really
inexperienced with life. I had never,

223
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,110
like I said, run really
further than a mile. Um,

224
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,840
I didn't even understand like that
people did that I had heard about like

225
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:31,670
marathons and stuff.
But, um, I remember when,

226
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,163
you know, when,

227
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,970
when I had heard that I had to run
like a mile and a half for the pst,

228
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,200
I was like, what in the
fuck? Like why Wa and then,

229
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,280
and then like I told my dad
that I signed up for the,

230
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,310
the seal teams and I was like, yeah, I'm
going to be a seal. And he's just like,

231
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,250
you have no idea what
you just signed up for.

232
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,630
I didn't even know I had to
go to buds. And then, uh,

233
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,920
so he, he, I was just like,
yeah, I'm going to be a seal.

234
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,660
What's wrong with that? And He, uh,
he bought me the, the two, three,

235
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:09,770
four documentary and we
sat down and watched that.

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,920
And I remember like, just watching the,

237
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,450
the four mile timed run. And
I was just thinking like,

238
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,350
is that even possible? Like,
do people really do that?

239
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,220
And I was just thinking like,
Jesus Christ, like this is,

240
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to have to do all
of this shit. Oh my God,

241
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,940
I better start running. I'm
about to start training.

242
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,260
So did you start running and training?
Yeah, I mean I went out and uh,

243
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,600
you know, actually back up before
I even saw that the first, um,

244
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,530
the first introduction I had to buds was,

245
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,750
or navy seals in general once I signed
the, like a signed up and I was like,

246
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,600
all right, I'm going to be a navy
seal. I better do some research.

247
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,870
So went out and got navy seals with
Charlie Sheen and I watched that and that

248
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:02,630
was my very first introduction
to what navy seals were.

249
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,940
And I was just like, man, it looks
pretty intense. Pretty cool though.

250
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,440
And uh, you know, in the
scene, the scene in that movie,

251
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,030
they say it's buds,

252
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,820
but it's obviously not cause it's
like in the woods and they're like,

253
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,100
there's like grenades
going off and they're like,

254
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,320
they're like a army crawling under
barbed wire. And he's like, this is buds.

255
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:28,070
You know, like it was just like
this crazy scene or whatever.

256
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,670
And I was just thinking like,
damn, I gotta go through all that.

257
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,573
All right and better.

258
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,500
So I went out and bought some fucking
Cammo pants and bought some boots,

259
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,540
like just leather boots and
I'm there and I went for a run,

260
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,390
uh, down my street. And I remember it
was like a mile or I did, I was like,

261
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:51,410
I have to run a mile and a half, so
I'm going to see how this goes. And I,

262
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:54,060
and I went and got those
pants and got suited up

263
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,560
and I was just thinking like, Oh
man, this is going to be hard. But,

264
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,940
and then, then, then my dad got the,
uh, the two, three, four documentary in,

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,890
and then that was just like, oh, okay.

266
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,710
I really just have no fucking
idea when I just signed up for.

267
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,760
And I was just thinking like,
damn, that looks really hard.

268
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,030
But I already told everyone
that I was going to do this.

269
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,730
And I was just kind of that, you know,

270
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,110
that's one good thing about being 18
and you're just young and dumb and

271
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:30,110
stubborn. And you know,
luckily I used the, the,

272
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,550
the good of that to get through I guess.
So you get, I was gonna say, you know,

273
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,770
my, my, my, my, a dive motivator
was Mike Nos. Do you know him?

274
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, I know who it is. I
don't know personally. Um,

275
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,960
well he's an old Vietnam
frogman a plank owner at,

276
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,770
at a damn neck. And he,

277
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,380
he came in and he's a tall guy and
he walks with like a kind of a,

278
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:01,260
a big limp cause he had like a hip
replacement. He's still swims like a fish.

279
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,573
And uh,

280
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,580
he actually taught me how to do the
sidestroke the day before my pst.

281
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,970
So it was like pretty steep learning.

282
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,660
Yeah, that's, that is,

283
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,050
I always tell people I'm not to make
decisions when they're super emotional and

284
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:23,080
so I'm going to start adding, don't make
decisions when you're super just bored.

285
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,920
Yeah. You might end up at
buds. So you show up there,

286
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,640
you show up the buds and you must've,
you know, obviously you made it through.

287
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,680
Was there any, what was your,
what was tough for you in buds?

288
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,740
Running? Running was definitely, uh,

289
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,800
I mean obviously that's like
what you do the most of. And, um,

290
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,760
man, it was just,

291
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,440
I went from no running
ever to running my ass off,

292
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,180
just everywhere. And, uh,
and those timed runs, man,

293
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:58,420
I was just fucking having a
lot of conversations with,

294
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,380
with Jesus and those
runs and just, you know,

295
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,030
giving it everything I fucking had
just to make the cutoff on those,

296
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,310
on those runs. And then,
and then I eventually,

297
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,640
I became like a pretty good runner
just from doing it. And, uh,

298
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,000
um, but yeah, I was, I was for sure
captain of the Goon Squad and, uh,

299
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,990
but luckily all those fucking dodgeball
sprints were paying off and the goon

300
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:27,190
squad, so it was, it was
nice, uh, in the goon squad,

301
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:32,140
I felt comfortable. Did you get rolled
for anything? Yeah, I got rolled. Um, uh,

302
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,920
for, uh, some I had real bad shin
splints from, from loading from the,

303
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,890
the lack of running previous and
uh, but other, you know, got rolled,

304
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,750
dealt with that. And like I said,
I picked up like from running,

305
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:50,380
so I just got good at
it and I was like young,

306
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,020
so adapted well I guess.

307
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,180
Yeah, it's, it pays to be
young in buds in my opinion.

308
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,630
Yeah. Well I'm a physical
perspective. Physical, yeah, for sure.

309
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,690
With like dealing with the
overuse injuries. I mean,

310
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:05,090
cause you're definitely gonna just,

311
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,320
they're obviously just gonna fucking
ream your ass and then you have to get up

312
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:09,890
and go.

313
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,750
Yeah, I was talking to, uh,

314
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,750
one of the medical guys there who
came from like a sports environment,

315
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,840
like the, I think the NFL. Who's
he? The, I think it was the NFL.

316
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,030
And do you remember the, uh, I think
it's Patella for moral syndrome.

317
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:28,100
Did you ever know anyone
that got that there? Anyways,

318
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:31,700
there's a bunch of people that get this,
this, this patellofemoral syndrome,

319
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,290
you know, there. And he said, yeah,

320
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:38,291
at Buds I would see 10 cases a
week of Patella memorial syndrome.

321
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:43,400
It's where your Patella like rubs
against your, your femur or something.

322
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,090
And he said in the NFL you'd see
like one of these every year,

323
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,570
maybe one a year.

324
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,310
And so these guys that would
come to buds for from a physical,

325
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,450
what was the athletic trainer perspective
would learn so much because they're

326
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,850
just getting these mat.

327
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,130
These bodies are just going
through abuse like no other bodies.

328
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,880
And so they see all those,
all these common injuries
that you get to your knees,

329
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:11,330
your uh, your shoulders, your
back like that. You go to buds.

330
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,550
As an athletic trainer, you learn.

331
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,750
And as a doctor you learn so much about
how to deal with these things because

332
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,710
you see 10 times more than you would
or more than you would anywhere else.

333
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,080
I believe that. But I've also
talked to people who say like,

334
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,570
I was young to going through buds 18.

335
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,010
And so you get the, um, you get the,

336
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,030
you get the mind of, Hey, I've just do
whatever they tell me to do, you know,

337
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
but there's some people that say they
have told me they didn't think they were

338
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:45,260
mature enough at 18 or
19 to go through buds.

339
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,800
Um, I for sure was not,

340
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,700
I don't want to say I wasn't mature enough
to go through because obviously I did

341
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,850
and I made it through
however you say like what,

342
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,010
or ask like what my biggest struggle at
Bud's was, was definitely my maturity.

343
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,480
I mean physically, like physically
it was running, like, just, uh,

344
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,670
I was never a long distance
runner, obviously. Um, sprinting,

345
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:15,671
I was fast as fuck sprinting and I was
really strong on the log and like the

346
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:21,140
boats, the boats on heads was
extremely surprising to me. I like,

347
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:25,100
I remember seeing it on the
videos and thinking like, okay,

348
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,590
that's kind of weird. Like why are they
running around boats on their heads?

349
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,840
Like, and then, uh, I didn't think it
was going to be painful because they're,

350
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,450
they're like inflatable, the
rubber boats or whatever.

351
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:39,500
And when they put the thing on your
head, I was just like, Jesus Christ,

352
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,290
this thing is smashing my fucking neck.

353
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,890
Did the instructors jump around in the
boats when you went because they stopped

354
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,890
doing it at some point? Yeah,

355
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,840
they would. Uh, like some of the
little guys would like jump in,

356
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:55,430
hang on the handles and, and shit like
that when, when you're riding. But yeah,

357
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,230
he definitely knew when they were on the
boats cause they got a lot heavier. But

358
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,520
um, what they would do and I went
through and they stopped doing this,

359
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,740
which is a good thing they would,

360
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,980
they would be like the boats would be
lined up and we'd have them in head.

361
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,570
Carey and the instructors would be in
like boat one and then they would just

362
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,850
jumped into boat two and
then jump into boat three.

363
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,210
And I remember hearing when they would
did that to me a couple of the times that

364
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:23,730
they did it to me. I heard
like this deep kind of

365
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,540
[inaudible] inside my neck.

366
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,500
And I remember thinking this
is probably not good. And they,

367
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,170
they stopped doing it thankfully.
Cause that's not healthy.

368
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,460
So you actually used to be like
six to, I dunno if I got shorter,

369
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:42,600
but I definitely took some, took some
damage, took some damage for sure.

370
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,970
Yeah, that was that.

371
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,010
The boats on heads was probably the most
surprising thing to me of how like I

372
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:55,650
just wasn't expecting it to be that
bad. And uh, but like the log PT,

373
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,880
you know, I was always,

374
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,170
I actually really enjoyed the log PT
I think probably because from roofing,

375
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,531
you know,

376
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:04,950
I was always carrying those 80 pound
bundles of shingles up the ladder.

377
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,720
And then like I was the
young guy on the crew,

378
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:10,770
so I was a shingle bitch or three
years and you know, everyone,

379
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,000
everyone on my crew is in their
forties. So they, you know,

380
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,200
I was the 15 year old when I came
on the crew and just a young,

381
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,430
strong kid. They,

382
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,750
they took full advantage of it and just
wherever they needed shingles on the

383
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:29,190
roof, that's where I hauled them up.
And, uh, so I was used to carrying,

384
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,100
you know, that the heavy load and stuff
I didn't, like I said, I feel strong.

385
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,840
I felt really good on that
stuff and mentally I was like,

386
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,300
um,

387
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I just was super competitive and that's
what really got me through Bud's was,

388
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,200
was just that sheer competitiveness.

389
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,800
The maturity level. Where
could that have tripped you up?

390
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,230
Were you like doing dumb stuff
on the weekends where you

391
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,170
no, not really. Um,

392
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,540
cause I mean I wasn't even old enough to
go drink or anything like that, so, uh,

393
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,260
it was more just kind of not understanding
well one like I was different.

394
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,980
I was different than most people
there because like you said,

395
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:18,981
you wanted to be in the military your
whole life and like you wanted to be a CLM

396
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,490
assuming. Did you?

397
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,320
Yeah. I mean as soon as I kind of figured
out what the seal teams were. Yeah.

398
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,830
Yeah. So like, like that
and like just how you are,

399
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,230
you're very disciplined,
you're very, you know,

400
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,790
you're very militant I would
say. And I would concur.

401
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,810
I was like more of like a wild,

402
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:43,040
like free spirit kind of,
you know, kid growing up.

403
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,000
And uh, and I,

404
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:49,560
I was not military at all and so, and,

405
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,810
and I also like getting through bootcamp
was difficult for me because of that as

406
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:59,490
well, you know, just like,
I'm like, why, why my,

407
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,260
my question was like, why do
we have to [inaudible] we're,

408
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,060
we're literally spent all day
undoing our bed and, and remaking it.

409
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,730
I was like, I, what the fuck
is the point of this? Like,

410
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,920
it's such a waste of time and you know,

411
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:17,310
obviously it's all for a
reason than design, but I just,

412
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I couldn't wrap my head around it so that
just lack of military bearing and um,

413
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,290
lack of maturity and understanding,

414
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,290
like why things are the
way they are. And you know,

415
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:35,630
the whole military structure just, you
just do it and you don't questions,

416
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:36,690
stuff like that. You know,

417
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,360
that was probably my biggest
hang up, you know, just,

418
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,550
I was different than everyone. I
was young, I was, I don't know,

419
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,700
I didn't want to be a seal
my whole life. You know,

420
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:54,360
some of these people like this is like
their dream and they've been training for

421
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,950
it for whatever.

422
00:27:55,951 --> 00:28:00,510
And I'm just Kinda here showing up and
guys are quitting and, and I'm not.

423
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,231
And you know,

424
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:06,030
and like physically I was doing like
a lot better than some guys who,

425
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,150
like I said, it was kind of just like,
man, I'm just here, whatever, doing this.

426
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,680
And other guys, it's like,

427
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:14,610
this is everything to me and you know,

428
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,240
so it's like I track,

429
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,400
so you get done with buds and you
show up and where'd you go? Team 10,

430
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,170
team 10 know, right on. And then how
was that checking into team 10? Um,

431
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,510
it was, it was cool, but by that
point, you know, I'd kind of like, uh,

432
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,400
obviously I was like, all right, I'm
a seal now. And I had been in the,

433
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,790
in the pipeline for a while and kind
of getting in the flow of things in the

434
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:49,080
military and, and stuff
like that. But, uh, yeah,

435
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,920
I was super excited to
check into team 10. Um,

436
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,660
and I originally I was going
to go to team five and then my,

437
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,150
I told my family, you know,

438
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:04,150
that I got orders to five and they were
all kind of bummed out cause they want

439
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,920
it, they're all on the east coast. And,
um, they were like, Oh man, you know,

440
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,740
we were hoping you'd come to the
east coast. And I was like, Eh, okay,

441
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,990
I'll go to the east coast.
And I thought it was like,

442
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,920
kind of cool too because it felt like, uh,

443
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,750
like a new, like a new chapter
because like, you know,

444
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,570
the seal team one, three and five are,

445
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,890
and seven are right by the buds
compound. So it was like, you know,

446
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:33,600
I'd been there and been in the scene for
the last two years or whatever it was.

447
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,490
And it was, it was cool.

448
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:39,570
It felt cool to like go across the
country and like check into a team and,

449
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,360
you know, I just felt like, like,
this is it, this is a real deal.

450
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:47,170
So that was super cool.
I felt, felt good. Um,

451
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,010
my trip was awesome.
And, uh, what was your,

452
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:54,730
what was your job in your first
platoon? I was a heavy gunner for sure.

453
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,010
A Dub. A knuckle dragger yeah,

454
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,980
that's a classic new guy. Strong new guy.

455
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,390
Guess what gives him a pig?

456
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,200
Your big strong new guy got
something for you. And I loved it.

457
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,400
I embraced it. I didn't think it
was like a bad thing, you know?

458
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,000
What year is this now? 2009.

459
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,780
Okay, so you yeah, you went straight
to the, to the mark. 48. No,

460
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:22,830
end the 60 for you.

461
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,430
[inaudible] that's, that's, that's
nice. Yeah. We shot sixties and stuff,

462
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:31,230
but now like act fam, shoot
with sixties or something. Yeah.

463
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,970
And there was sixties on like, uh,

464
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,970
humvees and stuff like that and
going through a vehicle stuff.

465
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,880
So there were still a little
bit of transition taking place.

466
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,230
So you're a pig gunner, your first
platoon. How was your first workup?

467
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,360
It was awesome. Uh, it's
definitely a good time. Uh, Gotcha.

468
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,080
What surprised you about like going
through workup, being in a seal platoon,

469
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:56,300
what were, what was different
than what you thought it was?

470
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,300
What was different from how
it was for Charlie Sheen.

471
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,403
Okay.

472
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,200
You know, it was, it was
a lot like the movie.

473
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,950
I'm just kidding. It was, it
was, it was great, man. I, I,

474
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,840
I thought it was a lot of fun.
Um, we got to travel, travel,

475
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,680
travel the country. That was the cool
thing too about the east coast. Um,

476
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,540
the training sites were kind of all
over all over versus the west coast.

477
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:31,100
It was kind of like the same song
and dance like Nyland and, and uh,

478
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,770
let's the other one. Um, you know
what I'm saying? Like in the training,

479
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:41,300
the trainings, like all the same sites.
And uh, so going into the east coast,

480
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:44,690
I got to see a bunch of new
places and that was cool to me,

481
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:48,160
just kind of seeing
the world. Um, and the,

482
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,520
the Brotherhood of like
being in the troops and,

483
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,300
and stuff and you're, you're rolling
around as a team. I thought that,

484
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,300
that was really cool. Um,

485
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,950
was there anything that was more
challenging? Like, you know,

486
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,190
cause I'm new guys, they have a hard time
and their first platoon with whatever,

487
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,100
with land warfare, they
have a hard time with CQC.

488
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,440
They'll have a hard time
with, you know, whatever.

489
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,120
Sometimes it's like not
easy sometimes. You know,

490
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,780
you get a guy that can't
dive very well and whatever.

491
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:21,350
Was there anything that was any skill
set that was hard for you or did you

492
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:22,580
pretty much, which is,

493
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,740
I would say most guys coming out of
buds and SQT like most of them are fine.

494
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:31,250
Like most of them get, get they, they
can, they pick things up pretty quick.

495
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,380
You know, they made it
through all that crap.

496
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:37,970
They made it through SQT where you're
getting screened. Right. Again.

497
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,480
So most of the time, but still, you'd
still get guys showing up a platoon that,

498
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:41,901
you know,

499
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,660
they wouldn't be comfortable with this
or they wouldn't be great at that.

500
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,220
Was there anything that was tough for you?

501
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,060
Uh, I would say like
everything was, was tough. I,

502
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,400
I wasn't, I wasn't a master at
anything other than my pig, you know,

503
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,240
and, uh, so everything was, was,

504
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,220
was somewhat challenging for me,

505
00:33:03,221 --> 00:33:06,640
but I also didn't really
struggle with anything too,

506
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,470
too much other than like my
maturity, like that, you know, I was,

507
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,180
I had checked into a seal team before
I could even go into a bar, you know,

508
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,190
and I didn't go to college or
anything like that, so I was,

509
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,440
I was a 20 year old at a
seal team, you know. Um,

510
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,940
so yes, I had been through a lot of,

511
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,030
as far as like buds and Sgt. And you know,

512
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:37,480
that kind of forces you to grow up, um,

513
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,580
to an extent, but seals
like to party too. And, uh,

514
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,020
and I kind of,

515
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,370
that was probably my biggest challenge
was just my maturity and just kinda

516
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,980
learning when to, to lock on and,

517
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,460
and you know, when it was
time to like chill out.

518
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,760
Did you ever get caught? Did you ever
get in trouble? Did he ever get arrested?

519
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,690
Uh, I did get arrested and not in my new
guy platoon. I got arrested in my, uh,

520
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,810
and when I was in my second platoon, uh,

521
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,670
got into a bar fight,
um, this, these guys,

522
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,560
it was actually three, three dudes, uh,

523
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:22,080
had just started mouth and off
to one of my platoon members,

524
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:24,760
wife. It was him and I, and uh,

525
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,820
my girlfriend at the time and his
girlfriend at the time now or wife and uh,

526
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,020
we are coming out of the bar and they
just had had a couple of drinks and they

527
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:38,610
had come over and said some disrespectful
shit to them and you know, and I,

528
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,810
I just was feeling froggy
a little bit and, and uh,

529
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,260
didn't let it slide and ended up whooping
their ass and beat up three people

530
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,360
outside of a bar and got arrested. But,

531
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,910
but your first platoon, you,

532
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:57,911
you manage to keep your nose clean or
at least as far as the actual law go,

533
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,430
the actual law enforcement goes
tremble. And then where was that?

534
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,600
So you did your workup.

535
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,530
Where did you guys go on deployment
to your first deployment? Afghanistan.

536
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,570
And when you were going to
Afghanistan, where you going?

537
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,270
Did you go as a whole
troop to Afghanistan?

538
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,330
Uh, Yep. Yeah, I'll, I'll, three of
our a platoons went. Yeah, it was a,

539
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:24,990
it was kind of an interesting,
um, thing because, uh,

540
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,220
it was in 2011 and, uh, I dunno if you,

541
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,360
you said you got out in
2010. Well, yeah, there was,

542
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,090
I'm sure you'd heard about they, uh,

543
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,140
they wanted us to somehow get
on the army schedule and uh,

544
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,280
so it was us and team
seven [inaudible] and um,

545
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,850
we ended up basically doing
two deployments back to
back and got sinked up with

546
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:59,400
the army or something like that. I don't
know. I don't know all the, all the,

547
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,120
yeah.

548
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,680
You know, Mumbo jumbo that actually took
place, but or why, why we did it. But,

549
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,300
uh, they told us kind of right before,
it was like two months before we left,

550
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,400
they were like, Hey, I'm just kidding.

551
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:15,220
You guys are going to go to Afghanistan
and we're going to need you to stay

552
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:19,450
there for basically a year. And
we're like, oh shit. Okay. So, uh,

553
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,580
we went there and, uh, it was,

554
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,230
it was an interesting deployment
for sure because my platoon,

555
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,213
um,

556
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,740
we were the furthest outposts from
any major base in Afghanistan.

557
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,900
And, uh, you know,

558
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,630
we're basically rough in it the whole

559
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,523
time we were out there.

560
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,510
Did you guys take over at
outpost somewhere or did
you guys establish one? Uh,

561
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,980
we took one over that had just been this

562
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,130
established like literally a couple
months ago, you know, so there was,

563
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,020
there was nothing there. We were sleeping
in tents still, um, no running water,

564
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,070
no, no, nothing like that. And then, um,

565
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,470
I think around month seven
or eight of our deployment,

566
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,500
we packed up and went 15
miles north and set up a new,

567
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,860
uh, sites.

568
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,860
So it was literally just fucking
rough in it the whole time.

569
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,300
Uh, you know, airdrop
and our food in and um,

570
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,400
no running water the whole time.

571
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,700
And what, what type of ops were you doing?

572
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,600
Um, we were, we were doing
all kinds of stuff. Uh,

573
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,120
and I was lucky enough to kind of, we
got to, they shifted our guys around too.

574
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:46,121
So like we got to all it
kind of experience different
things cause we all had a

575
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:49,310
different kind of mission
set and different,

576
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,500
we're on all three of our platoons were
in different areas of Afghanistan. So,

577
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,950
um, I got to kind of
do a lot of everything.

578
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,180
So where are you guys going
out on patrol from your,

579
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,770
from your Ford Operating Base. Was
that, yeah. And yeah, pretty much daily.

580
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,630
And you were, uh, interacting with the
local populous type thing. Yep. Yep.

581
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,310
Try to establish relationships.

582
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,480
Yeah. I only did that for a little
while. That was a really dumb,

583
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,370
you don't because you didn't
feel like you made any progress,

584
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:24,540
didn't make any connections.

585
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,710
Yeah, I mean, in my opinion, I
just thought it was like kind of a,

586
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,280
a waste of time. And um, I just,

587
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,340
I just felt like we could have been doing
a lot more stuff or better stuff with

588
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,210
our time and training and all that.

589
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:44,920
And it was just like a super
dangerous area to be in.

590
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,520
You know, it was in a Hellman and

591
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,350
we basically just lived in a fucking
minefield, you know? And it was just

592
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:59,170
[inaudible] everywhere, just as
a constant threat. So, you know,

593
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,860
and we were going on these long
patrols every day and, and uh,

594
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,810
and all these,

595
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,810
all these ops we were doing and hitting
these villages that were just riddled

596
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:15,520
with idds everywhere and
you know, getting contacted,

597
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,230
you know, on your basically just stick
out like a sore thumb there, you know.

598
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,860
So, uh, I mean, you know
how it is overseas. I,

599
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:28,370
I didn't feel real
comfortable with that. Like,

600
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,430
and it sucked. Uh, being in a
minefield, like just every step,

601
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,440
just please don't blow up. Please
don't blow up. Please don't blow up.

602
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:39,760
Please don't blow up, you know,
for a year. Yeah. Did you guys,

603
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:43,600
did you guys hit any
ids? Uh, yeah. Yeah, we,

604
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,500
we encountered a couple ideas and um,

605
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,730
so shitty. Yeah. And that the enemy,

606
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,130
did you have a feel for

607
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,230
who was bad and who was
good when you'd go out?

608
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,580
No, definitely not. Um, there was, I mean,

609
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:11,080
cause like literally there was,
there was a times where, you know,

610
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:15,280
we'd be in the village fucking
shaking hands with people and then,

611
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,910
you know, on the way out, get contacted,

612
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,140
getting a firefight and then
fucking go back and look and, oh,

613
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:26,130
it's the same guys that we were just
shaking hands with it or fucking dead.

614
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,340
Yeah. Um, so it was,

615
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,940
it was hard to,

616
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,240
okay,

617
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,250
it,

618
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,250
it was really weird to like get rev
ramped up and everything as he's like,

619
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,390
you get in this mindset, this
warrior mindset, you know,

620
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:52,190
that you're going to war and you're going
to this fucking land where everyone,

621
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,270
everyone is, you know, your enemy and
blah, blah, blah. And then it's like, oh,

622
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:59,700
just kidding. Let's, let's try to help
some of these people or whatever and,

623
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,220
and the, you know, the good and
use like, okay, yeah, I want to,

624
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,080
I want to help people and, and stuff
like that and, and do what I can, um,

625
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,780
to help these people out.

626
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:14,780
And then if they're getting
like bullied essentially by the,

627
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,960
by the Taliban or whatever,
like that's not cool. But

628
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,700
I just felt like it was,

629
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,760
it was really weird too to be there and
go there with that mindset and then have

630
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:31,490
to fucking like try to help people.
And then when you tried to help people,

631
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:35,650
they don't want your help and you know,
and they fucking shoot at you and,

632
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,520
and shit like that. So it's like,

633
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,920
and then you're expected to like go out
and try and help these people again and

634
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:47,120
it's, I dunno, it was just
like a weird, weird dynamic.

635
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,090
And would you go,

636
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,640
when you said you would move and
positions where you going from,

637
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:56,960
like would you like switch platoons and
go to a different operating base? Yeah.

638
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,500
And then you'd spend some time there with
them and then do operations with them

639
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,980
and then after a little while and
go to a different one as well. Yeah.

640
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,790
Yeah. We, we rotated our guy, all of
our guys just to, so we can all get,

641
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,070
you know, experience doing other things,
like working with the commandos or,

642
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,630
you know, uh, training,
the fit, training fit and,

643
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,140
um, or doing the VSO stuff.
And yeah, it was cool. I,

644
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:31,070
I enjoyed that just cause it broke
up the monotony of every day,

645
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,350
you know, going on patrols,
doing the same things,

646
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:38,030
seeing the same places or whatever
and dealing with the same threats. Uh,

647
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,820
it just, it keeps you kind of from
getting complacent, I felt like,

648
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,600
so for the 11 month or, yeah. So I,

649
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,720
I was definitely happy to move and,

650
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,750
and do new things and work
in like, and it was cool too,

651
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:57,770
because on the base that
we were at in Afghanistan,

652
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:01,250
it was literally like a hundred
yards by a hundred yards.

653
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,470
That was your, that was like our camp.
It was like being in prison, you know,

654
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,980
but worse like, cause
we're getting shot at too.

655
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,110
And like if you,

656
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,150
when you go outside to go get your
fucking food that they airdrop in,

657
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,060
you know, you're, you're
worried about stepping on ids.

658
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:24,260
Like we found IUD is literally right
outside of our compound, you know.

659
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:27,350
So it was a constant
threat always. And uh,

660
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,260
and like I said, like going to get our
air dry. It was just a lot of work to,

661
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:37,460
because not only it was like
we were sealed bees, you know,

662
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:39,110
we had to like filled our,

663
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,380
we had to like build our camp and also
like all the stuff that came with that,

664
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:48,500
like going and getting
our, our, uh, supplies,

665
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,190
I would airdrop in and, and
being out there, you know,

666
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,890
you only get ring routes and, and stuff.

667
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:59,450
You only get airdrops every
once in awhile. And uh, so when,

668
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,740
when shit would come in, it was
like all hands go work on this.

669
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,550
And then also you got to prep
your shit and get ready for the,

670
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,760
the op tonight or tomorrow
or whatever. And um,

671
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,370
and I remember just,

672
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,480
I remember I have a video of one of
our big airdrops coming in and uh,

673
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,780
you just see like three or four
pallets just burn in, just explode.

674
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:24,681
And you know,

675
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:29,681
it's like always like all the
water bottle pallets are fine,

676
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,890
but it's that one with like the
goodies, you know, it's like, Oh man,

677
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,311
you know,

678
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:38,850
that's the one that burned in and it
just fucking hits the ground explodes.

679
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,240
And you see like all the
repeats or something, you know,

680
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,420
something that people were looking forward
to just exploding. You're just like,

681
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,280
fuck, I dunno, I just accepted
that this was my life,

682
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:54,420
so whatever. I wasn't, I wasn't
thinking about the time too much.

683
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,400
And then, um, I just, you
get into a rhythm, you know,

684
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:03,780
and we got to, we got to go home for
rnr. That was cool. Took a little break,

685
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:08,080
but it was like bittersweet, you know,
go home for fucking two weeks and like,

686
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:08,221
oh,

687
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:11,580
I've just been playing in this minefield
where everyone's trying to kill me for

688
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:15,770
the last six months and come home
for two weeks and like to normalcy.

689
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,080
And you're just like, you know,
literally just fly straight from there,

690
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,880
no decompression or anything.

691
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:24,330
And then now you're back in normal
society with your family and,

692
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,040
and by the way, you're
leaving in 11 days to go back.

693
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,740
Yeah. And then don't get comfortable
because we're going right back over there.

694
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:36,390
So that was like, kind of like,
it was bittersweet and, uh,

695
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,600
got back over there. But that was cool
too, cause it was like, all right,

696
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,780
I'm fucking halfway through.
Like it's downhill now, you know,

697
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:47,370
so that it kind of definitely
fired me up to, to finish out.

698
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:51,660
But then, uh, towards the end and
we were there for all four seasons,

699
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,650
so we saw literally all
four seasons is interesting.

700
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,520
And um, by the end of it,

701
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,250
by the end of it, uh,

702
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,740
I remember when the ring route
came to pick me up to go out.

703
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,680
Uh, I remember flying away from,

704
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,030
from the base that we were at and just
thinking like, I, I felt kind of sad,

705
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,600
like,

706
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,140
like almost like when you move away from
somewhere and like I've moved my whole

707
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:21,840
life, I've moved around a
lot, so I was like, damn,

708
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:26,660
like this has been my home for the last
year. You know, I'm kind of bummed to,

709
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,710
to leave, but fuck this place.
I can't wait to go home.

710
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,410
Yeah, I got, I got kind of lucky because
I had been in the navy for awhile when,

711
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,400
when I deployed to Iraq and especially
my second deployment to Iraq where I was

712
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:44,600
in Ramadi. And, and like I, I, you know,

713
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,820
sometimes people will say,
oh, I look back and I,

714
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:50,720
I wish I would have
appreciated it more. You know,

715
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:54,500
people say that about certain parts of
their life. I don't have that at all.

716
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:58,430
Like I 100% appreciated every single
day I was there. I was like, this is,

717
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,400
this is the best part of
my whole life is right,

718
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,950
is what's happening today
right now. You know?

719
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:07,280
So I got kind of lucky in
the fact that, you know,

720
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,750
even talking to the guys that were new
guys on, on a, that deployment to Ramadi,

721
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,210
they, they just kind of, they were like,
from then on they'd be saying, damn,

722
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,430
you know, I thought that's what every
deployment was going to be like.

723
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:24,080
And it was, and it was, they just
didn't have that same perspective of,

724
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,120
hey man, this is like this target
rich environment where we're getting,

725
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,100
do what everyone's dreamed of doing their
whole life and you're going to do it

726
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,190
all the time. That
doesn't happen. You know,

727
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,010
it doesn't happen like that
usually, you know, it's hard.

728
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,780
And so I was pretty lucky in the fact
that I, I was, I could appreciate it.

729
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,710
Yeah. I know as far as the work,

730
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,960
like I was as far as like,

731
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,460
like being a seal and working there
like that, that was awesome, you know,

732
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:55,640
and I was, uh, you know,
one of the biggest,

733
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,110
like I say, concerns I had or, or not,

734
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:05,000
or even not concern was just like
a question to myself was, you know,

735
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,650
what would, how am I actually
going to react and combat,

736
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,790
you know what I mean? Cause everyone,

737
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,540
everyone likes to think that
they're ideally, you know, in a,

738
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:19,340
in a situation of shit popped off, you
know, I'll be, I'll be the guy who will,

739
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,540
you know, hold them, have my shit
together and be that, you know,

740
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,920
the rock or whatever, you know what
I mean? And, uh, some people crumble,

741
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,640
you know,

742
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,230
and I saw that as a seal like that,

743
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,350
that was kind of my, I was always
a realist, you know, it was like,

744
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:40,280
I've never been shot at, I've never
been in a gunfight or whatever. So,

745
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,020
um, I definitely, you know, I, I,

746
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,500
I feel like I'm not a coward and I
feel like I would step up and do,

747
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:53,150
do what I gotta do and perform. I feel
like that, but I don't know it for sure.

748
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,480
You know what I mean?
And, um, so that was,

749
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:01,590
that was definitely when it happened
in a, in a, you know, an I did, I,

750
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,440
I stepped up and, and
felt very pleased with,

751
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:11,180
with how that all went down and all the
combat and everything that I had been

752
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,810
involved with. Like
that was definitely, um,

753
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,800
rewarding to me, you know, like
as a seal and, and as a man just,

754
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,990
and as a warrior, just like,
okay, like I felt legit, you know,

755
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:28,910
I felt like fulfilled in
that sense. Um, so the work,

756
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,520
the work was really good,

757
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,470
but just as far as being
in that environment, like,

758
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,530
uh, the [inaudible] was really
like the IUD in the fucking, like,

759
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,570
invisible enemy was kind
of, um, discouraging,

760
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,220
you know, it was like,

761
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:53,450
it felt like we just had so much risk,

762
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,070
you know, for not a whole
lot of reward. And, uh, like,

763
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:00,340
which is different. Like I would say, oh,

764
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,580
I feel like in like Ramadi
was like a different way,

765
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:08,420
different environment. Um, but yeah,

766
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,570
yeah, no, that's, that's the, that's the
way in surgeons are supposed to fight,

767
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:14,920
right? You're not supposed to see them.

768
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:18,010
They're just supposed to pick away
at you the death of a thousand cuts,

769
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,850
you know, indirect fire ids and snipers.

770
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,940
And they don't want you to ever see
him. And, and that's what they want.

771
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,190
And just to slowly pick away because
they don't care about human life.

772
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,550
They don't value human life.
And here we are, you know,

773
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,980
every time we lose someone,
it's a, it's a tragedy.

774
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,850
And they don't care if they lose guys
or not. They don't, they don't care.

775
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,070
They don't care if the civilians get
killed, don't care about any of that.

776
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,050
And so that's why they have,

777
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,140
that's why they have an
advantage in those situations.

778
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,910
A psychological advantages. Hey,
we, we don't care if you kill us.

779
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:50,803
And by the way,

780
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,680
we know you care about your people and
so we're going to pick away and you're,

781
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,780
hopefully you're never going
to see us and we don't care.

782
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,120
We're going to blow you
up and we don't care.

783
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,240
Yeah. That was, I mean, that
was pretty apparent. I mean, uh,

784
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,200
cause a lot of the IED set
went off where, you know,

785
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:11,610
local villagers stepping on them
triggered by civilian, you know, and, uh,

786
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:16,410
and that, that just happened all
the, all the damn time. And, uh,

787
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,070
and we would, we would help
them, you know, we would,

788
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:24,120
we would aid the wounded and stuff like
that and they would like get pissed at

789
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:28,170
us and we're like, we didn't plant that
shit, you know, like get mad at them,

790
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,004
not us.

791
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,120
Yeah. There's that, that
insurgencies thing is,

792
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,120
but yeah. And like, you
know, do worth, it was,

793
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,670
it was just super
frustrating to me. Like, uh,

794
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:40,550
okay.

795
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,200
It was super frustrating to me.

796
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,110
Okay.

797
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:49,110
Dealing with like the politics
involved with war and um,

798
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:51,221
you know,

799
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:56,221
I felt like we absolutely could have
done things to give us more of an

800
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,390
advantage,

801
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,250
but it seemed like they were more
concerned with the politics and shit like

802
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:07,150
that, you know, as more than,

803
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,650
more than like the safety of us.
And I just felt like we could,

804
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,791
you know,

805
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:17,290
there's no reason why the we should
be going out in the daylight period.

806
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,730
You know, we, we train like
why not fight like we train and

807
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,870
oh, because you guys got locked down
from doing stuff at night. Right.

808
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:25,903
Is that right?

809
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,410
Dude, night shit. But we also did
a lot of day shit and I, you know,

810
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:32,660
to me it was just like, why
the fuck are we doing this?

811
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,090
Like we have night vision. Why
are we going out during the,

812
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,810
do you have Afghan forces
with you sometimes.

813
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,140
A lot of times we did. Well, yeah,

814
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,670
we, we had to work a lot in Ramadi,
in the daytime. Um, and the main,

815
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,430
the main reason why we look worked well,

816
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:51,950
there's a couple of big reasons why
we worked in the daytime in Ramadi,

817
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,410
which as you, as you just pointed out,

818
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,370
as a huge tactical disadvantage compared
to being out at night where we can

819
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:02,420
literally see and the enemy cants I
mean it's, but in reminded, you know,

820
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:05,180
we had to work with Iraqi soldiers
who didn't have night vision,

821
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,010
so they didn't even have flashlights.

822
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,800
They would have like one flashlight for
every four people and we'd eventually

823
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:12,800
got them flashlights and
stuff. But anyways, it was,

824
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:17,770
it was a problem because to go
out at night with them, it was,

825
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:22,330
they were blind. And so now you're,
you're like at a, you're at the same,

826
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,940
the same disadvantage
because you're trying,

827
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,100
you've got people that can't see mixed
with people that can see and they're not

828
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,460
getting anything out of it. They're
not improving their skills at all, all.

829
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,240
And they're just horrible. Yeah. And
they were, they were not, not good,

830
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,163
not good.

831
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,790
And so that was one reason was to take
them out in the daytime to get them to

832
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:43,530
operate. We had to go out
with them in the daytime.

833
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:46,500
And the other big one was the
enemy knew that we owned the night.

834
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,200
And so the enemy in Ramadi,
they didn't come out at night.

835
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,020
They came out in the daytime.
So if you wanted to kill them,

836
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,020
you had to go out when they
were, when they were moving.

837
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,130
And so that's where we are now. And
you know, we, we did both. I mean,

838
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:00,810
we did a ton at the night
as well. And also, you know,

839
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,090
we'd take advantage of the
night to get in good positions.

840
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,620
We know when and then during the daytime
they would come out to fight and you

841
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:08,760
know, they'd get it.

842
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,280
Yeah, we had, we had, uh, art we had,

843
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,240
we were working with the commandos
and they had night vision. Um,

844
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,840
but like I said, they were
just terrible. And, uh,

845
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:25,210
like one of them almost
shot me, um, on and up. Uh,

846
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,470
we were actually in a helicopter
flying to target and, uh,

847
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:35,290
it was one of their heavy
gunners. And, um, he,

848
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,340
uh,

849
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,660
it was around midnight and we
were flying in a Chinook to,

850
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,490
to the target. And, uh, I was
just kinda not enough, just,

851
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,090
you know, just, just
trying to con, you know,

852
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:52,570
catch a little nap on the ride to the
op and it's pitch black and the in the

853
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:57,400
Hilo obviously. And uh, all of a
sudden it's just crack, you know,

854
00:54:57,401 --> 00:55:01,930
like four or five rounds
crack off. And the guy neck,

855
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,580
it was the guy next to me and thank
God he had his barrel down and,

856
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,090
uh, like literally just shot
like four or five rounds,

857
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,150
like less than six inches from my feet
and there's just holes in the bottom of

858
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,300
the bird and shot the comms
out of the Hilo and everything.

859
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,400
And at that point I was just
like, you know, I was there,

860
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,500
just kinda used to shit being shitty and
just reached over and took the rounds

861
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:34,360
out of his gun and just that was it.
Yeah. And just like come over to comms,

862
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:38,500
like, yeah, the fucking
commandos 80, you know,

863
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,600
now everyone's just like, whatever.
But, uh, so then we changed like,

864
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,620
alright, no more commandos, Roland
hot in the birds and you know,

865
00:55:47,621 --> 00:55:52,240
on the way to target a target. And
uh, so we, we, we had changed that.

866
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,270
So then the next one we did,

867
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,040
we fucking got to, we uh, got to our,

868
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,520
our uh, target burdened landed,

869
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,310
get out and do our formation
and all of a sudden,

870
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,490
and it's like a total brownout, you know,

871
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,850
cause Afghanistan is super dusty
and everything there. And uh, the,

872
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,390
the Hilo lands were all getting out,

873
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,740
we're in our formation and total brown
out and then all of a sudden we hear

874
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,250
fucking rounds going off.
Correct. Remember, cause they,

875
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:29,390
the dudes loading their pigs like all of
a sudden had a runaway gun or whatever.

876
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,610
We don't know if we're getting contacted
like you can hear it's outgoing,

877
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,260
but like why, why is there outgoing
fire when we're infilling, you know,

878
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,210
are we getting in contact
or what's going on?

879
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,990
And it's just these guys are
fucking stupid with their weapons.

880
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:47,230
And Yeah. So that was
always, always something fun.

881
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:48,703
Always good.

882
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,790
So you wrap up that deployment and come
back to come back and roll into your

883
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:58,220
next, next platoon.

884
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,650
Yup. Come back. And, uh, Roland, so
the next platoon and um, I always to,

885
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,400
how was that? How was that coming
home now you're now you're home.

886
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,610
You did the two weeks in the middle. How
was the transition when you got home?

887
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,830
It was a, it was, it was rough. Um,

888
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:19,840
I was definitely dealing
with some PTSD I would say.

889
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,640
And uh, I was, I was
definitely kind of angry.

890
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,403
Um,

891
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:27,880
okay.

892
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,260
I was, I was angry.

893
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,170
Yeah.

894
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,930
It was a weird, weird,
weird emotions. Um, cause I,

895
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:39,620
I kind of was kind of
pissed off at like, uh,

896
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,430
America, like, like
not America as a whole,

897
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:48,170
but like I felt like a,
the, the politics, you know,

898
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,280
like I said earlier, I
felt like they really, um,

899
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,500
cared more about, or they just didn't
really give a shit about our safety.

900
00:57:57,501 --> 00:58:00,320
I felt like, uh, you
know, it's one thing like,

901
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:03,770
obviously we're doing a
dangerous job, but why,

902
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:09,220
why on earth are we not giving ourselves
every advantage that we are capable of?

903
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,350
You know, like, like the night
vision and stuff like that. And,

904
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,180
and a lot of times we
would capture people, um,

905
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,320
who we knew were bad, you know,

906
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,640
talking to our Intel guys
and they're like, 100%. Like,

907
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:31,880
this dude is a fucking
terrorist. Like, he's a bad dude.

908
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:36,470
Like everyone in his phone, you know,
they rip apart their shit. And like every,

909
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,080
every one of his contacts
are bad, you know, like,

910
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:42,440
this guy is definitely an IED
maker, you know, whatever.

911
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:48,220
And so we've got these guys captured,

912
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:51,530
but then we have to turn him
into the Afghan government,

913
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,270
which we also know is corrupt.

914
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:58,510
And then all of a sudden these dudes are
out on the streets again in a couple of

915
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:05,780
months time and making ids that, you know,

916
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,370
me or my brothers can step on
and fucking, that's a wrap. And

917
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,570
you know, uh,

918
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,140
Caleb Nelson was a seal that died on our
deployment from our team and it's kind

919
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:24,880
of, you know,

920
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:29,830
life and death and war just
puts things into perspective.

921
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,370
And, uh, it really made me angry that,

922
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:34,780
okay,

923
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,350
you know, like Caleb couldn't come
home because of an IED and like,

924
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,550
we're letting these people go.

925
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,550
And I just felt like we weren't being

926
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:47,523
okay

927
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,030
utilize fully and uh, and
like, like it was costing us.

928
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,390
And so I was like really
angry about that. And um,

929
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:02,150
and then also just kind of being in
that environment for a long time,

930
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:05,130
just it's different, you know,

931
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,960
different mentality and then
coming home to America and like,

932
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:13,530
people just don't understand
how good it is here.

933
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:17,930
And it's like a fucking fairy
tale, you know? And, and trying to,

934
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:23,150
and listening to people talk and complain
about about Shit here and I'm just

935
01:00:24,181 --> 01:00:27,990
like, you don't even
have to, you don't even,

936
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,440
you just walk down that sidewalk and
didn't even give a fuck where you stepped.

937
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,700
Like, you don't even care cause
you're not worried about anything.

938
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:39,150
You're not worried if there's an IUD
there, like you have running water,

939
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:43,830
you took a shower today, you
fucking, I had to burn my own shit,

940
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,890
you know? Um,

941
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:52,610
so I was just like a lot of anger dealing
with that and I was drinking a lot,

942
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,340
like, uh, and I also felt like,

943
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,820
I felt like seals were the only ones
that kind of understood and got it.

944
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,990
And then also being over
there in Afghanistan, I saw,

945
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:08,680
yeah,

946
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,850
you know, Kandahar, the main base.
And Kandahar was like a fucking,

947
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,220
it was like a little town, you know,

948
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:20,250
and there's like flag football leagues
and shopping and TGI Friday's people

949
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:24,640
having birthday parties and shit like
that. And you know, that's where,

950
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:29,020
that's where like Tim McGraw flies in to
do the concert for the troops and shit

951
01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:31,920
like that, you know? And it's like,
oh, is this where we're staying?

952
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,540
They eating like kings in? And
they're like, no, no, no, no,

953
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,060
you're going out there. So
then, you know, that's where I,

954
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,930
that's where I was and that's where,
where me and my boys were, you know,

955
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:49,830
living in the sock live in doing
some serious fucking shitty living,

956
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,880
you know, and, and,

957
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,830
and working a job that was
dangerous as fuck every day.

958
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,730
And then just seeing that
kind of shit. And like,

959
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,390
I don't know, I just, I felt like,

960
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:05,840
yeah,

961
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,140
before I had gone over
overseas, I was like real,

962
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,080
like thank you for your service
to everyone I saw, you know, and,

963
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,820
and afterwards I was just
kind of the opposite and uh,

964
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,310
I was like, fuck all motherfuckers, man.

965
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,330
So I was just disgruntled and whatever.

966
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,010
And M and P, you know,

967
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,710
I'd hear people talk about PTSD
or this or that. And I'm like,

968
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,520
what the fuck are you, what
are you afraid of? You know,

969
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:40,500
you were on a main base that like,
wasn't, it's not even a thing,

970
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,690
like you didn't experience war,

971
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,450
but that was like just kind of
immaturity at the time. And, and like,

972
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,980
like I said, me being just
kind of disgruntled and um,

973
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:58,260
dealing with that and I was
drinking like heavily, uh,

974
01:02:58,530 --> 01:02:59,363
and

975
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:01,190
okay.

976
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:06,190
I was just a super aggressive
person and it wasn't like a good,

977
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,820
it wasn't good for my friends and family,
like people I cared about or whatever.

978
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:11,490
And like I said, I,

979
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,840
I felt like seals were kind of
the only ones that understood.

980
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,880
And then even amongst seals,
I felt like only the ones who,

981
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:25,610
who had to live so shitty, like we
did, like our platoon, you know,

982
01:03:25,611 --> 01:03:27,620
no running water for a year. And like,

983
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:33,370
like just living in that environment was
super rough and I felt like they were

984
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,470
the only ones who
understood. But then again,

985
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:41,471
it's like I just spent a year with
these assholes in a hundred by a hundred

986
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,460
foot, you know, place. I
don't want to see them. And,

987
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,900
uh, so just kind of felt alone
a little bit, you know, and uh,

988
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,080
whatever dealt with that

989
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,340
got got through that I'm
doing better now. And,

990
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,640
and I was like, kind of

991
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:03,610
okay,

992
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,610
disgruntled towards people claiming
PTSD and all this kind of shit for years

993
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,660
after that. And then
actually some random, um,

994
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:20,260
uh, this random, at a
dinner I was at, she was,

995
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,440
uh, in the army or
something like that. And,

996
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:27,370
and she had t she was talking about
PTSD and I was just thinking like,

997
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:31,060
Jesus Christ, what the fuck are
you? What, what is it? You know?

998
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,220
And I kind of said my viewpoints on
it and she was like, well, you know,

999
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:40,510
fear is relative and you know,

1000
01:04:40,511 --> 01:04:42,210
like you are,

1001
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:46,150
you were seriously trained
and stuff for war and,

1002
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,720
and to be in that
environment and you know,

1003
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:53,560
some people weren't and like
fears relative like this,

1004
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,620
like being in a gunfight to you, you know,

1005
01:04:56,621 --> 01:05:01,621
and versus like just being in that country
like could be the same amount of fear

1006
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:06,550
or more for that person. And I was
just kinda like, you know, hmm.

1007
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,750
I never really thought about it
that way. Okay. I'll change my mind.

1008
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:16,270
War is different for everybody. And I
remember my first deployment to Iraq, we,

1009
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:18,070
we, we travel

1010
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,520
a lot and we went to a lot of different
places and so we'd go from like the

1011
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:26,521
incredible palaces that had been taken
over that had subways and Starbucks.

1012
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:27,311
And then we, you know,

1013
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:30,730
the next day we'd be out at
some outstations somewhere
there'd be an ODA team

1014
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,600
just living in, you know, the
most horrible living conditions.

1015
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:38,860
And then the next day you'd be with some
random Marine Corp company out in some

1016
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:42,370
other forward operating base into, and
again, they're just living like in hell.

1017
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,930
And then you come back to another,

1018
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,700
another like main farb and it's all
luxurious and nice. And I mean it just,

1019
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:51,910
it Kinda is what it is, you know,
it just Kinda is what it is.

1020
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:56,470
And that actually makes sense what
that female said about, you know, hey,

1021
01:05:56,471 --> 01:06:01,210
it's different. People are there, they're
there for different reasons. You know,

1022
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:06,270
like we joined the seal teams because
what we want to do is go out and go on

1023
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:12,970
patrol with a machine gun. That's like
100% of why you're doing the seal teams,

1024
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,850
someone that goes through, you're
hoping for, you're praying,

1025
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,170
you're praying for a war.

1026
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,430
Yeah. And I remember, I remember
like being out there, man,

1027
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:25,550
I remember my very first
up, um, when I, we,

1028
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,590
we flew in to this, to, to this village.

1029
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,520
And I remember being like super
nervous and like, Holy Shit,

1030
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,210
I'm fucking navy seal. And I'm actually
going on my first mission. Like,

1031
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,460
Holy Shit. And I'm just thinking
like, uh, when we land, we,

1032
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:45,461
we landed at like 3:00 AM or something
and that we offset like way far away.

1033
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,490
But I was thinking like
that's going to be guns blaze.

1034
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:54,040
And as soon as this Hilo Lance
that jump out the he load,

1035
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:58,220
I'm just like full blown ready for more
like what are bringing on, let's go,

1036
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:03,230
where's it been logged? And
it was just pitch black,

1037
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:07,700
quiet and sat there for
fucking hours. And you know,

1038
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,000
till the sun came up, nothing
happened. I was like, God damn it.

1039
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,010
I was so disappointed. You know,

1040
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,380
I was looking for to like war and
then, you know, obviously we got,

1041
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:21,260
we got plenty. But uh, I, yeah,

1042
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:26,090
I remember just being real antsy
to, to get in a firefight in,

1043
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:27,170
you know, to,

1044
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,800
to do what I've been trained to do and
put my training to the test, you know?

1045
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:35,030
And yeah, it's different for other
people who are not experiences may vary.

1046
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,240
There was no doubt about that.
So when you went to a bar,

1047
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,260
when you got home and you
got put into a new platoon,

1048
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,050
did you guys keep a core
group of guys from your,

1049
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,410
from your previous platoon
together or was it like brand new?

1050
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:52,290
Oh yeah, no, we, we had guys that
stayed and, and some went, you know,

1051
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:56,850
to trade at and some screen
and standard standard shit.

1052
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:59,950
Few, few core guys stayed
together. Four or five or whatever.

1053
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,020
And then you guys got a new
chief and a new OIC. Yeah.

1054
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,840
New Assistant to commander. Yup.

1055
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:09,200
Yeah, that was man, God, thank God I am.

1056
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:13,700
So I still do not miss
having fucking 20 bosses,

1057
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:17,450
you know, in the, and
then every, you know,

1058
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,650
at the drop of a hat it can change and
then all of a sudden it's like, nope,

1059
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:25,820
new flavor. We're, we're, uh, now
we're, you know, it's like, oh,

1060
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:27,560
Jockos now our fucking commanders.

1061
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,280
So we're all waking up four 30 and you
go on a p t it's like, what the fuck?

1062
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:36,080
When did this happen?
This is bullshit, Jack.

1063
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,570
And as you do another workup.
Yup. Yeah. And, uh, I, uh,

1064
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,340
I'd always wanted to be a
dog handler and yeah. And I,

1065
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,430
I tried to volunteer to be a dog handler
as a new guy and, and they said, no,

1066
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:52,220
cause you know, they want you to have
your gun. Yeah. They want you to,

1067
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,750
here's your dog names, 48 and uh,

1068
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,920
make it bark. So yeah, now I got to, um,

1069
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:06,000
to do the dog handling
thing and, um, the super,

1070
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,760
super excited about that. And, uh, it was,

1071
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,030
it was honestly such a great time. Um,

1072
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:16,510
I had a bad ass dog and I
was as first handler and uh,

1073
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,520
yeah, it was, it was super cool because,

1074
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:26,370
you know, one I was, I
was on one platoon wonder,

1075
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,400
so I'd already kind of
gotten that Afghanistan,

1076
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:32,550
gotten some combat under
my belt. And, um, you know,

1077
01:09:32,551 --> 01:09:35,720
I was the classic worst. The,

1078
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:39,630
the worst guy in the teams is
a one platoon wonder and a,

1079
01:09:39,631 --> 01:09:43,950
so I was full blown, just one. Cruz
wonder, you knew everything 100%.

1080
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,570
And uh, and I got a
fucking dog. So watch out.

1081
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:53,900
Stellan no, uh, my dog
was super cool. And, um,

1082
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,000
they like a, there the,

1083
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,560
there was six of us that went over to
work with the dogs and we all got along

1084
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,060
really well. And uh,

1085
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:07,580
and that was super cool because
now you're not a new guy finally,

1086
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:12,110
you know, and I mean, even on
our deployment in Afghanistan,

1087
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,340
we were still fucking doing new guy. Yeah,

1088
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,930
you're here a new guy years fucking
N***a. I couldn't fucking believe it.

1089
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,510
I'm like, we literally,

1090
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,710
they made us shovel rocks
one time, like a hole,

1091
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,510
like a dumpster or a dump truck
full of rocks. And they just,

1092
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:37,190
we just moved it from one pile
and just tent over like 10,

1093
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:41,420
15 feet to the right. And we just
moved the pile of rocks to this,

1094
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:46,220
make a new pile, 15 feet to the right.
And it was, it was a disciplinary thing.

1095
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:48,460
It wasn't, you know,
all the new guys, your,

1096
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:53,120
your attitude's not good and we're
just like, are you fucking serious?

1097
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:57,500
Like, we're just in a firefight with
you. Like, you know, we're not like,

1098
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,400
we're expecting to like be boys now
and they're like, shut up new guys.

1099
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:05,720
Your attitude sucks. Go shovel
rocks and you're just like, God,

1100
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:10,580
you know, we were like literally
having to burn shit. You know,

1101
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,770
our own shit. Uh, we had, we had, uh,

1102
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,390
barrels that we had wrapped up debt
coordinator around and cut in half and,

1103
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:24,270
um, filled with diesel fuel. Um, those
were our, those were our shitters,

1104
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:28,770
but they needed burned. So when,
uh, when the, when the new guys,

1105
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,530
you know, when, when we didn't, uh,

1106
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,820
have the best attitudes or our
attitudes weren't up to par,

1107
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:38,280
we shoveled rocks and burned shit.

1108
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,220
So I was definitely happy to not be
a new guy anymore. Um, but anyway,

1109
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:48,660
yeah. So as one between
wonder had a dog and uh,

1110
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,030
got to go through another workup
with the dog. So that was super cool.

1111
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:54,560
And,

1112
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,070
and got to go through dog training
school and learn about the dogs and,

1113
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:03,660
and um, yeah, unfortunately like right,

1114
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,820
right before it was,

1115
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:10,770
we were on like predeployment leave
and they had told us like, Hey,

1116
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,780
change of plans. We're going now
we're going to Yukon. So, uh,

1117
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,410
we don't need the dog anymore.
And I was like, fuck man,

1118
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,600
this isn't like a piece
of equipment. I mean,

1119
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:25,530
that's essentially how the navy looks
at them. They are, they are equipment,

1120
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:28,140
but you know, obviously
it's a dog and you,

1121
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:32,970
you form this like super strong bond and
attachment with them just like they're

1122
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:35,550
your pet. And, uh,

1123
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:40,740
my dog was super awesome and I'd
worked with them so much, you know,

1124
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:45,150
it was like a robot. It was
like a, it was so cool and, um,

1125
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,860
I was fucking so pissed off when
they just dropped that on us.

1126
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:52,770
And it's just like, yeah, man, hand
the Aleisha over to someone else.

1127
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:57,510
And Yeah. So did that. And uh,

1128
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,200
then went to Yukon and, and you know,

1129
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:04,050
a lot of guys were fucking
super pissed off though. We,

1130
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,120
we're going to YouCam and you know,

1131
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,800
I was definitely looking
forward to using my dog and,

1132
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:15,300
and you know, doing that in
Afghanistan, but, you know,

1133
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:20,230
it is what it is. You, you know, I, I
definitely knew that there wasn't, I,

1134
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:24,450
I didn't see any value in just
bitching about it. And, uh,

1135
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,590
it seemed like that was like, the
common thing was just, it was,

1136
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:31,830
it seemed almost like if you
weren't bitching about it,

1137
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:35,460
then you were looked at as a
turd. And like, if, you know,

1138
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:39,780
if you weren't bitching louder than the
guy next to you, then you're, you're,

1139
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,230
you know, Oh man, I'm so disappointed
we're not going to Afghanistan. Yeah,

1140
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:47,430
me too. I'm super disappointed. Like,
yeah, well I can't even sleep at night.

1141
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,260
Well, I don't even want to
fucking go, you know, like,

1142
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,820
yeah, I just realized just to
shed some light on to everyone.

1143
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:58,300
So when you deploy in a seal
platoon or a seal troop,

1144
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:00,220
you can deploy different
parts of the world.

1145
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,130
Sometimes you deploy to places
like Iraq and Afghanistan,

1146
01:14:03,131 --> 01:14:07,150
which as we just kind of discussed,
that's what everybody wants to go. Well,

1147
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,920
95%. Well,

1148
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,990
you never know what the real number is
because there's somebody that don't want

1149
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,720
go. But there's, there's the attitude,

1150
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,940
most guys want to go and
they want to go fight,

1151
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,720
but there's also you have to deploy to
other parts of the world where there's no

1152
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,840
war going on. You might just deploy
to the Pacific or you might deploy,

1153
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,450
in this case you calm
is for European Command.

1154
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,640
So that's going over to Germany and doing,

1155
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:32,820
doing things out of Germany in different
parts of Europe and it's definitely not

1156
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:37,780
a high threat environment. And so
yeah, and that's the way it goes.

1157
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:42,040
Sometimes there's a mission that has
to be done and it's a different kind of

1158
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:42,341
mission.

1159
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:45,250
You're going to build relationships
with other countries and you do these

1160
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:47,950
exercises and do training events,

1161
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:52,600
but it's not generally what guys
are excited to do in the seal teams.

1162
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:55,610
So there's always, there's
always, uh, you know,

1163
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,650
I always get asked that question when
I, when I go and talk to seals is, hey,

1164
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:03,220
my guys are going here. How do I keep
them on, you know, how do I keep them,

1165
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:03,550
hey,

1166
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,540
how do I keep them engaged when no one
wants to do it or they don't care about

1167
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,430
it? It's like, yeah, you've got to
work through that. It's definitely,

1168
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:10,323
it's definitely

1169
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,180
because, you know, I would
imagine, especially if you know,

1170
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,010
like that you're going to Yukon and then
starting that workup because you still

1171
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:22,820
have to go through the workup
and train as if you know,

1172
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,940
your fucking life depends on it and you're
going to war and you know that you're

1173
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,690
the elite, you know, Warrior and, and
you have to be ready for anything.

1174
01:15:32,691 --> 01:15:36,650
So you like, obviously
our training is, um,

1175
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:41,630
developed around that, but then
having to keep up that motivation,

1176
01:15:41,631 --> 01:15:44,540
like it's, it's one thing
when you're like, fuck,

1177
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:49,520
do this training sucks and it's,
I'm tired, it's hot. Um, you know,

1178
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:54,850
like fucking covered in shit or whatever
and I've got to hike 12 miles carrying

1179
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:57,020
this thing. And it's like, well,

1180
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,120
you gotta do it though because we're
going to fucking war like this. Serious,

1181
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:05,080
you know? But then it's
like, oh, don't you come in?

1182
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:09,290
Why the fuck are we even training
today? You know what I mean? But, uh,

1183
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,550
I don't know. So I didn't really
have that, that attitude though.

1184
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:16,760
I was kind of excited to,
you know, I had just gotten,

1185
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,640
we had just done that that year deployment
to Afghanistan and it was, you know,

1186
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:25,790
in my platoon was the one that was
really, really shitty, shitty living.

1187
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:30,470
The other two platoons were in
Nice spaces that they were like,

1188
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,850
had an awesome Jim's like good
food and, and stuff like that.

1189
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:38,180
And uh, you know, so I, I wasn't,

1190
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:41,480
I wasn't too terribly
upset about it. Obviously.

1191
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:46,400
Like everyone wants to go work and
kill bad guys like a champion, but,

1192
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:50,870
uh, you know, when you, when you
got to do that, it is what it is.

1193
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,640
You might as well fucking enjoy it.

1194
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,340
And that's why I feel I might
as well make the most of it.

1195
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:59,780
At what point did you
start Jujitsu? I started,

1196
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:04,070
I started Jujitsu
actually, um, in buds. Uh,

1197
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,250
that was my introduction, um, to buds.

1198
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,190
One of our buds instructors was, he,

1199
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:15,800
he was interested in Jujitsu and
liked it or whatever. And uh,

1200
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:21,200
so as a punishment, one day we
had to do wet and Sandy Jujitsu,

1201
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,090
like introduction to Jujitsu.

1202
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,300
And like a lot of guys were,

1203
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:30,860
were not enjoying it because one,
if you've never done Jujitsu,

1204
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:34,460
you're 100% going to get fucked
up by anyone who has done it.

1205
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,860
And we were wet and Sandy,

1206
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,950
so it was like just cold and
wet and miserable and sandpaper,

1207
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,880
like grinding on each other, you know.
But I actually really enjoyed it.

1208
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:48,380
I was like, Holy Shit, this is
pretty cool. And uh, one of the guys,

1209
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,160
there was two guys in our
class that were both, uh,

1210
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:56,360
really high level wrestlers
like in high school and, um,

1211
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,170
and they were probably like on
a blue belt level, you know,

1212
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:03,920
they were probably like 130 545 pounds.

1213
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:07,700
And at the time I was
around 180 590 pounds.

1214
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:12,890
I had done never done Jujitsu ever or
wrestled or anything like that. And,

1215
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,360
uh, I always punched, you know,

1216
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:17,240
I knew I punched hard cause
I've been in a lot of fights,

1217
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:22,250
like street fights and shit and bar
fights. But, um, art at that point,

1218
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:25,760
sorry, I wasn't bar fights. It
was like high school fights. Um,

1219
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,680
dodge ball fights, right? I did get in
a dodge ball fight once, no bullshit.

1220
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,460
And, uh, so anyway, these,

1221
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:40,090
these little guys just tied me in a
fucking knot and I was just so impressed

1222
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:44,720
like, because looking at these
dudes, I would be like, 100%,

1223
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:49,640
I'll fuck this guy up in a fight. And
we, you know, they were like, all right,

1224
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:53,240
no striking, you know, no punching, but
we're going to grapple. And I'm like,

1225
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:56,750
okay, and we're grappling and they're
just completely fucking me up.

1226
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,750
And I was like thinking, oh my God,

1227
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:04,870
if these little itty bitty men can tie
me in and not like this and just make me

1228
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,900
helpless, like, imagine what
I could do if I learned this.

1229
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,440
So I started rolling with one of my
friends who was like six to 240 pounds at

1230
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:22,000
the time and just super
aggressive. And, uh,

1231
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:27,320
he was probably around a
blue belt level of knowledge.

1232
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,810
Um, maybe not quite a blue belt, you know,

1233
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:34,340
but he knew definitely more
than I did and we, you know,

1234
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:39,290
he was really aggressive too. And, and,
and he was like all about rolling. Um,

1235
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:43,850
so we would roll No-gi and he
would just constantly were,

1236
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,130
this is in bugs or in buds and then
buds in the nest gt. Um, you know,

1237
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:53,060
buds was the introduction to it. And
I was like, Whoa, I, I fucking loved,

1238
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:53,720
this is cool.

1239
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,700
And then I started talking to one of my
classmates who is also into it and you

1240
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:02,090
know, he had done, he had done some
training before the navy and like I said,

1241
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:04,790
he was around a blue belt level.
So when you got to team 10,

1242
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,920
did you start training immediately
or one of the academies?

1243
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:12,210
I didn't start training, um, at one of
the academy's until after Afghanistan.

1244
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:16,950
I came back and, uh, cause one of the
guys, one of my, like my see data, he was,

1245
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,550
uh, he was a purple belt at the time.

1246
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:25,590
And um, we would roll
on occasion, you know,

1247
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,270
in, and he would be like, and he would
tell me like, man, you have like great,

1248
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,330
you know, aggression and an
ability and all this shit, but you,

1249
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:37,360
you got to go to an academy.
And learn, you know,

1250
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,050
and I'd only learned just from that guy,

1251
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:44,310
that dude beat my ass over and over
and he would literally like just,

1252
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:49,710
just fucking get on top pressure
grind, arm triangle, you know?

1253
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,050
And he'd be like, all right man, you know,

1254
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:55,920
I got on top of you and I fucking
arm trying to squeeze like that.

1255
01:20:55,921 --> 01:21:00,420
Don't let me do that again. I'm like,
all right, got it. You know, try harder,

1256
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:03,710
try harder, you know, you know,
you got to do something. No,

1257
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,770
you're not doing anything. You know what
I mean? So it was one of those. So, uh,

1258
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,280
I had gotten pretty good at just getting
my ass kicked and dealing with a big,

1259
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,000
large human or whatever.

1260
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,890
So then when I actually
showed up to an academy, um,

1261
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,620
I had been doing that for a
couple of years, you know,

1262
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:27,510
with him and never put on a gear or
anything like that. But then afterwards,

1263
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:29,910
yeah, he was like, you got to
join gym. So I joined a gym,

1264
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,900
put on the g and then really
like, that's when my Jujitsu, I,

1265
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:37,200
I'd say really started my journey.

1266
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,730
And that was in 2012 did you have
someone to train with on your Yukon

1267
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:45,930
deployment? Um, yeah, uh,
trained with my, see Daddy,

1268
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,880
he was there and uh,

1269
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,710
I trained and you come like we were
obviously going to different countries,

1270
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:57,510
so I would go and hit up different gyms
and the different countries and then all

1271
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:02,040
the other, uh, the other countries, seal
teams, you know, that we worked with.

1272
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,310
There's always someone who's
into combatives, you know,

1273
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:09,320
so I would basically just find
out who that guy was. Yeah.

1274
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:13,220
Who wants to get some. And then we'd
roll the mats out and fucking train and,

1275
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,520
and I was trying to get guys into
Jujitsu back then and I was telling them,

1276
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:17,821
you know,

1277
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:22,710
it's a great workout and people are just
looking at me like that's not a fucking

1278
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:25,830
workout. And you know, you're not
lifting weights, you're not running,

1279
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:29,910
you're not. I'm like, dude,
it is a workout for sure.

1280
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:31,950
And it's, you know, one that,

1281
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:37,190
that I thought the reason I liked Jujitsu
specifically was because it was like a

1282
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:42,120
deadly martial art. You know,
I could fucking choke you.

1283
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,230
And like your, you're tapping your, you're
asking me like please don't kill me.

1284
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:51,810
You know? And that's what I thought
was fucking cool about it. And,

1285
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:55,620
uh, definitely one of the cool things
about it, you know, like there's,

1286
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,190
there's times where, I
dunno, yeah. Like we're,

1287
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:03,780
we're gunfighters I get
it, but your first line is,

1288
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,360
should be you like my, my body,

1289
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:12,690
what can I do with my fucking vessel that
I was brought into this universe with?

1290
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,620
Like versus you if I don't have
a weapon, if I don't, you know,

1291
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,540
it's just me and you.
Yeah. One-On-One. Like,

1292
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,080
yeah, I mean I got to see
like over and over again,

1293
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,540
just guys that didn't know how
to, I didn't know anything.

1294
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:30,630
And they'd get in a simple prisoner
handling situation and wouldn't be able to

1295
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:31,810
handle someone.

1296
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:35,260
And the only thing that they would know
to do was like bludgeoned them in the

1297
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:38,020
head, which is cool.
That's fine, I get it.

1298
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:43,240
But when you bring that person into the
detainment facility and they're freaking

1299
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:44,410
all jacked up,

1300
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,550
and then it turns out that they're
not the person you were looking for or

1301
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:53,290
whatever. And, and that just doesn't,
that's just not, that's just not cool.

1302
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,700
And it's not,

1303
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:59,230
it's not tactically the best thing to
do because you don't have the control.

1304
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,350
I mean, you can't count on punching
someone or hitting him in the head.

1305
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:06,820
You can't count on that solving the
problem. Whereas Jujitsu, it's like, yeah,

1306
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:11,200
no, I have this human under
control. Whereas you can, you know,

1307
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:16,030
you've punched people before that you've
nailed them and they shook it off like

1308
01:24:16,031 --> 01:24:20,860
it didn't even happen. Uh, you know, the
whole thing with like muscle strikes.

1309
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:25,660
I've see, I've had guys, I mean,
I've muzzle struck plenty of people,

1310
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:30,250
but I've had guys that
I've seen put the craziest,

1311
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:35,380
most aggressive muscle strike on a
dude and have the dude bleeding. Yeah.

1312
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:39,640
But like still fighting
and you think, yeah.

1313
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:43,960
And so, so yeah, from the people
are in fear for their life. Oh yeah,

1314
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,823
definitely.

1315
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:49,960
And they hate you and they hate
your society and they're a jihadist.

1316
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:53,320
It's like, yeah, they're that Mazel
strike if it doesn't knock them out,

1317
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:54,940
which ensure that it is possible.

1318
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,750
But the idea that that was just going
to stop someone in their tracks 100% of

1319
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:03,010
the time was completely
ludicrous. Now with Jujitsu,

1320
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:05,770
at least you're going to have
some control, more control.

1321
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:08,770
And even that's not 100%, you
know, cause you could, you know,

1322
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,130
you've got someone that's really small,

1323
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,190
get someone that's really big and
depending on your skill level,

1324
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:15,070
there could be issues there. But um, yeah.

1325
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:20,071
So you finally started training at a
school 2012 and then you just dove in all

1326
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:21,690
the way.

1327
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:23,100
Yeah, I started a,

1328
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,920
I started training at a
school in 2012 and um,

1329
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:31,830
started competing and Jujitsu.
Uh, you know, I really, once I,

1330
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,180
once I joined a school,

1331
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,710
I learned more in six months than
I did in four years. Of course,

1332
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,560
No-gi rolling with my
buddies, you know what I mean?

1333
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:43,800
That is just the blind leading
the blind essentially. Like,

1334
01:25:43,801 --> 01:25:47,550
who knows the most today and it's
like, you guys are all fucking wrong.

1335
01:25:47,551 --> 01:25:50,040
We're all teaching each other
wrong shit. You know what I mean?

1336
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:53,520
So I learned more in six months
than I did that whole time.

1337
01:25:53,521 --> 01:25:55,620
And so I'm at that point,

1338
01:25:55,621 --> 01:25:59,210
I'd really like fallen in
love with Jujitsu and, uh,

1339
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:05,030
I started competing all the time
and was really well because I was a,

1340
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,970
I was competing as a
white belt and, you know,

1341
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,600
but I had already had a shitload
of grappling experience, you know,

1342
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:15,890
with fucking big, strong dudes who
are just fucking me up then. Now,

1343
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:20,530
like now I'm the big strong guy
and I know a little bit and I,

1344
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:25,220
I've been in like hard situations
on the mat, you know what I mean?

1345
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:30,221
And then obviously just the
team guy just will to fight,

1346
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,420
you know, that's always
a different level. Uh,

1347
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,660
you can tell when you roll
with a, a team that even,

1348
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:38,490
even when a team guy's brand
new at Jujitsu, there's,

1349
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,330
they're still going to be there.

1350
01:26:41,331 --> 01:26:44,980
You can just tell that they're different
because their will to fight is,

1351
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,740
is generally higher. Um, so anyway,

1352
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:53,741
I started competing a lot and doing really
well and then started fighting and j

1353
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:57,170
doing really well and that
as well. And, um, you know,

1354
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,000
that led me to what I'm doing now.

1355
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,630
And then you actually took over when you
came home from your Yukon deployment,

1356
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,090
he took over the combatives
program. Yeah. Yup. I, uh,

1357
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:08,900
I took over the combatives program.
That was something that, you know,

1358
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:10,670
I felt like,

1359
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:13,020
uh,

1360
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:17,070
kind of lacked in, in
the seal teams. You know,

1361
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:21,660
I was very shocked at that. I was
surprised at that, you know, uh,

1362
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:26,160
obviously we're, we're, the
seals are the best in the world,

1363
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:31,070
you know, at what we do and,
you know, were gunfighters and,

1364
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,850
and all that shit. But I would,

1365
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:37,410
I imagined that are hand
to hand combat. You know,

1366
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,840
like everyone thinks
like, oh, fucking seal.

1367
01:27:39,841 --> 01:27:43,590
He must tap me on the shoulder
and I'll, and I'll die. You know?

1368
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,390
And it's true just for everyone who's
listening. That's definitely true.

1369
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,060
But, uh, I hadn't gone to that school yet,

1370
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:55,890
so I was like confused as to why
that wasn't a school or whatever.

1371
01:27:55,891 --> 01:28:00,600
So anyway, I, I felt like
with, at this point I was,

1372
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:04,110
I was, uh, competing
quite a bit and having,

1373
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:08,400
having some pretty good
success in the, uh, fight MMA,

1374
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:13,380
Jujitsu world. And I'd also had,
you know, real world experience,

1375
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,221
you know,

1376
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:17,970
a lot of real world experience dealing
with prisoner handling and stuff like

1377
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:19,740
that. And, um,

1378
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,870
and I just felt like I
felt like I could bring,

1379
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,863
um,

1380
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:33,510
I felt like I could do a good job
at leading the combative. So, um,

1381
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:38,430
I took that on board and, and
they gave me a shot. And, um,

1382
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:43,230
I rewrote the curriculum for combatives
that we used on the, on the east coast.

1383
01:28:43,231 --> 01:28:46,650
And, um, it was, it was
really good, you know, and I,

1384
01:28:46,651 --> 01:28:51,420
and I went into with the
operationally focused mindset,

1385
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:55,800
you know, not if you're doing it, I'm
all about Jujitsu. I love Jujitsu.

1386
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,160
However, if you're doing a
triangle choke on target,

1387
01:28:59,161 --> 01:29:02,110
something's probably gone terribly
wrong. Way Wrong, you know?

1388
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:07,220
But it's definitely not a
bad thing to know Jujitsu,

1389
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,050
you know what I mean?
Especially as, as an operator,

1390
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:13,770
you're dealing with human beings
and you're not just, you know,

1391
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:18,030
you're not just going to go in and
fucking kill everyone on target, you know,

1392
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,990
there could that happen. Yeah,
absolutely. But is that going to happen?

1393
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:26,970
Probably not. And you're going to have
to deal with human beings and you know,

1394
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
anything from just marshaling them
to a full on fight for your life is

1395
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:38,610
combatives related. You know?
So I covered all of that in my,

1396
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:44,010
um, program and, and I
really focused on, um,

1397
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,001
basic,

1398
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:50,001
simple things that you could
remember during a time of stress.

1399
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:51,181
You know,

1400
01:29:51,181 --> 01:29:56,181
like you're not gonna remember 12 steps
to an arm bar or something like that

1401
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,090
when you're in a situation and
you need it. You know what I mean?

1402
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:04,410
Especially in a combative
situation overseas. Like that's,

1403
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,890
your adrenaline is going to be going
like crazy. It's going to be fast.

1404
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:12,840
You need something simple, effective
and that, you know, that you can,

1405
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:17,940
uh, remember easily. And it's also, you
know, how it is like in a, in a workup,

1406
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,150
you're, you're, you're getting fed
through a fire hose essentially.

1407
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,610
And there's so much shit you're,

1408
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:27,450
you're learning and you're expected to
be proficient and like perfect that I'll,

1409
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:30,000
I'll it all of it before
you go out the door.

1410
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:34,320
So our combatives we didn't get
a whole lot of time, you know,

1411
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:35,340
it was like a two week thing.

1412
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:40,341
And so I really focused on developing
techniques and things that,

1413
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,570
you know, uh, and would also be, uh,

1414
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:49,860
effective, effective, uh,

1415
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,860
towards your enemy or your,

1416
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:55,230
your person that you're dealing with,

1417
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,140
but also mitigate risk to
the operator. You know,

1418
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:02,910
like muzzle strikes are great because
you can muzzle strike a hundred people in

1419
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:05,190
a row and your hands feel fine, you know,

1420
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:09,630
and you're not worried about breaking
your weapons and control. So, you know,

1421
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:14,610
that was kind of my focus
was operationally focused
mindset and um, you know,

1422
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,810
and, and on the west
coast I felt like, uh,

1423
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:22,830
from what I had seen going out
there and working with those guys,

1424
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:27,810
it was a lot of, uh, I felt like more
guys were interested in combatives,

1425
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:31,170
but there, it was more of
like a sporty kind of thing.

1426
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:34,080
Like they were up in the fight room
doing Jujitsu and stuff like that.

1427
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:38,220
And which, which I thought was
great. Like I said, it's better.

1428
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,860
It's definitely better
to, to, you know, have it,

1429
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,360
not need it than need
it not have it. And uh,

1430
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,610
so I think that it was good
that guys were doing that,

1431
01:31:47,611 --> 01:31:51,390
but I didn't think that it was
operationally focused enough. You know,

1432
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:55,950
like I don't think that you should be
training combatives and PT gear. You know,

1433
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:56,910
like I had my,

1434
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:02,470
I like the program that I up was all
scenario driven and it was all like train

1435
01:32:02,471 --> 01:32:06,700
like you fight and you know,
so in your, in your cammies,

1436
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:08,560
in your boots with your gear, you know,

1437
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:14,040
cause handling someone in PT gear
versus handling someone and you know,

1438
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:17,860
full kit is totally different as well.

1439
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,170
Yeah. Yeah. Well there's,
it's um, you know, I was the,

1440
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:27,310
the discussion that used to happen a lot
with all this stuff because believe me,

1441
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:32,050
I was in this discussion
for a long, long, long time.

1442
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:37,370
You, you reach a, or you get a ton of
fucking pushback. People are super busy.

1443
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:40,510
People are super emotional about, um,

1444
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:44,740
about combatives and you
know, I would always like,

1445
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:50,290
I wasn't, I wasn't as emotional as
I, I wasn't very emotional about it,

1446
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:54,340
but for me it was just like, hey guys,
need to know how to do this. This is,

1447
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:58,240
this isn't about emotion. This is about
just the facts of being ready to be,

1448
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,420
be prepared, being prepared on the
battlefield. That's what you need to be.

1449
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:06,490
And you know, one of the things
that people would say was, you know,

1450
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:10,300
um, the, like the speed shooting contests,

1451
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,720
you shouldn't do that because it
will take away from your operational

1452
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:17,110
capability. Okay, I get it. However,

1453
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:20,550
who does better on the range?
The guy that's like a, uh,

1454
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:25,090
a hobby shooter too, and then
goes out to whatever CQC,

1455
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:28,800
he's drilling nails all day long. It,
same thing with parachuting, like, Oh,

1456
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:31,060
okay. So I sky dive, whatever. I'm a,

1457
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:34,120
I'm a skydiver on the weekends and I
like to go down and have a ton of jumps.

1458
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,480
I have, you know, 2000
jumps with my slick rig.

1459
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:40,330
How do I do when I put a combat
equipment on? I do awesome.

1460
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:43,990
I'm way better than like a guy like
me cause I wasn't like a recreational

1461
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:48,440
skydiver when I've, I put equipment on
it was like, it was, it was a, yeah,

1462
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,330
I had to pay attention.

1463
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,930
Whereas the guys that were good skydivers
in the civilian side, they were good.

1464
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:57,480
Same thing with like, Oh, who's
going to do better? Um, in a,

1465
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:58,810
in a grappling match,

1466
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,370
a guy that wrestled in high school
with his gear on or a guy that didn't,

1467
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,530
you know, has his gear on.
It's like it doesn't matter.

1468
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:10,180
You get certain skill level and you're
going to do great and that's just the way

1469
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:13,930
it is. Now. What you can't do is just say,

1470
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:18,070
oh well we're never going to train
with gear on because there are certain,

1471
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:21,400
you know, it's like saying, hey, we'll
never get to train with the g if you,

1472
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:25,120
if someone never trained with the g
before and they go against some of the g,

1473
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,550
it depends on how long that person
has been training with the g four,

1474
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:32,560
because hey, no, g and g have
all kinds of similarities.

1475
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:34,030
They have all kinds of similarities.

1476
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:39,190
They also have some differences and
depending on how much you do of each is

1477
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,500
where you're going to kind of shake
out which one you're better at.

1478
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:46,450
But there are, there's so much
crossover between g and Nogi,

1479
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:51,510
between skydiving on the weekends and
skydiving in the teams and shooting on the

1480
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:56,920
weekends and shooting at a teams. The
way I was looked at, it was train more,

1481
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:00,410
train, train all the time with
everything, you know, as much as you can.

1482
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,980
And that's, that's how you get
better at things. But yeah,

1483
01:35:03,981 --> 01:35:08,630
that combative thing was, um,
it still is. It still is. It's,

1484
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:13,090
it's, it's hard. It's hard
to change. It's a shift, that

1485
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,750
taboo thing for some reason. And,

1486
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,480
and it totally depends
on who's who's at the,

1487
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:23,290
the head of the table. You know,
what, what their flavor is,

1488
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:27,370
what their take is on it. And if the
guy, you know, is like you or me,

1489
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:30,730
then it's like, hey, we're all going
to fucking, we all need to know this.

1490
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:33,520
We all need to do that. And then other
guys come in and they're like, ah,

1491
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:34,960
that shit stupid. We don't need that.

1492
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:37,750
Yeah. And I was, I was,
when someone would say,

1493
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,920
guy should be working on shooting,
I'd say, I totally agree. Absolutely.

1494
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,020
You know, give us a range, you know,

1495
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,350
in the building and we'll do that in
the building because that's without

1496
01:35:47,351 --> 01:35:52,030
question our primary weapons
system and you know, no doubt I,

1497
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:55,840
you want to be a great
shot for sure. Guess what?

1498
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:58,540
How many hours are you going
to shoot a day? I mean,

1499
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:01,750
are you going to shoot 22 hours a day
because you're going to have some time.

1500
01:36:01,751 --> 01:36:04,600
At some point we go, you know what,
let's get some other skills in here.

1501
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:08,470
You know, we might as well know. And
like you said earlier, you can't just go,

1502
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,500
you don't just go on target
and shoot everyone. There's a,

1503
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:16,780
there's a female, you know Dave Burke,
who's one of the guys at echelon front.

1504
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,240
Yeah. He, he has a,

1505
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,990
he has a story that he tells about the
first time he came face to face with

1506
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,350
looks like Iraqi woman that did not want
him in the house and he's, you know,

1507
01:36:26,351 --> 01:36:31,351
whatever 18 year marine at this
point and he didn't know what to do.

1508
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:36,520
Yeah. And it's like, yeah,
you, you, you need to train,

1509
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:38,800
you need to train to
handle those situations.

1510
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:43,190
And, and a lot of people, you know
that people are unpredictable.

1511
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:46,100
They are just totally unpredictable.

1512
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:50,210
And especially in a situation
where they don't know,

1513
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,240
like a bunch of people with guns and body
armor just busted up in their fucking

1514
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:55,700
house.

1515
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:00,700
Like you think that person's going to
be like just cool as a cucumber or calm

1516
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,510
like, I dunno.

1517
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:06,980
And then when you put hands on people
to people freak the fuck out and,

1518
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,551
and you know,

1519
01:37:07,551 --> 01:37:12,110
and you don't need to just
muscle strike everyone.

1520
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,590
Like you said, like if you do that,
you're gonna get shut down real quick.

1521
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:19,700
You know what I mean? And you
should be, as an elite warrior,

1522
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:21,650
you should be expected,

1523
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,760
or at least I expect people
to handle themselves. Like,

1524
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:30,790
and you shouldn't let this fucking Iraqi
woman just walk all over you or fucking

1525
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:35,540
flail around. Cause like, you don't
know what to do. I can't muzzle Stryker.

1526
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:38,780
I can't shoot her. So what, what do
I gotta do? You know what I mean?

1527
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:42,760
And if you've never, and that's
just like a woman, but if let, uh,

1528
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:46,280
now you have like a fighting age
male or something and you know, Oh,

1529
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:50,780
if he resists, I'll just kill. No,
that's not the case always. You know,

1530
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:55,500
it's definitely not like,
and uh, you know, it's,

1531
01:37:55,530 --> 01:38:00,530
you definitely don't want the first time
that you're handling a human being like

1532
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:04,230
that to be overseas when it's
real and they can, you know,

1533
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:07,950
very easily get to your shit
on your kit and you know,

1534
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,300
it can be a bad day or especially
like I tell people, you know,

1535
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:15,840
just think of like muzzle, muzzle
discipline and awareness. You know,

1536
01:38:15,841 --> 01:38:17,670
like when you have your gun,

1537
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:21,060
even at high ready and then you're
marshaling someone and they freak the fuck

1538
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:24,840
out. Now all of a sudden you've got a
hot weapon, like going around the room.

1539
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:28,920
It's just shit that there's so much
things that you, you need to think about.

1540
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:33,540
And uh, the more you do it, the more
comfortable you're going to be with it.

1541
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:36,930
And that was kind of
my mindset towards it.

1542
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:41,700
At what point did you realize
you were going to get out? Um,

1543
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:46,200
well I wasn't,

1544
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:51,090
I wasn't sure I was fighting and stuff
and I was just kind of doing that as,

1545
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:56,330
as for fun as a hobby on the weekends
and competing and stuff like that.

1546
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:57,480
Uh,

1547
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,480
and then I had gone out and trained at
Black House with some UFC fighters and,

1548
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:10,230
uh, I had already, I had always
like looked at the UFC, you know,

1549
01:39:10,231 --> 01:39:13,530
as I was, I was always a fan. Um,

1550
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:16,080
and I enjoyed fighting and stuff and,

1551
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:21,510
but I'd always looked at those guys like
they were kind of super human or like,

1552
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:23,600
like it was like the
NFL of fighting. Like,

1553
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,280
those guys are genetic freaks or
whatever. You know what I mean?

1554
01:39:26,281 --> 01:39:28,920
When you think of someone in the
NFL and you're just like, man,

1555
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:32,670
it must be nice to be born like
that, you know, or whatever.

1556
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:36,510
But fighting's kind of a
unique thing where I dunno,

1557
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:42,000
anyone can do it and uh, as long
as you just put in the, the work,

1558
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:46,650
you know what I mean? So, and
being a genetic freak helps too.

1559
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,650
But, uh, but I had gotten there,

1560
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:52,470
I had gotten the black house and I had
trained with some of the people in the

1561
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:57,390
UFC and I was just like, Holy Shit.
Like, I'm actually like doing fine.

1562
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:02,190
Like I'm hanging with these guys and,
and um, you know, talking to them and,

1563
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,160
and just kinda getting to
know some of these guys.

1564
01:40:05,161 --> 01:40:08,040
And it just made it a little more
human, you know? And it's like, well,

1565
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:10,650
what did you do before
you're a fighter? Like, oh,

1566
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:14,790
I fucking worked in a restaurant, you
know, I was a busboy or whatever. I was,

1567
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,570
uh, you know, this, that third.
And I was just thinking, you know,

1568
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:22,080
and they're all looking at me like,
dude, you're fucking navy seal like,

1569
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:25,320
and I'm just like, yeah, but
that's all I've ever known,

1570
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:29,640
and that's all I've ever done. I did
right out of high school, you know, and,

1571
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,720
uh, and I'm just me, you know,
and I know like, I'm not special,

1572
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:34,883
you know what I mean?

1573
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:40,280
And it just kind of made a ahead of
like a shift or like a realization,

1574
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,550
like, these are just
people just like you, and,

1575
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:49,860
and they just fucking stuck with fighting
and practiced it until they were good

1576
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:54,160
enough to beat, you know, the
competition and now they're here.

1577
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:58,600
And I was like, fuck, I, I could do that.
Like, I'm pretty good, you know? And,

1578
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:03,490
um, yeah. And I've been through some shit,
like, I could push myself hard, like,

1579
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,160
fuck, I can do this. And at the time,

1580
01:41:06,161 --> 01:41:08,530
like I was [inaudible] I'd already
been a seal for awhile and,

1581
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,290
and you know,

1582
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:16,410
I got to experience a ton
and life and just in war and,

1583
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:23,770
and just that whole lifestyle
and that whole thing. And, and,

1584
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:29,020
uh, I was just at a crossroads, you know,

1585
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:33,550
and I was like, well, I can stay
in and make a career out of this.

1586
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:37,150
Like I was planning on doing, I was
planning on staying in for 20 years.

1587
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:42,730
Um, and, you know, I can screen and, you
know, try and make it over there and,

1588
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:47,380
or I can get out and, and
kind of pursue this. And,

1589
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,880
and at the time I was 29 or, or, yeah,

1590
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:55,210
I was 27 when I was like
making this decision. And, um,

1591
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:00,790
I was like, you know, fighting this
kind of a young man's game and, uh,

1592
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:04,330
like you read earlier in the
beginning of this, like, you can't,

1593
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:09,310
you can't even pause time
waits for no one. And,

1594
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:16,000
uh, I was like, well, if I,
if I just keep down this road,

1595
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,080
I don't want to think like, what
if, or like regret, you know?

1596
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,120
And I was like, I've already,

1597
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:25,840
I've already been on this path for
a while and it's cool and all that,

1598
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:30,090
but I want to see what
else I can do. So I,

1599
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:34,570
and I was really fucking struggling
with, with that decision for a long time.

1600
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,780
It was stressing me out and,
uh, then once I just said,

1601
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:40,810
fuck it and this decided, you know,

1602
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:45,430
which way I was going then the like
all that stress, like relief this,

1603
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:50,290
it was a big reliever and uh,
yeah, cited to get out. And

1604
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,140
um, I got out in 2018

1605
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,300
how many amateur flights did
you have when you were in a,

1606
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:06,100
like 17 or something. And then, and did
you go pro while you were still in? No,

1607
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:08,200
they wouldn't let me. And that was like,

1608
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,830
it was so frustrating to
me because in Virginia,

1609
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:15,040
the amateur rule set is
the exact same as pro.

1610
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:18,460
So it's day before
weigh ins. Um, you know,

1611
01:43:18,461 --> 01:43:22,840
all strikes like initial
elbows, no Shim pads, you know,

1612
01:43:22,841 --> 01:43:27,580
it's four ounce gloves, no
head gear. It's, it's, it's uh,

1613
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:32,530
it's fucking pro. We're five minute
rounds. Uh, no, there were three,

1614
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:37,330
three, three minute rounds, three
minute rounds. Um, but some,

1615
01:43:37,331 --> 01:43:41,350
some of them had five minute rounds,
like I fought in North Carolina. Um,

1616
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,260
so yeah, it was no
different, you know, and uh,

1617
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:48,760
trying to explain that to like
my command and shit and I'm like,

1618
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:52,550
there is literally no
difference. And guess what,

1619
01:43:52,551 --> 01:43:57,551
like a punch from punch in the face from
an amateur feels the same from a pro.

1620
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,670
That's why I'll tell
you what her like those,

1621
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:03,770
that bruise that came from an amateur,
it would have came from a pro too.

1622
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,510
I talked to Tim Kennedy about this,

1623
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:10,340
like it's so crazy the army gave that guy
and gives him so much and he's a great

1624
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:13,130
guy and obviously an
incredible fighter. But yeah,

1625
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:18,110
I mean he was just full on just getting
after it red while it is still is. Yeah.

1626
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:21,740
And they support him. He's all,
it's awesome. It's awesome, man.

1627
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:26,741
I ran into total fucking roadblocks
left and right with my fighting and um,

1628
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:32,300
you know, and I used the
argument all the time. Like guys,

1629
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,530
you don't even stand same way. Yeah. He
was in the Marine Corps. Yeah. I taught,

1630
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,560
I taught the bamboo officer of the Marine
Corps just out there fighting in the

1631
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:44,810
WEC. But the, uh, the fuck go traded
Tim Kennedy, they, they sponsored him,

1632
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:49,040
like ranger up or whatever.
Yeah. We'll rangers up is,

1633
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:54,200
it's actually Tim's Co a company. No,
Tim. But for awhile Tim, Tim was like,

1634
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,540
he, I forget the exact story, but he,
he was sponsored by like the army.

1635
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:03,290
Yeah. For awhile they were using it as
like a recruiting tool. And then he said,

1636
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:03,920
listen,

1637
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,590
you can either keep paying
me a sponsorship or you can
just let me come back on

1638
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,750
active duty. And, and they were like, oh,

1639
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:13,310
that sounds like a good financial
deal for us. So yeah, Tim Tim's, yeah.

1640
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:16,060
And that's, and that's why
I kind of was forced to,

1641
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:21,130
to choose because I was running
into so much fucking bullshit and,

1642
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:23,930
um, you know, like glory,

1643
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:29,350
a glory had come to town and they were
doing a fight at the Hampton Coliseum.

1644
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:34,370
And, um, you know, at this
point I had already had quite a,

1645
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:38,660
quite a few fights under my
belt and had some, a popularity,

1646
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:43,700
I guess as a fighter. And, and
they had heard about me and, um,

1647
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,460
they invited me to,

1648
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,490
to fight on the show and Mike Tyson was
gonna be there and shit. And I was like,

1649
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:53,720
man, this is going to be a fucking
huge opportunity. It's on Spike TV too.

1650
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:58,610
And I was, you know, I was like,
can I, can I fight on this? And,

1651
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:03,440
and they were like, yeah, you know, we'll,
we'll see what we can do, blah, blah,

1652
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:05,990
blah. And then last, you know,

1653
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,550
last minute they told me no, you
know, and I was just like, fuck,

1654
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:14,060
if I would've been your boss,
you would've been fight. I know.

1655
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:18,440
And that's the shitty part is like,
you know, it depends on who's,

1656
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,030
who's at this at the table
at the moment. Hey, you know,

1657
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,100
now that I think about it,

1658
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:25,370
cause I'm just sitting here thinking
like there's probably a Po. In fact,

1659
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:29,690
I remember seeing some kind of policy
that they put in place at some point.

1660
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,080
I forget, even if it was yes or
no, or I forget, but they remember.

1661
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:36,230
But my argument to that was
like, all the time was like,

1662
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:38,570
like just same one with the
skydiving. You know, I'm like,

1663
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:42,410
guys fucking skydive all the time.
There's leapfrogs, you know, why not?

1664
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:47,240
Why don't the navy, why doesn't the
navy use me as a recruiting tool?

1665
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,400
You know, like, I, I wouldn't, I
don't want to get out of the teams.

1666
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:54,360
I want to stay in the teams, but I also
want to fight and like, I can do this.

1667
01:46:54,361 --> 01:46:59,130
Like I was ranked number one on the east
coast and two weight classes, you know,

1668
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:02,940
and I was like, I'm pretty good
at this shit. Like, you know,

1669
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:04,920
and it,

1670
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:08,270
I don't understand why we
don't utilize this, uh,

1671
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:11,520
utilize me as a recruiting tool,
you know, go to the fights,

1672
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:14,970
set up a fucking pull up bar, handout
tee shirts and try and hand, you know,

1673
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:18,840
or go to the, they had me
go to the national, uh,

1674
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:23,870
high school wrestling contest or a
tournament and they had me do like a

1675
01:47:24,691 --> 01:47:29,080
combatives demonstration and, and had me
go out there and wrestle with all the,

1676
01:47:29,081 --> 01:47:33,780
the high school students and stuff.
And Yeah, I fucking brought it.

1677
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:36,390
Yeah. I'll tell you what
I mentioned frog baby.

1678
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:42,300
Y'All was up at the California
state championships last year or no,

1679
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:46,780
it was 2019. I was like, hi, a
bunch of hyenas. I mean my, my,

1680
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:50,880
my daughter was competing and, but
you know, we're up there and the boys,

1681
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:55,680
they're just animals. They're animals.
It's, it's awesome to see. Yeah,

1682
01:47:56,130 --> 01:48:00,450
it's those dudes, those kids were
fucking taught and they fucking,

1683
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,200
they all wanted some shit.

1684
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:06,330
They were like [inaudible] cause I
was there in like Cammie Cammie pants,

1685
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:10,830
you know, and the fucking Blue
UDT seal shirts and, and uh,

1686
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:14,160
we brought the pull up bar
and, and you know, cause the,

1687
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:19,380
I think but buds likes, they try
to get wrestlers because wrestlers,

1688
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:21,300
you know, wrestlers,

1689
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:24,870
I don't even want to say wrestlers have
a good chance of making it through buds

1690
01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:27,090
because that's not true.
It's definitely not true.

1691
01:48:27,091 --> 01:48:30,990
It was slightly better transit or
normal. Right. However, however,

1692
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:36,050
wrestlers are used to a fucking grind
and that's probably why they're a little

1693
01:48:36,991 --> 01:48:41,991
bit more comfortable and used
to the grind factor of buds.

1694
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:45,570
That does not mean they're used to
getting cold and wet and dealing with all

1695
01:48:45,571 --> 01:48:48,750
that shit, but they're used to
dealing with the grind, so whatever.

1696
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:53,910
And they're competitive. So, uh, so
we went there and yeah, all those,

1697
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:57,360
all these fucking high school wrestlers
are looking at me like I got something

1698
01:48:57,361 --> 01:48:59,190
to prove, you know, or whatever. And,

1699
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:03,800
and I'm out there representing the
fucking seal team, so I'm like, Hey,

1700
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:07,470
I got something to prove to.
Let's go young buck. And, uh,

1701
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,910
so we, we didn't know it was a
good time, but I was like, why?

1702
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,480
Why don't they fucking, they're cool
with this, but not like fighting,

1703
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:17,250
like what's the difference? Like I dunno.

1704
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:22,890
So I just ran into tons of
frustrating headaches like that,

1705
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:26,400
and that's what really
ultimately decided to, you know,

1706
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:30,930
I was just decided to go go this way
and I'm glad I did. But, um, I, that's,

1707
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,070
you know, I gotta say like the seal
teams, I'd never tried to fight pro,

1708
01:49:35,071 --> 01:49:37,020
but like the seal teams
was totally support.

1709
01:49:37,021 --> 01:49:39,690
Like I would go and train
at places that give me,

1710
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,380
well the west coast was a lot different
than the east coast. You guys,

1711
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,890
you guys were definitely more
supported on that kind of stuff.

1712
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:49,380
Extra curricular things.

1713
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,710
So you get out. And then
when did you go pro?

1714
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:58,320
Uh, right after I got out. So you've
been pro for a year and a half,

1715
01:49:58,321 --> 01:50:01,440
two years right now. A year and a half.
How many fights profiles do you have?

1716
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:05,080
I've only done two
profiles so far. Um, I uh,

1717
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:09,510
won my first one by a TKO in
the third round. It was a good,

1718
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:12,720
really good fight. Um, uh, against, uh,

1719
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,350
another pro who he was
a pro boxer as well,

1720
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,290
and he had called me out and kind of
campaign for the fight or whatever and

1721
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:22,890
cool. So I obliged and uh, and then, uh,

1722
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:27,450
and then I did my, uh, LFA debut.

1723
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:32,700
Um, I fight in a Sunga. I don't know
if you've seen any pictures of videos.

1724
01:50:32,701 --> 01:50:37,470
I mean, I have, unfortunately, you
can't unsee it. You're welcome.

1725
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:41,550
No. Uh, so that's actually
my buddy, uh, Jeff gum.

1726
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:44,730
He owns that company. Yeah. So, um,

1727
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:49,740
so obviously like I try to support other
team guys and their ventures and stuff

1728
01:50:49,741 --> 01:50:52,550
like that. And you know, uh, um,

1729
01:50:52,830 --> 01:50:55,320
it was right up my alley with the, uh,

1730
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,470
I thought it was funny if I'll pretty
much do anything if I think it's funny.

1731
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:03,520
And, uh, so I, I fought in the sun go,
which is for those of you don't know,

1732
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:08,370
it's kind of looks like a, a
American flag diaper sort of thing,

1733
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:09,590
but it's, sorry.

1734
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:11,270
Yeah, well it's from Brazil.

1735
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:16,750
In Brazil there's a sun and there's a
Sung Gal and I think the Sunga guys like

1736
01:51:16,881 --> 01:51:19,580
the smaller one and the sun
gal is like a little bit,

1737
01:51:19,581 --> 01:51:24,581
but their speedos basically speed
up their speedos and dean lister,

1738
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:30,530
because he has so much Brazilian
influence in his brain,

1739
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:36,010
he went through his phase of
training with a Sung Gow and,

1740
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:40,400
and uh, the, those were some of the
worst years of my life to be honest with,

1741
01:51:40,401 --> 01:51:44,930
you don't know, know ourself.
We can't do that today. Yeah.

1742
01:51:44,931 --> 01:51:49,580
So, uh, I'm, I'm not, I'm
very anti Sanga and some Gal,

1743
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:54,530
but, but you, you know, you go for
it. Hey, it's if, if I wouldn't,

1744
01:51:54,531 --> 01:51:57,470
I would make me want to fight you
less if you were wearing that.

1745
01:51:57,471 --> 01:52:01,820
So you got that little psychological
edge or it was like confusing to them.

1746
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:06,680
Yeah. I mean, do you remember, were you
watching like UFC when everyone was,

1747
01:52:06,681 --> 01:52:09,500
when all the Brazilians were still
wearing them in UFC and they still do

1748
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:10,080
sometimes.

1749
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:15,060
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen some of them. Yeah.
But I thought it was funny. So, uh, I,

1750
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,510
so I got a little cut patch sewn
into it, so I go put my cup in it.

1751
01:52:18,511 --> 01:52:23,070
And that was my, my new
fighting attire and uh, yeah,

1752
01:52:23,071 --> 01:52:27,540
I went out, it couldn't
have, uh, I don't know.

1753
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:30,900
It was awesome. We'll
say that. Uh, I went out,

1754
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,280
I fought on LFA on national TV and um,

1755
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:40,290
I w it was during a military
appreciation fight and so we,

1756
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:45,530
they hosted the fight it at a
army base and it was in a hanger,

1757
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,500
you know, with helicopters. And
then we've got all these people,

1758
01:52:48,501 --> 01:52:52,160
all these active duty army people and
their uniforms and stuff in the crowd.

1759
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,570
And, uh, you know, here I am the,

1760
01:52:55,571 --> 01:53:00,170
the navy seal and the American flag
speedo and, and come out to fight,

1761
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:03,950
um, and got knocked out 30 seconds.

1762
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:08,750
So it's like good. Could get
really that much worse from here.

1763
01:53:08,751 --> 01:53:11,330
So that's cool. But now it was,

1764
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:15,920
it was actually they called it the
craziest 31 seconds in LFA history.

1765
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:20,330
I watched it. It was a lot of
time to watch fights. Yeah,

1766
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,880
I had time for one blink.

1767
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:29,030
I think you posted it somewhere. I
posted that I posted the little video.

1768
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:33,830
I mean which some, which so many people
were where so like they were like, wow,

1769
01:53:33,831 --> 01:53:37,610
I can't believe you posted this.
And like sat him down first. Right.

1770
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:42,260
Then you sit him down. No, so he had a
14 inch reach on me. He was six, six,

1771
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:44,870
three and I'm fucking big ass dude.

1772
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:48,200
And honestly like I didn't
even know like we were,

1773
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:51,770
we were real cordial with each other
like at Wayans and stuff like that.

1774
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:54,710
So I wasn't sure if like we were going
to touch gloves or not, you know,

1775
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:58,370
cause it's always kind of a, I feel like
they should just like make that a rule.

1776
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:01,610
Like you are, you, you, you either do
or you don't. It's a rule with me now.

1777
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:03,900
But, uh, I,

1778
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:07,610
I wasn't sure if we were gonna touch
gloves or not and like kind of coming out,

1779
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:09,140
dude, he honestly,

1780
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:13,460
he hit me like I didn't even know
he could reach me from where he was.

1781
01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:17,390
And it was just like, I think
from that, that, that big weight,

1782
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:22,400
I do a big weight cut and, uh, I
think it just, you know, just fucking,

1783
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:27,650
just put me on Queer street right away.
And, uh, so right out of the gates,

1784
01:54:27,651 --> 01:54:29,750
I, I was rocked and,

1785
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,700
and was kind of fell down and was just,

1786
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:38,690
he'd swarmed me and I was just getting
punches thrown at me, uh, left and right.

1787
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:42,530
And I'm just kinda like seeing
stars, trying to gain my composure.

1788
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:46,880
And then I finally like got backed
up in and a won against the cage and,

1789
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:52,220
and uh, gained my composure for a
second, landed a one, a clean one too,

1790
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:55,970
and, and dropped him and then a ran over,

1791
01:54:55,971 --> 01:55:00,920
like got excited when I dropped him
down, Kinda went over towards him and,

1792
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:02,240
and fucking just,

1793
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:05,900
I think probably my coordination was
just kinda off still from just getting

1794
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:06,734
rocked and,

1795
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:11,150
and I literally just tripped
right over head over him,

1796
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:14,660
over his body. And then
as we're both standing up,

1797
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:18,200
he fucking threw another
punch and that was it. So,

1798
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:20,870
and I was just like, God damn it.

1799
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:24,860
I'm a fucking navy seal on a army base.

1800
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,680
Like fighting in an American flag,

1801
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:30,500
speedo on national TV and
just got knocked the fuck out.

1802
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:38,180
[inaudible] you know, whatever.

1803
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:42,400
Know what to tell you that say, man,
you're getting out there. Hey, yeah,

1804
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:44,140
fuck good. You it is. There's,

1805
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,850
there's, there's going to be a winner
and a loser. That's right. And if you,

1806
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:50,970
the real losers are the ones that
are actually not getting in the ring.

1807
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:55,860
Hey, I know a lot, a lot more times than
not. I've come out Victoria. So, uh,

1808
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,730
it is what it is. I don't,
it didn't slow me down,

1809
01:55:59,731 --> 01:56:03,450
doesn't bump me out or
whatever. Just part of it.

1810
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,530
And I understand that going into it,
it's a risk. I'm willing to take your,

1811
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:10,590
what's your next fight? Um,
we're setting up one, uh,

1812
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:13,080
looking at August 25th and uh,

1813
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:18,140
Riverside hopefully with the LFA
so hopefully that goes through and,

1814
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:23,280
and I'll be all set to go right now.

1815
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:28,830
I don't care who it is, just I
just want someone, I don't care.

1816
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:32,730
Like I, I never really care who
my opponent is. Honestly, I don't,

1817
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:36,960
I don't look at really their
skill set or I never have really,

1818
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:41,961
I don't care because I've
dealt with people just so
much in like combatives and,

1819
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:45,570
and Jujitsu and fighting.

1820
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:49,500
It's just like people are unpredictable
and that's what I stick with.

1821
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:54,501
Like you may think you have a game plan
figured out and then all of a sudden

1822
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:58,320
they do something different. And I don't
even want to be thinking about, oh,

1823
01:56:58,321 --> 01:57:01,230
well I thought he was going to do
this and I had this set up for this.

1824
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:02,760
And you know what I mean? Like

1825
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:07,440
I know what you mean. I will say this,
when you find out who your opponent is,

1826
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:10,500
you got to watch him. You got to watch
some, you got to at least figure out,

1827
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:12,990
because there's people that have things,

1828
01:57:12,991 --> 01:57:16,520
they have their game and if
they have that game and you,

1829
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:19,800
and you know about it as, you
know, like if, if you know,

1830
01:57:19,801 --> 01:57:23,790
I'm good at whatever, you'll
defend that thing. Right?

1831
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:29,430
And if you don't know it well then
I'll get you in that situation, right?

1832
01:57:29,431 --> 01:57:33,390
If you're really, let's like I'm
what we'll anybody, anybody, if you,

1833
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:35,700
everyone's got that thing at their
game that they're good at, right?

1834
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:38,330
And like in Jujitsu, hey, this
guy's got a good guillotine,

1835
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,880
this guy's got a good arm lock, this guy's
got flu. Good. He looks, or whatever.

1836
01:57:41,881 --> 01:57:44,850
Everyone's got their little
thing. And if they're good at it,

1837
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:49,290
then that's what they'll
kind of steer you towards.

1838
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:54,930
But, um, yeah. So I always, and
I always say, look, I get it.

1839
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,340
We don't care who the opponent is, but
when you find out who your opponent is,

1840
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:02,850
take a look, you know, set, send
it to me. Let me look at it.

1841
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:06,540
You know what I mean? Cause like I've
been watching these things forever to say,

1842
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:08,730
Hey, it looks like this guy has got this.

1843
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:11,610
And you also have to watch more than
you're going to watch like three or four

1844
01:58:11,611 --> 01:58:15,840
fights and see if they have any grappling
tournaments that are posted on Nagar

1845
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:18,710
whatever on Youtube, you know, and you
find out what kind of game they have.

1846
01:58:18,910 --> 01:58:21,930
And if you can do that, then you can learn
from it and you can take it into the,

1847
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,790
you can take it into the cage with you.

1848
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:28,350
Yeah, no, I'm definitely not opposed
to doing that at all. I just, uh,

1849
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:32,970
I just don't put all my eggs in
the basket. You know what I mean?

1850
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:36,000
That way I don't, if shit
doesn't go according to plan,

1851
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:38,340
like that's cool cause they're
just fall off too. Yeah.

1852
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,640
To evolve. But guess
what, they'll back to,

1853
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,960
they'll go back to what they're
good at. You know what I mean?

1854
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,970
So that's another thing to think about.

1855
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,700
Yeah. Cool. Um, I, uh, so that glory,

1856
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:52,980
that actual story, um,

1857
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:57,150
when I had gotten told no, uh,

1858
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,350
that I wasn't able to do that fucking
event and in Hampton roads, so I was,

1859
01:59:01,410 --> 01:59:02,850
I was really bummed out. And, uh,

1860
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:06,450
so I ended up actually just
calling the guy already,

1861
01:59:06,451 --> 01:59:09,270
like had decided at that point I
was like, you know what? Fuck this.

1862
01:59:09,271 --> 01:59:11,850
I'm getting out of the navy.
Like I'm, I don't want,

1863
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,600
I don't want to be told what I
can and can't do or whatever.

1864
01:59:15,601 --> 01:59:18,480
You know what I mean? Like, and uh,

1865
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:23,490
so I called the guy back and said, well,
when's the next one? And he was like,

1866
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:26,760
oh, we got, we got another, another
one coming up in San Diego. And I said,

1867
01:59:26,761 --> 01:59:31,080
put me on that one. And I, so I
just took leave and was like, yeah,

1868
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:34,110
I'm just going to San Diego.
And I ended up fighting in

1869
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:36,570
the Gloria San Diego.

1870
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:40,260
I just took leave and I went out
there and did it anyway and, uh,

1871
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,210
ended up knocking the guy
out in the second round.

1872
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:45,440
Right on. Good outcome. Well,

1873
01:59:45,441 --> 01:59:49,910
this is a pretty good spot since
we're up to current events. What else?

1874
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:52,940
I know you've got your supplement
company, you got shirts. What else?

1875
01:59:52,941 --> 01:59:56,440
How can people support what
you got going on? I would

1876
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,300
say the biggest, uh, biggest way
is probably on Instagram. Um,

1877
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:06,100
that's my really my only platform. Uh,
I put out a lot of content on Instagram.

1878
02:00:06,101 --> 02:00:10,330
I do a, my live streams from there. I
thought about doing a podcast as well,

1879
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:11,164
but, but, uh,

1880
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:14,680
I think I'm just gonna stick
to my Instagram lives and
just kind of treat them

1881
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:19,330
as podcasts or whatever. Uh, cause
I like talking and interacting with,

1882
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:23,410
with my supporters a
lot. And, uh, you know,

1883
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:28,560
so I figured people would get bored just
talking to me for a long time in a room

1884
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:33,130
like this. I don't know. But,
uh, yeah, I would say, uh,

1885
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:37,930
followed me on Instagram at,
uh, at Mitch Ag Yard. Um,

1886
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:42,370
and yeah, we've got a
supplement company. Um,

1887
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:46,330
our main product is a thing
called the smashing greens.

1888
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:50,110
That's what I gave you
today. And, uh, that,

1889
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:54,790
that actually is a blend of
different organic super foods. Um,

1890
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:58,690
so I watched this documentary
called fat sick and nearly dead.

1891
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:04,380
I don't know if you've seen it or not,
it's on Netflix. And, uh, this guy, he,

1892
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:08,560
he was really overweight and had this
some sort of skin disease and he ended up

1893
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:13,561
getting a juicer and ended up doing
60 days of just vegetable juice.

1894
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:19,270
And, uh, he ended up losing
a ton of weight and, um,

1895
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:24,790
his skin disease cleared up and just like
the doctors were just like blown away

1896
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:28,650
at, at, at how healthy he had
become, you know, just from,

1897
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:32,350
from doing all this and learned about
micronutrients and all this stuff.

1898
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:37,330
So I was like, man, that seems
like a cool, a cool thing.

1899
02:01:37,331 --> 02:01:41,510
Like I want to try it, you know, I've
never fasted before or anything like that.

1900
02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:44,300
And uh, went out and
bought a juicer and it was,

1901
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:49,630
it was a fucking pain in the ass to
clean that thing like three times a day.

1902
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,200
And I was having,

1903
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:57,250
I had to buy like $30 worth of vegetables
every day to make enough juice to,

1904
02:01:57,441 --> 02:02:00,890
you know, put into a glass that
would somewhat keep me full.

1905
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:05,240
And I was just like, there's gotta be a
better way than this shit. And so, uh,

1906
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:11,710
ended up going to a vitamin shop and saw
like organic freeze dried wheat grass

1907
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:17,630
and you just add water to it. And I was
like, oh my God, that's so much better.

1908
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:18,051
You know?

1909
02:02:18,051 --> 02:02:23,051
So I went and basically picked out a bunch
of ingredients that I did research on

1910
02:02:23,811 --> 02:02:26,990
that you know, things
that I wanted and um,

1911
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,330
and uh,

1912
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:34,690
put them all into like a Shaker Cup
and added water and drank it and did,

1913
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:40,400
did a fast that way. And uh,
it was obviously much cheaper,

1914
02:02:40,401 --> 02:02:42,650
much better, like just more convenient,

1915
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:44,390
way more convenient and
everything like that.

1916
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:48,950
And I just didn't have anything in
post on Instagram one day. And, uh,

1917
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:51,680
and so I just shared it
and I was just like, hey,

1918
02:02:51,681 --> 02:02:56,090
this is kind of a concoction that
I came up with and, and I do my,

1919
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:01,150
I do a five day fast like this and uh,
just kind of, it makes me feel good,

1920
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,140
helps me lose weight. And
then I started doing that,

1921
02:03:03,141 --> 02:03:06,320
like cutting weight for my fights and um,

1922
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,720
and then people, it just
fucking caught on like wildfire.

1923
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:15,230
Like everyone was like, what does that,
what does that? And then I was like,

1924
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:18,020
look, I'm not associated with
these companies at all. You know,

1925
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:21,530
like these aren't, I don't get it paid
for this. Like, this is just here,

1926
02:03:21,531 --> 02:03:25,760
this is what I do. And like put it,
laid it all out there and I was like,

1927
02:03:25,761 --> 02:03:29,690
you can get all these products on Amazon
or your local vitamin shop or whatever,

1928
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,480
and just made it as
idiot proof as I could.

1929
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,810
And I was just getting bombarded
with questions nonstop, but,

1930
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:40,940
but it was like a lot of people were
having like a ton of success fasting with

1931
02:03:40,941 --> 02:03:45,650
that and losing weight. So I was like,
well, that's pretty cool. You know, like,

1932
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:48,530
I'm really, I'm down to
help people, you know,

1933
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:53,360
better themselves and I enjoy like pushing
people and pushing myself and trying

1934
02:03:53,361 --> 02:03:58,100
to be better and everything. So, um,
so I stuck with it and just kept,

1935
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:00,080
kept answering all the
questions or whatever.

1936
02:04:00,081 --> 02:04:03,950
And then after like a year and
a half or so, I ended up, um,

1937
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,740
making my own, you know,
it's just like, well,

1938
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:11,060
I might as well fucking make this my
own products. And so I found a way to,

1939
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:14,240
to kind of make that come to life and, um,

1940
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:17,720
took all those products basically
and just put them into one,

1941
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:21,770
removed all the fillers and all the
bullshit in there and just was like,

1942
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:22,220
you know,

1943
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:26,390
I didn't know anything about the
supplement industry or anything like that.

1944
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:29,390
I just never intended on doing that,

1945
02:04:29,391 --> 02:04:33,950
but just Kinda came
about and, uh, you know,

1946
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:38,280
delivered a product that was way more
convenient than everyone was already using

1947
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:40,920
and buying all these
other things. And now,

1948
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,900
now it's like my product and
they're able to support me.

1949
02:04:45,901 --> 02:04:47,670
And now it's like, I don't, you know,

1950
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:51,120
I don't have an issue answering these
questions now that you're buying my

1951
02:04:51,121 --> 02:04:54,770
product. You know what I
mean? So, um, now it's,

1952
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:59,780
it's been super awesome because we've
had just a ton of people lose so much

1953
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:05,880
weight and like my brother lost
110 pounds, you know, using it.

1954
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:09,310
So it really works, which
is cool, you know, and,

1955
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:13,170
and it's really helpful for people and
it's changing their lives and like,

1956
02:05:13,171 --> 02:05:15,510
I'm all about that. And now,

1957
02:05:15,511 --> 02:05:19,230
like it's supporting me financially
now that I'm not out, you know,

1958
02:05:19,231 --> 02:05:21,150
in the navy anymore, cause I didn't,

1959
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:25,230
I didn't get a retirement or anything
like that. I just got out. So, um,

1960
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:27,740
so yeah, that's super cool. And, and, uh,

1961
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:32,870
the supplement in a company like now
that I've been in it for a little while,

1962
02:05:33,330 --> 02:05:37,440
like I'm starting to get
more understanding of it and,

1963
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,560
and, uh, we're, we're doing

1964
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:46,470
pre-workout protein bcas, all that
stuff, like kinda expanding it and,

1965
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,150
and, um, you know, now I'm like
really involved with it and,

1966
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:55,650
and I'm just treating it like
everything else. Like I always tried to,

1967
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:57,750
uh, you know,

1968
02:05:57,780 --> 02:06:02,780
under promise and over deliver and like
I always want to make sure that like

1969
02:06:02,821 --> 02:06:06,090
people are getting like
something good, you know,

1970
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:10,440
I don't want to ever feel like I gypped
someone or got one over or something

1971
02:06:10,441 --> 02:06:13,530
like that. Like when people
come to use my products,

1972
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:18,300
like I want them to be like a
fucking satisfied for certain means,

1973
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:22,620
best policy to have, make the best.
Yeah. Stuff. Just don't skimp. You know,

1974
02:06:22,621 --> 02:06:27,420
like my, my, my, my end game
is not to make the most profit.

1975
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:31,800
Like I want an actual good fucking
product like that. My name is behind,

1976
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:35,880
you know, and I'm proud of what's
the, uh, what's the website? Um,

1977
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:41,720
you can either go to smashing frog.com
or massive supplements.com m a s F

1978
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:48,870
supplements.com. Either one, they
go to the same place, but yeah. And,

1979
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:52,200
uh, we got tee shirts
and stuff, but a, I'm,

1980
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,060
I'm basically streamlining
my tee shirts, uh,

1981
02:06:56,310 --> 02:07:00,810
cause I had massive apparel and I
just made a bunch of tee shirts that,

1982
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:05,520
that I wanted to make, you know,
that were like personal in the me.

1983
02:07:05,521 --> 02:07:08,430
Like the mindset is everything.
Attitude is contagious.

1984
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:10,710
Don't be a Polisci be humble, you know,

1985
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:13,710
these are shirts that like I've kind of
made all the shirts that I want to make

1986
02:07:13,711 --> 02:07:18,360
and I made them, I was kind of a t
shirt snob, uh, before I had my company.

1987
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:23,220
And then once I made my company and
like got into the apparel industry,

1988
02:07:23,221 --> 02:07:26,520
like I just wanted like really
comfortable, nice fitting,

1989
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:30,600
good quality tee shirts and
printed my own shit on them.

1990
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:32,070
And that's all I wear now.

1991
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:36,910
But I'm just streamlining it down
to a couple that I like. And, um,

1992
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:42,490
I'm actually launching a new brand
pretty soon that I'm very excited about.

1993
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:47,530
Cool. Cool. Right on, right? Yeah. So a
few follow me on Instagram. You'll, uh,

1994
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:52,060
you can keep up with all that stuff
I've got going on and, and, uh,

1995
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:55,420
watch my future fights. And
hopefully I don't get knocked out.

1996
02:07:58,020 --> 02:07:58,853
Echo you anything.

1997
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:04,540
What happened with that dodge ball
fight you're talking about? Oh Man. Uh,

1998
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:07,330
it was oddly enough, it
was in a church also.

1999
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:13,000
So I got into a dodge ball
church fight, dodge ball church.

2000
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:17,860
Did you win that one? I did. And uh,
knocked the guys tooth out. Um, we,

2001
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,600
we were there to, uh,
practice our dodge ball and,

2002
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,870
um, we were taking it
very seriously. You know,

2003
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:30,520
cause there was a tournament coming
up that I think had like a $500 prize,

2004
02:08:30,521 --> 02:08:35,290
which when you're like
16, $500 is a million.

2005
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:39,400
Yeah, that'll go a long way.
Go a long way. So, you know,

2006
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,310
the stakes were high and
uh, we were, we were,

2007
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:46,960
we were there and there was some
local jokers that were just,

2008
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:47,853
you know,

2009
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:52,810
not taking it seriously and like just
fucking with our practice and stuff.

2010
02:08:52,811 --> 02:08:55,450
And, and there's one
thing that makes me angry,

2011
02:08:55,660 --> 02:08:59,760
legitimately angry is when people are
taking dodge ball service, you know, just,

2012
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:03,610
and it was, there was a
time for joking around,

2013
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:05,980
there was a time for
seriousness and you know,

2014
02:09:05,981 --> 02:09:08,440
that wasn't the time
and ended up, you know,

2015
02:09:08,441 --> 02:09:11,770
I ended up saying something to this dude
and just you just kind of fucking mouth

2016
02:09:11,771 --> 02:09:15,640
off and you know, tempers,

2017
02:09:15,670 --> 02:09:18,490
tempers flared and escalated. Yeah.

2018
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:23,520
Things escalated and ended up getting
into like a full on brawl like dodge ball,

2019
02:09:23,921 --> 02:09:28,470
dodge gang girl. It was a dodge
brawl dog from dodge ball.

2020
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:31,030
So thank you. That's a good time.

2021
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:36,520
Awesome. Um, Hey, speaking
of fighting, sure.

2022
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:41,230
And smashing things, sir. W I mean Echo.

2023
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:46,090
Yes. We want to be better at fighting.
We want to be better at living.

2024
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:48,520
What do you got? What do you
got for us? I got a few things.

2025
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,000
So we'll start with Jujitsu, right?

2026
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:56,200
You're no good. Better. Um,

2027
02:09:57,470 --> 02:10:02,470
I'm starting to like Nogi better I would
say just because I feel like it's more

2028
02:10:02,841 --> 02:10:06,920
applicable to the cage.
However, um, you know,

2029
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:10,670
like Jocko was saying earlier,
I, I agree wholeheartedly.

2030
02:10:10,671 --> 02:10:15,671
I think that everyone who trains Jujitsu
should train in a g as well because,

2031
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:17,511
uh, you know,

2032
02:10:17,511 --> 02:10:22,511
there are a lot of similarities and I
feel like if you only train Nogi and then

2033
02:10:22,611 --> 02:10:24,630
you go against someone with a,

2034
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:28,070
put a Guiana with any sort
of decent skill level,

2035
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:32,420
you're gonna get fucking choked
for sure. And uh, it just,

2036
02:10:32,421 --> 02:10:34,250
the geese everything down

2037
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:38,360
and it's a, it's a totally different
animal. And the thing is like,

2038
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:43,390
you can train in a GE all the time and
take the g off and roll with someone

2039
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,870
No-gi and you're, you're going to do
fine. You're, you're still doing Jujitsu.

2040
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:51,710
You know what I mean? It's a different
game, but it's not that much different.

2041
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:55,160
But going from No-gi to g very different.

2042
02:10:55,610 --> 02:11:00,030
So that's why I think, I think people
should definitely train an ag still. Yeah,

2043
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:04,010
agree. Yeah, both is best for sure. Yeah.

2044
02:11:04,011 --> 02:11:07,580
The g adds these elements
that if you only train No-gi,

2045
02:11:07,581 --> 02:11:08,810
you're not used to those elements.

2046
02:11:08,811 --> 02:11:10,760
And if someone else is
used to those elements,

2047
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:14,930
all the Nogi l most of the Nogi
elements are in the Geek. You know,

2048
02:11:15,150 --> 02:11:18,650
like those elements are there for the
most part of course close, you know,

2049
02:11:18,651 --> 02:11:21,080
like using like if you were
getting a street fight,

2050
02:11:21,081 --> 02:11:25,490
like you can use clothes like a g. So it
gives you even that many more options.

2051
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:29,870
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I
agree. Well speaking of g is
what g we're going to get,

2052
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:33,710
everyone's doing Jujitsu. No, I
feel like it's growing essentially.

2053
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:36,770
So what kind of gear are we
getting? Origin G, you know,

2054
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:37,850
why are we getting origin geese?

2055
02:11:37,851 --> 02:11:41,630
Because they're made in America and
they are factually the best skis in the

2056
02:11:41,631 --> 02:11:45,530
world. Rash guards as well. Okay. So where
do we get, and we get them at origin,

2057
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,840
maine.com that's also where we're
getting jeans. Yeah. By the way.

2058
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:52,190
And I got mine by the way,

2059
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:57,710
approval level 100 you know,
always reluctant to sing, you know,

2060
02:11:58,610 --> 02:12:02,840
101% approval. But here I'm going to say
it 101% approval because they exceeded,

2061
02:12:02,841 --> 02:12:06,040
literally exceeded my expectations.
Your expectations were high worry?

2062
02:12:06,150 --> 02:12:08,720
100% I was like, yeah, the way you're
talking, the way they, you know,

2063
02:12:08,721 --> 02:12:11,090
PD does a good job in building
these things up. You know,

2064
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:15,410
he's taking close up pictures
of the buttons coming out
of the factory that it's

2065
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:19,190
really good. So I'm like all right,
expectation, expectation level is high.

2066
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:23,930
100% these have to be five star jeans
essentially. They're like five star plus.

2067
02:12:23,931 --> 02:12:25,970
Some added things that I
was impressed with. So yes,

2068
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:28,100
a hundred per 101% approval. Yes.

2069
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:33,200
So jeans you can get
them shirts, rash carts,

2070
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:38,540
southern stuff, supplements. Yes. So
what kind of supplements? Joint Warfare,

2071
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:40,010
which I'm happy man.

2072
02:12:40,011 --> 02:12:43,130
I've been on the joint where if I think
it's been one year consistent joint

2073
02:12:43,131 --> 02:12:47,360
warfare crew oil, so
approved, 100% approved,

2074
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:49,460
actually adding value,

2075
02:12:49,461 --> 02:12:52,520
providing value even beyond what
you might think in the beginning,

2076
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:54,370
cause you don't want, you
know, when we're young,

2077
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:58,610
we're all young guys or
whatever, you don't care that,

2078
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,650
you know you have muscle
soreness, you have all this stuff.

2079
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:03,680
What are the joint soreness is one of
those things that just kind of creeps up

2080
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:06,500
on you. But if you're on top
of that, that doesn't take it,

2081
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:09,410
it'll take you out of game if you're
not ready. Preventative. Yeah.

2082
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:13,460
And when it comes by, and I, I'd get
like elbow stuff from lifting and stuff.

2083
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:15,800
Uh, but if,

2084
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:19,940
if I was on like joint warfare
glucosomine could join any,

2085
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:22,940
any one of these things that they did
recommend when I started grappling.

2086
02:13:22,941 --> 02:13:27,200
By the way, if I was on that, I would've
never got out of the game at any point.

2087
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:32,160
Last point is get your joint warfare,
get your crew in, stay on that.

2088
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:35,550
Get your discipline to
fully get your discipline.

2089
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:40,920
Discipline is like all day now. Yes sir.
That's kind of where it's going. It's,

2090
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,320
yeah. It's like, yeah, guess
what? I'm just drinking. Oh,

2091
02:13:43,321 --> 02:13:47,510
I'm just going to have some discipline.
Right. It's kind of poured this a,

2092
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:51,930
is this what you're talking about? Yeah.
Yeah. It's just hastiness and goodness.

2093
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:56,040
[inaudible] mission. Is
this a pre-workout? Yeah,
it's, it's not like a super,

2094
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:59,460
um, there's not like a
super caffeinated deal.

2095
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:01,890
Cause I don't drink a lot of caffeine
and I don't want to drink a lot of

2096
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:05,940
caffeine. So yeah, you little cognitive,

2097
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:10,200
a little physical. Okay. And
you just sip this all day?

2098
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:14,670
Yeah, I don't have like some in them.
I won't drink it like after dinner,

2099
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:15,570
you know,

2100
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:18,840
because I d there's a little bit of
caffeine in it and I don't drink a lot of

2101
02:14:18,841 --> 02:14:19,710
caffeine. So

2102
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:22,010
not even in the mornings when
you're, when you're waking up?

2103
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:25,580
Nope. Okay. So four 30
says a little bit 15 teeth.

2104
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:29,630
The white tea has some caffeine in it
too. So I guess I do drink caffeine,

2105
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:32,510
but I don't drink high
doses. Like, like a,

2106
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:37,000
like a monster energy drink or
whatever. Yeah, it makes sense.

2107
02:14:37,001 --> 02:14:41,210
Speaking of energy drink, we got an
energy trans coming out, but it's,

2108
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:46,180
it's actually good for you, which
is completely, it's like we,

2109
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:50,570
it's hard to call it an energy drink
because energy drink puts it in a,

2110
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:56,180
in a category with things that are
actually horrible for you. Right?

2111
02:14:56,181 --> 02:14:58,370
Like the normal energy drinks
that are just horrible for you.

2112
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:02,030
This is something that you
can legitimately just drink
and it's good for you.

2113
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:06,980
Yeah. So that's coming out only you'll
see some cans of that in the near future.

2114
02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:09,060
Oh yeah, that's a good one. Also milk,

2115
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:13,370
if you want a dessert,

2116
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:16,340
if you want extra protein in the
form of the dessert, that's it.

2117
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:21,590
Milk all flavors. I like that. Just say
if you want a dessert. Chocolate. Yes.

2118
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:23,563
Big Mint chocolate,

2119
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:28,790
chocolate protein as well. And
I was in my, my protein, our uh,

2120
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:33,380
my supplements took a long
time to come out like way.

2121
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:38,200
I'm sure if you've encountered whenever
you're dealing with any kind of putting

2122
02:15:38,201 --> 02:15:39,034
out something,

2123
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:43,270
it never goes according to plan and is
always longer than you're expecting or

2124
02:15:43,271 --> 02:15:47,380
whatever. And I had done a mint
chocolate. I that was just,

2125
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:50,980
I've been a huge fan of mint my whole
life. Mint, chocolate, whatever,

2126
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:53,470
deliciousness. And uh,

2127
02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:56,770
and I saw that you put out a mint
chocolate and I was like, God damn it.

2128
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,120
Everyone is going to think of the coffee.

2129
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:03,650
I don't have the patio with a mint
chocolate or they'll probably think like,

2130
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:04,131
Dang,

2131
02:16:04,131 --> 02:16:07,160
I thought I was the only one who loved
mint chocolate better than everything

2132
02:16:07,161 --> 02:16:08,100
else. Like, you know,

2133
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:12,380
we all kind of do Jacko and
about seals both like Jujitsu,

2134
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:16,140
but like men chocolate. Yeah. Will, same
thing with Pete. Right? I mean, not,

2135
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:19,040
not the navy seal thing, but wait, was
he into mint chocolate or peanut butter?

2136
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,260
Ah, he was in the meant,

2137
02:16:21,290 --> 02:16:26,190
but I think peanut butter c the peanut
butter was kind of like the second wall

2138
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:29,000
and started smashing. Well, yeah.

2139
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:31,660
And that makes sense because
in my family, you know,

2140
02:16:31,661 --> 02:16:34,930
I'm not disclosed like my favorite
dessert is this or that. I'm not that,

2141
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:38,860
you know. But I will say that when you
came out, it's almost like, you know,

2142
02:16:38,861 --> 02:16:43,180
you're, you're going public with your
mint chocolate, uh, love admiration.

2143
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:44,800
I was like, Hey, hey, me too.

2144
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:49,760
But peanut butter chocolate has always
been my close, close second. Yeah.

2145
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:50,560
Easy money.

2146
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:55,330
But the one that really does
strawberry because it's just so,

2147
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:59,910
yeah, good. Oh yeah. But, and
strawberry's a staple anyway. You know,

2148
02:17:00,090 --> 02:17:02,380
just like staple everything but
so vanilla, but I'm not over here.

2149
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:06,250
I'm not over here, uh, jumping up and
down about vanilla. Yeah. But some people,

2150
02:17:06,251 --> 02:17:07,270
I know, some people are,

2151
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:12,160
I've got a cinnamon toast
crunch for teaming out and
I've got to think of a name

2152
02:17:12,161 --> 02:17:15,910
for it because I don't think I can
legally call it the cinnamon toast crunch.

2153
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:21,280
I don't know. I don't know what the
rules are. I thought about thinking of a,

2154
02:17:21,281 --> 02:17:25,730
you know, growing up, uh, I always
had, we were kind of not so, uh,

2155
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:30,780
financially gifted when to call
it that living in a trailer.

2156
02:17:31,130 --> 02:17:35,650
And um, my mom would always get fruity
dyno bites, you know, there you go.

2157
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:37,360
And Cinnamon Toast squares.

2158
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:41,230
So I used to eat those out of the bag.

2159
02:17:43,210 --> 02:17:47,330
That's not what the
other kids eat one size.

2160
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:50,500
Especially once I joined the navy
and started getting, you know,

2161
02:17:50,501 --> 02:17:54,910
a good paycheck. I just, I
never, you know, I never, again,

2162
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:58,000
I always appreciated my cereal game.

2163
02:17:58,001 --> 02:18:01,840
It was always the good
stuff. Rudy pebbles,

2164
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:04,960
when a real snow fruity dynamites
in this house get out of here.

2165
02:18:04,961 --> 02:18:07,030
With that comes in a bag.

2166
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:13,240
Little kids need food. That's where I
got warrior kid milk, strawberry boom,

2167
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:18,280
chocolate. Yup. Let them eat and be
healthy in or God that Jocko White Day.

2168
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:21,190
Yeah. Maintaining. Yeah. Yeah.

2169
02:18:21,191 --> 02:18:24,430
My wife gets lit like she hits a point
in the day where she's like, man,

2170
02:18:24,431 --> 02:18:28,900
I'm considering just to go to bed right
now or the bus out of Jocko white tea

2171
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:33,190
and just get after it as literally says
that. Yeah. And I know the feeling,

2172
02:18:33,191 --> 02:18:34,960
but man, she's really
committed to it though.

2173
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:38,950
You got to take a go to you gotta take
something or may create a supplement of

2174
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:43,130
some kind for a little power nap
because working on it, you know,

2175
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:47,990
I did start a rumor that you take
naps. No, I freely admit that freely.

2176
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,490
Yeah. He's very open about
it. I wrote, I wrote about it,

2177
02:18:50,491 --> 02:18:55,420
I wrote about it in the district. It was
free and field. I, if I'm really tired,

2178
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:59,740
I elevate my feet above my heart and I
sat in alarm and I'll sleep for eight

2179
02:18:59,741 --> 02:19:04,030
minutes and eight minutes. Eight
minutes. Power now. Yup. And if you go,

2180
02:19:04,031 --> 02:19:07,060
I mean sometimes I'll go 10
but if you start going 1520,

2181
02:19:07,061 --> 02:19:09,700
then you then you're like
legitimately you'll feel groggy.

2182
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:13,120
But you know the deal man from just like
you were talking about sleeping in a

2183
02:19:13,121 --> 02:19:15,940
helicopter. Like you wake up from those
things and you're totally on fire,

2184
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,400
you know, sleep for 10 minutes,
eight minutes, whatever.

2185
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:23,630
I have no problem with this. I, the
problem with me is a, I don't know,

2186
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:28,490
I tend to nap better than I
sleep. Um, and the like when I,

2187
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:32,480
when I wake up, my brain just
starts going and it just,

2188
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:35,930
once that happens, it's
just, that's it. I'm up.

2189
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:38,630
So when you say a supplement
for power adapted,

2190
02:19:38,631 --> 02:19:42,410
like helps you get into like power nap
state, like that guy, I don't know,

2191
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:48,320
we'll look into it. We'll
work in it. It could be your,

2192
02:19:48,321 --> 02:19:52,190
your cinnamon toast crunch. A flavored
situation. Yeah. Have you taken hypnosis?

2193
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:56,420
Oh yeah. So origin. So we have, we
have this thing called hypnosis,

2194
02:19:56,421 --> 02:19:59,210
which is like a sleep. Yeah.
But that's not for now. In

2195
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:03,223
[inaudible] eight minutes.

2196
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:07,130
It's usually you'd take a rail of
it and you're out for eight minutes.

2197
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:10,280
Just fully recharged. More power
nap. I'm working on it. Well wait,

2198
02:20:10,281 --> 02:20:12,110
but technically in, I don't know,

2199
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:14,570
this just seems like this
is true power nap king,

2200
02:20:14,571 --> 02:20:17,660
you know you have like what the
five phases, right, of sleep or

2201
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:22,760
actually of insomnia. Yeah.
So yeah, so you can have,

2202
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:27,510
you probably get jammed up somewhere
in one of those stages. Right?

2203
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:31,850
Power nap is stage one, I
think. I'm pretty sure it's
only stage one. Power nap.

2204
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:33,560
I, it depends on how tired you are.

2205
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:35,900
Well then it won't be
considered a power nap.

2206
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:39,920
If you're like super tired and you go
boom all the way. Faith stage five sleep.

2207
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:43,460
But you went to bed. Do you have sleep
apnea or anything? Nope. No. Yeah,

2208
02:20:43,461 --> 02:20:46,700
I don't have, I did a sleep study
and I don't have sleep apnea,

2209
02:20:46,701 --> 02:20:51,701
but I have insomnia and it's like I wake
up enough not to actually wake me up,

2210
02:20:52,490 --> 02:20:55,870
but like, it's like I wake up,
no, don't even know I'm awake. Oh,

2211
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:58,550
you know what I mean? So I
wake up, when I do wake up,

2212
02:20:58,551 --> 02:21:01,400
I'm fucking still exhausted. That's great.

2213
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:08,960
Actually. So one of the, I actually
have a CBD line as well. Um,

2214
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:13,570
which I don't know if you get into the
CBD at all. Not really. No, no. Um,

2215
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:16,890
but one of the products
that we're launching is um,

2216
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,440
a thing called green dreams
and it's a rapid dissolve.

2217
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:24,800
It's a rapid dissolve tablet and you put
it under your tongue and dissolves in

2218
02:21:24,801 --> 02:21:26,450
like 10 seconds and it's um,

2219
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:31,070
25 milligrams of CBD and
10 milligrams of Melatonin.

2220
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:34,130
So, but no one wants that.

2221
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:37,670
That's not for an eight
minute power nap, power nap.

2222
02:21:37,671 --> 02:21:41,350
That's the going to bid situation.
That's a go to bed slow ration.

2223
02:21:42,570 --> 02:21:42,920
Right on.

2224
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,680
Well the opposite of that is Jocko white
tea cause you don't take that before

2225
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:48,170
you go to bed. Maybe after you
wake up in the middle of the day,

2226
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:52,640
like my wife or whatever. Also if you're
into dead lifting, which we all are,

2227
02:21:52,641 --> 02:21:57,050
of course it'll increase it to 8,000
pounds proving by the way, double blind,

2228
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:01,760
triple placebo situations. No joke. Also,

2229
02:22:01,761 --> 02:22:05,300
we have our own store. Jocko has
a store, it's called Choco store.

2230
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:09,760
We go rash guards doing
shirts. Tee shirts.

2231
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:14,510
You want to represent while on the
path. Oh, there's Rutgers hats. Yeah,

2232
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:18,980
for those of us that like
trocars, which apparently we do.

2233
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:22,810
They're nice. One size fits
all. What about flex fit tech?

2234
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,340
I did the flex fit for a while, but you
know I got a small head weight flex.

2235
02:22:27,341 --> 02:22:29,850
It has two sizes though. I know.
Yeah. So you're going to get,

2236
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:33,630
you got to get the small medium or the
large XL and I don't know nothing about

2237
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:37,470
the even about that at all.
And get back to it. Hoodies,

2238
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:40,110
hat snob over here. Yeah.
Hoodies. Lightweight.

2239
02:22:40,111 --> 02:22:44,460
And do you find youth for
lightweight Hoodie? Definitely.

2240
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:49,190
All the time. Year round? Yes sir. I
agree. Not everyone agreed with that one.

2241
02:22:49,990 --> 02:22:53,310
[inaudible] yes, some will. Yes. So the
ones we have, yes, they have zipper.

2242
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:58,080
I'm a fan. I'm a fan of the zipper. The
zipper light Hoodie with the pockets.

2243
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:59,940
Agree. I honestly,

2244
02:22:59,941 --> 02:23:04,370
I don't even have any of my own in
my apparel line at the moment, but a,

2245
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:09,360
I'm a fan of those. Yeah. Yeah. Well
Dang. Dang. You know what I mean?

2246
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:11,850
Either dispatcher or heavy hoodie.

2247
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:14,310
That's where it's all
functional and I get it,

2248
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:18,330
but that's like a g zip zipped up,

2249
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:23,280
a non or a zipping lightweight should've
fucking little bit. Yeah, please.

2250
02:23:23,281 --> 02:23:28,100
Some warm guard without for sure. And
you know, hopefully it looks good.

2251
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:29,640
Hope you, hopefully you liked the design,

2252
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:31,860
but you will be representing
while you're on the path.

2253
02:23:31,861 --> 02:23:36,390
A lot of good stuff on there. Jocko,
store.com some patches on there too.

2254
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:40,140
I reordered some more patches are
coming in. What I did, I made a mistake.

2255
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:44,340
I made a mistake. I don't
want to go too deep into it,

2256
02:23:44,341 --> 02:23:49,200
but it resulted in patches not
being available for a little while.

2257
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:53,310
They're going to be available, you know,
you can't buy what's not available.

2258
02:23:53,311 --> 02:23:56,940
So yeah. Yeah. That's what they're telling
me too. And I was like, Dang. Okay.

2259
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:00,120
All right. So, you know, you learned
something new everyday and uh, you know,

2260
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:03,910
speaking of which, right on top of
things, I'm trying to be chair to beat.

2261
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:08,280
It'd be anyway smashed
the light button. Oh,

2262
02:24:08,281 --> 02:24:10,590
my daughter keeps saying that to me. She,

2263
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,030
and she doesn't even know what that means.

2264
02:24:12,031 --> 02:24:15,450
I think she halfway knows what that
means. She's like smash the like button.

2265
02:24:15,451 --> 02:24:18,420
And I was like bred the video that you're
pretending to make doesn't even have a

2266
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:20,340
like button. You need to just,

2267
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:23,760
I got to cut it on and I got
to stop her from saying that.

2268
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:24,480
That's what I gonna say.

2269
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:26,860
But if you're in the mood to
smash the homework about Dana,

2270
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:31,230
if you want to subscribe to this podcast,
you can still do that if you want one.

2271
02:24:31,231 --> 02:24:34,440
Where have you listened to podcasts
talking about the warrior kid podcast,

2272
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:39,620
which there are now three new warrior
kid podcasts live at this time.

2273
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:45,060
Good one. Stories from Uncle Jake.
Yeah. Stories that teach lessons.

2274
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,970
An interview with John Bozak,

2275
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:51,360
the warrior kid artists
that drew Mikey the dragons,

2276
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:53,850
talking about how to get better at art,

2277
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:58,920
how to use art as a tool
to better at other things.

2278
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,150
How's Goodman those good that
those like do you do any art?

2279
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:08,020
I didn't draw in my books. No, but
I mean, yeah, I can draw. Yeah.

2280
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:11,340
He sent me a man and I'm
going to post this online.

2281
02:25:11,341 --> 02:25:13,410
Everybody can seal
paintings. Oh, for real.

2282
02:25:14,370 --> 02:25:18,000
Have you been into that for like a long
time or is that like a new situation?

2283
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:18,510
Uh,

2284
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:23,510
did my first painting in
2000 Easter of 2016 yeah.

2285
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,060
It's okay. Let new car. Oh yeah. Like,
Oh, when I was three I did my, no, no,

2286
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:29,130
definitely not. Yeah.

2287
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:34,510
Jocko has the original logo where I
have the original logo of echelon front.

2288
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:38,200
Jockos design actually
designed some other stuff too,

2289
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,630
so he drew it right.

2290
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:45,310
But so the disconnect was that I drew it.

2291
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:49,060
I didn't draw it on with my
hand. I drew it on the computer.

2292
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:52,720
Like I drew it on power
point. It's so bad. Oh,

2293
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:56,800
it's so funny because when I first, when
he first sent it to me, I'm like I had,

2294
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:59,350
of course you drew it on
PowerPoint then you know,

2295
02:25:59,351 --> 02:26:02,650
it's not like you have one of those
pads and stuff, your chocolate,

2296
02:26:02,651 --> 02:26:06,580
you don't have that kind stuff. So, but
it's not as obvious when you get it.

2297
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,620
You just get the finished product and
it literally looks like my daughter drew

2298
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:12,010
it with her left hand. She's
right handed by the way. And,

2299
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:13,630
but the concept was legitimate.

2300
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:17,770
Do the sound is what the national
and front logo is at this time.

2301
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:22,030
That's what you're pushing and man
received. But the community part of it,

2302
02:26:22,031 --> 02:26:26,740
I tried to explain it to
you nine different times
and you kept sending me back

2303
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:30,910
junk. I said, okay, pictures
worth a thousand words.

2304
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:34,420
I don't feel like explaining this a
thousand times. Let's just send him a,

2305
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:38,590
a rudimentary sketch of the concept,

2306
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:42,670
which you then chiseled out
into, you know, glory. Yeah.

2307
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:48,640
Emphasis on rudimentary by the way. But
the comedic part of it is how it looked.

2308
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:51,760
It looked like a child drew it. So now
anytime, like if you ask them, oh yeah,

2309
02:26:51,761 --> 02:26:55,270
have you been into art? Boom, that
flashes in my head and he says, yes, boom,

2310
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:58,810
makes it more funny. I'm going to post
it online so we all can have a good laugh

2311
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:03,580
nonetheless. Yes. Work at podcast is out.

2312
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:07,600
That interview with John Bozak is very
good, like especially like cause it is.

2313
02:27:07,601 --> 02:27:09,910
He talks about getting like
frustrated with stuff and goes,

2314
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:12,520
I told y'all and his
little kids so it was good.

2315
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:17,530
Don't forget about warrior kids soap from
Irish oaks ranch.com that young Aiden

2316
02:27:17,531 --> 02:27:22,300
is making on his farm. You
get soap, you can stay clean.

2317
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,540
Of course. Also we have a youtube channel.

2318
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:30,690
If you're interested in the video version
and see when Mitch looks like Hell

2319
02:27:31,181 --> 02:27:33,070
Yeah, I'm handsome.

2320
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:37,830
You might be the Buffet's guests
we've ever had, right? I Dunno.

2321
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:40,780
Buffets guests like out of 185 yeah.

2322
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:44,370
We've only had like probably
10 or 15 gap to Kennedy.

2323
02:27:45,770 --> 02:27:46,950
Kennedy, Kennedy touched,

2324
02:27:47,010 --> 02:27:51,310
you know how many fucking times people
you and Tim Kennedy need to fight.

2325
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:55,780
And I'm like, have you seen Ken
Tim Kennedy's way bigger than me?

2326
02:27:55,781 --> 02:27:58,630
First of all, 85. Yeah.

2327
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:04,020
And what do you fight at 71 70 walked
around and I have fun at one 85 as well as

2328
02:28:04,331 --> 02:28:09,160
a champion. I want to 85 to um,
I've walked around close to 200.

2329
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,580
No, Tim is like to 15 to 20.
He's a big dude. Awesome.

2330
02:28:17,230 --> 02:28:21,260
Just in passing. Um, I shook
his hand one time, but yeah,

2331
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:23,700
he's a big dude. And uh, but I was always,

2332
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:28,670
always telling me like that's not w way
of like kind of like similar stories.

2333
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:31,040
Like there's, it wouldn't make
sense for us. Definitely. Yeah.

2334
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:34,940
We just want to see and see
what a psychological warfare

2335
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:39,950
is. An album with tracks. Wait,
wait, no. Back to youtube.

2336
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:42,640
We have a youtube channel. I'm
going to Devin. I'm going to, uh,

2337
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:45,860
what I call explain the value
of Youtube. You just did,

2338
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:47,870
you can see what Mitch looks at.
That's just part of the value.

2339
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:52,250
That's just like the, a big part. I
mean, donuts, don't undersell that.

2340
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:56,480
It's huge. But you know, we have some
excerpts on those. What I was gonna say,

2341
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:59,240
you know, if you don't want
to watch the whole podcast,

2342
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:03,130
there's excerpts on there anyway. Some
of them are enhanced by Echo. Yeah.

2343
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:08,230
So puts his art work onto the video and
they might be slightly better than my

2344
02:29:09,681 --> 02:29:11,150
original echelon front.

2345
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:14,870
Maybe low gun and maybe a little bit
better than there's something were over

2346
02:29:14,871 --> 02:29:19,010
enhanced. Yes. Some people think, some
people think they're under enhanced. Yes,

2347
02:29:19,011 --> 02:29:22,490
I would agree with both guard lists.
Nonetheless, we have a youtube channel.

2348
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,560
That's the point. Yeah.
And if you want to,

2349
02:29:24,561 --> 02:29:28,550
you can smash the like button. Sure.

2350
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:33,740
Comment, subscribe, whatever the three
things they always say anyways. Yeah.

2351
02:29:33,741 --> 02:29:35,450
Psychological warfare
is an album with tracks.

2352
02:29:35,451 --> 02:29:40,130
If you're running into
moments of weakness, put in
psychologic warfare, you'll,

2353
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:44,330
it'll solve your problem. No weakness,
weakness, uh, overcome. If the,

2354
02:29:44,331 --> 02:29:47,690
if you want the visual version
of that, go to flip side,

2355
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:54,220
canvas.com my brother Dakota Meyer has a
little company where he's making things

2356
02:29:55,581 --> 02:29:58,200
that you hang on your
wall, artistic thing.

2357
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:01,600
Some people call them artistic
things and you can uh,

2358
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,670
get those if you want him
to make a special one,

2359
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:08,930
you hit him up on Twitter to
some customer if it's like,

2360
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:13,190
if it seems to get some traction. Yeah,
he can put it out. Yeah, he's good.

2361
02:30:13,191 --> 02:30:16,430
He's doing good stuff on there. Yeah,
I check them out from time to time.

2362
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:20,540
Flip side, canvas.com also on it.

2363
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:24,050
So you got on it.com/jocko or you
can get a lot of good stuff on there,

2364
02:30:24,051 --> 02:30:26,900
including kettlebells, other
workout stuff and bring my routine.

2365
02:30:26,901 --> 02:30:31,220
I'm going to Hawaii by the way,
for one month. I know people,

2366
02:30:31,221 --> 02:30:35,210
people really don't.
They Undersell Hawaii.

2367
02:30:35,211 --> 02:30:38,780
I feel like I feel that the same way when
I went there for the first time I was

2368
02:30:38,781 --> 02:30:40,280
blown away. Where'd you go?

2369
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:45,740
I'm Maui and I'm a lot
who I'm gonna cry. Yeah.

2370
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:50,120
One month I heard this beautiful. Yes
sir. It is. So I'm bringing the rings.

2371
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:51,920
Your request, by the way,

2372
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:56,750
that was one of the selling points of
rings is that you can bring them places

2373
02:30:56,990 --> 02:31:00,080
too. That wasn't really my request.
There was a statement, yes. Statement,

2374
02:31:00,140 --> 02:31:03,380
a recommendation recommendation
should be reluctant recommendation.

2375
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:06,050
You sure did. And it was a really,
it was a legitimate recommendation.

2376
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:08,780
Then the last I'm taking it, I'm
taking them to Hawaii anyway.

2377
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:11,180
Point is the rings. I have it from on it.

2378
02:31:11,181 --> 02:31:12,950
You can get those need
kettlebells you can get,

2379
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:17,660
I have this k they have this
mineral electrolyte like mix. Right.

2380
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:22,200
And I think I might've just
enhanced what I called the mega mix.

2381
02:31:22,201 --> 02:31:24,090
It's the pre-work. I'll
make a mix. There's two,

2382
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:27,560
there's one for just the one for lifting.
The one for Jujitsu is discipline,

2383
02:31:27,690 --> 02:31:32,100
one scuba discipline, little bit of
Gatorade. So it's a half Gatorade,

2384
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:35,460
half water, mixed, optional, Gatorade.
Some people they don't like Gatorade,

2385
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:40,080
some people. And that's cool. You can
put lemon juice in there if you want.

2386
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:44,970
Sure. Um, like I said, the discipline,
the electrolytes from on it.

2387
02:31:44,971 --> 02:31:49,350
And then uh, I want to add your
Greens. I'll hook you up. Yeah,

2388
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:51,780
that'll be the mega mega
mix. That's pre Jujitsu.

2389
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:54,580
Is there a certain time where
you gotta take those Greens? No,

2390
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:57,470
just whenever I get them,
make them on all day. Boom.

2391
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:59,070
So that's gonna be the pre Jiujitsu.

2392
02:31:59,071 --> 02:32:01,530
The pre lifting is
essentially the same thing,

2393
02:32:01,531 --> 02:32:06,390
except you put like the caffeinated pre
workout in it. If you're into it anyway.

2394
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:09,030
Anyway, back to on it.
That's where you get it.

2395
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,490
There's a lot of cool stuff
on on there. Quite a large,

2396
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:15,690
large human being yourself, man, looking
good. But I don't sound big though.

2397
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:20,460
Thank you. Perspective. I'm sorry.
Does my voice not match how I live?

2398
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:26,220
You know? I can't say because
you saw me. I saw you seen.

2399
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:30,990
Just started talking. Kind
of ingrained. There you go.

2400
02:32:31,460 --> 02:32:35,760
Maybe not though had had you not
spoke, I'd been like Dan. Yeah,

2401
02:32:36,150 --> 02:32:40,800
let's dudes probably fucking got a
jacked voice. Yeah, like junk. Yeah,

2402
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:43,680
but it's melodious. It's not
Jacqueline. Sorry. I have a,

2403
02:32:43,681 --> 02:32:48,630
I have a high pitched voice. Melodious
very melodious. Yes. Interesting. Anyway,

2404
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:52,020
got some books way to where
your kid three. It's out.

2405
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:53,610
It's called the where there's a will

2406
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:59,880
teaching kids about how to go harder.
That's a little lesson in this book.

2407
02:33:00,300 --> 02:33:01,320
Yeah. You got to push harder.

2408
02:33:01,321 --> 02:33:04,890
And also teaching them about their
ego and how their ego will get them in

2409
02:33:04,891 --> 02:33:05,724
trouble.

2410
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:10,080
Everyone wishes they would've learned
about ego earlier because it makes your

2411
02:33:10,081 --> 02:33:12,150
life better. Of course,

2412
02:33:12,151 --> 02:33:14,570
there's a way the warrior could want
and where the where could do Mark's

2413
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:18,870
mission. Those books are for
kids to learn to get on the path.

2414
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:23,100
If they're a little bit younger than
that, you can get a Mickey in the dragons.

2415
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,940
They can learn about how
to overcome their fear.

2416
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:32,160
There's actual pragmatic protocols
that you can take as a human being to

2417
02:33:32,161 --> 02:33:36,090
overcome what you're afraid of. Why not
learn that when you're five years old?

2418
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:38,460
That's my question. Why not?

2419
02:33:38,670 --> 02:33:40,890
Because you didn't know about the book
Mike and the dragons and now you know

2420
02:33:40,891 --> 02:33:44,010
about it. Your kids are just
out there conquering fears,

2421
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,360
which is a positive thing.

2422
02:33:46,130 --> 02:33:48,840
[inaudible] yeah, and that's a
good one too because you can like,

2423
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:51,720
you know if you have a bedtime routine
and then you read to your, you know,

2424
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:55,680
four or five year old before they can
read. It's one where you can read it.

2425
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:59,010
Not only can you read the whole thing
if you want to, it's like a 1516 minute,

2426
02:33:59,011 --> 02:34:02,940
you know, but they'll want to hear
it again. So it's like a, you know,

2427
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:05,760
so one year while you're
reading it over and over again,

2428
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:07,410
that lesson will be instead, you know,

2429
02:34:07,411 --> 02:34:10,920
ingrained and instilled deeper and
deeper than just one of the many books.

2430
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:12,890
Repetition. Exactly. Right.

2431
02:34:14,010 --> 02:34:18,070
Then we've got to discipline or freedom
field manual. If you go, Hey Jocko,

2432
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:20,530
can you post your workouts? Yes,

2433
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:23,170
they're in the discipline equals
freedom field manual. Hey Jocko,

2434
02:34:23,171 --> 02:34:25,060
what do you think you should do
in a situation like this? Oh,

2435
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:27,670
it's in the discipline equals freedom
field menu. Hey Jocko, will you eat?

2436
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:30,640
It's in the manual. What's your
sleep routine? It's in the manual.

2437
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:33,580
Do you take naps? It's in the
manual. It's all in there,

2438
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:39,220
so they just want it goes freedom field
manual, the guide to getting after it.

2439
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:41,170
If you want the audio version of that.

2440
02:34:41,171 --> 02:34:44,710
It's on iTunes and Amazon
music and all the MP3 things.

2441
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:48,160
Then of course we got extreme ownership
and that I got a [inaudible] of

2442
02:34:48,161 --> 02:34:52,060
leadership written by me
and my brother Leif Babin.

2443
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:57,990
Those are going to help you become a
better leader in your business with your

2444
02:34:59,561 --> 02:35:02,350
family and in your life. Watch it happen.

2445
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:04,840
Of course we have Ashkelon Front,

2446
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:08,740
which is my leadership consultancy and
what we do is solve problems through

2447
02:35:08,741 --> 02:35:12,430
leadership because all the problems that
you're having in your life right now in

2448
02:35:12,431 --> 02:35:14,800
an organization are leadership problems.

2449
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:16,870
I don't care what they are and if
you want to solve those problems,

2450
02:35:16,871 --> 02:35:20,830
you have to fix your leadership and
that's what we do. It's me, Leif Babin,

2451
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:25,990
JP Denelle, Dave Burke deal.
Yes. Flynn Cochran, Mike Cirelli,

2452
02:35:25,991 --> 02:35:30,340
Mike [inaudible] and Jason Garner. Go
to Ashkelon, front.com for details.

2453
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:32,500
We also have e f online,

2454
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:37,000
which is online leadership training,

2455
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:41,230
which is something that's
hard to comprehend.

2456
02:35:41,231 --> 02:35:46,231
How are you going to take leadership and
teach people leadership from an online

2457
02:35:47,441 --> 02:35:50,800
thing on online training
program? Well, you read about it,

2458
02:35:50,830 --> 02:35:53,200
you take tests on it and then
you get put in scenarios,

2459
02:35:53,230 --> 02:35:58,230
interactive scenarios on the computer
where you have to make decisions.

2460
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:00,700
So that's the f online.

2461
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:05,770
Then we have the muster,
which is a leadership

2462
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:09,010
conference to leadership event.

2463
02:36:09,150 --> 02:36:12,430
Something like ring of gathering data
and it's all, it's all in actually.

2464
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:15,400
The muscular is what it is.
Yeah, it's, it's a muster,

2465
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:19,450
but it's the mustard though. Must
Be. So look, the muster leadership,

2466
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:23,350
they've all sold out and
they're all going to sell out.

2467
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:26,860
The next one is September 19th
and 20th in Denver. After that,

2468
02:36:26,861 --> 02:36:28,840
December 4th and fifth
in Sydney, Australia,

2469
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:33,250
check out extreme ownership.com
for details. If you want to come,

2470
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:37,870
don't wait to register because then you
won't be able to go and you'll be mad at

2471
02:36:37,871 --> 02:36:42,640
me and I, and you'll send me a,
like, let's say you're my friend.

2472
02:36:42,670 --> 02:36:45,500
Let's say you're someone I actually
know. Sure. How'd you set it? And, and,

2473
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:50,110
and we're doing a muster
up in San Francisco and you
send me a Texas says, Hey,

2474
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:52,090
sorry for letting you know late. Uh,

2475
02:36:52,091 --> 02:36:53,950
you said you're going to hook me
up with some tickets. It's cool.

2476
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:58,360
I can make it and I'm bringing two
friends and I'm like, well, first of all,

2477
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:03,130
no, because it's literally sold out.
It's not like, hey, it's sold out,

2478
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:06,850
but we could still let people in. That's
not sold out. It's sold out. Yeah,

2479
02:37:07,390 --> 02:37:10,540
so don't wait. And then of course
we have VF, Overwatch, where we take

2480
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:16,160
proven combat leaders
from special operations,

2481
02:37:16,161 --> 02:37:19,760
from combat aviation and put them into
companies in the civilian sector that

2482
02:37:19,761 --> 02:37:23,150
need leadership. Leadership is the most
important thing on the battlefield.

2483
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:28,300
Why not get battle tested leaders to
help out you inside your business,

2484
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:34,780
go to e f overwatch.com and if
you want to ask me a question,

2485
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:39,500
us a question, you want to give me an
answer? Did I mess something up today?

2486
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:44,330
Probably. You want to let me know
about that. Please bring it. Mitch,

2487
02:37:44,390 --> 02:37:47,120
as he said, he is on Instagram.

2488
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:53,600
Mitch Underscore, AG,
e. R a. G. U. I. A. R.

2489
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:56,390

and on dash fight Boykin.

2491
02:38:02,830 --> 02:38:07,040
Cool. Echo is at Echo Charles
and I am at Jocko Willink. Echo.

2492

Anything else? Nothing else. Thank you.

2493
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,060
Thank you guys for having me very
much. I really appreciate the uh,

2494
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:18,590
hospitality and opportunity I
had to home. Awesome. Well Mitch,

2495

thanks for coming on.

2496
02:38:19,311 --> 02:38:23,500
I appreciate it and thanks for your work
in the teams and I'm sure you're going

2497
02:38:23,501 --> 02:38:28,501
to keep putting forth maximum
effort to smash people in the cage.

2498
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:33,620
Look forward to seeing that hey to all
the other vets out there and to those

2499
02:38:33,621 --> 02:38:38,420
that are still in uniform. Thank
you for standing. Watch over.

2500
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:43,480
Freedom for our great nation and to
our police and law enforcement and

2501
02:38:44,301 --> 02:38:49,301
firefighters and paramedics and EMT and
dispatchers and correctional officers in

2502
02:38:49,521 --> 02:38:53,120
border patrol, secret service
and all the first responders.

2503
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:58,720
I travel around the country and I run
into you all the time and I see what

2504
02:38:58,731 --> 02:39:03,731
you're doing out there working and
working hard and the reason that we live

2505
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:06,500
safely here in our country is you.

2506
02:39:07,390 --> 02:39:07,870
Okay.

2507
02:39:07,870 --> 02:39:12,400
So thank you for holding the line here
at home and everyone else out there

2508
02:39:12,401 --> 02:39:14,830
remember that you can't
hit the pause button,

2509
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:20,670
get it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter at all.

2510
02:39:20,671 --> 02:39:24,780
If you get knocked down or you get tripped
up or you think that something isn't

2511
02:39:24,781 --> 02:39:28,800
fair, it doesn't matter.
You still don't get to stop.

2512
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:32,080
So get back up,

2513
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:37,090
bite down on your mouthpiece
and go get after it.

2514
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:41,800
Good. Until next time,
this is Mitch Aggie,

2515
02:39:41,810 --> 02:39:45,410
r and Echo and Jocko out.
