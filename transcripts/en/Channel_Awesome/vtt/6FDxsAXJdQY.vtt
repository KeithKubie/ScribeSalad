00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.120
It's interesting how we go from a movie called Lilo &amp; Stitch,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.400
to its sequel Stitch,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.500
to its other sequel called Lilo &amp; Stitch 2.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.280
Though, in a way, I do kind of understand it,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.280
seeing how Stitch was obviously a pilot to a TV series,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.660
like Tarzan &amp; Jane was a pilot to a TV series,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.260
but then they come out with Tarzan II and Lilo &amp; Stitch 2,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.880
which seemed more like actual sequels.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.800
It's also interesting that the sequels seem to fall into the

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
slew of smaller stories.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.320
They definitely connect to the first one,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.800
but they're not as big or grand.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
And, well, with the exception of Mulan II, they're surprisingly kind of welcomed.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.600
I really enjoyed Tarzan 2, I thought a lot of great effort was put into it.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.740
And here, this one's not too bad either...

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.680
Nyeeeh, for the most part. We'll get to the bad stuff too.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.780
In this movie, Stitch has a glitch.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.200
He starts acting all evil, and attacking people, and doing all sorts of terrible things.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.420
But, it comes and goes.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.660
Eventually it's discovered that this came from a glitch that happened years ago,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.220
and the Russian alien is trying to figure out how to stop it.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.060
While that's going on, Lilo has this big hula competition

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.640
that she really wants to win, especially seeing how her mother won it years ago.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.580
And the rest of the story focuses less on alien encounters and explosions and ray guns,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.300
and more on them just trying to figure out what to do for the hula contest and keeping Stitch under control.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.540
Like I said, a much smaller movie,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.500
but for what it is, it's actually alright.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260
In the 1st film, I thought the sisters really stole the show,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.800
and in the 2nd film, I thought the aliens really stole the show,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.100
and here, it seems perfectly balanced.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
Both Lilo and Stitch are a ton of fun to watch, they're just adorable.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.080
I love how she's written like a real little kid

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160
and that sort of spreads to Stitch as well.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
The side characters, though nobody really knew, are a lot of fun to watch as well.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.680
Does that makes it as good as the 1st? Well, there are a couple problems.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.180
There's one or two awkward moments that just come across as odd.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.800
For example, the Russian alien knows that Stitch has a glitch and he's trying to put together this device.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.100
But he keeps it a secret for some reason.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.240
Why would he do that?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.280
Shouldn't everybody know that this thing can explode at any moment

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.480
and he can attack people, and seriously hurt them, or even kill them?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.200
Why is he keeping it a secret?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.340
He's sneaking around trying to get household items to build this device to save him,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.120
but why doesn't he just tell people?

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.420
I'll tell you why,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.760
'cause you have to have a scene where Lilo thinks Stitch is really bad,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.000
and Stitch does feel bad, and there's this misunderstanding,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.060
and it's stupid, it's so freaking stupid.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.580
There's also minor things like the romance between Nani and the boyfriend is kinda bland.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.220
Once again, I guess they never really got this right.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.980
Sometimes there's a read from an actor that clearly needed to be done again.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.540
And even the water-color backgrounds are a little too obvious this time.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.280
I don't know, I remember in the 1st film it was blended a little better,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.720
but here it just look super flat.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.120
And I know that's kind of the idea of water-color,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.200
but, I don't know, it doesn't blend as well here.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.260
Oh, and without giving too much away,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.660
there is a huge cop-out ending.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.360
There's a really emotional moment,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440
the acting is great, the animation is great

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.640
but then suddenly, it's just retconned

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.700
and they never explain why.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.600
It's just, kind of magic, I guess.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
Or, is it magic? Is it science?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.820
I don't know, it just comes out of nowhere,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.800
and they openly admit they don't know why it happened.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.940
Stuff like this that could so easily be fixed

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.340
is what keeps it from being as good as the original.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.240
But still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoyed a lot of it,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.880
again, as smaller stories go.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.680
Most of the same actors are back with the exception of Lilo,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.600
who this time is replace Dakota Fanning.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.880
And by God, she does a great job impersonating her.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.960
Not just the voice, but the heart, the comedy, the emotion. She really gets it.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.660
I don't know if they switched her out because they wanted a bigger celebrity,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.980
or the original actor's voice was changing,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.300
but she does a great job.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.400
You barely even notice the difference.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.080
So even though it's a sequel that doesn't really add much,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.920
and yeah, probably doesn't need to exist,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.800
I still have a soft spot for Lilo &amp; Stich,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800
and, if you do too, you'll probably enjoy this.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.580
Grab your hovership and check it out.
