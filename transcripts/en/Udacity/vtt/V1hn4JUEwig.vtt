00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.062
Grant also didn't know how these ordered
cancellations would affect the total

00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:07.971
amount of money he would make. We can't
really help Grant with his business

00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:12.233
issues, but we can help him with the math
he needs to know about. So which of these

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.402
expressions down here should replace the
question mark right here, to create an

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:20.514
equation for the future earnings that
Grant will have after all of these orders

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:24.826
are paid for? Remember that we need to
take into account, both the money that he

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:28.931
thought he was going to make from all of
the orders he originally received, and

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:32.947
then also, the money that he will no
longer make from the orders that have now

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:37.255
been cancelled. Please assume that money
from all original orders, and money from

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:40.747
cancelled orders down here are positive
when written on their own.
