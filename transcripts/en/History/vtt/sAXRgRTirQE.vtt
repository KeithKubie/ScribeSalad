00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.670
MIKE WOLFE: This is Model A
Firetruck.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.000
VANESSA: Right.
MIKE WOLFE: Wow.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.920
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER): We're
here in Indiana with Vanessa

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
and her daughter, Savannah.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.290
Vanessa's father was
the Model A king,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.170
and now she's carrying
on his legacy.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.790
FRANK FRITZ: What's top
speed in a car like this?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.790
VANESSA: 55.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.040
FRANK FRITZ: I bet
it gets the looks.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.460
VANESSA: Oh, it does.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.210
It's almost a Bonnie and Clyde
car, only a little bit earlier.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.080
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER): Out
of all the Model A's that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960
have passed through
Bill's hands,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.420
these are the ones
that he held onto.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.380
Look at this, Frankie.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.420
FRANK FRITZ: Oh, that's nice.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.710
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
He kept the rare,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.290
the unusual, the different.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.830
I love this kind of stuff.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.210
VANESSA: This is made in Canada.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.540
It has a 29 cowl,
but it is a 30.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.460
MIKE WOLFE: 30.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040
What's so special
about this one

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.500
is this carriage company
may have made more,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.540
but I feel like it's the
only one that has survived.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.540
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER): Another
one of Bill's crown jewels

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.380
in the collection is
a truck from Canada.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.120
The body was modified
by a carriage company,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.040
and as far as Vanessa
knows, it's the only one.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.710
What do you value this car at?

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.580
I'd like to get
$35,000 out of it.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.710
I can kind of set my
own price because it's

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.170
the only one that exists.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.880
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER): Vanessa
feels this truck is so rare

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.210
that she can set her own price.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.460
There's nothing
to compare it to.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.580
MIKE WOLFE: It's beautiful.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.790
This truck right here,
we got some history.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.500
This is my pouting truck.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.920
What do you mean
by pouting truck?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.790
Oh, me and mom, you
know, our little spats.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.790
Mother, daughter.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.170
When you get your
way or something?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960
When I didn't get my way and
it was too cold to walk out

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.250
to the horse barn, I would
just come to this truck

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.750
right here, because it
was super comfortable.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.750
Sit in the truck--

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.920
Did you know
that's where she was?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.580
Cross my little
arms, and work it out.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.420
I mean, we had
conversations, me and you,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.120
and you weren't even in there.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.080
It still happens.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.250
I couldn't help but
notice the Texaco sign.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.790
VANESSA: Great for a single
decoration on the wall.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.830
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER): Texaco
was one of the top-tier names

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.460
for Petroliana collectors.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.040
Made in 1948.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.670
It's double-sided.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.000
I mean, it is porcelain.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.330
It will clean up.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.210
The only thing bad that
it's got going for it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620
is whoever mounted it has
these big creases in it.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.670
VANESSA: Yeah.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.750
FRANK FRITZ: I mean,
that's the, I don't

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.290
want to say the kiss
of death, but that's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.750
the bad part about it.
- Yeah.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.460
How about $650?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.710
Six and 1/4.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.500
It's yours.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.620
- Six and 1/4?
- Yeah.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.000
All right.
Good deal.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.620
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
it takes a little longer

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.290
to move these bigger
signs, but even

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.960
with the damage
and the creases, I

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.460
can still make a little money.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.420
I just discovered
I had a 29 back half.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.210
I got 29 doors.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.540
And I have a 29 cowl
in another barn,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.290
that I can make a
29 roadster pickup.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.080
I love that you know
what everything is.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.460
Somebody had told me I was
going to do this for a living

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.830
when I was 16.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.420
No way.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.620
I was a hairdresser.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.540
OK.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.290
Hairdressers, Model A, right?

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.420
MIKE WOLFE
(VOICEOVER): Vanessa is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.790
such a strong, beautiful woman.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.420
And over the years,
she was determined

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.710
to make it on her own and
honor her father along the way.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.830
Your dad would be
really proud of you.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.170
Yes.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.830
Just getting to know him, and
doing the business with him,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.710
and seeing how he
would wheel and deal,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.830
and I wouldn't give anything
for that experience.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.080
Let's go see if
we can find Frank.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.380
He's probably getting
in some trouble.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.500
I don't trust him with
Savannah by himself.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.120
SAVANNAH: Frank, I want
to show you my car.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.880
FRANK FRITZ: All right.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.830
This is my 1931.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.120
This is your car?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.580
A400.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.880
FRANK FRITZ: Wow, this is nice.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.380
Yeah, she's very special.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.580
That's why she's in the back.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.960
In the back, nobody
can touch her.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.460
We got to keep her special.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.420
That's right.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.830
VANESSA (VOICEOVER):
My dad wanted

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.500
to make sure each of the kids
inherited some kind of Model A.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.540
FRANK FRITZ: What's
the plans on this here?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.880
I'm going to sell it.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.330
I would really like to be
able to take the money,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.040
and take care of my
family, and have a home.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.210
So you want to buy a house?

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.960
SAVANNAH: Yeah I
want to buy a house.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.750
I want to buy some land.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.250
Good for you.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.880
I'm hoping it will
help me pay off college,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.040
and kids, and property.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.710
Frank, take a peek
into my world.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.960
I'm looking at your
world right here.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.750
I can see why you are
selling so much in your booth.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.000
VANESSA: Yeah.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.330
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
Savannah is very persuasive.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.960
Just imagine her all
shined up and those seats,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.540
I could almost pout
in those seats too.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.290
But I don't think he's
going to buy this car.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.420
A guy in Alabama
offered my dad,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.750
right before he
passed away, $110,000

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.080
for that one and this one.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.580
And dad in the hospital,
sitting, he said, Vanessa, I

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.210
should have taken that.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.540
FRANK FRITZ: What were
you thinking on it?

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.170
I wanted 50, but 45?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.420
- $45,000?
- Cash.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.750
Money.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.540
Well, that's the only way
to go is that cash money.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.000
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
I really appreciate

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.380
her showing me the car.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.750
I've never seen one like it.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.750
But today, I'm not a player.
