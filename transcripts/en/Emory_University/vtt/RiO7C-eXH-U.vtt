00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.830
Alright. Are you ready?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.130
Okay. I am fully aware, in making this appeal
to my much afflicted and suffering brethren,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.690
that I shall not only be assailed by those
whose greatest earthly desires are to keep

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.380
us in abject ignorance and wretchedness, and
who are of the firm conviction that heaven

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.260
has designed us and our children to be slaves
and beast the burden to them and their children.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.600
I say, I do not only expect to be held up to
the public as an ignorant, impudent, and restless

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.750
disturber of the public peace, by such avaricious creatures,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.340
as well as a mover of insubordination--and
perhaps put into prison or to death, for giving

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.860
a superficial exposition of our miseries and
exposing tyrants.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.350
But I am persuaded that many of my brethren,
particularly those who are ignorantly in league

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.600
with slaveholders or tyrants, who acquire
their daily bread by the blood and sweat of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.390
their more ignorant brethren--and not of a
few of those, too, who are too ignorant to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.460
see an inch beyond their nose, will rise up
and call me cursed--Yea,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.440
the jealous ones among us will perhaps use
more abject subtlety by affirming that this

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.740
work is not worth perusing,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.040
that we are well situated, and there is no
use in trying to better our condition,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.160
for we cannot.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.800
I will only ask one question here. Can our
condition be any worse?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.630
Can it be more mean and abject?

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.100
If there are any changes will they not be
for the better,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.660
though, they may appear for the worse at first?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.060
Can they get us any lower?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.850
Where can they get us?

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.180
They cannot treat us worse, for they know well,
the day they do it they are gone.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.560
But against all accusations, which may or
can be referred against me, I appeal to heaven

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.760
for my motive and writing--who knows that
my object is, if possible, to awaken in the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.960
breast of my afflicted, degraded, and slumbering
brethren, a spirit of inquiry and investigation,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.840
respecting our miseries and wretchedness,
in this Republican Land of Liberty.
