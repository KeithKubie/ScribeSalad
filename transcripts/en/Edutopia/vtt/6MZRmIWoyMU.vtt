00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:06.976
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dexter's a Big
Picture High School,

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.566
and one of the things Big
Picture High School tries

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:11.656
to do is get the students
out into the real world.

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:13.296
So he's interning with us.

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:14.756
&gt;&gt;Laura: One of the best
things about the Learning

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.776
Through Internship Program
is the maturity and growth

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.176
that you see very quickly,
even from 15-year-old freshmen.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.886
Having students passionate about what
they're doing, really makes a difference

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:27.166
in the schoolwork, so
we're able to connect it.

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:36.256
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The unique thing

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:39.876
about Nashville Big Picture High
School is our students physically come

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:41.506
to our school three days a week.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.916
And on those days, we
focus very intently

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.676
on the core subjects that they need.

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:51.456
On the other two days, which
are Tuesday and Thursday,

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.536
students pursue their passions
and they pursue their interests

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:56.536
in the community through an internship.

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:00.296
&gt;&gt;Laura: The Learning Through Internship
process, what we call our LTIs,

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.046
are a four-year long process.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:04.876
&gt;&gt;Laura: So wherever you want to begin.

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:07.386
&gt;&gt;Dexter: We can start with this.

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:09.046
I have like three pictures.

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:12.226
&gt;&gt;Laura: We start freshman year
with the students coming in,

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:15.376
doing things such as
taking interest inventories.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:19.386
They have to create a resume, they
have to practice phone skills.

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:20.766
They have to role-play interviews.

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.666
We make them jump through several
hoops before we allow them to go

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.116
on an informational interview.

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:30.116
&gt;&gt;Dexter: As my internship,
I want to do architecture.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:35.256
I want to become an architect, because
my family influence was by my father,

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:37.206
he used to be an architect a while ago.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:41.196
And then my mom just kept on pushing
me towards that influence, like,

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:45.726
"If you just focus and you put your
mindset to it, then you can do anything.

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:48.716
&gt;&gt;Dan: So you have to know a little
bit about everything of everybody

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.986
that you're employing, because
they're a part of your team.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:54.506
&gt;&gt;Dan: We do a lot of
different things every day.

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.166
And I really want to show them that.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.546
We sketch, we design.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:01.056
&gt;&gt;Dexter: First we had the men and
women's bathrooms set up right here,

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:04.086
and then the janitor's, kitchen,
mechanical room all one side.

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:08.356
&gt;&gt;Dexter: Mr. Tansey gives me objectives
to achieve, and goals to achieve,

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:13.656
and lets me use RevIt and SketchUp which
are two different programs that we use

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:16.456
to make architecture easy
for us instead of drawing.

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:19.766
&gt;&gt;Dexter: It shows me how to
push myself, and it shows me

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:23.016
that other people are helping
me to achieve my goals.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.416
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're also out in the field.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.716
We're talking to contractors,

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:28.496
we're talking to business
owners, we're talking to clients.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.046
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hey, guys [Good morning]

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:33.736
&gt;&gt;Laura: I get onsite
every two to three weeks.

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:36.886
I'm looking for things that he's
seen and things that he's learned.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:41.566
And it shows that he's
comfortable where he is and maturing

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.856
in his professional skills.

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:44.956
&gt;&gt;Dan: He's really, really grown.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:48.986
I mean, from Day 1, you know, we
were doing sketches; to Day 2,

00:02:48.986 --> 00:02:51.446
we're on the computer; to
Day 3, we're in the field.

00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:55.486
Him being able to take all that
in, and then understand how all

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:59.176
that comes together, I think, has
been really his great strength.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:02.936
&gt;&gt;Joe: Up, good, concentrate
on the ball, good!

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:06.446
&gt;&gt;Andi: I'm learning to be a
professional tennis teacher

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:08.676
and professional tennis player.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:14.396
I'm the youngest Certified Professional
Tennis Registry Member in the country.

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:16.926
&gt;&gt;Joe: Look up, beautiful!

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.866
&gt;&gt;Joe: When Andi first came
to me, she was a person

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.796
that didn't really think
too much of herself.

00:03:25.086 --> 00:03:26.386
&gt;&gt;Joe: One more, up!

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:31.166
&gt;&gt;Joe: The confidence came as
Andi started to take leadership

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:34.136
to support the other kids in the school.

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:35.676
&gt;&gt;Andi: Good, come forward, good!

00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:41.126
&gt;&gt;Sherry: Andi's a better student
because her confidence has grown.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:43.986
But in the beginning, he
spent a tremendous amount

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.936
of time with her reading skills.

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:49.396
&gt;&gt;Andi: I really struggled
in the English mostly.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:55.316
And so at night, I've just been reading
the passage and going through here.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.956
&gt;&gt;Andi: It goes beyond tennis.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:59.526
He's like a second father to me.

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:02.376
He's helped me in every
aspect of my life.

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:07.266
School, tennis, just being there for
everything that I've been through.

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:12.356
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: Now we're going to get into
writing the equations for each of these.

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:15.826
&gt;&gt;Andi: I feel like I'm more
responsible as a student.

00:04:16.316 --> 00:04:18.656
I get my work in on time.

00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:22.206
I know if I have a problem,
I can go talk to my teacher,

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:26.896
and that's something I really struggled
with my freshman and sophomore year.

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:30.586
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: The distance from the foci
to any point that's on that ellipse.

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:31.606
&gt;&gt;Andi: Equal distance.

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:32.366
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: There ya go!

00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:34.836
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: Andi is in my
Critical Thinking class,

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:36.826
and she's in my Pre-Calculus class.

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.286
She is also my daughter!

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:44.586
The internship, it's made her a
better student, because of the--

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:46.746
having more pride and
confidence in herself.

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:47.456
&gt;&gt;Andi: Go.

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:53.506
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: And her dream is to open a
tennis club for the underprivileged.

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:57.506
&gt;&gt;Andi: What's next for me is that
I'm going to either go to college,

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.896
or go play on the pro tour.

00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:03.346
&gt;&gt;Courtney: We want them to
be excited about their passion

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.366
and tie that to their education.

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:09.046
So they can be successful
lifelong learners.

00:05:09.556 --> 00:05:15.196
&gt;&gt;Laura: Every high school should allow
the space and the place for students

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:21.266
to explore their passion, even if
it was just for 20 minutes a day.

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:23.066
Maybe it's 45 minutes a week.

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:25.786
I think that they would
see some huge benefits.

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:29.536
&gt;&gt;Joe: Go, whoo, that's
a great shot, thank you.
