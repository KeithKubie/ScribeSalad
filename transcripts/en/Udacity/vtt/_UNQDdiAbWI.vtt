00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.210
For your final two levels of
competition, generic competition and

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.010
budget competition, think larger scale.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.510
Now, generic competition
includes products and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.780
services that fulfill
the same customer needs.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.390
So, a generic competition for
our flavored water here,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.970
would be any other drink that our
potential customer can choose.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.890
So, regular water, sparkling water,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.490
juice, tea, sports drink,
sodas, you get the picture.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.500
Budget competition includes all
products and services that compete for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.010
the same amount of money.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.760
Okay, so wow, let's think about that.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.740
This is a $2.50 water in the Bay Area,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.370
so, everything else that's
$2.50 is our budget competitor.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.880
So, this adorable stuffed monkey,
a sponge, pack of trading cards,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.670
some breakfast cereal, some pencils,
some post-its, a hamburger and fries.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.990
You get the picture.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.240
Now, for more expensive items
in the budget category,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.319
like let's say an engagement ring,
you might be competing for a car, or

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.242
a down payment to a house or
part of it or vacation.

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:08.056
You get the picture.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.630
Just think larger scale.
