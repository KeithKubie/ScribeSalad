00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.650
Welcome to the third lesson in Introduction to Data

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.590
Science. During this lesson, we're going to be focusing on

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.480
some basic methods in statistics and machine learning that you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.700
can use to analyze data. During the last lesson, we

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.860
mainly focused on methods to acquire and clean data from

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.550
a variety of sources, such as relational databases, APIs, and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.810
flat files. However we also discuss some basic methods that

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.930
you can use to verify the integrity of your data.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.950
And while you're doing that you might learn some very

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.165
basic things. For example, you might know who the tallest

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:34.230
shortstop to ever play in major league baseball was, or,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.304
how many people over the age of 65 enrolled in the

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.536
[INAUDIBLE] program in a particular district. You might find, though,

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:44.579
that you want to answer some more subtle questions. For example,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.015
we might want to know, are left handed batters any

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:51.298
better than right handed batters? Or, hey, is there any correlation

00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:55.045
between age and the [UNKNOWN] rejection rate? We'll use

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:58.611
statistics and machine learning to answer these types of questions.

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:00.963
We'll also find that these methods are really useful for

00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:04.300
answering questions about ridership on the New York City subway.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.200
For example, we might be able to discover whether

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.140
time of day, or the weather outside, influence how many

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.350
people are riding the subway. During this lesson, we're going

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.455
to assume some basic familiarity with stats. Either you haven't

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.591
seen the stuff or if you feel lost, it might be a good idea to

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.301
enroll in Stats 95. I've included a link

00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.870
in the instructor comments. Alright, let's jump in.
