00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.180
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.600
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.380
What is it? August 28th, 2017 what's going on how are you ?

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.190
<v 2>Ahhh,</v>

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.920
<v 1>what's up? Sorry. It was obnoxious. I understand. I understand,</v>

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.800
but I gotta make the lady shut it off first, right? Oh my God.

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.210
Who is this guy yelling?

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
Why would you want to listen to that when you could just,

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.990
you could just sit and watch reality television with myself.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.770
Let's do a bunch of broads fucking yelling at each other. It's unreal.

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.020
It's unreal. My wife Watches that shit all the time. All the fucking time.

12
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.660
You come home and it's just like, it's like they live with us.

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.810
You know what I mean? Me and my wife, we give, hey, we get along great.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.081
You know,

15
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.170
but you wouldn't know it walking up the fucking front walk to the house.

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.750
You hear like five women screaming at each other.

17
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.040
<v 0>No.</v>

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 1>It's just like, what are we hosting the Jerry Springer show? What's going on?</v>

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.140
And you open the door and she's watching the real housewives of who gives a fuck

20
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
the real housewives of Trenton, the real housewives of Dayton, Ohio.

21
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:09.590
Wherever the hell they are,

22
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.360
<v 0>okay?</v>

23
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.770
<v 1>Wherever they are, whatever city they're in, the real housewives,</v>

24
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.220
they got fake tits. They got big ass fucking,

25
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.420
they got ass injection lips. They got the fucking Botox,

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.520
<v 0>okay?</v>

27
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
<v 1>It's unbuttoned about where they are real housewives. Grand rapids you'd like,</v>

28
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.900
there's not going to be some Hollywood shit guy and there it is.

29
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.480
Why is everybody walking around acting like there's some aging actress?

30
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.210
You know what I mean? And they somehow they have to look good for what the,

31
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.140
what the fuck are you looking at you if you ever 50 year old mom,

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.810
just be your mom. Relax. It's over. He landed a guy, he knocked you up.

33
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.240
All the laws are in your favor. For God's sakes.

34
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.900
Go have a fucking piece of pie and go smoke a camel.

35
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.680
I don't understand what the fuck these fucking spaghetti strapped women,

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.240
you know the stupid, they're still wearing the tag tops. You know what I mean?

37
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 1>Jesus Christ with the fucking tired skin show.</v>

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.420
And what are you doing trying to compete with your daughter? What are you doing?

40
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.530
Good Lola. Little take. Take a page out of my book. Just fucking,

41
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:25.300
just give into it here. Start falling out. Fucking shaving

42
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.450
your legs are two white. Put some pants on

43
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.950
your fucking guts. Getting too big. Start wearing sport coats on stage.

44
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.010
These are the [inaudible]. That's the classy way.

45
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
That's the classy way to just gracefully, you know,

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.880
go from being young into your middle aged and to just be an old.

47
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.760
This what you do. Then you get an old man hat, right?

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.620
You start pottering around, you make funny little jokes. Everybody. Lao,

49
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.360
we look at a look at that guy still making jokes. That's what you do.

50
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.623
<v 3>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.320
<v 1>You don't get chemicals shot into your fucking face,</v>

52
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.770
you know and enhance your fucking tits. Like what? What are you trying to do?

53
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.980
Huh? You're trying to give some 60 year old a hard on.

54
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:16.490
I don't understand what these women are doing. It was funny,

55
00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:18.470
I didn't even want to talk about this shit. I just,

56
00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:21.080
I don't know why that just came out. It just did. All right.

57
00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:25.760
I had a wonderful show last night, a wonderful show. I was at the kid cod,

58
00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:27.800
melody, melody tent, if I can say it,

59
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.630
which is a such a special place for me to do stand up because the one and only

60
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:37.631
time I ever saw the great George Carlin live was that the cape cod melody tent.

61
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.710
And I am embarrassed to say I saw him in 1988 and me and this other guy went to

62
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:47.711
go see him to laugh at him because my buddy had me convinced that he had stopped

63
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:51.620
writing and that he was still doing 20 year old bits.

64
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.050
So we were going to go see him as a joke.

65
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.940
If you can listen to how fucking stupid,

66
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:59.750
I was one of the most prolific comedians of all fucking time.

67
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.150
So we show up to laugh at this guy and within two seconds we were just on the

68
00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:10.151
fucking floor laughing and the guy hit his brand new 90 fucking minutes and we

69
00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:13.610
were driving home like he, he wasn't doing more stuff.

70
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:18.080
He wasn't doing fucking like, that's how dumb I was. Um,

71
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.270
I did a lot of dumb shit back then.

72
00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:23.360
I went to some comedy shows and I was literally the person in the crowd.

73
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.090
I wasn't heckling or anything, you know what I mean?

74
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.690
Although one time I did heckle Don Rickles just cause I wanted to have an

75
00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:34.130
interaction with them and I knew that I wasn't gonna meet him. You know,

76
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.650
I saw him at a casino about four years ago

77
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.383
<v 3>and um,</v>

78
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.160
<v 1>I waited till his encore and he came out in the encore and he was just doing his</v>

79
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:47.190
jokes, doing his jokes, and I was way in the back. He's playing this giant room.

80
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:52.100
I was way in the back and I just went, hey, it didn't say anything.

81
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.850
Kept doing his jokes, kept doing his jokes.

82
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.900
I waited like another three minutes and I went, Don, hey.

83
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.740
And he just looked out to where I was sitting. He goes, yeah,

84
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:02.110
I know my name made that fucking Rickles face. And I was with Bart,

85
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.070
nick and he fucking elbow. He goes, he hurt you. He hurts. And that was it.

86
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.141
You know,

87
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.380
I broke a major rule of engagement there with the fucking as a standup comedian.

88
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.300
I shouldn't have done it, but I couldn't help myself.

89
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.480
I could have helped myself. You know what? Let's be honest.

90
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.630
Why don't we just be honest? Okay. Now that,

91
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.550
that stupid fucking fight is over,

92
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:25.500
can we all just be honest with ourselves here?

93
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.540
I'm a selfish person in rather than accepting the fact that I wasn't going to

94
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:35.110
get an interaction with them, I had to do that because I'm a selfish cunt. Okay.

95
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.190
And, uh, you know, now can we all be honest about what went on Saturday night?

96
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.260
I gotta be honest with you. I have not even seen highlights of it.

97
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.430
I didn't fucking watch it. I actually came home and, uh,

98
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:48.910
I was staying with some relatives here in Boston who also didn't get the fight

99
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.330
cause they're sane people. They're like, yeah, it's just, you know,

100
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.450
he's Floyd's gonna carry him for a couple of rounds that he's going to finish

101
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:57.880
them and then they both, you know, they're not going to really each other up.

102
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.270
They're both going to leave with a boatload of money.

103
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.250
Isn't that what's going on here? Yeah.

104
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.330
Isn't there some Guy Alvarez who's actually a fucking modern day champion or

105
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.820
some shit like that coming up anyway, we'll spend the money on that.

106
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.210
We'll spend the money on that fucking thing, whatever that box and match.

107
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.570
I don't know shit about boxing, but I,

108
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:16.520
I do know Lal Zeto versus Muhammad Ali when I fucking see it.

109
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.110
So I mean a better version of it I should say. But anyways, um,

110
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.580
we actually watched a wicked tuna.

111
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.883
<v 4>Yes.</v>

112
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.540
<v 1>I have such mixed emotions when I watched those fishing shows, you know,</v>

113
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.500
I got this love of animals, but I also love tuna. You know,

114
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.840
I am of an environmentalist who loves crab, you know,

115
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.600
King Crab. Who the fuck doesn't love that? I mean,

116
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.370
that's just fucking tremendous.

117
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.960
So when they sit in and talking about how it's all fished out and they can't

118
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.880
find any and that type of stuff, you know,

119
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.700
it's not that we should stop crabbing.

120
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.760
They should just be less fucking people that they have to find it for, you know,

121
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.470
so, um,

122
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.983
<v 3>you know,</v>

123
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.700
<v 1>I dunno, I always have all these fucking ideas of how to,</v>

124
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.873
<v 3>you know,</v>

125
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.730
<v 1>trimmed down the population. And of course I'm never part of the problem. Right.</v>

126
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.210
As those, as most mass murdering maniacs,

127
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.130
you're never part of the problem like Hitler.

128
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.340
I'm sure when he looked in the window, the window looked in the mirror,

129
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.460
right and was brushing his fucking teeth. Right.

130
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:27.790
I'm sure that he saw a blonde haired blue eyed person.

131
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.910
<v 4>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.720
<v 1>Instead of seeing what he truly was, which was the runt of the litter,</v>

133
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.110
you know what I mean? But the guy had heart,

134
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.160
any fucking overcame what the fuck he looked like to achieve his dream.

135
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.340
You know, granted he was out of his fucking mind, but I mean,

136
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.920
that alone should've just see, should've been, if he wasn't so crazy,

137
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:48.940
it would have been, well, look at me.

138
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.370
I'm fucking ugly as Shit and look what I've achieved.

139
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.343
<v 3>You know</v>

140
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.730
<v 1>what? If somebody who looks like me actually had a good heart,</v>

141
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.470
imagine what they would achieve. Isn't that why?

142
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.760
We'll have fucking loan to ticket. Why,

143
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.060
why we y'all fucking loan a ticket is that guy, they're like, you know,

144
00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:09.540
my dream came true and I played the Cape Cod melody tent telling jokes.

145
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:13.800
His dream came true and fucking, you know, tens of millions of people died.

146
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.810
That was literally his dream.

147
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.243
<v 3>You know,</v>

148
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.520
<v 1>like imagine if he never did his shit right and he just lived a regular life and</v>

149
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:27.310
then all of a sudden God, fuck why came? Say God forbid it's him.

150
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.010
I just naturally say, God forbid when I talk about terminal disease,

151
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.100
Adolf Hitler, right? Doesn't fucking, you know,

152
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:35.590
somebody bought his paintings or some shit, right?

153
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:40.360
So he just doesn't go down that fucking road. Now he's just, you know,

154
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.530
some regular guy and a, and then he has like, he,

155
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.310
he gets some terminal illness and for some reason make a wish, wishes back then.

156
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:51.890
And they'd go, what? What is your dream? What is your wish? And then he,

157
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.020
and then he g rarely you're gonna make my wish come true. This is what we do.

158
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.750
Eight off. We make sure your day with a smile on your face.

159
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.280
What is your dream? And he would have laid there, you know,

160
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.950
telling the guy to come a little bit closer. What do you want to do?

161
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.640
I want to exterminate all of the Jews. That's what he would've said.

162
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.720
And what a fucking quagmire that make a wish would have been.

163
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.460
They would have had to have, they would have to, hey, hang on a second,

164
00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:23.580
they'd have to step out in the hall going, I, what do we do here? I mean, I,

165
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:24.970
you know, I mean we, we, we,

166
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.040
we just kind of made a broad statement that we make dreams come true. We,

167
00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:30.800
we didn't clarify it. Like, what,

168
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.990
what do you want to stand out here long enough?

169
00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:36.500
Maybe he'll fucking die the disease. I mean, our whole reputation's on the line,

170
00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.310
right? And then all of a sudden make a wish gets dragged into it,

171
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.910
gets dragged into the madness of this man and then no longer looked upon as this

172
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:49.550
wonderful organization that they are. Right.

173
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.980
Which takes in millions and millions of dollars. Right?

174
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:53.450
And God knows what the fuck they do. Who knows?

175
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.710
You never know what those charities,

176
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.633
<v 4>right.</v>

177
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.850
<v 1>Are they helping people out or are they helping themselves to a classic Camaro</v>

178
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.850
with some tea tops. When we return, we'll be taking some callers. Sorry,

179
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.640
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about today. Um, so anyways, yeah,

180
00:10:09.641 --> 00:10:13.270
everybody thought I was going to cave. I have not caved on two fronts.

181
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.890
I have not drank in 11 days. And I feel this is that dude. I go 11 days.

182
00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:21.040
I could go a year, I could go a fucking year.

183
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:25.330
I feel fucking fantastic. And I just used the word fantastic.

184
00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:27.970
I never thought fantastic. You know,

185
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.070
I'm doing cardio like I've always been doing,

186
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.450
but I'm not negating it at night with the fucking three or four home pours over

187
00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:37.780
there with the giant ice cube. Um,

188
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.290
and it's actually, the sober life is fucking great. It just sucks at night.

189
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.440
That's the only thing at night. It sucks at night, you know,

190
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.170
because it's like, what the fuck do I do? Um, I'm like, yeah,

191
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.080
like I'm a habit guy, so this is the time of night.

192
00:10:56.081 --> 00:10:58.610
I fucking do this and then I'm not doing it. I'm like, well now what do I,

193
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.590
what do I do? So, you know, I did, I started playing guitar again. Anything,

194
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.980
you know, I suck. What do you want? I mean it just, I go in there,

195
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:10.730
I fucking play a little bit and during that time and then it gets late and then

196
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.570
I literally feel my body just go on and come on and do it. Go pull one,

197
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.040
go that's right over there and look at the bottle, do look the bottle,

198
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.950
my dead boy yourself one. And I just,

199
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.170
all I have to do is just go downstairs to my bedroom.

200
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.230
And then the fact that I'm an old man takes over. Like God, Dude,

201
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:26.720
I am not fucking going all the way back up there. He's an animal.

202
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.340
He's not even as I'm laying there,

203
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.163
<v 4>you know?</v>

204
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.330
<v 1>Yeah. I go downstairs and my angel liver,</v>

205
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:38.800
a wife is laying in bed watching five women. She doesn't know,

206
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:42.310
screaming at each other and say horrible things. You know,

207
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.930
they're really big on attacking. Like, if a woman's never had a child,

208
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.430
they're really big on attacking that file, man, that fucking mean,

209
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.610
just Goddamn fucking main people, you know,

210
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.810
it's dumb as guys are the way we solve shit with violence. I just think,

211
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.051
you know,

212
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:07.051
just punching somebody in the face is way more civil than say,

213
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.670
well that's why you're barren and you can't have a child. It's like,

214
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:17.080
really? Do me a favor next time, just punch me in the nose when that just being,

215
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.060
can we just, can we just leave it at that?

216
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.460
So there's something to salvage afterwards. Jesus Christ. Um,

217
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.680
so many, but now that I've gone 11 days, now it's just starts to fade.

218
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.760
Like I don't even, I walk by my, my fucking, I told you 19,

219
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.480
27 Yankees lineup worth of fucking booze and I'm telling you, like,

220
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:42.420
I don't even see it anymore. Like, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't,

221
00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:46.920
I get murderer's row murderer's row, the shit that I drink.

222
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.570
Um, you know, and then they're all, I have the batting order,

223
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.280
you know what I mean? Top of the order,

224
00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:57.660
right through cleanup is the top of the shelf top shelf shit.

225
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.210
You know that shit. Pappies I say you.

226
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.720
Okay. Here we go. Let's go with booze. So what would you line up? B?

227
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.320
Who's hitting lead off? Who's getting on base? Right?

228
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.630
Who's your fucking Ricky Henderson?

229
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.870
That's gonna fucking possibly hit a solo shot and the next guys don't even have

230
00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:19.760
to knock them in. You know what I'm going to say? I'm going to go

231
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.050
my Ricky Anderson is Johnny Walker blue.

232
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

233
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.570
<v 1>Oh, this is going to be hard. I've got too many cleanup hitters. Dan.</v>

234
00:13:32.571 --> 00:13:35.460
I would say baton second is grand patrol.

235
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.010
All right. I'm not a big Tequila guy,

236
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.020
so I'm not getting into that fucking a Gavi shit. Where the fuck they put in it?

237
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.540
Yeah. Then I would say, ah, this is a hard one.

238
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.790
I would say maybe some pappy van winkles is going third.

239
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.610
Then Bat and cleanup in my world,

240
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.350
I would say is a McCallum rare cask.

241
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.003
<v 4>Right</v>

242
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.060
<v 1>now we're getting to the middle of the order. This is a, you know,</v>

243
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.980
it's not a special occasion. I just want to get fucked up.

244
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.633
<v 4>All right.</v>

245
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.720
<v 1>These are the guys hitting two 70 to 80 then you get in the middle already.</v>

246
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.420
You got Johnny Walker Black, his bat and fifth

247
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.910
I'd say no. Fifth is patroned silver. Johnny Walker Black

248
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.210
is baton sixth and seventh, eighth and ninth.

249
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:40.470
Now you're talking companies coming over. You like these people, but they don't,

250
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.560
they don't like appreciate good boots.

251
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.160
So you're just going to hit them with some basic shit, right?

252
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.610
That's when you have to go maker's mark,

253
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.670
Jack Daniels batting ninth

254
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.950
batting ninth. If someone wants to mix it, I'll give you, this is the fuck this.

255
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.600
This is the national league. When the pitcher bads. Johnny Walker.

256
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:07.620
Red Label.

257
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.510
There you go. That's my line guy. You know what? Semi me your booze lineups.

258
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:16.990
<v 5>Okay.</v>

259
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.330
<v 1>Probably should've had. I can do the beer one</v>

260
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.570
lead off Scott to be Budweiser. You know that? Thanks. Getting on fucking base

261
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.093
<v 4>right</v>

262
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.690
<v 1>that second. I would have a Miller high life.</v>

263
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.720
That and the third. No, no. Let me see. I'm going to give a fuck.

264
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.810
I got the, I don't know, lead off cores light.

265
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.650
No, but we were doing best beer all the way down, not on, oh,

266
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:48.950
what am I doing here? What am I doing here? All right. I am, I am.

267
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.860
I am white trash when it comes to beer. Okay.

268
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.280
The fanciest, I mean, I'll go, I would say, all right,

269
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.350
I go Budweiser, then Miller.

270
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.470
<v 4>Hi Life. [inaudible].</v>

271
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.740
<v 1>Then I'd say, uh, Ben,</v>

272
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.610
third Benton third and beer.

273
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.313
<v 4>That's a tough one.</v>

274
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.380
<v 5>Okay.</v>

275
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.750
<v 1>You start wondering, people clear the basis a little bit.</v>

276
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.690
I'll go a little snobby and I will say Blue Moon.

277
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.840
I don't mind the orange slice. I don't mind it. Like I, if I want,

278
00:16:21.841 --> 00:16:25.320
if I'm just fucking thirsty, I'll have one of those bat and cleanup is Guinness.

279
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.400
<v 4>All right.</v>

280
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.160
<v 1>Then I'd have a black and Tan fifth</v>

281
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.860
six. Now you're just getting, now you want to get fucked up, right?

282
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:39.140
But you don't want to get your fucking going to become a fat fuck.

283
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.410
So I would say core is light, light beer.

284
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.130
Famila now eight and nine.

285
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.440
<v 5>Okay.</v>

286
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.140
<v 1>Eight and nine. This is for when some, you know,</v>

287
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.620
some older people are coming over with their kids and you just get a fun,

288
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:56.830
I dunno, for whatever fucking reason you gotta have an IPA.

289
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.350
And when I was at this like a Sierra Nevada or some shit, I would,

290
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.030
something like that. I don't drink, but I mean I'd leave that alone.

291
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.040
This isn't this a stupid, as Congress,

292
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:13.270
I'm literally fucking sober and I'm making bows, batting lineups. All right.

293
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.180
If you're a beer drinker or if you're a hard liquor, you know,

294
00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:18.700
I want to hear your lineups. Okay, let's get ready man.

295
00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:22.840
Up The fucking pennant races are heating up. All right.

296
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.450
I want to, I want to see what you line up. Sorry.

297
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.630
You come walking up to the bar with your little pulling your met your fucking

298
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:32.230
lineup card out of your back pocket. Um,

299
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.150
by the way, that Blue Moon eyes is signed to like a one year contract. You know,

300
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:41.470
you don't, you just pick up a fucking big bat at the end of the fucking season.

301
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.360
Like he, you know, he's not, he's not a true red sock. Um,

302
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.550
all right. So anyways, by the way, somebody tweeted at me,

303
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.040
that's stupid company out there and fucking Wisconsin.

304
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.930
It microchipping their fucking employees and these fucking idiots are doing it

305
00:17:57.931 --> 00:17:59.970
and you know, and I'm like, why would they do that?

306
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:04.971
And then all you have to do is look at their faces and you look at them,

307
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.690
they, I have this childlike innocence. They are believers.

308
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.370
That's all it is.

309
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.720
They grew up in a great state of Wisconsin where you're sheltered. All right?

310
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.680
You're in the Midwest. You are in the hat of the country.

311
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.340
That fat fucking weasel in North Korea is missiles.

312
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.900
Even if it makes it that far, he's not shooting it at Wisconsin. Right?

313
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.500
The Green Bay packers did they like owned by the fans?

314
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:34.260
It's fucking everybody's making cheese. It's Mayberry.

315
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.950
You ever been to Wisconsin? It's fucking tremendous.

316
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.710
The air is fresh. The water is fucking clean. At least it looks that way.

317
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:47.640
When I drive by at 80 miles an hour and awaiting some God for Sake and fucking

318
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:48.770
place, I'm going to perform at

319
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.863
<v 4>right.</v>

320
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.770
<v 1>It's tremendous. Fuck these people, they believe,</v>

321
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.913
<v 4>right?</v>

322
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.660
<v 1>They all ordered the fight.</v>

323
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.670
<v 4>Okay.</v>

324
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.000
<v 1>They think he's gonna make it great again. They just, they believe,</v>

325
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:07.120
you know why? Cause they're fucking good people out there.

326
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.310
So they walk into the workday, hey guys, this is the new thing. And they,

327
00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:17.690
and they sit there looking, Gio, no, this seems a little bit creepy, right?

328
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.020
But how did they get them and how do you get,

329
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:25.190
how do you get the general masses? How do you get them all right?

330
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.010
There's two ways to get the general masses fear and free tee shirts.

331
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.560
<v 4>One or the other.</v>

332
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.870
<v 1>You scare the shit out of them. They're fucking on board.</v>

333
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.480
You tell him the boogie man's under their bed,

334
00:19:40.481 --> 00:19:43.480
whatever the fuck you tell them they need to do, they got to fucking do it.

335
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.690
If you don't want to fucking waste your time coming up some fucking bogeyman

336
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.470
story, just make a free fucking tee shirt.

337
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.480
And that's what they did in Wisconsin.

338
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.110
They had these fucking tee shirts that said, I got shipped.

339
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.420
That was it. That was, that was the tipping point. Wait a minute.

340
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.710
If I put that foreign object in me that I have no idea what it is,

341
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.080
no idea what its capabilities are.

342
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.000
No idea what it really does other than what you tell me you evil cunt,

343
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.770
you'll give me that free tee shirt and you know they got on the extra soft ones.

344
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.830
Oh my God, Dude. My, I tell you right now, my favorite,

345
00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.610
my favorite Goto tee shirt is my, I got chipped.

346
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.020
It's so soft, you know?

347
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.650
Then as much as I'm making fun of them,

348
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.500
I see the writing on the wall because there's way more people.

349
00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:36.140
There's way more believers out there, you know,

350
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.320
believing in the invisible lines, believing in the teams,

351
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:44.270
believing in all that fucking bullshit, right? Believe in it,

352
00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:49.180
they're evil, but these people are saints or vice versa, right?

353
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.880
These people are, they do it. They do it all over the world.

354
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.160
<v 5>Okay?</v>

355
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.020
<v 1>God loves us best. These people are infidels. These people are fucking Dez.</v>

356
00:20:58.021 --> 00:20:59.460
These people are fucking that.

357
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.050
It's the thing is that common thread with human beings is that this fucking

358
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.230
lunatics at the top. Okay.

359
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.130
And then you have nice people at the bottom, you know, Wisconsin people,

360
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.280
people give the shirt off you fucking back, you know,

361
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:17.290
provided you not to 10 let's, let's not,

362
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:19.840
let's not overly romanticize these white people. At the end of the day,

363
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:22.750
they are white people. Okay? And I'm not shitting on my own.

364
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:25.580
People were just in a position. It's a society my way. You know,

365
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.650
nobody's watching us so we get to go full fucking, you know,

366
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:33.840
full fucking frontal nudity with their fucking brains. There's nobody,

367
00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:38.050
there's nobody in our way, right? That's why we guys where we go fucking crazy.

368
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.380
You need some sort of hand on, maybe that's what the microchip is for.

369
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.920
I have no idea. I just know at the end of the fucking trail, who is it?

370
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.630
Because some of the people that run shit, look at Bill Clinton.

371
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.140
The man could not keep his dick in his pants. He shoving cigars up,

372
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.980
women's vaginas half his fucking age. That fucking guy that,

373
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:03.810
that's one of the guys run shit or someone of his fucking ill Keegan.

374
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.270
Let that guy put a fucking microchip. What do I get? A free tee shirt? Yes,

375
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:10.300
you don't skippy I write, I'm in. And that's it.

376
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.760
And this is the thing they don't need.

377
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.430
They don't need thinking people to buy in.

378
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.490
All they need is the free tee shirt people in the free tee shirt people.

379
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:19.390
You get enough of them,

380
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.060
it becomes a tipping point and then they can start changing.

381
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.960
You know what I mean? It's like the toll booths, right? Everybody easy pass.

382
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:28.520
I'm not getting now. You're not gonna fucking track where I'm going. Right.

383
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.040
And it was just one easy pass lane.

384
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.640
10 fucking lanes where you threw your change in or fucking went to a guy, right?

385
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.940
And then it became eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

386
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:40.560
Go Fuck Yourself. Well, you don't have to,

387
00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:43.410
you can use the fucking surface roads. You don't have to use the highways,

388
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.790
but your taxes did pay for them. Then you're like, fuck, that's what happens.

389
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.280
And they'll get all of us. Do you know what?

390
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:51.820
<v 5>Okay.</v>

391
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.050
<v 1>You know what I love about life though?</v>

392
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:55.270
They can never stop you from drinking yourself to death.

393
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.680
<v 5>Okay?</v>

394
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.290
<v 1>And that's one to grow on. All right. With that, let's, uh,</v>

395
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.410
sorry that got really fucking dark. Um,

396
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.890
all right. What are we doing here? Uh, live reads. Okay.

397
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.640
I'm reading off my phone here because I have no internet where I'm at right now.

398
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.550
I'm gonna have to go drive down to a fucking coffee shop.

399
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.910
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

400
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.240
<v 1>You know,</v>

401
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.090
there's nothing in a coffee shop that I want other than their internet.

402
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.320
You know, I don't drink coffee. Your, your little pastries.

403
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.950
Are they like eating a fucking bathroom tile? They're always fucking up.

404
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.620
They just suck. Everything in Starbucks fucking sucks.

405
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:37.010
I don't, I don't have the coffee. I know the coffees that heroin. All right,

406
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.070
but do you ever go into a bodega that's really selling fucking drugs?

407
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.250
You know what I mean? You know, like oldest serial is, that's what that's like.

408
00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:47.170
What fucking like a Starbucks is.

409
00:23:47.171 --> 00:23:49.370
It's like a drug deal in Bodega.

410
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

411
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.410
<v 1>Do you know what I mean? And like the only thing that, that,</v>

412
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.470
that is good in there that is, that is not past,

413
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.800
it's fucking date of freshness is the fucking drugs that this cell in.

414
00:23:58.801 --> 00:24:01.620
And what Starbucks. It's the coffee. Everything else in this sucks.

415
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.920
That's why you've gotta Love Dunkin Donuts, you know?

416
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

417
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.290
<v 1>The copy evidently is out of this fucking world, but they also make,</v>

418
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:12.380
they make these great doughnuts. All right. Draftkings everybody

419
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.220
a fantasy for all shit. Draftkings is back.

420
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.100
I love these guys because they finally admitted what the fuck they were doing.

421
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.090
All right. All right. She fucking degenerate. Gamblers. Hey, you go.

422
00:24:24.091 --> 00:24:25.350
You're in a loveless marriage.

423
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:30.330
Let's add to the pain draft kings fantasy football season is almost here and

424
00:24:30.331 --> 00:24:34.050
there's no better way to get closer to the game you love than to put your

425
00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:35.310
fucking paycheck on it.

426
00:24:35.311 --> 00:24:40.311
With draft kings one week fantasy football draft kings is hosting a $100,000

427
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:45.330
contest. That is totally free to enter.

428
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.590
All you have to do is put your paycheck down and if, yeah,

429
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.310
and if you don't draft the perfect lineup, you can what?

430
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.530
And if you drafted the perfect lineup,

431
00:24:55.531 --> 00:24:58.500
you can win $1 billion.

432
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.340
<v 0>Okay?</v>

433
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.360
<v 1>All right. I was making fun of this. Now I think I'm in with draft kings.</v>

434
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.920
There are many ways to play.

435
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:10.100
Choose between public contest with big cash prizes or private contest where you

436
00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:12.420
can compete against a group of your friends.

437
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.720

451
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.330
how they came about, how quickly they grew,

452
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.750
and now quickly at the state and federal level, they're like, wait a minute,

453
00:26:12.751 --> 00:26:17.370
this is a national drought gambling ring and we're not getting any fucking money

454
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:17.910
out of this.

455
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.050
How many beaks did you have to fucking wet to get back into the game?

456
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.730
Geez, I bet they went to one of those Bilderberg makes all right.

457

Cho Chat or anything or anyone else or sleep like anyone else.

461
00:26:39.671 --> 00:26:42.760
So why the fuck is your mattress? One size fits?

462
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.880
I don't know, because there's a basic shape to everybody. Um,

463
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.770
because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks. Oh,

couples, they customize each side of the mattress. I, yes,

472
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.060
the beginning of the end of the relationship,

473
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.920
your mattress arrives at your door in about a week and shipping is 100% free.

474
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.670
I like mine to be like this. Yeah, I like it to be like that.

475
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.300
I'd rather fuck this guy. I don't give a shit. I'm already banging her.

476
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.950
He looks asleep.

477
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.800
That's why everyone from GQ magazine to Forbes are all talking about helic

480
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:54.470
No questions asked. Be Funny if they asked you what was the problem?

481
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.000
I mean sleeping was okay, but when I went to Bang my wife,

482
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.650
I kept getting this pain in my left knee. Yeah, you know I played sports, but I,

483
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:04.500
you know, I never had painted that one. Look,

484
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:06.690
my fucking knee hurts when I banged my wife. I don't want to tell you.

485
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.180
All right, I'll sign there. All right,

That's helix sleep.com/burr hey. Hello sleep.com/bird h.

488
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.460
E. L. I. X. Oh Jesus.

489
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.530
Look who's back movement watches. Everyone hang in there. I got two more here.

490
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.730
Movement watches. You guys know movement, right?

491
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:35.040
They reinvented the watch business by selling directly to you with over 1

492
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.460
million watches sold to date. Well, you God damn it,

493
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:42.510
these bastards did it again except this time with sunglasses. Nah,

494
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.500
you thought they were done with watches. Now they're going to keep going.

495
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.400
They just shot one right across the bow of every designer.

496
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:54.060
Fucking sunglass boat out there. They were tired of having a pay.

497
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.280
They were tired of having to pay for cheaply.

498
00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.780
Made throwaway shades or overpriced designer glasses. So they said, fuck it.

499
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.510
They actually wrote, screw it. They said, fuck it. You know,

500
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:04.500
that's what they said in the meeting.

501
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.100
We'll make our own starting at just 70 bucks.

502
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.310
Movement sunglasses start at just $70 with the option to upgrade to polarized,

503
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.210
um, with over. What the fuck does that mean? Polarized.

504
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.490
You stop agreeing with people the second length you fucking,

505
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.580
he's a polarizing character. Um, those overpriced designer brands will,

506
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.170
will run you upwards of 200 bucks.

507
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.320
Movement figured out by selling online.

508
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.440
They were able to cut out the middleman and retail markup providing the best

509
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.750
possible prices. They figured this out with watchers. They're like, hey,

510
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:40.410
why not do it? I'm glad I did. I hope they keep going.

511
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.120
We've done it again. We've cut out the middleman with fucking Dildos,

512
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.570
uh, where they are. High quality premium. I don't know how to say it's a c.

W I N C for some reason pronounced wink.

527
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.690
When you have a great glass of wine,

528
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.680
it enhances the moment whether you're reflecting on, I, you know,

529
00:30:57.681 --> 00:31:02.040
if I had to make a wine lineup, this is what it would be. Who's leading enough?

530
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.100
You gotta get lead off with a cat. All right man. You fucking,

531
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.990
uh, bottom of the order.

532
00:31:09.991 --> 00:31:14.991
I don't know who the fuck I w all I know is a Barolos baton cleanup for me and I

533
00:31:15.901 --> 00:31:19.290
don't give a fuck about anything else. About why, you know what I mean?

534
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.770
I take on the whole wine world, but just the two of those nice fucking cab.

535
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.450
If I want to get shit face Barolo, if I don't know if I did something that day.

536
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.710
All right? Uh, when you have a great glass of wine, it enhances the moment.

537
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.250
Whether you're reflecting on the day or with someone you love.

538
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.870
Wink understands this. It's why they started their company.

539
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.690
I mean how many times we have to tell you this is why they fucking did it.

540
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.320
To give you access to exceptional wines from around the world.

541
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:50.380
So you can have more of these moments. See I need to use it.

542
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.140
But if I wasn't on the wagon, I'd use this shit cause I,

543
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.460
cause if you can't put together a nine fucking bottle list of booze,

544
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.050
bear our wine, I guess liquor I should say, then,

545
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.770
then you know you're really doing your liver a disservice.

546
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.300
Just try winc.com t r Y W I N c.com.

547
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:13.650
Take a brief palate profile quiz and w you know,

548
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.390
and somehow that'll end up on somebody's microchip in their fucking hand in

549
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:20.200
Wisconsin and Winkel recommend distinct and interesting wines actually

550
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:24.100
customized to your pallet to be shipped directly to your door every month.

None of your time is what?

552
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.180
You'd be funny if you committed a murder years later and you left the fucking

553
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.160
wineglass and they went back to this information.

554
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.540
Well it says here that that wineglass was part of your profile.

555
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:39.410
Is that not true? It's part of your palate profile.

556
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.830
Then you get all nervous. He just confessed to it on the stand, right?

557
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:45.290
Like it's the 1950s cop show.

558
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.980
They were tired of having to pay for cheaply made throwaway wait.

559
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.870
That's the shades. Like what did I do here?

574
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.790
You don't. One thing I do like about tech technology, I like docusign.

575
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:58.410
I really enjoy that shit. Makes it nice and fucking easy. Um, oh, by the way,

576
00:33:58.411 --> 00:34:00.990
I have to, I have to hight this gig because they don't do a lot of,

577
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.620
they don't do a lot of standup at this venue. Now at this point,

578
00:34:04.621 --> 00:34:09.180
if you listen to the podcast for a while now you realize that you know as much

579
00:34:09.181 --> 00:34:11.340

he's actually a frustrated musician. You know,

581
00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.940
I wish I was good at guitar. I wish I was good at trumps.

582
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.490
I have a tremendous amount of respect for you musicians. Speaking of which,

583
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.550
Queens of the Stone Age,

584
00:34:23.551 --> 00:34:28.020
one of my favorite bands of all time put out their brand new album this week.

585
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.490
I'm going to be listening to it and I'll give you my own review of it on

586
00:34:32.491 --> 00:34:35.400
Thursday. Just kidding. I fucking hate when people do that,

587
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.170
that I'm supposed to listen to you. Who the fuck are you? You know,

588
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.770
fucking listen to you. I'll listen to it myself. Make up my own mind.

589
00:34:43.771 --> 00:34:47.910
How about that? How about that? All right. They youtube person, youtube person.

590
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:52.290
Anyways, I'm going to be a November 2nd. I'm going to be in clear lake,

591
00:34:52.291 --> 00:34:56.910
Iowa at the surface ballroom. Know the surf ballroom is the,

592
00:34:56.911 --> 00:35:00.810
that's the last place buddy Holly, the big Bopper, Richie Valens,

593
00:35:00.811 --> 00:35:02.010
all of those guys played.

594
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.210
Waylon Jennings was there that night and he went on the bus and everything. Um,

595
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.650
just being a music fan, I don't know if it's slightly morbid to play there,

596
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:12.510
but I'm going to play there and I'm flying in.

597
00:35:12.511 --> 00:35:15.330
I'm landing at the fucking airport. They took off from everyone. They go,

598
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.440
Angie fucking nervous.

599
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.130
They crashed because there was no de icing technology back then.

600
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.050
They had too much weight on their wings,

601
00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:24.900
which changed the shape of the air foil. They were overweight.

602
00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:27.520
They could fucking produce enough lift. They crashed and they die.

603
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.990
That's not going to happen in 2017 so I'm going to be there. Won't happen to me.

604
00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:35.670
It won't happen to you. If you want to check out this legendary venue, uh,

605
00:35:35.671 --> 00:35:39.150
November 2nd clear lake, Iowa surf ballroom.

606
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.570
I'm going to be there with Dean del Ray, um,

607
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.450
who was actually born the same day that they all died.

608
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.850
Not the same year but the same day. So it's going to be,

609
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:49.950
that's going to be tremendously freaky fucking night.

610
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:54.120
I've got a brand new hour and last night I, it could not have gone better.

611
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.270
And I left out half of my fucking jokes. I was having so much fun.

612
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.970
I'm down at the Cape Cod Melody Tent,

613
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:04.050
so please get your tickets November 2nd clear lake, Iowa, the surf ballroom.

614
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.640
And I will be tweeting out and Facebooking out a link because I am an old man.

615
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.750
I'm not on Photoshop. I'm not on Instagram. It's not Photoshop.

616
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.850
What's the other one? That is Instagram. And then there's the other one.

617
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.930
Snapchat. I need to get on those, right?

618
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.420
Is that what I need to do a, by the way,

619
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:23.280
I'm thinking of putting together a college tour,

620
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.640
a tour of colleges in the beginning of next year, um,

621
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.680
to help promote F is for family and bringing a bunch of swag to,

622
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.980
uh, you know, free merchandise, free efforts for family merchandise.

623
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.090
This is what I want to do. If I get enough interest from certain schools,

624
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:44.700
especially the University of Kansas,

625
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:47.850
when the Jayhawks have a home basketball game,

626
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.320
so I can go to that legendary arena, that would be tremendous.

627
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.860
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

628
00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.080
I was actually thinking of doing that once a year, right in every like,

629
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.770
you know, college fucking, um, division. You know,

630
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.510
like one year I'll do a big 10 fucking f is for family tour. I'll do an SCC one,

631
00:37:10.511 --> 00:37:14.980
I'll do a pack 12, whatever the fuck they're called now. Um, the whack,

632
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.890
right. Do something like that. I don't know.

633
00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:19.960
I'm always thinking a fucking ideas like that shit, but uh,

634
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:24.740
just to help promote it and um, yeah, cause that's my fucking job.

635
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.470
I've got to sell the goddamn shoving. Don't get mad at me. Right. All right,

636
00:37:27.471 --> 00:37:30.560
37 minutes in. Here we go. Here we go. All right, let's uh,

637
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.630
let's read some of your questions here for this week. I'm up, up, up, up, up,

638
00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:39.380
up, up the nineties. Dear Billy temple pilot,

639
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.240
I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for the 90s. I was 12 and 1990.

640
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.620
I'm 10 years older than you.

641
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.010
You have bested and had no stress or responsibilities.

642
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.120
I get how that influences this, but it was a good time.

643
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.800
I'm happy with technology now in our society is more conscious of social issues,

644
00:37:57.801 --> 00:37:59.630
but everything is so loud now.

645
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.750
Do you ever get into stylistic for the nineties if so,

646
00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:07.160
what part of the nineties can you have your podcast guy use the friends theme

647
00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:10.850
song for the Thursday podcast? That's a question mark there or anything.

648
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.810
Awesome from the 90s uh, thanks for reading this. If you do,

649
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.070
life is pretty boring these days. And if I could use something,

650
00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.770
uh, to brighten my day as a pet store manager. All right sir.

651
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.800
Here's what's happening to you as you're slipping into your life and you don't

652
00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:35.000
like what's going on. So rather than fixing the, now you're going back in,

653
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.900
that's not, I mean that's, that's a temporary fix. Okay.

654
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.180
If you don't want to manage a pet store,

655
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.950
asked yourself what you really want to do and start slowly walking towards that,

656
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:49.150
taking a half a step,

657
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:52.600
a quarter step every day in one point you're going to look up and God damn it,

658
00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:53.434
there it is.

659
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:58.120
Just like Indiana Jones and then you grab it and all of a sudden a giant ball

660
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:01.840
starts rolling after Ya and you gotta fucking run out of there and that's you

661
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:05.050
after you make it, then trying to stay there. All right.

662
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:09.070
But that's way more exciting than managing this pet store that, you know,

663
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.550
you're saying brighten your day as a pet store manager.

664
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.560
You one of these guys who actually doesn't like animals.

665
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.260
You probably don't like the people right coming in there or whatever.

666
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:19.990
I don't know what it is but it's, but I will answer your question.

667
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.880
My favorite part of the 90s

668
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.830
was the month before nevermind came out and I was listening to the skid row

669
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:33.820
slave to the grind and I thought hair metal and all night when the hair metal,

670
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:38.821
but metal was never going to end cause that was what you love was the end of my

671
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:44.341
youth because I was 22 in 1990 so that was the end of the end of it for me.

672
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.690
So like think about 2000 for you. You're getting out of college,

673
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.290
all this new music is coming out. You're starting to not be able to, you know,

674
00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:54.970
the next few years, you can't keep up with it.

675
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:58.090
What the fuck are they listening to? And then that's what happens.

676
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:59.230
And then you start driving around.

677
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.320
But I'm not gonna let you do this shit that I, I still listened to 'em

678
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.980
you know, I try to listen to newer shit. Like, you know, it's a new band in me,

679
00:40:06.981 --> 00:40:11.300
like Cold War kids and I'm like, I saw them, you know, recently they were on TV.

680
00:40:11.301 --> 00:40:13.880
I'll download some of this stuff and I'll be like, oh, I remember that song,

681
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.990
that fucking ball. Bam, my bow [inaudible] son.

682
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.340
<v 6>Wow.</v>

683
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.390
<v 1>Fucking soon. The guy's singing away the really high voice, amazing voice. And</v>

684
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.190
I was looking at that. It's like that fucking album came out 2006 or something.

685
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.370
So I'm way behind the curve, but I try to stay up on, all right,

686
00:40:35.371 --> 00:40:38.520
you want to hear some embarrassing, I'm going to fucking tell you all my latest,

687
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.680
my latest downloads.

688
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.310
I downloaded Dreamweaver by Gary Wright,

689
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:46.560
that album tremendously.

690
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.600
Tremendously fucking a underrated album.

691
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.250
All right. Cause everybody thinks of, uh,

692
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.760
they think of that song.

693
00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.430
<v 6>We, we'll, we'll train way BA</v>

694
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.650
<v 1>right. And everybody laughs at that song, you know,</v>

695
00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:07.760
they use it in these ironic history hipster fucking ways. I gotta tell you, man,

696
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.180
that fucking album is the shit.

697
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.940
And I'm just stuff is some poppy shit on that. But, um,

698
00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.810
all these years of me talking about loving to play drums and all this stuff,

699
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:25.130
why did nobody tell me about Andy Newmark? Jesus Christ.

700
00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:28.130
That guy's one of the best fucking drummers I've ever heard he plays on this

701
00:41:28.131 --> 00:41:30.620
album. And uh, you know,

702
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:34.100
you don't have to get it for fucking dream weaver or any of that, but like, uh,

703
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.660
love is alive.

704
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.740
The longest time I thought that sounded like clapped into me singing or maybe

705
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:42.260
like one of those, uh, Steve Winwood bands.

706
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.693
<v 3>Um,</v>

707
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.520
<v 1>just listen to how tasty the fucking drums are.</v>

708
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:51.510
And I'll actually post a video this week of him fucking playing with like Rod

709
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.530
Stewart and these guys just fucking Whalen. All right. So I downloaded that.

710
00:41:55.531 --> 00:41:59.490
Then I downloaded Cold War kids, Robertson cowards.

711
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.270
I'm downloading the new queens of the stone age today. And then here's,

712
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.850
oh Jesus, he's in defense to me.

713
00:42:05.851 --> 00:42:09.930
I lost a lot of my music when I dropped my last phone into the toilet. Um,

714
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.470
it was actually in my back pocket and I stood up from taking,

715
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.900
taking a dump. Right? No, no I didn't. I didn't, I was fucking hammered.

716
00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.710
I remember this guy was saying there was something about standing up when you

717
00:42:22.711 --> 00:42:27.060
take a Piss, some fucking health reason. So I sat down like a lady, right?

718
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.900
And I had my phone in my back pocket when I stood up at fucking fell into the

719
00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:35.550
toilet. Fucking brutal. Like I was going to go get that. Nah,

720
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.190
it ain't happened. And so I don't use the cloud and everything.

721
00:42:38.191 --> 00:42:42.750
Just I lost everything. So I downloaded ac DC. If you want blood, you got it.

722
00:42:42.751 --> 00:42:47.751
Live ACDC for those about to rock AC DC high voltage.

723
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.600
Then I had to get my vintage Arrow Smith in there. I downloaded get your wings,

724
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.150
rocks, toys in the attic.

725
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.170
Then I downloaded the new fucking mute math. While I'm on waiting,

726
00:42:58.171 --> 00:43:00.540
I'm still waiting for the rest of that album. Come out to play dead.

727
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.950
I downloaded Glen Campbell rhinestone cowboy cause I've been singing that with

728
00:43:04.951 --> 00:43:09.730
the advertising Lako Rad stone ball bag. Uh,

729
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:14.610
Peter Frampton, Frampton comes alive. All Jay's,

730
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.410
all j a this is all yours. Marvin Gaye, sexual healing download.

731
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.250
Let a fucking tremendous song that is the new royal blood album.

732
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.873
<v 3>Um,</v>

733
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.990
<v 1>Anthony Hamilton. Then I downloaded like three prints,</v>

734
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.050
albums not to have them sign of the times and then a dirty mine,

735
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.790
the first Soundgarden album, the prince album for you.

736
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.470
Then uh, Dave Brubeck live at Carnegie Hall,

737
00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:51.430
then a bunch of miles Davis. That's what I've done in the last couple of months.

738
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.110
Steaming with miles, working with miles round about midnight,

739
00:43:56.111 --> 00:44:00.890
relaxing with miles, cooking with miles. And there you go.

740
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.040
That's what the fuck had been downloaded. What else do I gotta get?

741
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.620
Wayne shorter. The idiot king. Attention deficit.

742
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:13.550
I think that's a, Oh, that's what's his face.

743
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.450
Tim Alexander on drums on that, the brown album.

744
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.760
Bad Motor finger. Temple of the dog. Oh,

745
00:44:20.761 --> 00:44:23.310
that was right when I'm Chris Cornell died.

746
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.690
I had to get all that fucking music back on my phone. John Coltrane,

747
00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:32.490
Sonny Rollins, Tesla skid they ago.

748
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:38.030
Marilyn Manson prime is prime as Primus animals should not act like people.

749
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.520
Pork, soda and sailing, the seeds of cheese.

750
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.800
You know Derosa just sent me a new fucking,

751
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.450
they knew their latest fucking track. It's the shit. I absolutely loved it.

752
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.530
Primus has a new one coming out with the fuck is it called? Let me see here.

753
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.750
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? And my phone and my phone in my phone.

754
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.850
All right. What do I have him underneath? You know,

755
00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:03.040
everybody says Joe has no shoulders. That's not true.

756
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.620
He lacks the meat that is between your neck and your shoulders basically is

757
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:12.250
trapped. He's, he's, he was born without it. Um, all right, Primus,

758
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:15.070
the seven. Check that out this week. All right.

759
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.590
Enough with this old man telling you the music that he likes.

760
00:45:17.591 --> 00:45:21.820
Let's get back to your young people questions here, shall we? So, um, yeah,

761
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.100
when grunge came in, I got up. I didn't like the first,

762
00:45:24.101 --> 00:45:27.850
like when Pearl jam first came out in Nevada, first came out,

763
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.630
I didn't like those bands because they knocked all my bands off the top 10.

764
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.090
You know, I was like, this isn't a good band. What about Brittany Fox?

765
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.560
What about winger, man? What about warrant? Um, yeah, I listened.

766
00:45:41.561 --> 00:45:43.300
I didn't necessarily buy all those albums,

767
00:45:43.301 --> 00:45:45.340
but I didn't think any of that was bad music. I was young.

768
00:45:45.341 --> 00:45:46.690
I didn't fucking know any better, you know,

769
00:45:46.691 --> 00:45:49.510
at least those guys could fucking play under these cons today with a fucking

770
00:45:49.511 --> 00:45:53.590
laptop and a God damn Christmas tree in their head. Um,

771
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.690
so it took me a long time to admit that nirvana pearl jam were great bands,

772
00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:02.530
but like Soundgarden and fucking Alison chains had like fucking that anger in

773
00:46:02.531 --> 00:46:07.420
there. Um, and just the sound of the lead singers,

774
00:46:07.421 --> 00:46:12.200
man, I just, I really liked their front men and uh, now of course, you know,

775
00:46:12.201 --> 00:46:14.120
I love Pearl Jam. I love Nirvana and all that shit,

776
00:46:14.121 --> 00:46:18.140
but I was a bit of a baby when their music came out. I was, I was too young.

777
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.210
This is the first time I've seen my music go away.

778
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:23.540
So I wasn't mature enough to be like, you know what, you know,

779
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.580
I have to accept that, uh, you know,

780
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:30.680
my time has come and gone and that this is what the fucking music is now and I

781
00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:33.260
should listen to him. It took me a good 20 years to be able to do that.

782
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:37.490
All right. Hey there, Billy Clinton. Uh, did you, did you hear this yet?

783
00:46:37.491 --> 00:46:39.410
The court ruled that the head of

784
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.530
the Democratic National Convention Debit Wasserman, that's her name, Dib. It

785
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.000
Sholtz rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders.

786
00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.560
The court. What court.

787
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.450
So this woman under the influence of Hillary Clinton's camp tampered in the u s

788
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.990
election process, but none of the Democrats are celebrity.

789
00:47:02.991 --> 00:47:07.991
Do rights are going to be outraged because there's sanctimonious ass hats.

790
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:14.390
And for the record, I was a registered Democrat and stop fucking saying that.

791
00:47:14.391 --> 00:47:16.300
If it's a fact, it's a fact. I don't need to,

792
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.340
I used to be or this or I actually voted for Obama.

793
00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:22.220
I don't give a fuck what you did. If what you're saying is factual,

794
00:47:22.221 --> 00:47:25.780
I don't need to know what the fuck you did. I was a registered Democrat.

795
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:27.980
It's about 2010, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

796
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.960
With the exception of Bush and Gerald Ford A. Anyways,

797
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:36.010
the hypocrisy is just so insane to me to not be mad at this,

798
00:47:36.011 --> 00:47:39.580
especially as a democrat. I think you have to have clinical issues. Yeah. Well,

799
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:43.120
I heard like Bernie Sanders was drawn a bunch of people and they just didn't

800
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.600
even cover it. All right. Now where does this coming from? This is the, uh,

801
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.000
the observer.com.

802
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.310
June, 2016,

803
00:47:52.311 --> 00:47:56.450
a class action suit was filed against the Democratic National Committee and the

804
00:47:56.451 --> 00:47:59.210
former Democratic national, uh, oh, it's Debbie,

805
00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.090
Debbie Wasserman Schultz for violating, uh,

806
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.100
the DNC charter by rigging the Democratic presidential primaries for Hillary

807
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:12.960
Clinton against Bernie Sanders. How hilarious would this be?

808
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.660
It's actually doubly sad if this is true.

809
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:21.050
Even former Senate minority leader Harry Reid admitted in July,

810
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:24.750
2016 I knew everybody knew that this was not a fair deal.

811
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.650
He added that Debbie Wasserman Schultz should have resigned much sooner than she

812
00:48:28.651 --> 00:48:29.250
did.

813
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:33.000
The lawsuit was filed to push the Democratic National Convention to admit their

814
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:37.200
wrongdoing and provide Bernie Sanders supporters who supported him financially

815
00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:41.100
with millions of dollars in campaign contribution with restitution for being

816
00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:44.880
cheated on August 25th,

817
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.070
2017 federal judge Williams Schlei is this all true,

818
00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:52.071
dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which the

819
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.080
Democratic National Convention to attorneys that argued that the DNC would be

820
00:48:55.081 --> 00:48:59.520
with, well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidates.

821
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.100
That was their argument. So they weren't denying it.

822
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.760
And evaluating plaintiff's claims that this, you know what I'm going to do?

823
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:10.530
I'm going to send this to Jimmy door and I want him to, I cause he, you know,

824
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:14.280
I'm too stupid to be able to debunk this or say that it's actually fucking true.

825
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:19.190
I want to know. I want to know what love is.

826
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.590
I mean, this wouldn't surprise me. You know what I mean?

827
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.870
I would actually love it.

828
00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:30.871
This got some fucking attention just to truly shut up all these fucking dopes in

829
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:35.480
Hollywood. You know, you know, back in the day. Yeah. I mean, I guess I,

830
00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:38.110
I mean I think that, I mean it was, can do,

831
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:40.960
I'm not trying to be the spokesperson for fucking Western oil or whatever the

832
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:43.920
fuck people are trying to do out there, but like I,

833
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.410
I tried to like evenly trash everybody and I'm totally into conspiracy theory.

834
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.900
Like none of this is shocking to me.

835
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.513
<v 4>You know,</v>

836
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.910
<v 1>I t I just think we're just inherently flood and I based that on myself</v>

837
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.710
as I fucking, you know, I as like just fuck up all the time,

838
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:13.080
which is what just inherently flood people. All right Jimmy door.

839
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.740
Then we go, this is how dumb I am.

840
00:50:16.741 --> 00:50:21.340
I'm going to send this to him and I'm just going to text, is this true?

841
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:27.530
You know, and he loves me enough to actually reply this.

842
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.760
I know part of him is going to feel sad that I'm as dumb as I am and then I have

843
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:38.120
his phone number. Um, yeah. I mean,

844
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.540
none of that surprises me. I mean it was,

845
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:46.780
he kind of felt that Bernie was getting boxed out and I guess maybe the

846
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.223
Democratic National Committee does have the,

847
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:52.520
I guess does have the right to do it the same way the NFL had the right to

848
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:56.450
suspend Tom Brady, whether he did anything or not. I mean,

849
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:58.520
when they took it to court, they go, yeah, this is bullshit.

850
00:50:58.521 --> 00:51:00.200
You don't have enough fucking evidence. And they're like, well,

851
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:03.170
we're a corporation. Right. Does it cooperation? I have a right,

852
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.920
this is blended. Some play. Yes you do. Well, Tom Brady's our employee,

853
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:09.470
therefore he suspended. Um,

854
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.410
that's Kinda like what they did to Bernie Sanders and yes, I did.

855
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:16.040
Just compare him to Tom Brady. I think they have a lot in common.

856
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.280
I'm living in a retirement community at 33 years of age. What's up?

857
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:25.010
Freckled ball bag. Um,

858
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.210
a friend recently turned me onto your podcast. It's hilarious. Well thank you.

859
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.990
Thank you for preventing me from killing myself on my one hour commute to work.

860
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:35.660
Well, that's great. I like to, I like to do what I can,

861
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.620
although I am into population. Maybe I should take a control population control.

862
00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:42.050
Maybe we should take a couple of weeks off. Uh, my wife,

863
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.190
28 and I 33 finally had enough money to buy her first home to what?

864
00:51:46.191 --> 00:51:47.090
You guys are crushing it.

865
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.180
So he purchased a nice little townhouse in Connecticut.

866
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.500
We didn't know at the time,

867
00:51:51.501 --> 00:51:55.910
but we were moving into a community that is potentially the evil offspring of a

868
00:51:55.911 --> 00:52:00.440
retirement village and the house of wax. Uh, yeah.

869
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:03.140
Well that's what happens when you buy your first house. You so excited.

870
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:07.700
You don't drive around. You don't know the questions to ask now, you know.

871
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:09.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

872
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.610
<v 1>Are the people old, these shit around here. Just out of curiosity,</v>

873
00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.600
is this a drug filled neighborhood?

874
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:21.480
Is there any chemical fucking shit in the water?

875
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.650
What are the schools like? You know, all those questions you have to ask.

876
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.350
All right, we are nice, courteous people. And so we think

877
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.870
so. We think he's a, so don't take the anger in this email out of context.

878
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.380
Um, well he had a little perspective that we use.

879
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.230
If you said we're nice courtesy people, courteous people.

880
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:44.160
But the fact that you actually have the intelligence to say are so we think

881
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.970
understanding that there is another perspective in life other than your own.

882
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.480
We've helped some of our old ass neighbors carry shit, you know,

883
00:52:51.481 --> 00:52:55.020
because they can't, with the osteoporosis and everything,

884
00:52:55.021 --> 00:52:57.570
we wave and chat with them when walking our dog.

885
00:52:57.571 --> 00:53:01.530
And we even hold the charity beer pong tournament in New York City every year to

886
00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:06.240
raise money for ms, uh, unrelated to our community. But it shows we care.

887
00:53:06.241 --> 00:53:09.930
Question Mark, I guess question Mark Anyhoo enough about us.

888
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:11.611
Uh,

889
00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:16.611
this past weekend we had my brother and sister in law in town and invited

890
00:53:16.681 --> 00:53:19.400
another couple over on Saturday, Saturday.

891
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:23.910
I'm sorry if I blew your eardrums out. I tried to pull it away enough. Uh,

892
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.680
I don't, I took it away at a time. Sorry. Uh,

893
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.360
we went to hang out at school at our, at our pool, sorry.

894
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:34.350
We took a float snacks, a couple of beers and a speaker.

895
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.390
They were five to seven other people at the pool, all in their hundreds.

896
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.300
It did not look like the pool scene from Caddyshack. Uh,

897
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.091
we hung out,

898
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:50.091
chatted sip to beer and listened on low to Jack Johnson or some other Melo soft

899
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:51.744
shit.

900
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.820
Monday morning at 10:00 AM the entire community got this email residents,

901
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.140
it was reported to the board and the management that over this past weekend

902
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:04.800
there was some owners and guests who behaved inappropriately,

903
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.290
loud and shout in conversations,

904
00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.450
foul language and may have partaken in alcoholic beverages prior to or while

905
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:13.500
visiting the pool.

906
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:18.770
None of these things are acceptable and are also violation of the pool rules of

907
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.240
the Old Fox court.

908
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:25.830
Obviously you added that if [inaudible] said individuals were seeing behaving in

909
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:29.670
such a manner going forward, the police may be called and set.

910
00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:34.110
Individuals will not be permitted to use the facilities and may also be subject

911
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:38.460
to a hearing in front of the board whereby fines may be imposed.

912
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.990
The pool facility is for the peaceful enjoyment of all residents and we hope to

913
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:44.460
keep it that way. Thank you.

914
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.370
Signed the old ass board of directors. Jesus Christ. Dude,

915
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.400
what the f you didn't realize you fucking bought a house in a retirement

916
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:58.710
community says first off,

917
00:54:58.711 --> 00:55:01.260
let me say I've had,

918
00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.640
I had nothing against the elderly. I love my grandparents. It's,

919
00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.770
you don't have to stop establishing credibility.

920
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:10.550
You bought a fucking house as a buddy in the, in the,

921
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:13.470
it's like the movie cocoon, but if you jump in the pool,

922
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:18.120
you're still fucking old again. It, um, anyways,

923
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.230
I called her once a week.

924
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:23.040
I enjoy quiet and that in the couch for some scotch or an old fashioned and

925
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:26.010
shit. I still use hotmail. Yes,

926
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:31.440
we're a part of Hoa and in rules above, above about alcohol strengths.

927
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.000
The, at the pool you can only have two guests per household. Oh Shit.

928
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:37.470
We violated the covenant.

929
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.310
But this email from the board is still absurd right now. It's not absurd.

930
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:44.430
You just didn't do your homework. You didn't do your homework.

931
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:46.973
That's what happened.

932
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.400
You didn't do your homework and they just fucking rip the spread here with that

933
00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:54.790
pen in the back pocket, waiting on my mother's fucking quilt here. Um,

934
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.610
on the fuck am I here? I got to go back to this here. By the way,

935
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:03.270
everybody thinks every sound of my podcast is a fart now because I hold this

936
00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:05.640
thing to my chest and he fucking sound that's made dough.

937
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:10.500
You fucking ripped ass last week. Uh, I mean, maybe I did.

938
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:14.850
I don't think I, I don't feel that I am. Maybe I am. I don't know. Um,

939
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.210
but it's, I mean, I'm in my house, you know, I have to Fart. I let it go.

940
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:21.270
You can't fucking smell it. Deal with it. Um,

941
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.440
no dude is all on you. This is just, he said,

942
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:28.270
but loud conversations. What?

943
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:31.900
Drinking alcoholic beverages prior to visiting the pool area. You kidding me?

944
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:36.430
The police may be called get an f in life. Do Do.

945
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:40.000
This is their life. This is the end of their life. And they want quiet.

946
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.780
Okay? Half of them probably fought and fucking wars.

947
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:47.770
The last thing I need is you with your new fangled fucking Elvis' music.

948
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:52.550
That is Jack Johnson to them. Look at this is the deal.

949
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.710
You guys fucked up.

950
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.793
<v 3>Okay?</v>

951
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.770
<v 1>You guys fucked up. All right. And this is part of buying your first house.</v>

952
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.130
Okay. I bought my first house back in 2011.

953
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.983
<v 3>Um,</v>

954
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.370
<v 1>and you know what I was like, wow, this is a great old house.</v>

955
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.840
It has a lot of character and you know,

956
00:57:12.841 --> 00:57:17.130
you know what my fucking old people at the pool was galvanized pipes in the

957
00:57:17.131 --> 00:57:21.360
walls, cloth wiring, a gas leak flashing.

958
00:57:21.361 --> 00:57:25.380
When I turned on the lights to possibly ignite the gas underneath my fucking

959
00:57:25.381 --> 00:57:29.160
house, a wood rot, termites,

960
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:34.530
non permitted fucking building shit. I've just, you fucking name it,

961
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.520
put a new roof on it. That guy fucked up. He didn't reattach the thing.

962
00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:41.070
The water came through. They blamed me. I just said fuck it.

963
00:57:41.071 --> 00:57:43.770
I paid for it myself. This is part of it, dude.

964
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.990
I'm really sorry that you're going through this.

965
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.560
I'm sure there's somebody else old that will buy your fucking house.

966
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:51.903
<v 3>Um,</v>

967
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.660
<v 1>other than that, I would just, you are in a communal area.</v>

968
00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.160
I would be quiet when you go down to the pool. I mean,

969
00:58:01.161 --> 00:58:02.630
I try to look at the bright side.

970
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:06.410
At least nobody's going to be listening to loud fucking Benny Goodman music all

971
00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:08.570
the way into the night because old people, you know,

972
00:58:08.571 --> 00:58:11.990
they fall asleep like nine times a day. So,

973
00:58:11.991 --> 00:58:14.540
and even if you don't like your neighbor, they're going to die soon.

974
00:58:14.541 --> 00:58:16.910
There's a lot of positive ways to look at this and you can also,

975
00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:21.290
you can always sell. So I would make the best of it. You can always Uber.

976
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.371
I would Uber,

977
00:58:22.371 --> 00:58:26.000
I would go out and go get fucking hammered and be loud in the young part of town

978
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.260
and then come back.

979
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.980
Just make sure you get some sort of electric car to cruising up real quietly to

980
00:58:30.981 --> 00:58:33.680
your fucking front door. I'm sorry you're going through that.

981
00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:37.310
But what you learned is you have to fucking check out your neighborhood before

982
00:58:37.311 --> 00:58:41.010
you, uh, you know, you gotta read everything,

983
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.440
you know, so that's the deal. All right. I hope it works out for you.

984
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.380
All right. Oh, guess who just texted me back?

985
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:55.040
This is why Jimmy door is to shit cause I just read shit and Jimmy gets to the

986
00:58:55.051 --> 00:58:58.470
bottom. But this is what Jimmy just sent me back. Basically. Yes,

987
00:58:58.471 --> 00:58:59.370
the judge left,

988
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:03.660
opened the door for the lawyers too to refile in a way that would be more

989
00:59:03.661 --> 00:59:04.494
successful.

990
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:08.730
The important thing in this case is that the lawsuit forced the DNC lawyer to

991
00:59:08.731 --> 00:59:13.380
admit in court that they don't have to run a fair primary and that they can pick

992
00:59:13.381 --> 00:59:17.910
and choose whoever, whoever they want and can ignore the voters.

993
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.010
Uh, they can ignore the voters, will if they choose to do so.

994
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:27.050
The wikileaks emails revealed that the DNC was colluding with the Clinton

995
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:29.900
campaign and gave her an unfair advantage,

996
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.550
which is why Wasserman Schultz resigned before the DNC convention last summer.

997
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:36.440
The judge dismissed the case.

998
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:41.180
It appears to me based on the fact that plaintiff did not have stand standing to

999
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:44.840
sue and the federal court did not have jurisdiction in this case.

1000
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:48.200
I am interviewing the lawyer who filed this case today,

1001
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.050
so hopefully lots will be cleared up in that interview. So there you go.

1002
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:57.770
Search Jimmy door. Um, I'll send out a link to [inaudible].

1003
00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.630
That's a comedian. That's, that's an informed guy here.

1004
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.590
That thing was written here on eloquent. That was,

1005
01:00:02.591 --> 01:00:07.240
I actually sounded smart while reading that. Um, check that out.

1006
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.510
Oh Man. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1007
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.350
All those women who cried over fucking Hillary Clinton and she's just as fucking

1008
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:19.190
filthy as this guy. Can you believe this? Trump. Can you fucking believe this?

1009
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:22.970
Trump. That's all you hear out in fucking Hollywood land where I live.

1010
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.910
And it's just like I want to, I hope it's true. So I'm gonna be like,

1011
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.350
well what do you think about that?

1012
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:32.460
And watch them completely dismiss it the same way to go back to Tom Brady or

1013
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:35.450
I'll be all right. So He lets a concert, what? They air out of a ball.

1014
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:39.240
What about when you guys did this and that the other people root for the wall?

1015
01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:41.720
That was no fucking big deal. Cause our team did it.

1016
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.520
I fucking love it. I love it. Oh Jesus Christ. I love it. Okay.

1017
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.780
Boss, racist, racist, racist. Question Mark.

1018
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:56.910
Hey Billy. Booze bag. Ah, Billy. No Fun. 11 days. Motherfucker.

1019
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.970
Uh, shut up. I know you're not drinking. Oh, he got me. Look at that. Um,

1020
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.530
any more, it's all I could come up with. All right. Bill recently,

1021
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:09.430
our company at an event where we give a tour to possible clients who will

1022
01:01:09.431 --> 01:01:11.470
partner with us in the future during this event,

1023
01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:13.660
our boss who is outgoing and funny,

1024
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:18.810
was ironing white sheets and thought it'd be funny to poke fun at the KKK by

1025
01:01:19.001 --> 01:01:23.230
placing a white sheet over his head and saying, black lives matter.

1026
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:24.310
Uh,

1027
01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:27.520
he immediately recognized the situation and took it off his head and address the

1028
01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:28.061
whole company.

1029
01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:32.860
The next day he apologized and made our counselors available to the company for

1030
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.400
whoever was affected and offended. Jesus fucking Christ.

1031
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.260
You've got to go through all of that.

1032
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.630
I just love these people that are just so fucking,

1033
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.930
I don't know where the fuck they live that they feel like I can do this in the

1034
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:48.800
not going to have a problem. But then everybody's like so fucking hurt.

1035
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:50.150
They need to be like counseled.

1036
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.830
Why don't you just try to get out of your job for a couple of hours?

1037
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.010
Just walk up to the guy and say you're a fucking asshole.

1038
01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.930
And then if you want the guy fired, just say that.

1039
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.290
So I'm just gonna sit there and hold your hand. I'm,

1040
01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:07.291
the only problem was that he left out the black lives mattered part in the first

1041
01:02:07.451 --> 01:02:12.010
meeting and simply said, oh, wait a minute. So when I would, he's saying, okay,

1042
01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:12.844
wait a second.

1043
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:19.680
The only problem was that he left out the black life lives matter part in the

1044
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:23.820
first meeting and simply said, he placed the sheet over his head,

1045
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:28.700
which is where the outrage came from. You know, dude,

1046
01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:31.130
that's one of the most important part information,

1047
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.020
most important information in this fucking story.

1048
01:02:33.021 --> 01:02:34.580
And you left out some words here.

1049
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:40.000
The only problem was that he left out the black lives mattered part in the first

1050
01:02:40.001 --> 01:02:42.790
meeting and simply said, he plays

1051
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.760
the sheet over his head,

1052
01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:50.720
which is where we're WGRE we're, the outrage came from to,

1053
01:02:50.721 --> 01:02:53.960
what am I supposed to do with this? And the counselor meeting with everyone.

1054
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.140
I couldn't help but notice only white middle aged women were trashing the guy.

1055
01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.680
They were crying, et cetera.

1056
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:03.970
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1057
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.180
<v 1>Not One minority in that room said they were affected.</v>

1058
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:12.420
It pissed me off because it was almost insulting to minorities watching this.

1059
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:17.730
What if there was actually a minority who was actually racially discriminate

1060
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.350
against and went to court and wasn't listened to to it?

1061
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:22.040
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

1062
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.460
I'm 90% sure these women were just looking for money.

1063
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.340
It's not like our boss tried to hide or make excuses,

1064
01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:32.590
so the white women got offended. What am I,

1065
01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:36.670
this is like a fucking beat sheet for a script that isn't written yet.

1066
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:46.280
What white middle aged women were trashing the guy, they were crying,

1067
01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:47.114
et cetera.

1068
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.460
That fucking sentence ended.

1069
01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:55.160
Then he began a new paragraph with that and then starts talking about the

1070
01:03:55.161 --> 01:03:57.440
minority women there. I don't, I don't know what you're talking about here, sir.

1071
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:00.403
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1072
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.090
<v 1>Okay. So, okay, so you're asking me what, okay,</v>

1073
01:04:03.091 --> 01:04:07.890
what am I opinions you think these women are just looking for an opportunity to

1074
01:04:07.891 --> 01:04:10.200
sue sue, s e w

1075
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:17.070
so for money or do you think they actually believe these ladies were offended?

1076
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:21.090
Thanks, Bill. I don't know what you're talking about here, sir. I have no idea.

1077
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:22.763
I have no idea.

1078
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.940
I'm I making fun of white women for acting like they were offended and crying

1079
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:32.510
because you think I have no idea. I don't know what Sir proofread. Okay.

1080
01:04:32.511 --> 01:04:34.010
I'm not a good speller either but you know,

1081
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.790
I do know where the spell check is and I hit the button and it erases all my

1082
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.100
impurities. Alright. My fiance is in into fucking other men.

1083
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:48.200
Okay. He says I feel or she said, I don't want,

1084
01:04:48.201 --> 01:04:50.300
what the fuck this is what gender this is. He said,

1085
01:04:50.301 --> 01:04:53.990
I feel like this is a slightly different yet amusing take on relationship issues

1086
01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.400
and would love to hear your tackle. You tackle this in a podcast basically.

1087
01:04:58.401 --> 01:05:00.800
I really like watching my girl. Fuck other men.

1088
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:05.780
It's not a cuckold thing because I'll fucker right after and it's always the

1089
01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:10.390
best sex we ever had. Right after.

1090
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:17.890
You don't ever shower first sir. Right after. Okay. Thank you. No,

1091
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.460
I don't judge. Whatever you want to do, if that's what you guys are in.

1092
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.510
My issue is that our sex is already great and I'm well above average in size and

1093
01:05:25.511 --> 01:05:29.230
stamina. So it's hard for her to find another guy.

1094
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.530
She's actually interested in, oh Jesus Christ,

1095
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:36.370
Jesus Christ. You started all the way to the left.

1096
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:39.760
Now we're all the way to the right. Oh Wow. Yeah. This guy,

1097
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.490
this fucking guy here. You know, I don't mind.

1098
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:44.770
I don't mind her fucking other guys. I can handle it.

1099
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.820
Cause at the end of the day, my Dick show big, nobody can follow me.

1100
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.700
I'm okay now I'm judging the guy. I don't know why I'm doing I.

1101
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.680
This is just all over the fucking map.

1102
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.920
I don't push the issue because I'm confident in my abilities.

1103
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:03.940
Evidently so confident you gotta fucking write an email about it and don't want

1104
01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:06.940
her to have a bad time simply for my pleasure.

1105
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:09.280
But I wanted to know your opinion on the subject.

1106
01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.140
We have threesomes with other women.

1107
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:15.500
God bless you and I can't even get ended them.

1108
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.340
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1109
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.140
<v 1>So I can't judge her. I love her.</v>

1110
01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:23.430
And our amazing sex has been a driving factor after almost four years. Yet.

1111
01:06:23.431 --> 01:06:27.870
There's something about fucking her after she's been with another man that is so

1112
01:06:27.871 --> 01:06:28.704
hot to me,

1113
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:33.770
I can't actually accurately explain it and she just doesn't seem into it because

1114
01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.490
as she puts it, I do it better. Dude,

1115
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.550
this is one of the greatest emails. I hope you if VM, if you just made this up,

1116
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:45.880
I would really appreciate your opinion on this weird kind of relationship where

1117
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:50.710
the issue for me is that I can't get off because the girl as incredible as she

1118
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:53.220
is is too perfect. What?

1119
01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.620
Well, the issue for me is that I can't get off because the girl

1120
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:06.170
as incredible is, she is is too perfect. So to weigh her,

1121
01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.340
to make her not perfect is to have you watch your fuck. Another guy,

1122
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.630
she got a giant Dick and you enjoy it and you kinda like want to show like

1123
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.090
that is the only way I can look at it.

1124
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.240
This is what you like the head like the best comedian in the fucking country.

1125
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.170
All right,

1126
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:33.580
but there's still some level of insecurity you have that you have to go on on

1127
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:34.210
these, these,

1128
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:38.440
these shows where the comics aren't at your level and you have to go on last and

1129
01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:42.760
you have to fucking kill harder and kill longer than anybody else to prove that

1130
01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:45.670
you are the best comedian in the fucking country, if not the world,

1131
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:49.840
if not the fucking universe. Right. Is that what it is?

1132
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.100
Is it the fact that you know, that you fucking nail in or better than these,

1133
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:55.450
these other fucking guys,

1134
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:59.800
they come out with their average Dick's and their little fucking dicks and she's

1135
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:03.820
bored shitless. Do you make the other people watch?

1136
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.370
You know what I mean? Like you helping out their golf swing it all, yeah.

1137
01:08:09.371 --> 01:08:10.530
You keep lifting your head.

1138
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.970
You gotta fucking keep your head down as you follow through. Dude. I don't,

1139
01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:21.680
I don't have the problems you have sir. All right. I am very followible.

1140
01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:26.950
<v 3>Um, I have no idea. Uh,</v>

1141
01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:29.640
<v 1>I, I do what I, I have no idea.</v>

1142
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.790
That is like I would send that into a,

1143
01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:35.700
can you please go on Dr Phil?

1144
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.660
Cause I just want to watch him and see what goes on in his eyes when he listens

1145
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:45.160
to this story where he just goes like, so you NIAID,

1146
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:50.890
<v 8>I have another man have sex with your woman where the penile devise that is</v>

1147
01:08:52.351 --> 01:08:57.180
smaller than yours in order for you to get off. Last words you're saying.

1148
01:08:58.030 --> 01:09:02.010
<v 1>And you know, Doctor Phil's got some giant x comp Dick, right? You know,</v>

1149
01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:05.880
he's got some fucking huge Hogan. That's what you do.

1150
01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:10.110
That's the end of the episode is you go in the back and you watch doctor Phil.

1151
01:09:10.111 --> 01:09:10.944
Fuck you

1152
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.640
with the sweat pouring off his fucking head and you're just sitting there

1153
01:09:18.641 --> 01:09:22.420
relaxed and confident. Right. That'd be funny. He probably,

1154
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.880
he probably wouldn't get naked. He just dropped his pants down.

1155
01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:28.880
He'd still have his fucking wingtips on. Um,

1156
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:32.990
you know what he'd do to try to [inaudible] our ear in the fucking, you know,

1157
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:36.120
this dirty talk will be how much fucking money he's worth. Uh,

1158
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.000
he want to go to Oprah's tonight. Hi. You want to go?

1159
01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.750
<v 8>Do you want to go to Oprah's tonight? I can make it happen,</v>

1160
01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:47.840
<v 1>but that's, I'm sorry. I know this is a fucked up podcast, but I didn't,</v>

1161
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:52.160
I didn't, I wasn't the one that took it into that area. All right.

1162
01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:56.000
Other people did. Ah, that was really weird. That was a really weird visual.

1163
