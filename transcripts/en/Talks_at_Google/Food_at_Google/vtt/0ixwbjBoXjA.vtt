00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.930
CHRIS FISCHER: Well, it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.270
Thank you, Tanya,
for organizing this.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.660
We just wanted to get together
and talk about modern New

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.160
England cuisine,
and where we think

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.920
it is, where we think it's
going, and drink some water.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.047
We actually wanted to drink
beer, but they wouldn't let us.

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:25.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.120
Both these guys got the day off.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.570
I don't really have a schedule.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.900
So Matt Jennings on my right
was born and raised in Boston.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.740
He had a restaurant
in Providence

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.270
for 11 years called
Farmstead, and he recently

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.230
came back to Boston to open
Townsman in downtown Boston

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.450
that three months ago
was just voted "Best

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.410
new restaurant in Boston."

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.560
Nico Monday, born and raised
in northern California.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.219
He worked at Chez Panisse
for six years with his wife,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.510
where he fell in love with her.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.550
Everything I read
about you-- "They

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.650
fell in love at Chez Panisse."

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.720
Everything is so
beautiful at Chez Panisse.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.240
So anyway, they moved
out here to Gloucester,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.250
where Amelia is from,
to open first The Market

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.790
on Lobster Cove, one of the most
beautiful experiences of just

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.681
getting to that restaurant.

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.680
Jumping off the bridge--

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.250
NICO MONDAY: It's not
on the way to much.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.620
CHRIS FISCHER: It's on
the way to the restaurant.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.800
That's where you go.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.080
NICO MONDAY: Exactly.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.538
CHRIS FISCHER: And
then as he said,

00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:34.640
it's literally falling
off into the water.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.970
After The Market, he
decided to take his passion

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.030
for wood-burning ovens--
which we actually

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.907
all share-- to The Market, where
they serve pizzas and oysters.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:48.990
NICO MONDAY: Short &amp; Main.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.400
CHRIS FISCHER: Sorry.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.100
What did I call it?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
NICO MONDAY: The Market.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.020
Do you have a wood-burning
oven at Townsman?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.145
MATT JENNINGS: No, I don't.

00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:54.934
I wish I did.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:55.630
I wish I did.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.005
CHRIS FISCHER:
You have a smoker.

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.560
MATT JENNINGS: I
have a big smoker.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.920
Couldn't have wood with 250
residential units upstairs.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.670
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.830
That's a lot.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.610
MATT JENNINGS: They
didn't want that.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.750
CHRIS FISCHER: And to tell
you about myself for a moment,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.300
I grew up on Martha's Vineyard.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.310
I currently operate
my grandmother's farm.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.940
She turned 100 three
weeks ago, two weeks ago.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.600
Still feeding her very
well, and she's keeping

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.552
us all very well entertained.

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.760
I most recently ran a
restaurant in Martha's Vineyard

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.990
called The Beach Plum
Restaurant, where

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.838
I built a wood oven, and I
took it with me when I left.

00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:32.796
NICO MONDAY: Good call.

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:33.962
You gotta pack 'em up when--

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:37.750
CHRIS FISCHER: That was
my severance package.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.600
And I just published
a cookbook-- my first.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.340
The Beetlebung Farm
Cookbook came out June 2nd.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.520
It's on sale here today.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.010
So I just wanted to get
together with these guys

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.880
and talk about seafood,
oysters, cooking, New England.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.880
We served oysters today
from my friend Roy.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.070
Roy is someone I admire
because he wears sweatpants

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.550
all the time.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.700
And I mean, I just-- don't you
want to wear sweatpants pretty

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.200
much--

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.320
MATT JENNINGS: Leisure suit.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.153
CHRIS FISCHER: Yeah.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.140
Well, with an
apron, nobody really

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.030
knows what you have
underneath there.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.920
But oysters are this
quintessential New England

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.200
food.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.880
They're sort of--
they're so decadent,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.760
and they're also so plentiful.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.070
And so they're fun to get.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.880
They're easy.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.820
They're not very easy
to eat-- I mean, shuck--

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.910
but they're easy to eat.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.326
NICO MONDAY: And
sustainable-- one

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.880
of the most sustainable
things that we have up here.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.330
CHRIS FISCHER: And so we
wanted to serve oysters for you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.760
guys to bribe you into coming.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.730
And you guys both serve
oysters at your restaurant,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.249
and so that's where
we're gonna start.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.290
NICO MONDAY: There we go.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.204
CHRIS FISCHER: What is
your first oyster memory?

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.570
MATT JENNINGS: Hmm.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.830
Well, I don't really
have-- I don't recall

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.100
having a first oyster memory.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.760
I mean, I have more of a first
clam memory than anything else.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760
CHRIS FISCHER: Which is?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.710
MATT JENNINGS: Which is
going out and getting quahogs

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.350
with my dad.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.717
CHRIS FISCHER: Did you
ever dig for razor clams?

00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:06.550
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.310
Stepped on razor clams.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.480
CHRIS FISCHER: Yes, exactly.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.940
They're aptly named.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.910
Do you have razor
clams up in Gloucester?

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.130
NICO MONDAY: We do.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.690
Yeah, there's a
few left out there.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.210
CHRIS FISCHER: Yeah.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.376
They're very sensitive--
speaking of sustainability,

00:04:16.376 --> 00:04:21.230
they're very sensitive to any
sort of changes in toxicity

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.300
of the water, et cetera.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.560
So they are disappearing.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.130
We were getting them from
the Island Creek guys.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.280
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah,
Ipswich area still has some.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.090
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.715
This winter moved around
some of the clamming flats,

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:37.040
and there's actually a huge
clamming flat just developed

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.085
over the winter right
in front of The Market.

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:41.960
The guys have just been
out there going nuts.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.793
MATT JENNINGS: We're
having such a hard time

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:50.125
getting any shellfish so
late into the season because

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.580
of the snow pack.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.143
And ice was still covering
all the mud flats,

00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:56.280
so they couldn't even clam.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.980
CHRIS FISCHER: And then
when all the snow melted,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.110
everything's broken.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.307
Kind of like having a farm--
you wade and wade and wade.

00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:04.140
And then you're like,
Oh my God, I'm thawed.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.764
And then your--

00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:06.420
MATT JENNINGS: It's
the big let down.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.080
CHRIS FISCHER: It's true.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.860
But Nico, you were
saying-- Nico, again,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.580
came from northern California.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.050
Your godmother is Alice
Waters-- probably grew up

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.820
sitting on the bar at Chez
Panisse eating oysters.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.780
NICO MONDAY: I did.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.797
Spoiled rotten.

00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:25.380
CHRIS FISCHER: And
coming out, he also

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.050
said, "There's only one
way to eat an oyster.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.940
Out of Alice Waters' hand."

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.696
NICO MONDAY: That's not
what I said at all, Chris.

00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:36.275
No, we were talking
about whether you

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:38.900
like to cook oysters, or whether
you like to just eat them raw,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.710
or different preparations.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.700
And for me, it's one of
the most perfect foods that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.500
comes with its own
spoon, and you just

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.740
do as little as possible to it,
especially when you're pulling

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.520
it right out of these waters.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.260
Like, a little mignonette,
and that's all.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.520
That's all you need, if that.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.020
CHRIS FISCHER: What
do you drink with it?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.394
NICO MONDAY: Well, we were
going to get a case of Tecates

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.290
and just go to town.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.500
We drink a lot of rose up
at The Market Restaurant

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.330
out on the deck.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.749
And that for me is also a really
wonderful childhood memory.

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.540
I don't know if that's
OK to say-- drinking

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.550
rose as a childhood memory.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.000
But yeah, eating oysters,
and eating everything growing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.205
up at Chez Panisse-- there
was usually a bottle of

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:28.970
rose close at hand.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.620
And you're standing
up on the cooler

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.480
making pizzas
before you could see

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.669
into the thing, every
spare moment that we had.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.210
You know, there was this place--
Tomales Bay Oyster Company--

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.640
to kind of answer your question
about your first oyster

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.360
memories, I don't remember
the first time I ate one,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.520
but I remember going
up to Tomales Bay

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.120
and just sitting on the
funky old picnic tables,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.870
and watching the guys pull
bags right out of the ocean.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.000
And I just knew,
that is how that is

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.030
meant to be done right there.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.607
Yeah.

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:00.940
I haven't changed my philosophy.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.660
CHRIS FISCHER: I think it's
interesting on the Vineyard--

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.500
and that's what we
call where I'm from.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.206
Or the Island, actually.

00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:10.330
Because then you're not
referring to anywhere else.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.788
If you're talking
about the Island,

00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:13.640
you're not talking
about Nantucket.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.320
MATT JENNINGS: I
know there's a big--

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.861
you want to make
sure that you're not

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:18.650
associated with Nantucket.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.935
That's how Vineyarders are.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:22.060
CHRIS FISCHER: Matt's spent
some time on Nantucket.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.965
MATT JENNINGS: There's
Martha's Vineyard,

00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:24.040
and there's everything else.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.100
CHRIS FISCHER: Actually,
your first cooking job

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.930
was on Nantucket.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.350
MATT JENNINGS: It was.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.990
CHRIS FISCHER: At
a grocery store?

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.610
MATT JENNINGS: Well, no.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.800
I was a stock boy first.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.195
Like, I would fold
the papers on Sundays,

00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:37.250
and put the sodas away.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.460
The guy who owned that also
owned an adjacent cafe, so I'd

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.009
like leave work and
walk by the cafe,

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:46.050
and all the cooks were
getting ready for service.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.010
And I was like,
ah, it's so cool.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.210
Gotta get in there.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.730
And they'd be like,
maybe next year.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.730
And then finally a
couple years later,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.530
I was peeling onions
and scrubbing dishes.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.780
CHRIS FISCHER: Well, that's
the thing about growing up

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.450
on the Cape-- and we're
close enough here,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.470
and Gloucester has
it too, but-- you're

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.530
surrounded by the most
incredible ingredients.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.440
And there's less woods on
Nantucket than the vineyard.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.890
There's a lot more deer,
basically, on the Island.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.130
But I was just thinking
about my childhood,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.530
going out in the wintertime.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.990
And Nico came out
and visited me once

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.120
and was talking about
how everywhere you went,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.110
somebody had a bucket
of clams in their garage

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.130
or in the back of their truck.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.080
We actually went
oystering together

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.282
after a big rainstorm--
a huge rainstorm.

00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:33.740
And the shellfish
warden came down.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.440
And he wasn't mad that we
were getting the oysters.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.830
The pond was actually
shut down, because when

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.700
you get a certain
amount of rain,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.530
bacteria goes into the pond.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.977
And he said, you know,
you can't keep those.

00:08:44.977 --> 00:08:46.060
And we're like, all right.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.920
We'll just dump them back.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.170
And he's like, no, no, no, no.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.120
Put them in the
back of my truck.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.760
But growing up-- wintertime
especially-- my dad

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.800
kept a bucket of oysters,
a bucket of clams.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.210
But during hunting season,
they were in the garage,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.470
and in the garage,
he hung his deer.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.100
So at night, he'd be like,
if you wanted clams--

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.702
and it's hard to
shuck a clam period,

00:09:08.702 --> 00:09:10.910
and you've got little hands,
and you just don't quite

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.250
know how to do it yet--
so you'd go in the barn,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.980
and you'd just be
like pinballing off

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.740
of these venison,
these deer hanging.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.810
And then you'd have to
find the light switch,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.940
and then you'd carry
the clams back in.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.050
But when you start eating them
like that at such a young age,

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.980
just like at Chez Panisse, you
create a memory, a food memory,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.110
and a vocabulary.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.100
And your body
actually-- I mean, I

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.550
think that's such a formative
thing for me as a cook,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.745
that idea of those simple, pure
flavors like a perfect oyster,

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:46.630
a perfect venison loin,
a perfect bluefish.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.210
You're a big bluefish proponent.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.630
And that's a fish that if
you're not on coastal England,

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.610
you can't-- I mean,
besides maybe smoked.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.930
I mean, tell me a little
bit about your relationship

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.702
with bluefish, besides
when you give somebody

00:10:00.702 --> 00:10:01.910
a knuckle sandwich and they--

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.620
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah, I know.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.119
I wear one.

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:05.850
I wear one proudly.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.740
I mean, it was all
kind of wrapped up

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.270
in the same experiences for
me-- bluefishing and surf

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.215
casting with my family,
and going out for clams,

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.340
and all that sort of stuff.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.710
And so we'd go-- whether
it was the North Shore,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.460
or way out on Smith
Point on Nantucket,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.260
or kind of very remote,
desolate places,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.440
that you bounce
through the dunes,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.730
and take all the air
out of your tires,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.980
and bounce the whole way
out, and set up camp,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.430
and you'd be there for the day.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.360
Great memories.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.526
CHRIS FISCHER: Are there
bluefish on the West Coast?

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:40.610
NICO MONDAY: Not that
I've ever encountered.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.050
CHRIS FISCHER: Do you serve
bluefish at the restaurant?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.305
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:44.670
CHRIS FISCHER: Do people
order it when it's not a pate?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.003
MATT JENNINGS: They're learning.

00:10:46.003 --> 00:10:49.310
I mean, I feel like so
much of that is education.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.500
Our obligation as cooks
is to kind of help

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.170
them understand why we
love, and why it's so great.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.128
CHRIS FISCHER: And that's
part of the education

00:10:56.128 --> 00:10:57.450
is just making it really well.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.152
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:59.152 --> 00:10:59.640
CHRIS FISCHER: You don't even
have to tell them what it is.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.710
MATT JENNINGS: Well,
people have this idea

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.410
that it's like really fishy
and it's really fatty,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.340
and oily and bloody and gross.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.320
And I mean, there are
nuances of all those things,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.430
right, in that fish.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.970
But when done
properly, it's amazing.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.660
My mom-- so I grew up with
like we'd go fishing and then

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.180
get back.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.415
And we'd divide the
fish up, and it'd all

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:20.530
get broken down and
gutted and cleaned.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.070
And some would go
in the freezer,

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.260
and some we would
smoke right away.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.920
My mom would make
smoked bluefish pate.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.090
Now I serve her bluefish
pate at to my restaurant--

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.500
CHRIS FISCHER: Her recipe--

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.210
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.600
CHRIS FISCHER: Amazing.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.183
MATT JENNINGS: I do
it with weird shit

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:33.460
like kimchi and whatever.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.040
Pickles, and stuff that
she would never do.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.900
She'd put it on toast,
and that was it.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.390
But it's there.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.440
It's a part of me.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.430
CHRIS FISCHER: And that's a
good part about your cooking,

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.040
about what is New England
cooking traditionally

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.840
versus contemporary.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.250
You're taking-- Matt went to the
New England Culinary Institute.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.970
Traveled extensively in America.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.269
Cooked in Europe a little bit?

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:01.060
MATT JENNINGS: Yup.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.430
CHRIS FISCHER: Whereabouts.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.500
MATT JENNINGS: I spent some time
in Italy, and France as well.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.180
CHRIS FISCHER: And taking--
traditional New England food

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.490
is simple.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.680
It's meant to be cooked at home.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.600
We were joking before,
the ingredients

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.790
are so good that-- we have
a long tradition of corn.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.540
And Matt was referencing
the southern resurgence

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.020
of corn and corn recipes.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.500
And this idea that they were
kind of the pioneers of it,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.300
and we've had corn for a
lot longer than the settlers

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.020
came here.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.275
And it's so good here that
the recipes were steam it.

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:39.150
MATT JENNINGS: Right.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.070
CHRIS FISCHER: So
it's like four words.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.070
Two words, actually.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.150
Corn.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.310
Steam it.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.390
Salt.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.889
MATT JENNINGS: We
did a lot with it.

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.270
I mean, we were talking
earlier about the grist mills.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.010
Those are such an inherent
part of New England cuisine.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.180
You go through these little
towns and rural areas

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.817
of Massachusetts, and all of a
sudden there's a mill, right?

00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:57.150
And there's a mill there,
because they would grind grain

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.440
there.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.648
Or I mean, they were
potentially doing other things--

00:12:59.648 --> 00:13:04.560
making paper, whatever--
but those communities

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.402
were begun by having the
necessity to create food.

00:13:09.402 --> 00:13:11.360
CHRIS FISCHER: And I
think too with real estate

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.640
being-- in New England,
the land is really fertile,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.160
but there's not huge
expenses like the Midwest.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.060
And corn is a lot more efficient
to grow than other grains,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.280
and so that makes
a lot of sense too.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.341
The same with the best lobster
I've known-- the best bluefish,

00:13:31.341 --> 00:13:32.840
all those ingredients
are so simple.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.630
Or just the simple shucked clam.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.000
MATT JENNINGS: I think our
settlers learned early on

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.634
that New England
both climate and soil

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:43.050
weren't the best
for corn, either.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.630
It's kind of hard to grow
corn on the mountain.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.380
And a lot of that is rocky soil.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.740
CHRIS FISCHER: And
Nico is a transplant,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.240
as we say, with a
wife who grew up here.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.560
And you learned to
cook-- and you, again,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.060
go back to northern California.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.600
And I ate at Matt's
restaurant yesterday.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.880
There's Little Gems on the menu.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.760
You can't be a cook
and not be influenced

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.930
by what is happening out there.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.932
And so now that you've
been here for five years--

00:14:14.932 --> 00:14:15.640
NICO MONDAY: Yep.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.730
This is number six.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.950
CHRIS FISCHER: Number six.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.810
Are you a California cook
who's cooking in New England,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.370
or are you a New England cook?

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.750
NICO MONDAY: I knew you
were going to ask that.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.260
CHRIS FISCHER: That's
because I sent you

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.301
that question in advance.

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.570
NICO MONDAY: I don't think
that they're necessarily

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.830
mutually exclusive.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.120
You know, what does that
mean, to be a California

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.660
chef or a New England chef?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.810
Like right now, I
live in New England,

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.040
and I live up in Gloucester, and
I make my home there, and use

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.500
all of the ingredients that
Gloucester and the North Shore

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.630
have to offer.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.850
So I think in that sense, I'm
very much like a New England

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.996
chef at this point.

00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:55.870
CHRIS FISCHER: And eating
at your restaurant,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.820
The Market-- I was saying that
it has that French influence.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.330
It has that northern
Californian influence.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.090
And you were saying you spent
time in France, before you even

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.660
knew what the heck you were
doing, at 19 years old.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.821
And I mean, growing up, your
parents worked at Chez Panisse?

00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:15.070
MATT JENNINGS: They did, yeah.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.140
They met there.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.722
Like Amelia and I.

00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:20.160
CHRIS FISCHER: That's
cooking school right there.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.690
You went to cooking school.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.250
You had a very
different experience.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.220
I tried to go to cooking school.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.510
I dropped out.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.600
Before that, I washed dishes.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.520
I cooked, but then
you didn't get

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.770
fed as well as the dishwasher.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.870
And I was really hungry, so
I started washing dishes.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.880
And then I just jumped
into restaurants

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.660
after doing all
the wrong things.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.110
Do you feel-- they're
very different journeys,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.500
but what's your feeling
on culinary school?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.790
Like if a kid drops
out of high school,

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.640
or from graduates
from high school

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.546
and doesn't know
what he wants to do,

00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:56.420
would you tell them to
go to culinary school?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.461
MATT JENNINGS: It's hard.

00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:01.230
I mean, we have that
conversation internally a lot.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.870
I mean, we get as many great
cook out of culinary school

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.130
as we do get shitty ones.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.450
I mean, it's all a matter
of what you put into it

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.390
and if you really
want to be doing it.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.649
I think the kids that-- I
shouldn't call them kids

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:14.940
because they're not all kids--
I think the students who

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.760
go through culinary
programs either-- it's

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.680
like any other career.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.120
You're either going to blossom
and find out that that's really

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.420
what you want to do,
and then every day

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.310
is a joy, to a
degree, or you're just

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.560
doing it because you don't
know what else you want to.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.580
But for me it was great,
because I didn't make it

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.220
through regular college.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.864
I made it through one
year and that was it.

00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:41.030
That was all I could handle.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.655
That's all administration
could handle.

00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.699
They said, get this
kid out of here.

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:45.740
And so I took a year off.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.010
And I went back to
this place that I

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:52.300
had grown up working, in the
grocery and in the restaurant.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.880
And I said to myself,
what do I know how to do?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.120
I know how to cook.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.430
I love to cook.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.680
So why don't I look into that?

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.096
So for me, it made
the most sense.

00:17:00.096 --> 00:17:02.070
It was the next progression.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.901
And where I went to
school was perfect for me.

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.609
NICO MONDAY: Don't
you feel like, though,

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.050
that whether you go to
a cooking school or not,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.880
that you end up starting in
the same place in a restaurant?

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.780
And so long as you end up
in the right environment,

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.740
with the right
eagerness-- whether you've

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.180
gone through a program
or not-- you're

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.296
going to start at
that same spot.

00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:26.670
Not that you don't
learn skills--

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.520
practical ones-- there,
but cooking school,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.097
it always seemed
to me, was like you

00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.680
were going to get
the real experience,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.190
hands on, whether you knew
what you were doing or not.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.023
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:17:40.023 --> 00:17:44.350
I think, though, that's the
liberal decision like that I

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.540
couldn't make at that
time, because I needed

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.840
the safety of the least knowing
that if this thing-- like,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.413
I didn't know where
to go as a cook.

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:53.740
I didn't know where
to go work, or who

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.090
I should look to as a
mentor, or any of that stuff.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.770
Or if I even knew
that I was really

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.620
going to want to do this
80, 90 hours a week.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.647
So I needed that
ability to figure out.

00:18:04.647 --> 00:18:06.230
CHRIS FISCHER: I
think no matter what,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.650
most successful
chefs that I know

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.250
got a foundation somewhere.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.000
So you got a foundation
in cooking school.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.875
You had those skills.

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:15.960
I got a foundation under
Mario Batali at Babbo,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.880
and that was like my
most focused time--

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.160
two and a half years solid.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.990
You had a foundation, which
sounds like France, then

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.320
six years of Chez Panisse
before opening your own place.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.110
And that's the biggest thing.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.600
If you have the
foundation, then there's

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.220
the question of is it
better to stay in one place,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.250
or jump around and
take these influences?

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.240
And I also was
lucky enough to cook

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.830
under the umbrella of Alice
Waters' world and Fergus

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.940
Henderson's world--
and I see a lot

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.700
of Fergus' influence
in your love for pork--

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.410
and Keith McNally and Mario.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.030
And I was very lucky to
cook for these great people.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.640
And you steal a little
something from each one.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.750
And I think the bottom
line with all of them

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.610
is give somebody a glass
of wine as soon as they

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.955
walk in your restaurant.

00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:08.580
NICO MONDAY: That's
what we've learned.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.820
CHRIS FISCHER: Yeah, right?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.839
MATT JENNINGS: We wouldn't
be there without them, right?

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:13.880
Give them what they want.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.995
CHRIS FISCHER: So yeah.

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:17.870
I mean, we've all jumped
around a little bit.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.540
And now looking
at the influence--

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.850
and I'm going to use you as an
example of being in Providence,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.840
being a New England guy,
and coming back to Boston

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.380
and getting a lot
of attention for

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.361
a big, exciting new restaurant--
you're taking traditional New

00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:34.610
England flavors, you're
taking traditional New England

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.000
ingredients, and adding so
many different-- I wrote down.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.110
I probably can't find it right
now-- some of the ingredients

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.210
that you're using.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.319
From andouille sausage-- am
I pronouncing that right?

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.110
MATT JENNINGS: Yup.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:52.200
CHRIS FISCHER: Which is actually
a raw, extraordinarily spicy

00:19:52.200 --> 00:20:00.660
pork sausage, and blood
oranges, and coconut milk.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.592
shiso leaves.

00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:03.300
MATT JENNINGS: Middle
Eastern influences.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.090
CHRIS FISCHER: And I
was trying to classify

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.673
some of your influences,
but then it's

00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.450
just a global cuisine.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.460
And we live in a global world,
thanks to people like Google

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.984
and the rest of-- Anthony
Bourdain, and media,

00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:18.650
and all of that.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.970
And so here you are, a
young influential chef

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.070
doing a New England brasserie.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.130
And it's exciting, because
there kind of aren't

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.175
any rules in certain ways.

00:20:31.175 --> 00:20:32.800
I mean, do you feel
that way, or do you

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.364
feel like you have to appease?

00:20:34.364 --> 00:20:35.780
MATT JENNINGS:
Well, I mean, think

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.780
I just kind of have reached
a point in my career

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.655
where I really don't care.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.300
I think I spent a lot of
time in my early 20s--

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.780
so I opened my first
business when I was 25.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.030
And it started off as retail.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.480
It was an artisan food
showcase of sorts-- you know,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.005
charcuterie, cheeses,
olive oils, pastas.

00:20:58.005 --> 00:20:59.380
And then we opened
the restaurant

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.980
a couple years later,
which was right next door.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.610
So I could run back and
forth and like, if somebody

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.020
was in the shop and staring
at something on the shelf

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.356
and was like, the hell do
I do with salted capers?

00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:11.730
I had the ability
to go in there,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.089
grab something, be
very improvisational.

00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:16.130
But I think I was always
really kind of conscious

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:23.840
of wanting stuff to be
a certain type of food--

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.290
very well designed and
integrated into the greater

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.260
ethos of the
restaurant and shop.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.600
And now, I mean,
I think I just--

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.082
it's not to say that it's not
as thoughtful, but I feel like--

00:21:38.082 --> 00:21:39.540
CHRIS FISCHER: It's
more thoughtful

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.700
because you have
more references.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.140
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah, I think
I'm able to just kind of cook

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.596
the way that I want to cook,
and not worry about what people

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:47.220
think about it.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.420
And typically I think
that's when it actually

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.370
gets really good.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.940
CHRIS FISCHER: And that's when
more people start thinking

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.020
about what you're doing.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.645
What about you?

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.280
NICO MONDAY: Well,
I mean, I think

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.600
what you're getting at is like
you cook what you want to eat.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.230
At least, for us with a
daily changing menu that's

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.170
very small, you know,
it's hard to appeal

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.690
to a mass number of
people on a daily basis,

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.750
whereas you just come
up with a simple formula

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.150
that you know you're
going to kind of like

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.040
cover some bases for people.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.320
But at the same time, we
wake up in the morning,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.820
and I'm sure like you,
you talk to your fish guy,

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.260
and you say, hey.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.480
What's looking good today?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.590
You look at what is coming
in from the farms that day,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.752
and you say OK.

00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:32.210
What do we want to
have for dinner?

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.001
CHRIS FISCHER: It's
freedom between cooking

00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:36.220
with local ingredients and
cooking a local cuisine,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.550
especially when a local
cuisine is not traditionally

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.120
a restaurant cuisine.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.960
And you're again, bringing
that California influence

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.960
and that simplicity and that--

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.046
NICO MONDAY: Well, but I think
that's the philosophy of it,

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.670
but that's what we're
all talking about

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:56.910
anyway is just an
ingredient-driven style

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.210
of cooking.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.390
You could call that
Californian, you

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.550
could call that New
England, because all we're

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.670
talking about now is like, OK,
what is the bounty out here?

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.470
It's the bounty of the ocean
and these beautiful farms

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.874
that are at least in season for
parts of the year this year.

00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:16.040
CHRIS FISCHER: Well, that's
the thing about everyone

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.540
that spends time in California
for a certain amount of time.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.560
You come back to New England
and it's like, oh my God.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.510
Thank you for the seasons again.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.420
But the reality too
is that the seasons

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.070
are so micro-- four
seasons are too broad.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.700
In the book, we
did six sections,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.670
which is a little bit
bigger than four seasons.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.390
And then we broke that down
into 17 different menus,

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.930
with the idea that week
to week, day to day,

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.800
there is such a
change of ingredients,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.470
and a change in the
same ingredients

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.680
from like the very first
strawberries that are just

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.360
like a little tart, and you're
like so excited to eat them.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.790
But they're not that good,
and they get perfect--

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.390
MATT JENNINGS: And
then they're gone.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.660
CHRIS FISCHER: And
then they're overripe

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.990
and you're still trying to
coax some love out of them,

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.320
but they look like crap.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.060
But they still taste good.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.476
MATT JENNINGS: I
think that's kind

00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:06.590
of why I love being from
here and cooking here.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.965
I feel like it's
more rewarding--

00:24:07.965 --> 00:24:10.360
because I lived in California
as well for a while--

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.100
I think it's more
rewarding for me

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.870
to cook here that it is in
a part of the country that

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:21.180
has amazing produce
and accessibility

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.700
to incredible ingredients,
because our season's shorter

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.200
here.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.060
So when it comes, it's
like this crazy love affair

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.675
that you have for
like three months,

00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:30.800
and it's just [SLAMS FIST].

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.440
When snap peas first come,
it's like they're everywhere.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.820
They're all over the menu.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.460
CHRIS FISCHER: Or like
three weeks, or three days.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.709
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah, or
however long you can get them.

00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:40.270
You're pickling them.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.690
You're putting
them in your pasta.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.670
You're doing all sorts of
stuff, and then they're gone.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.230
And then it's on
to the next thing.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.870
For me, I just love that.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.767
My favorite time of year is
like September, October, when

00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:53.350
we're getting tomatoes,
but we're also

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.754
starting to see squash.

00:24:54.754 --> 00:24:56.920
And you're in that shoulder
season, and you're like,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.420
oh yes.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.920
I have the bounty of
everything at this time.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.950
You can put pumpkin and
tomato on the same dish,

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.510
and people are like, what?

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.535
CHRIS FISCHER: Radishes and
beets and green tomatoes.

00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:06.368
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:25:06.368 --> 00:25:07.300
It's amazing.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.466
CHRIS FISCHER: I'm trying
to think-- what ingredient

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:12.240
is out right now that you're
so excited about that's

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.676
going to go away really soon?

00:25:13.676 --> 00:25:15.050
MATT JENNINGS:
Berries right now.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.190
CHRIS FISCHER:
Berries-- strawberries?

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.610
MATT JENNINGS: And blueberries
are just starting right now.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.359
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:21.064
And the very beginning
of like raspberries

00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:21.980
and black raspberries.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.020
CHRIS FISCHER: Are you
seeing those already?

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.140
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.431
We've got them in our backyard.

00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:25.340
CHRIS FISCHER: Wow.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.530
I'm thinking of peas.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.030
We are at the end
of the pea season,

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.950
and they're starting
to get woody.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.900
And chervil is on its way out.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.860
Are there fava beans?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.430
Are you getting fava beans?

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.010
That's a very
California ingredient.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.889
And you had favas
on your menu too.

00:25:38.889 --> 00:25:40.430
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah,
the end of them.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.590
NICO MONDAY: That's so
funny, because all the farms

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.520
we work with, the favas
are on the way out.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.650
And then again in my
backyard, we just--

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.320
I'm obviously not a farmer--
so we got a little late start.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.820
CHRIS FISCHER:
What's the skin tone?

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.070
NICO MONDAY: A little
late start in the season,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.430
because we've still got favas
like that big in my backyard.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.380
MATT JENNINGS: Well,
so I love favas,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.940
and they're always
here and then gone.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.777
So last year, we actually tried
some new preservation methods,

00:26:05.777 --> 00:26:07.360
so we're actually
living off right now

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.199
some favas that we got in right
in the beginning of the season.

00:26:13.199 --> 00:26:15.115
so people are going to
cringe when I say this,

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:17.040
but we actually froze a bunch.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.770
CHRIS FISCHER: I was
going to say that,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.610
because they get farty
if you don't, right?

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.485
MATT JENNINGS: Well,
they're awesome, though.

00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:24.140
We actually steam them, and
then we flash froze them,

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.150
and they're incredible.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:25.941
They're incredible.

00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:27.865
I pull them out, they're
like just shucked.

00:26:27.865 --> 00:26:29.490
CHRIS FISCHER: That's
a perfect example

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.860
of modern-day technology.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.250
You are a chowder guy?

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.002
Everybody-- I mean, you
can't not like-- I mean,

00:26:38.002 --> 00:26:38.710
it's New England.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.310
NICO MONDAY: Well, that's
what we were talking about.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.810
Corn and lobster
chowder-- when that

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.506
comes in next month,
that's going to be--

00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:46.380
or whenever corn's going
to start popping up.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.415
CHRIS FISCHER: Do you
make seasonal changes

00:26:47.415 --> 00:26:48.127
to your chowder?

00:26:48.127 --> 00:26:48.960
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.354
And you mentioned
the corn thing.

00:26:50.354 --> 00:26:52.520
It's really funny, because
my wife brought corn home

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.110
for the first time from the
supermarket the other day.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.499
And whatever-- you buy
vegetables the kids want.

00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:02.040
You know, we've got to feed our
children, and they love corn,

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.650
and it's finally here.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.100
But like I ate it, and
I was just like, ah man.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.680
NICO MONDAY: It's
not quite there.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.170
MATT JENNINGS: I said,
why'd you buy corn?

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.670
CHRIS FISCHER: She's
like, I wanted.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.845
MATT JENNINGS: She's
like, the kids like corn.

00:27:11.845 --> 00:27:12.470
It's in season.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.690
I'm like, it's
not really in now.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.190
Not here, not here, it's not.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.170
Not really.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.390
September-- let's talk
about corn in September.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.848
CHRIS FISCHER: And
again, the thing

00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:23.840
about seasonal cooking
too-- the problem

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.920
that I have with the way
people talk about those choices

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.010
is that they sort of make
moral judgments about you.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.380
And that's not the point.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.330
There's two reasons
to buy seasonally.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.820
It's that you're going to give
a farmer-- ideally-- your money,

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.470
and they're going to
then take that money,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.830
and hopefully they're going
to send their kids college.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.140
MATT JENNINGS: Reinvest
it in the community.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.600
CHRIS FISCHER: Or they're going
to be able to grow more food,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.610
and your food is going
to be that much better.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.970
NICO MONDAY: Invest it in
their farm, most likely.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.420
CHRIS FISCHER: Hopefully
fix their tractor.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.380
My tractor's been
broken for three weeks.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.220
I can't get anybody to fix it.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.710
It's so annoying borrowing
people's tractors.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:05.480
My grandfather-- he famously
had cleared like 125 acres

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.500
with a bucket-less tractor.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.660
No headlights.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.670
Finally, his boss
bought him a tractor.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.320
He was so excited.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.237
And he would eat
dinner with the family,

00:28:14.237 --> 00:28:16.570
and then he would go out and
the tractor had headlights,

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.790
so he would work all night.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.859
And he was so pumped.

00:28:18.859 --> 00:28:21.400
And then he ran it into a tree
and shattered the whole thing.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.441
And he's like, all right.

00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:23.350
I'm done with that.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.160
But the other night, I found
myself-- I borrowed a tractor.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.880
My tractor's been
broken for so long--

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.550
I borrowed my friend's tractor.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.190
It was raining.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.106
It was Saturday night.

00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:33.200
The sun is coming down,
and I'm like scooping

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.300
this last bit of compost
to put in the fields.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.720
And I was not even close to
done, and I had that moment.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.646
That's where maybe you gain
some wisdom from your elders.

00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:42.990
I was like, all right.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.570
I'm turning it off.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.675
And I went to bed.

00:28:45.675 --> 00:28:46.800
And I didn't work at night.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.720
But I've definitely ridden
some of my fields at night.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.460
For me, I want to
write about food.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.430
I want to cook food.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.644
I want to grow food.

00:28:56.644 --> 00:28:58.810
There's not enough hours
in the day for any of that,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.660
and so you have to pick
and choose your battles.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:06.860
And last year running the
restaurant, writing the book,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.469
and cooking was very
fruitful in many ways.

00:29:11.469 --> 00:29:13.010
NICO MONDAY: Do you
think that you'll

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.299
go back to professional
cooking at some point?

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:16.590
CHRIS FISCHER: Yes, definitely.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.090
Certainly.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:21.075
And I spent the winter in
Japan actually doing some work,

00:29:21.075 --> 00:29:22.700
helping to open some
restaurants there.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.410
And the correlation
between the ingredients

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.740
and especially my last few
weeks there on an island

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.160
in Japan-- simple, simple.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.230
It's the only place that I love
eating oysters for breakfast.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.050
That's like the best
thing in the world.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.350
Oysters, clams,
any pure protein.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.360
And it's like I
stayed on this island.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.380
For breakfast, it was rice,
raw fish, and a poached egg,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.262
and some seaweed.

00:29:48.262 --> 00:29:50.700
That's the thing about--
and I referenced it

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.180
before-- my grandmother
just turned 100 years old.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.050
And when you work on a farm,
and you're outside all day,

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.220
and you're growing the food, and
you're taking care of the soil,

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.350
your food is that
much more nutritious.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.571
You're getting the
exercise you need.

00:30:03.571 --> 00:30:04.820
You don't have to go to a gym.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.890
You're not stuck indoors,
and it's so good for you.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.630
That's the third part of
eating seasonally, especially

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.646
seasonally and locally.

00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:18.770
And again, there's many
reasons for eating locally,

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.230
but if you're living
in an area, and you're

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.560
eating your local honey,
your allergies are less.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.620
NICO MONDAY: The reasons are--

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.810
CHRIS FISCHER: The
reasons are infinite.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:32.518
NICO MONDAY: Yes.

00:30:32.518 --> 00:30:38.270
CHRIS FISCHER: So I think being
a modern-day New England cook,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.330
chef-- whatever you are,
however you want to influence,

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.710
however you want
to feed yourself

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:48.220
or your family-- I guess
we all agree that there

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.250
aren't that many rules.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.070
And hopefully
restaurants are going

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.630
to have some influence
in that conversation.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.629
Hopefully the literature
that's coming out,

00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:59.170
and the books from
the area-- there's

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.320
a lot of exciting New
England cookbooks--

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.380
and just keep supporting farms.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.040
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.830
I mean, I feel like we-- I
know there have always been--

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.820
and it sounds like
especially your rich heritage

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.810
on Martha's Vineyard-- there
has always been a rich farming.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.460
But I feel like on
the North Shore,

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.310
where we were opening
five, six years ago, there

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:30.800
was just more and more really
young entrepreneurial farmers

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.750
just coming out of the
woodwork every day.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.910
And it's been really fun
to kind of watch that

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.180
grow along with the restaurant.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.929
CHRIS FISCHER: Well,
that's the nice thing

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:39.860
too for you growing up
in northern California,

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.250
growing up in Alice Waters'
world-- those chefs were

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.830
the first celebrity chefs.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.670
And they celebrated
Bob Cannard, and then

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.094
Bob Cannard-- he's a
farmer there-- then

00:31:51.094 --> 00:31:52.510
he starts celebrating
the farmers,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.093
and I feel like
that's where we're at.

00:31:54.093 --> 00:31:56.220
And so that's a
great progression.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.803
MATT JENNINGS: One
thing that's hard--

00:31:57.803 --> 00:32:01.240
because you have the land
expense is so much greater--

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.277
CHRIS FISCHER: And
farmers are pretty grumpy.

00:32:03.277 --> 00:32:04.360
MATT JENNINGS: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.250
CHRIS FISCHER: For good reason.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:05.930
MATT JENNINGS: For good reason.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.138
CHRIS FISCHER: No, it's true.

00:32:07.138 --> 00:32:09.670
MATT JENNINGS: But it's very
hard to find affordable land,

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.170
right?

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.760
So now thankfully there's
all these new land

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.651
leasing programs, and--

00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:15.900
CHRIS FISCHER: The Land Trust.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.358
MATT JENNINGS: Land
Trust for them.

00:32:17.358 --> 00:32:20.500
But it's challenging
for people you

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.630
aren't fortunate to
have grown up on a farm,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.460
or have family provenance.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.580
It makes a really
challenging career.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.960
CHRIS FISCHER: It's
challenging for every reason.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.200
MATT JENNINGS: I mean, in
general, yeah, exactly.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.700
Exactly.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.499
But then it's just
compounded by all that.

00:32:32.499 --> 00:32:33.540
CHRIS FISCHER: All right.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.460
Well, does anybody
have any questions?

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.579
I can't see you, but.

00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:41.745
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:32:41.745 --> 00:32:42.602
CHRIS FISCHER: Yes.

00:32:42.602 --> 00:32:45.101
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
getting your ingredients based

00:32:45.101 --> 00:32:47.747
on the seasons, and so forth.

00:32:47.747 --> 00:32:50.780
What do you do when
there's seven feet of snow

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.434
for three months at a time?

00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:55.892
NICO MONDAY: I'm really glad
that we're talking about that.

00:32:55.892 --> 00:32:57.220
CHRIS FISCHER: I'll just
repeat the question in case--

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.920
it's what do you do
in the wintertime

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.420
when you're a
seasonally-driven restaurant

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.868
or seasonally-driven
human being?

00:33:04.868 --> 00:33:07.980
There's many ways
to preserve food.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.750
A lot of them are
labor-intensive.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.620
There's freezing.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:17.049
I know an old farmer--
Ralph Sherman.

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:18.340
He lives down the road from me.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.890
He grows beautiful,
beautiful food,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.340
and he's about 85 years old--
and when the corn comes in,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.120
he'll grow as much as he
can, take it off the cob,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.685
blanch it, cryovac it.

00:33:27.685 --> 00:33:28.880
It goes in the freezer.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.040
He'll eat some of it fresh, but
then he keeps storing it up.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.950
That's a very
labor-intensive way to do it.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.450
NICO MONDAY: I mean, I know for
us-- The Market Restaurant's

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.520
a seasonal restaurant.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.280
So five years ago
when we opened that,

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.360
we never had to deal with that.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.680
And two years ago when we opened
our year-round restaurant,

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.040
we had to make really
conscious decisions about that.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.570
And where we ended
up was the concept

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.240
that we thought would allow
us to still kind of stay

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.550
true to the ethos of really
doing ingredient-driven stuff.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.970
And so it's a big raw bar
and a wood-fired pizza oven.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.600
And the seafood
and the shellfish--

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.790
if anything it just gets better,
provided it's not an iceberg

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.198
field and people can get at it.

00:34:14.198 --> 00:34:16.489
CHRIS FISCHER: You can eat
vegetables in New England up

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.540
until Thanksgiving easily.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.070
December you can
still find them.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:20.920
NICO MONDAY: Well,
and then we were

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.045
talking about root cellars.

00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:24.136
We lived off of one of
our farm's root cellars

00:34:24.136 --> 00:34:25.260
for the rest of the winter.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.120
And we put up stuff-- one whole
wall of the restaurant's just

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.080
that beautiful--

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.150
MATT JENNINGS:
Pickles, preserves.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.230
NICO MONDAY: In September,
when all the farmers are

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:39.394
unloading those last 400, 500
pounds of tomatoes on you.

00:34:39.394 --> 00:34:40.810
MATT JENNINGS:
I'll take them all.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:41.530
NICO MONDAY: I'll take them all.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.239
CHRIS FISCHER: The
other thing that's

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.830
nice too is if you really are
going to stick to your guns

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.889
in January and February
and you're not completely

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:51.830
depressed from all the snow
is like eat a lot of protein,

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.290
and eat a lot of simple food.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.179
And even beans--
there's a resurgence

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.800
of beans in New England, and
a lot of them can be dried.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.120
And you can find those,
especially in Vermont.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.840
There are those sources.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.590
MATT JENNINGS: We're
drying beans actually

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.673
already at the restaurant.

00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:10.840
We have kind of the rolling
racks with the sheet trays.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.320
And as soon as those beans
start coming in the summer--

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.480
the shelling beans-- we
just start drying them.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.650
CHRIS FISCHER: What varieties?

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.840
MATT JENNINGS: This last
year we did Rattlesnakes,

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.360
Devil's Tongues, and all sorts
of beautiful heirloom beans.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.130
Cranberries.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.630
CHRIS FISCHER: I'm
gonna grow these.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.220
MATT JENNINGS: And as
soon as they come in,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.250
we use some fresh,
and then we'll

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.970
put the rest on the drying
racks and put the fans on them.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.980
Come September,
October, November,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.640
we've got local beans.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.184
It's great.

00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:43.600
NICO MONDAY: But
it's a challenge.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.100
MATT JENNINGS:
It's a lot of work.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.700
NICO MONDAY: I won't pretend
that it's not a challenge.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.491
CHRIS FISCHER: But it's
cost-effective too.

00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.590
I mean, you really
save a lot of money,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.827
especially when you
buy something in bulk.

00:35:52.827 --> 00:35:53.660
Any other questions?

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.750
AUDIENCE: You mentioned in
passing that a passionate chef

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.650
works 80, 90 hours a week.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.840
And I want to know if
that's really what it takes.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.720
And also, which nights
do you take off?

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.680
I heard Sunday nights
are not good nights

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.986
to go to restaurants?

00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:15.640
CHRIS FISCHER: I think in any
profession-- you guys work

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.330
in a very competitive
field-- you either

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.070
need to work harder or smarter.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.050
And I'm not that smart, so
I just always worked harder

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.250
than anyone else.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:31.710
And so that to me would mean
yeah, over 100 hour weeks,

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.550
very, commonly.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.520
NICO MONDAY: Opening a
restaurant, as all three of us

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.650
will probably
attest, is just that.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.170
It is a test of your mettle.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:48.362
And you don't sleep a
lot, and you hopefully

00:36:48.362 --> 00:36:50.195
come out on the other
side six months later,

00:36:50.195 --> 00:36:53.860
and you're still so
happy that you've

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.010
chosen to open a restaurant.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.470
But yeah, I know.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.130
It takes a lot.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:04.470
It's like you said, it's a very
personal and passionate thing,

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.180
and you want to be
the one touching

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.280
every plate of food
that's going out,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.830
which is really hard to do it.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.040
But I think that
chefs try to do that,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.060
especially in the beginning.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.910
so

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.368
CHRIS FISCHER:
There's a lot to it.

00:37:20.368 --> 00:37:23.260
I mean, everybody is
now an expert on food,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.180
thanks to the internet
and to television.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.660
And so there's pressure
coming into Boston.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:35.000
You can't have missteps,
because that first bad review,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.905
you know, that can
be the death of you.

00:37:36.905 --> 00:37:39.030
I had a friend that opened
a restaurant in New York

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.490
recently, and he told me he
worked 120 days straight.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.620
And I'm sure those
weren't short days.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:51.290
And there's now a culture
of celebrity chefs.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.120
And that's a great
thing in certain ways,

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.010
because it celebrates this
joyless-- in certain ways--

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.880
lifestyle.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.290
But at the same
time, to be a chef

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.890
is so challenging on your body
and mentally and stress-wise

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.534
that a lot of people will
go to culinary school,

00:38:09.534 --> 00:38:11.200
or they'll think they
want to be a cook,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.908
and they'll work three
days in a kitchen,

00:38:12.908 --> 00:38:14.810
and it's not what they
thought it was because

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.100
of how it's been perceived.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.970
So it goes both ways.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.970
NICO MONDAY: There's the
other side of that too.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.400
The first time that
you get to experience

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.460
the pleasure of making
something that you think

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.109
is perfect and just
like, it's so tangible,

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:28.275
and then it just disappears.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.480
For me, that's
when I think I knew

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.960
I wanted to become a cook was
the first time you know that I

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.740
actually remember thinking
of something, making it,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.120
having it turn out, and
then just like it goes away.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.312
And it goes away.

00:38:45.312 --> 00:38:46.270
And you get to do that.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:47.910
CHRIS FISCHER: It's spiritual.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.140
And that's like
growing food too.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.870
You've spent all this
time on the soil,

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.560
and you think about
it all winter.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.810
My grandfather always
said that anticipation was

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.850
his favorite part of farming.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.180
And I love that line.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.230
I love that idea.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.480
And it's true.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.870
And you look at the soil, and
you see that little seedling,

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.270
and then it's a fava
sprout that comes up.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.520
It's that high, and you
nibble off some of the leaves,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.540
and they're like
taste like nothing.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.477
It's just that nutty,
perfect thing on a salad.

00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:16.060
And then you wait a
little bit longer,

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.540
and you get those fava beans.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.180
And you've been
waiting for six weeks,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.426
and then there's four
pods, and you get 15 beans.

00:39:24.426 --> 00:39:26.050
And you eat them and
then they're gone.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.930
And then you start over.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.510
Again, it teaches
you impermanence,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.740
and it's a beautiful thing.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.120
Thank you for articulating that.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.280
MATT JENNINGS: I'd say my answer
to that question would just

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.860
be that it takes everything
if you want to be good.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.500
It's like anything else, right?

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.050
I'm sure there's programmers
and people of other ilk in here.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.585
And you want to be the best,
it's the time you put in.

00:39:49.585 --> 00:39:50.960
I still have
members of my family

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.060
that don't understand it.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.450
My mom's like still to this day.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:54.860
CHRIS FISCHER: Why
are you doing it?

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.235
MATT JENNINGS: Like, Mom, I've
been cooking for 25 years,

00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:58.107
and I still get--

00:39:58.107 --> 00:40:00.190
NICO MONDAY: When are you
gonna start your career?

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.190
MATT JENNINGS: Should be
with your family today.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.690
It's like yeah, I know.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:09.510
But it's worth it.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.460
You have to love it, obviously,
and when you love it,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.284
then good things come out of it.

00:40:15.284 --> 00:40:17.700
And I think it's also about
training that next generation.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.158
For me, it's so
much about training

00:40:19.158 --> 00:40:21.730
that next generation
those same types of ideas

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.174
and fundamentals.

00:40:23.174 --> 00:40:25.090
Nico and I-- neither of
us could be here today

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.480
if we didn't have
people that we trusted.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.030
And so you eventually have to
also get to that point, right?

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.300
So there's a flip
side of it that you

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.310
have to get them to see things
the way that you see things.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.420
And that's probably the most
challenging aspect, I think.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.270
I think the hardest part of
our industry is people, right?

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.660
The food's one thing-- you can
teach a monkey, to a degree,

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.680
how to plate something.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.300
But it's the emotion that--

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.175
NICO MONDAY: You can't
teach the sensibility.

00:40:53.175 --> 00:40:54.565
MATT JENNINGS: You
can't teach sensibility.

00:40:54.565 --> 00:40:55.950
NICO MONDAY: You can't
teach someone how to care.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:56.094
MATT JENNINGS: Right, right.

00:40:56.094 --> 00:40:56.610
How to care.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.318
CHRIS FISCHER: Well,
and having a mentor,

00:40:58.318 --> 00:41:01.610
and having-- like when you
made that first perfect piece

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.320
of fish, and you fed it to
your mentor, and they tasted it

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.680
and they said it was perfect.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.950
Again, that's like the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.040
And I was reading
about you a little bit,

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.060
and somebody was observing
you in the kitchen.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.550
And there was a moment of calm,
and you looked at the kitchen

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.602
and you said, I love all of you.

00:41:21.602 --> 00:41:22.810
I just want you to know that.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.490
And again, I have
the same feeling.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.530
That's part of the
camaraderie of a kitchen.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.650
That's something that you
can't get anywhere else.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.280
And so flipping on what I said
about the hardness of being

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.260
a cook and all that is
that you'll never find

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.800
a family like that,
especially if maybe you

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.670
have a broken
family, or you don't

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.620
have the most perfect
situation at home.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.620
But you can't emulate
going to work.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.220
At Babbo-- this is in
Manhattan, and this

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.700
was when we were doing 300
covers a night for dinner,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.530
and we were a
three-star restaurant,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.840
and there was all this pressure.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.140
We had a line, and
there's five of us.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.200
And before service, it's just
you're sharpening knives.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.250
I just remember everybody
in there just sullen-faced,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.970
duct-taping every
wound on your body.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.605
Your hands, you have a headache.

00:42:11.605 --> 00:42:12.980
You haven't even
started working.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.130
And then you just go to
war, and then it's over.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.955
And then you start
over and do over again.

00:42:19.955 --> 00:42:21.330
MATT JENNINGS:
Food for me-- food

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.042
and cooking and running
a restaurant, I mean,

00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:25.750
the whole thing is
very emotional for me.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.090
I get really emotional.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:33.950
And I get really emotional also
I think when I see the kids

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.070
and the folks who are working
for me get passionate about it.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:41.270
Then I know that we're
succeeding on some level.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.850
When they receive an
ingredient-- for them,

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.230
watching my growers, my farmer
show up to the back doors,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.452
those people are rock stars.

00:42:49.452 --> 00:42:50.160
Forget the chefs.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.790
They don't care about me.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.950
I mean, they care about
what I think, obviously,

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.070
but it's the farmers
and the growers

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.690
and the fishermen
and the producers

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.120
that they're just
like, oh my God.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.124
Is Steve coming today?

00:43:01.124 --> 00:43:01.915
What's he bringing?

00:43:01.915 --> 00:43:03.070
He's bringing radishes?

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.184
And so that's when you
know, like OK, cool.

00:43:05.184 --> 00:43:06.350
We're doing the right thing.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.200
CHRIS FISCHER: And then when
they succeed, and they move on

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.644
from your restaurant, and they
go and they open their own.

00:43:10.644 --> 00:43:12.435
Again, when you see
them have that success,

00:43:12.435 --> 00:43:15.260
then you've done your
job very, very well.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.954
MATT JENNINGS: Yup.

00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:18.370
CHRIS FISCHER: Any
more questions?

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.360
NICO MONDAY: Cool.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.880
MATT JENNINGS: There's a
really nice book over here.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.880
CHRIS FISCHER: The
Beetlebung Farm Cookbook.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.260
It's about a year of
growing, cooking, living

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.200
on Martha's Vineyard.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.400
But I'm from the
Island, and my family's

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.350
been there for 350 years.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.050
And it's more than just a year.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:50.870
It was quite the process
to learn about that Island,

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.060
and about New England,
and about myself.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.954
And so thank you
for your support.

00:43:54.954 --> 00:43:56.245
Thank you for having us Google.

00:43:56.245 --> 00:43:56.995
NICO MONDAY: Yeah.

00:43:56.995 --> 00:43:58.390
Thank you for having us.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.955
CHRIS FISCHER:
Thanks for the water.

00:43:58.955 --> 00:44:00.204
MATT JENNINGS: Thanks, thanks.

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:01.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.140
CHRIS FISCHER: And there's
chicharrones on your way out.
