00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.960
prestigious proceeding I'm going to talk
about the future of intelligence where

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
about the future of intelligence where
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000
about the future of intelligence where
we're going to enhance our natural

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
we're going to enhance our natural
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.100
we're going to enhance our natural
biological intelligence which we've been

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
biological intelligence which we've been
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.620
biological intelligence which we've been
doing through education through

doing through education through
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.519
doing through education through
artificial intelligence and first I want

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
artificial intelligence and first I want
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.910
artificial intelligence and first I want
to share a surprising discovery I made

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
to share a surprising discovery I made
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070
to share a surprising discovery I made
in 1981 I was trying to figure out how

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
in 1981 I was trying to figure out how
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710
in 1981 I was trying to figure out how
to tie my inventions and I started with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
to tie my inventions and I started with
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630
to tie my inventions and I started with
the common wisdom that you cannot

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
the common wisdom that you cannot
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.680
the common wisdom that you cannot
predict the future but I thought if I

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690
predict the future but I thought if I
 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.209
predict the future but I thought if I
plotted a lot of data being an engineer

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
plotted a lot of data being an engineer
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.190

visualize it in the right way I could
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040
visualize it in the right way I could
make some educated guesses and I made a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
make some educated guesses and I made a
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590

surprising discovery there's one aspect

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
surprising discovery there's one aspect
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
surprising discovery there's one aspect
of the future that's remarkably

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
of the future that's remarkably
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180
of the future that's remarkably
predictable and that is that the price

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
predictable and that is that the price
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040

but of information technology proceeds
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.150
but of information technology proceeds
in a predictable manner and I had the

in a predictable manner and I had the
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.650
in a predictable manner and I had the

through 1980 in 1981 it was a very

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.090
through 1980 in 1981 it was a very
smooth curve and I projected it out to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
smooth curve and I projected it out to
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000

brain it is to make predictions about
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.590
brain it is to make predictions about
the future so we could predict the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
the future so we could predict the
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.230
the future so we could predict the
consequences of our actions the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240
consequences of our actions the
 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.069

10,000 years ago we didn't expect it to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.980
10,000 years ago we didn't expect it to
speed up we expect it to go a constant

that worked very well that became

by doubling every period so what's the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
by doubling every period so what's the
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.370
by doubling every period so what's the

doesn't sound that different but by the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
doesn't sound that different but by the
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969
doesn't sound that different but by the

this is not an idle speculation about

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519
this is not an idle speculation about
 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.670
this is not an idle speculation about
the future I mean this little computer

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
the future I mean this little computer
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.040
the future I mean this little computer
is actually several billion times more

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
is actually several billion times more
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.990
is actually several billion times more
powerful per dollar than the computer I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
powerful per dollar than the computer I
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.190
powerful per dollar than the computer I
used when I went to MIT in the 1960s and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
used when I went to MIT in the 1960s and
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170
used when I went to MIT in the 1960s and
we're going to do that again the next 25

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
we're going to do that again the next 25
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.970
we're going to do that again the next 25
years it'll be another several billion

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
years it'll be another several billion
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979
years it'll be another several billion
times more powerful and so shrinking in

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
times more powerful and so shrinking in
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.110
times more powerful and so shrinking in

smaller than that computer and the 2030s

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
smaller than that computer and the 2030s
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.580
smaller than that computer and the 2030s
will have computers and all robotic

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
will have computers and all robotic
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.280

me show you just what this means an

exponential starts out very slowly and
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.589
exponential starts out very slowly and
then it explodes when it gets to what I

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
then it explodes when it gets to what I
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.059
then it explodes when it gets to what I
call the knee of the curve

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
call the knee of the curve
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.770
call the knee of the curve
here's that graph I had in the nineteen

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
here's that graph I had in the nineteen
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.600
here's that graph I had in the nineteen
1981 I had it through 1980 this goes

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610
1981 I had it through 1980 this goes
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.809
1981 I had it through 1980 this goes
through 2010 that's a very smooth

through 2010 that's a very smooth
 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.390
through 2010 that's a very smooth
exponential progression it actually

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400

multiplying by actually every level is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410
multiplying by actually every level is
 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.150
multiplying by actually every level is
100,000 times greater than the level

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
100,000 times greater than the level
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.849
100,000 times greater than the level
below it so this goes back to the 1890

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859
below it so this goes back to the 1890
 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.280
below it so this goes back to the 1890

anymore and keep the vacuum in 1959 so
