00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:22.875
In 1879, amateur archaeologist
Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.973
and his young daughter Maria
explored a dark cave in Northern Spain.

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:32.527
When Maria wondered off by herself,
she made an amazing discovery.

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:36.098
They were standing inside 
a site of ancient art,

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:40.301
the walls and roofs decorated with
prehistoric paintings and engravings,

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:46.069
ranging from 19,000 to 35,000 years old.

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.116
Similar marks of our ancestors have been
preserved in caves all over the world.

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:55.230
The oldest we've found were made up to
40,000 years ago.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.495
What do these images tell us
about the ancient human mind

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.421
and the lives of their creators?

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:09.123
These early artists mixed minerals, clay,
charcoal, and ochre with spit or animal fat

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.665
to create paint.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:18.433
They drew with their hands and tools,
like pads of moss, twigs, bones, and hair.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:22.484
In many instances, their images follow
the contours of the cave

00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:25.190
to create depth and shade.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.958
The most common depictions
are of geometric shapes,

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:35.007
followed by large mammals, like bison,
horses, mammoths, deer, and boars.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:40.058
Human figures appear rarely,
as well as occasional hand prints.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:44.065
Some have theorized that these artworks
are the creation of hunters,

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:47.540
or of holy men in trance-like states.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.588
And we've found examples created by
men, women, and even children.

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:54.629
And why did they create this art?

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.928
Perhaps they were documenting 
what they knew about the natural world,

00:01:57.928 --> 00:01:59.702
like modern scientists,

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.806
or marking their tribal territory.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:06.193
Maybe the images were the culmination
of sacred hunting rituals

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.848
or spiritual journeys.

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:15.078
Or could they be art for art's sake,
the sheer joy and fulfillment of creation?

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.628
As with many unsolved mysteries
of the ancient world,

00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:19.925
we may never know for sure,

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.155
barring the invention 
of a time machine, that is.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.412
But while the answers remain elusive,

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.969
these images are our earliest proof
of human communication,

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.805
testifying to the human capacity 
for creativity

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.144
thousands of years before writing.

00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:41.548
They are a distinct visual language 
that imagines the world outside the self,

00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:43.248
just like modern art forms,

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:47.487
from graffiti and painting
to animated virtual-reality caves.
