00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.990
So one of the big differences that comes
from direct manipulation screens, that

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.720
is things you touch to provide input
versus what we have in the desktop and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.492
laptop world, is that the human body
all the sudden really starts to matter.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.350
Before when we're building software for
desk tops and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
laptops the size of our hands,
the size of our finger what's

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.940
a comfortable reach, that burden is
taken on by the keyboards and the mice.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.870
Right so
long as the mouse is comfortable and

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.240
the keyboards comfortable the software
designer doesn't have to worry about it.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.080
They don't have to think about
these are going to considerations.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.580
As soon as software is something
that people can touch and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.600
feel, the screen has to be considered
in the context of your hand.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.460
How far can you reach that thumb?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.860
How big is that thumb?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.110
These things impact
where you put controls,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.230
how large you make controls and how
easily those controls are to manipulate.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.050
Anyone who's struggled
with a desktop form on

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.940
a mobile device knows these teeny little
tick boxes and radio buttons can be

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.480
super frustrating especially if
you're trying to pick a specific one.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.200
So at the very least we need to consider
how to size controls, how to space them.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.690
And that's sort of the bare minimum.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.570
If you want to do one better then
you start thinking about well.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.650
Is it possible to create this flow or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.800
to complete this flow using what
I call one thumb one eyeball.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.650
And one thumb one eyeball actually
illustrate this here since

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.730
I have a phone like all of you too.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.580
In your pocket, kind of hold it like
this, and you look at it like this.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.940
TV may be on, you may be outside,
or something like this.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.070
How can I get something done,
just with these sorts of actions?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.070
And that goes much broader
than just size, right?

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.800
It's where you place the controls,
it's what the flow looks like,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.210
it's the kind of controls
you use as well.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.690
And we have a lot of controls that
require the precision of a mouse cursor

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.390
to use well little like spinner wheels
that you find on the desktop drop

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.620
down menus that you find desktop.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.030
All those controls need to be
rethought for touch screens so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.800
that they can actually
be used by our hands.
