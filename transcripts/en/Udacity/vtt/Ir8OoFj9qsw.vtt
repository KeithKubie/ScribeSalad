00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.960
Let us try a slightly more complicated exercise. This time, we have three

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.630
variables, A, B, and C. And here are the combinations of the truth values of A,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.320
B, and C. Here on the right are two formulas. The first one says,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.660
A and parenthesis B or C parenthesis closed.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.262
The second says parenthesis A and B parenthesis closed or parenthesis A and

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:31.670
C parenthesis closed. Please write down the truth values for these two formulas.
