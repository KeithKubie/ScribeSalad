Remember that we're trying to get x by itself. So the next step we need to take

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.055
in order to do that is to get rid of this factor of 3 out in front here, so that

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:12.268
I can rewrite the equation with a factor of 3 gone from this side. Of course we

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:16.236
need to do this legally, so think about what that means for the right side of

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:17.461
the equation as well.
