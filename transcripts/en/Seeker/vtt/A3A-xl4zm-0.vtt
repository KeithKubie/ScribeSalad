00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.360
Every year, tens of millions of Americans
suffer from nerve damage, some irreparably

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.360
so.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.800
Science can heal bones, grow new organs and
even restore our microbiomes, but why is it

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.830
so hard to fix our nerves?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.210
Hey guys Lissette here for DNews

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.250
The human body posses a remarkable ability
to heal.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.040
Bones re-fuse, skin wounds mend, and the immune
system adapts to infection, after infection.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.760
But there’s one area of the body that struggles
to recover after an injury: The nervous system.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.820
Nerve damage can be some of the most debilitating
and permanent type of injury.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.969
The nervous system is an incredibly complex
network used to send electrical information

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.969
throughout your body.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.760
It can basically be divided into two sections.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.670
With the brain and spinal cord making up the
central nervous system or CNS…. and the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.070
nerves made up of fibers of sensory and motor
neurons comprising the peripheral nervous

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.070
system.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.780
Each cell in the nervous system from the tip
of your finger up your arm, up your spinal

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.720
column, into your brain, is very specialized.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.460
And each has a unique function on the pathway,
like a circuit.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.539
If one these gets cut or injured, it’s hard
for an exact replacement cell to be put in

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.850
in the right spot.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.029
Think about when you get a cut on your skin.

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:14.799
If the cut goes deep enough, exact replicas
of cells won't cover the wound, instead fibrous

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.100
tissues form... which we call scars.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
And scars are part of the problem in regrowing
nerves, they often get in the way - especially

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.999
in the case of spinal cord injuries.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.810
As part of the CNS, spinal cord injuries are
notoriously difficult to heal; partially because

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.740
of the way nerve cells in the CNS are made.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.929
According to the book, “Results and Problems
in Cell Differentiation”, the CNS also has

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.640
certain proteins that weirdly, inhibit cell
regeneration.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.270
While this might sound like a bad idea, it’s
hugely beneficial overall to the formation

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.549
of the CNS.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.630
These cells need to grow exactly where they
are supposed to, just one out of place could

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.630
be bad.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.020
Like... think of an electrical circuit, each
unit has to be in a specific order in specific

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.060
place to work.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.590
If one is out of place, the integrity of the
CNS is compromised.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.719
Neurons in the CNS also lack certain cleaning
cells.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.130
Nerve cells are made up of many parts, but
they send signals through threads covered

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.429
in a protective sheet of myelin.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.870
These threads are called axons.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.760
Axons are the long part of the cell that reaches
out to the cell next to it to send information

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
down the line...

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760
Like arms handing the bucket down the line
in a bucket brigade.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.819
So these are obviously super important and
need protecting.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.450
That’s where the Schwann cells come in...
which are only found in the Peripheral nervous

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.450
system.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
Schwann cells, which aren’t neurons but
GLEEL cells, produce the myelin that help

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.290
protect the axons.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.680
But, a study published in The Journal of Cell
Biology found they also clean up damaged nerves

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.290
- making way for the healing process to take
place and new nerves to be formed.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.340
But the problem is... these Schwann cells
are missing from the CNS.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.969
What they have instead are myelin producing
cells called oligodendrocytes.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.250
But these cells don’t clean up damaged nerve
cells at all.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.780
Which is part of the problem.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.859
So unfortunately, according to Dr. Richard
G. Fessler professor at Rush University Medical

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.480
Center "There are currently no therapies which
successfully reverse the damage" from injuries

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.150
to the spinal cord.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.590
But research is currently underway to examine
the potential success of stem cell treatment,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.480
where stem cells are injected directly at
the injury site.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.499
Still, it will take a few years to see the
results of such trials.

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.659
But there are times your body can regenerate
nerves.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.420
The peripheral nervous system doesn’t have
the same blocking proteins that the CNS has,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.170
and Schwann cells help heal the damage.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.489
So it’s able to regrow nerves, albeit slowly.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.220
For instance, if you cut a nerve into your
shoulder, it could take a year to regrow.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.079
By that time...the muscles in your arms could
become atrophied.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.189
So, not surprisingly, researchers are working
on helping the body heal faster.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.590
One study published in the Journal of Clinical
Investigation found that a shock of heat made

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.540
the peripheral nerves grow faster.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.180
In another study published in the journal
Advanced Functional MATERIALS, researchers

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.090
used 3D printing to make a sort of guide for
peripheral nerves to follow as they regrew.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.870
The guide was built with small physical grooves
and even chemical cues to help guide the nerve

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.239
along its new path.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.230

repairing spinal cord injuries, check out
