00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.768
- [David] Hey grammarians, hey Paige.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:02.601
- [Paige] Hi David.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:03.434
- [David] Hey, so Paige,

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.155
I went to the grocery store yesterday

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.325
and I got this apple and
I put it in the fridge.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.105
And this morning, when
I opened the fridge,

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:14.325
the apple was all gross
and sticky and mushy

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.544
and I really wanna write a
letter to the grocery store

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:19.305
and say, "Hey, you sold me a gross apple."

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:20.371
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:21.574
- [David] But I'm stuck.

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:22.472
- [Paige] Okay?

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:26.713
- [David] I feel like I
ought to put a comma in here.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:29.894
So, here's the sentence I've got so far.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:32.589
"You sold me a mushy, sticky apple!"

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:33.940
- [Paige] Gross.
- [David] Gross.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.320
- [David] Unacceptable.
- [Paige] Totally.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.751
- [David] "So, I would
like my $1.38 back."

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.309
(Paige laughs)

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.298
But in another draft
of the letter, I wrote,

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:44.525
"You sold me a mushy green apple!"

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:47.113
- [Paige] Okay, so mushy,
sticky or mushy green.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.908
- [David] Yeah, and I feel like,

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:50.810
and I don't know how to
put this into words yet,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.594
but we're gonna put it into
words 'cause that's our job,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.577
(Paige laughs)

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:54.481
whether or not there should be

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.936
a comma between mushy and
green or mushy and sticky,

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:01.055
'cause these feel different to me.

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.371
- [Paige] Right, right.

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:05.708
Yeah, so there's actually a couple tests

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.166
that you can do on these sentences

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.227
to see if you need a comma
between the adjectives or not.

00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:12.945
- [David] So, Paige, what distinguishes

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:16.687
a pair like mushy and
sticky from mushy and green?

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:18.757
- [Paige] There's this sort of hierarchy

00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:21.607
or order that you put adjectives in

00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:23.630
when you have multiple
of them in a sentence,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.621
and it is called DOSASCOMP.

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.111
- [David] DOSASCOMP?

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.179
All together now, D

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.381
- [Both] Determiner!

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.532
- [David] O.
- [Both] Opinion!

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:34.456
- [David] S.
- [Both] Size!

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:36.303
- [David] A.
- [Both] Age!

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:38.088
- [David] S again.
- [Both] Shape!

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:39.877
- [David] C.
- [Both] Color!

00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:41.857
- [David] O.
- [Both] Origin!

00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:43.969
- [David] M.
- [Both] Material!

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.283
- [David] And P.
- [Both] Purpose!

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:47.116
- [David] Oh, okay.

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:51.990
So, mushy and sticky are
both opinion adjectives.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.823
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:54.309
- [David] So, these are
kinda in the same class,

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.634
whereas mushy and green,
that's an opinion and a color.

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.091
- [Paige] Yeah, they're
in two different classes.

00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:01.929
- [David] Right, so DOSASCOMP helps

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.008
determine adjective order, right?

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:04.841
- [Paige] Yeah, yeah.

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.273
- [David] So, it's the order
in which you would use,

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:08.217
if in which you were
stacking these adjectives

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.554
you would use them in
this DOSASCOMP order.

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.609
- [Paige] Right, so like
in the second sentence,

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.796
mushy is an opinion, like you
said, and green is a color.

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:19.594
And in DOSASCOMP, opinion
comes before color,

00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:21.856
so that's the order
that you write them in.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.225
So, like in the first sentence,

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:24.752
when you have mushy and sticky,

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:26.882
which are both opinion adjectives,

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:29.187
these are called coordinate adjectives.

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:32.249
They're in the same category of DOSASCOMP.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.669
And if you wanted to, you
could reverse the order.

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.045
You could say, "Sticky, mushy apple."

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:37.103
- [David] Well, let's try that.

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:38.353
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.123
- [David] Looks good to me.

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:41.868
Sticky, mushy, mushy, sticky.

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:43.190
- [Paige] Same thing.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.531
- [David] Okay, so if
we're trying to determine

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.393
whether or not we have
coordinate adjectives,

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:49.842
I guess the first thing we would do

00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:51.710
is consult DOSASCOMP, right?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.056
So that's step one.

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:54.733
And what is a dosa, Paige?

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:56.398
- [Paige] Oh, it's like a pancake, right?

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:58.227
- [David] Yeah, it's like
a South Indian pancake.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:02:59.060
- [Paige] That's pretty cool.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.434
- [David] And to scomp
is a word we made up

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:01.626
that means, "to eat."

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.382
- [Paige] Sure, eat some pancakes.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:04.901
- [David] Scomp on 'em.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.181
So, that's step one.

00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:09.384
Step two, try the reversal method.

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.281
- [Paige] Right, and
that's like changing it

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:14.756
from mushy, sticky to sticky, mushy.

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:18.188
- [David] And step three
is stick an "and" in there.

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:19.187
- [Paige] Mm-hmm.

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.213
If you can reverse the
order of the adjectives

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:23.812
and you can put "and" in
between the two of them,

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:25.888
then they're coordinate adjectives.

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:27.491
- [David] And if they're
coordinate adjectives,

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.037
you need to separate them with a comma.

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:30.211
- [Paige] Exactly.

00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:31.871
And that's why, in the case
of the second sentence,

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.839
with mushy green apple, you
don't put a comma between them.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.101
They're in different
categories in DOSASCOMP,

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:40.152
and so they must stay in that order

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.938
and there's no need for a comma.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:42.802
- [David] Thanks, Paige.

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:44.807
I'm gonna get back to
drafting my angry letter.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.356
(Paige laughs)

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:47.562
You can learn anything.

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:49.177
- [David] David out.
- [Paige] Paige out.
