00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTO THIS ESPECIALLY AT HAITI
PRICES.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.602 line:85%
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.302 align:start position:0% line:85%
COOL, MAN.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.704 align:start position:0% line:85%

GOOD LORD THAT'S --
THAT'S $83.3 MILLION PER HOME.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S ALMOST AS BAD AS
MANHATTAN REAL ESTATE.

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:26.746 line:91%

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:35.454 line:91%
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
LARRY, THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.890 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRUST THE RED CROSS IS A SAD
STORY.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.091 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.762 line:91%
IS IT SAD ENOUGH FOR THE TITLE
"JUST BECAUSE IT'S SAD DOESN'T

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:49.602 align:start position:0% line:91%
MEAN YOU CAN PRETEND IT'S NOT

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.210 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN HAITI.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:01.480 line:91%

MORE THAN A DECADE.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:10.289 line:91%

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.162 line:91%
THESE UN SOLDIERS ARE GETTING
HOOKERS WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.930 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO RELIEF WORK.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS SOUNDS DISGUSTING.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.666 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
BUT THE REALITY IS MORE
DISGUSTING.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.772 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:47.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO
BARTER WITH BUT THEIR BODIES.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.864 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FACT IT'S BY PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUPPOSE TO KEEP PEACE IT'S

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:52.731 align:start position:0% line:85%
WORST.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.235 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S LIKE A CARE BEAR ON A

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.903 align:start position:0% line:85%
MURDER SPREES ARE BAD.
