So, here is another data set.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have the sizes in square feet listed on the left,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the corresponding prices in dollars listed on the right.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I want you to look at the data.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Particularly I want you to tell me is there a fixed dollar amount per square foot?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.654
Yes or no?
