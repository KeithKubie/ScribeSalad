00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.470
Ants are found on every continent except Antarctica
-- ironic isn't it?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.549
Because you know… the word ant.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:17.420
It's in the name 
and ants are COOL.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.420
HA.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
Ants are everywhere, seriously, there are
over 12,000 species of ant, and they just

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.700
sent ants to space in the Commercial Generic
Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert - 06.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.120
I love NASA.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.280
I'm fascinated by these tiny creatures.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.920
I think they are totally going to take over
the world after we die.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.370
Ants are excellent organizers, they live in
nearly every kind of environment known to

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.360
man, and though most of us know there's a
"queen" ant, patrollers, foragers, builders,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.359
and so on, ants are actually egalitarian -- they've
got no leader!

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.929
According to the NASA documentation, "No one
ant directs the behavior of a group of ants

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.089
and no ant decides what another ant should
do."

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.979
They sent ants to space to find out how these
tiny leaderless organizers would handle microgravity!

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.230
They did better than we humans did, figuring
out how to float, and then grab the walls

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.550
of their container (or each other) very quickly.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.220
Without a leader, ants have to communicate
with each other to complete tasks that help

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.630
the colony as a whole.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.390
A study in Nature explored hydrocarbons which
coat ant bodies to keep them from drying out

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.670
in desert environments; but they're also used
to communicate.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.770
Patroller ants are usually the first to explore
for food, so researchers drew them out, trapped

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.090
them, and then placed tiny glass beads coated
in the same hydrocarbon as the patrollers

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.820
outside of the colony entrance.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.310
They hoped this would signal the forager ants
that the patrollers were back, and they could

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.270
come get the food they found!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.270
It worked!

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.160
This research has implications well outside
of the Honey I Shrunk the Science community…

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.310
When engineers and scientists use nature as
the inspiration for technology, it's called

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310
biomimicry.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.590
Honestly, it's one of my favorite things in
science and now computer scientists are proposing

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.750
to use ants' de-centralized command structure
to inspire new email spam filters!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.700
Researchers from Stanford realized while observing
ant colonies: young ants are surrounded by

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.560
other ants, each with a chemical scent.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.590
Over time,they meet more ants and learn which
are friendly and which are enemies.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.130
As they age, they'll eventually leave the
colony to forage -- meeting strangely-scented

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.060
ants which they know to attack, but no single
ant knows every scent, and thus recognizes

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.890
every intruder!

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.040
In this way, each ant has it's own training
and attack schema.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.209
Rather than training a spam filter with a
centralized master list creating smaller,

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.400
broken-up lists allows computer scientists
to make a cheaper, more efficient system.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.980
Studying ants can teach us a lot about the
environment too.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.819
New York City is chock full of environmental
stress for ants (and humans).

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.420
Researchers from North Carolina State observed
21 species of ant in Manhattan; and they found

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.060
the most common successful Tetramorium Sp.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.849
E has evolved to eat human leftovers!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.980
In nature, ants will seek out sugars, fruits,
meats, proteins, seeds, grains and even other

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.960
ant species to eat.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.100
Because they have a lot of human food on the
streets of New York these ants adapted to

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.910
clean up after US!They know this, because
researchers found high rates of carbon-13,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.920
a sugar found in corns and grasses common
in human food -- it's rare in their natural

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.920
food.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.819
The thing is, other than being super-successful
in this stressful environment, we don't know

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.810
what this adaptation will mean for these guys...

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.450
Studying ants tells us a lot about the kind
of environment we're creating for ourselves.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.880
Will they fall victim to junk food's woes
like humans?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880
I hope not...

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
It's pretty bad out there.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.275
So, ants have no leader, and no formal training
systems on who is attacking versus friendly,

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:48.099
and they eat our garbage and clean up our
streets -- they're a valuable educational

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.290
resource to learn about ourselves, our environment,
and through biomimicry, any number of other

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.880
scientific inspirations!

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.370
What's your relationship with Ants?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.840
Love 'em hate 'em?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.730

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.780

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.750
Because Thursday April 9 at 2 PM pacific 5
eastern we are going to have a Google Hangout

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.911
with Mitchell Moffit and Greg Brown from ASAPScience
and Joe Hanson from It's Okay to Be Smart.

00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:33.150
RSVP with the link in the description because
you do not want to miss it.
