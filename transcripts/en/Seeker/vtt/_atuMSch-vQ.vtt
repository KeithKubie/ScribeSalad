00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.270
Science provides new hope for paraplegics!

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.600
You go, science.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.260
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews with some exciting
news - as of this week, we are one step closer

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.480
to a cure for paralysis!

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.419
An experimental new treatment called "epidural
stimulation" has given new hope to men and

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.199
women suffering from chronic paralysis.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.349
Three years ago, doctors at the National Institute
of Health successfully rehabilitated a man

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.800
who was paralyzed from the neck down, by zapping
his spinal cord with electricity.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.470
Ever since that miraculous recovery, doctors
have wondered if it was just a fluke - or

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
a potential avenue for future therapy.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.740
Fast forward 3 years, to this week - when
the team of doctors that initially made that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.620
discovery, managed to replicate it 3 more
times, with 3 different male patients - all

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.970
of whom suffered spinal cord injuries that
left them paralyzed from below the neck or

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.880
chest for at least two years.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.059
Treatment involves implanting a suite of electrodes
in the vertebrae of the spinal cord, and administering

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.749
doses of electricity.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:10.299
Those electrical impulses allow the spinal
cord to receive simple commands from the brain,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.080
through circuitry that was previously considered
irreparable after spinal cord injury.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.439
All 4 patients are now capable of some degree
of voluntary motion, but they still aren't

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.409
able to walk unassisted.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.939
The simple act of lifting their legs and standing,
however, is still a huge improvement over

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.909
complete paralysation.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.909
One patient noted that even when the machine
was turned off, he saw "huge improvements

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.520
in bowel, bladder and sexual function."

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.479
Obviously this treatment is still experimental
- but experts say it could eventually prove

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.070
more effective than standard approaches, including
medicine and physical therapy.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.689
"The big message," they say, is that people
with spinal cord injuries of this type "no

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.920
longer need to think they have a lifelong
sentence of paralysis."

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920
What about you?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.569
Does this give you hope for the future of
paralysis patients?
