00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.900
Nostalgia Critic: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.240
and welcome to the first week of Nostalgia-Ween and you know what that means?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.700
You look around in all the stores and what do you see since October...

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.440
...September.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.640
Halloween and also a little bit of...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.440
...oh, come on!

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.980
Okay, okay, stay focused...

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.480
...unlike retail stores.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.020
That means certain things are going to be out and about.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.420
Witches, bats, spiders, monsters and of course

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420
"The Nightmare Before Christmas"

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.060
Hell, they practically have their own section.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000
Why? Because it has become a staple of the holiday.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.520
Everybody immediately goes to this imagery when selling Halloween merchandise.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.400
Even more than popular Horror films and and sometimes even Classic Horror films.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.100
Kids are now growing up looking at Jack Skellington, Sally, Oogie Boogie and so forth before they even see the movie.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300
It's like seeing Dracula everywhere before you see the movie "Dracula".

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.880
It's kind of become a phenomenon.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.280
Even Disney theme parks change their "Haunted Mansion" ride to the "Nightmare Before Christmas" ride

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.860
and on top of that they do it around Halloween and Christmas.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.080
That's no small feat, that takes a lot of work.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.080
It's crazy how popular this film is.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.400
Which is why it's funny when someone who hasn't seen the film finally checks it out after all that buildup,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.940
what's usually their response?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.320
Eh....That was...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.600
...

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.340
You all know what I'm talking about, heck maybe you're one of these people that experienced it.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.160
Someone who saw "Nightmare Before Christmas" thinking it was going to be amazing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.600
and discovering something not awful but not what you expected.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.760
As its popularity grows more and more

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.080
so does the crowd of people with question marks over their heads that just don't understand it at all.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.220
So, like a lot of these people, I have to ask the question,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.620
"Is 'Nightmare Before Christmas' really that great?"

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.240
So many people year after year shrug in confusion about why this film is as popular as it is.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.280
Is it something they're missing or is it another case of nostalgia goggles clouding an idea that wasn't anything that special?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.320
Well the first thing to keep in mind is unlike a lot of other popular films that many people claim are over hyped,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.580
this one didn't start out as a hit.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.360
That is to say, it wasn't a failure either.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.260
It did alright at the box office,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.400
But the reaction most people had when they first saw it was similar to what many people have today.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.520
Eh

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.840
Part of the reason for that back then is actually kind of the reason today.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.620
Animated films have come a long, long way.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.780
This is the time when "Beauty and the Beast", "Aladdin", "Mask of the Pantasm" and many other films

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.920
were upping the anti on how mature animated films could be.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.320
TV was following the same pattern,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.720
many of them were trying to entertain adults as well as children

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.360
and like I said, you could argue that films and TV are doing that even today.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.380
Which is why something like "Nightmare" doesn't seem to fit the mould.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.660
It's not an especially grown up story with grown up writing or grown up humour.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.940
It's actually super simple.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.800
Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloween Land, wants to take over Christmas so he can do something new.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.100
So he learns to appreciate what he has.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.040
Hmm, okay, that sounds fine for a little child

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.860
but why is it still being seen on clothes, shot glasses and other adult merchandise?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.540
If it doesn't seem very adult, how come adults are eating it up?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.740
Well maybe part of it is that the idea is unbelievably creative

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.880
and invites you into an unbelievably creative world

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.260
and on top of that, simplifies what is essentially kind of a hard concept to explain.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.400
Holidays having their own world and such.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.800
Yet it explains it in a way that everybody can understand.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.580
That's kind of tricky to do.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.400
But big deal so it executes an idea very well,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.580
that doesn't necessarily mean that it has deep or engaging characters.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.140
The dialogue from this movie is beyond basic.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.180
Dr. Finkelstein: Curiosity killed the cat, you know?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.360
Jack Skellington: I know.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.700
Nostalgia Critic: How long did it take you to write that one?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.520
But in trying to understand why people could possibly enjoy that kind of writing,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.360
can you think of other films and shorts that had similar writing?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.660
Immediately what comes to my head are holiday classics

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.280
like "The Grinch", "Charlie Brown", the "Rankin/Bass" stuff and so forth.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.620
All specials that have that kind of cheap quality to them but also a strange kind of honesty.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.140
There's a sense that they tried to keep it simple because they don't want to lose the special feeling of the holiday.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.680
In all these specials, the holiday is what's at the forefront even before the characters and story.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.620
That's always the number one focus and that's why we always watch them around this time of year.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.320
This one is very similar, except unlike the others, it does it with two holidays

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.580
and on top of that they're two holidays that are so polar opposite, you'd never think to combine them together

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.280
but they did and they mesh surprisingly well,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.000
in that, they're not supposed to mesh well.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.540
Again, a message that should be made very clear.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.960
But as you can see, it's such a weird complicated set-up that almost has to be kept simple.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.200
These kind of specials hold up because the words and ideas they use are brief and short but also important.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.640
People seem to appreciate both holidays here because it shows what happens if they were to be mixed together

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.480
so it teaches you to appreciate everything in its own unique way one at a time.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.680
But truthfully that's not the only lesson,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.880
it's also about not taking something for granted and appreciating the simple joys of what you have.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.640
Again, simple joys, many great stories about simple joys are told in simple ways

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.560
and this one is no exception.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.720
It doesn't constantly explain the meaning of the holiday, it just lets you experience it.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.920
Even Jack obsesses over what the meaning of Christmas is and then he realises, it can't be explained.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.380
It just has to be felt.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.380
Jack Skellington: Just because I cannot see it doesn't mean I can't believe it.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.340
Nostalgia Critic: And everything, from the breathtaking visuals, to the catchy as Hell songs, to the very easy to grasp characters reflect that.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.340
A good example of something similar is Batman.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.780
This character has been around for years and has been represented as both complex and simple

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.800
but it comes from a place everyone can understand, Bruce Wayne lost his parents and he wants revenge.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.120
It is such a simple idea you get right away yet there's been so many variations of it.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.060
Some childishly light, some disturbingly dark.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.740
"Nightmare Before Christmas" is one of those ideas that could and, in some respects, is being retold.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.700
It's one of a kind but there can also be variations.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.100
There are plays, concerts and musicals that all give their unique spin on the source material.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.460
Heck, maybe years from now we'll get variations even more different than the ones we're used to.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.540
Maybe there will be ones with more adult jokes, more complex ideas and more twists and turns.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.580
It can do this because it comes from a very simple yet identifiable source.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.140
I think that's what people relate to in the story,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.440
not just the creativity of it but the simplicity of it.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.420
This is a movie that is very basic,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.960
but so is "Rudolph", and "Christmas Carol" and "Great Pumpkin".

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.840
These are stories that anyone of any language can understand and enjoy.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.140
So while it's very easy to see why someone wouldn't get into something so seemingly simple,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.840
it's also very easy to see how someone would.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.900
Not only has this given birth to a new movement of creepy stop motion movies for kids

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.220
that are still being made years later,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.620
but they're allowed to tell stories that can be timeless and not have to throw in catchphrases to get a crowd.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.260
This is where a lot of that started.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.260
And even though it clearly took influence from several other holiday specials, it's still its own unique vision.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.960
You take any still from this movie and nobody will mistake it for "Grinch" or "Frosty" or anything like that.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.100
They immediately know it's "Nightmare Before Christmas".

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.520
That's how strong an impact it has, any frame is immediately recognisable.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.600
So, even though it's not super funny or super dramatic or super surprising,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.680
that was never really its purpose.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.840
The purpose was to create something simple but amazing.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.320
Small but impressive.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.440
Weird but easy to follow.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:40.160
It stimulates the imagination in a way everyone can understand and in some way relate to.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.720
So, while it will never be a masterpiece to everyone,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.840
it will still be a beacon of imagination for many of us.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.460
It's a symbol of Halloween that gets people excited

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.600
because when Jack, Sally, Zero

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.200
or any other creepy resident of Halloween Land are seen,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.700
it's a clear sign that the coolest holiday is right around the corner.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.100
and you can bet that every person that enjoys the holiday will be singing,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.040
"This is Halloween"

Hey Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out,

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.200
this week we are doing "Partnership for Drug Free Kids".

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.360
Their mission is to help families struggling with a son or daughter's substance abuse.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.880
They provide practical information, tools and support on their website and through their toll free helpline:

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.620
1-8-5-5 DRUG FREE

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.420
They advocate for addiction treatment and recovery support for teens and young adults.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.340
As a national non-profit, they depend on donations from individuals like yourselves,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.660
Corporations, Foundations and the public sector.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.520
Their YouTube channel offers stories and guidance to help families

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.120
prevent and cope with teen substance abuse.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.240
There's an especially wonderful video that shows an updated version of the egg in the pan

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.800
with the, "This is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, any questions?"

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.640
And, yeah, there are a lot of questions.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.740
Our youth as well as drugs are constantly changing and we need to be on top of that.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.380
This is an organisation that helps to keep us on top of that.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.680
If you look at their website or their YouTube channel you can see they clearly know what they're talking about

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.620
and have such big hearts and want to do everything they can to help these children out.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.620
So please, take a look, raise awareness

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.260
and share what you can with this great organisation

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.580
that wants to make our kids clean again.
