00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:05.605
(cell phone rings)

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.576
(Ahamed groans)

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:14.413
- [Ahamed Voiceover] My
name is Ahamed Weinberg.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.250
This year, like many before
it, I'm fasting for Ramadan.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.519
That means I wake up
before the sun rises,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.254
and eat everything in my fridge,

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.723 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then I can't eat
again until the sun sets.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:27.227
I do this for an entire month.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.365
(kettle whistles)

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.469
But you're probably wondering
why is your last name Jewish?

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.971
Why are you white?

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.373
What is happening?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.375
Let me explain.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.644
My mother was one of 10 children

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.113
in an Irish-Catholic family.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.381
One day, she joined a
Native American tribe,

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.216
and they called her Hat Woman.

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.153
Better than Sunblock, I guess.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.988
This is her at the end
of her spiritual journey

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.990
as a Sufi Muslim.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.125
She was never sunburnt again.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.629
In 1988, she married a
Jewish man from Brooklyn

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.663
who had also found Islam.

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.232
Look at that nose.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.334
The answering machine in
my house growing up was

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
"As-salamu alaykum. You've
reached the Weinbergs.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.272
"Please leave a message."

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.108
Nobody left a message.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.744
I go crazy every day.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.513
I can't drink or eat.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:25.852
I usually want to have sex
with my fridge around four.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:32.324
She's old and her
skin is yellow.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.760
She doesn't stop humming but...

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.529
Something about her I love.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:40.133
It's what's inside that counts.
