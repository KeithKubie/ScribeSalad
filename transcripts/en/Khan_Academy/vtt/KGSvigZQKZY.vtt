00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:01.352
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out

00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:06.352
what 256 to the four-sevenths power,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:11.229
divided by two to the
four-sevenths power is,

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.398
and like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:14.809
figure this out.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.637
All right, let's work
through this together,

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:18.854
and at first you might
find this kind of daunting.

00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:20.352
Especially when you see
something like two to the

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.616
four-sevenths power or is that even,

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.496
that's not going to be a
whole number, how do I,

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.176
how do I do this, especially
without a calculator.

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:28.513
And I should've said, do
this without a calculator.

00:00:28.513 --> 00:00:31.327
But then the key is to
see that we can use our

00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:33.602
exponent properties to
simplify this a little bit

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.683
so that we can do this on paper.

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:37.913
And the main property
that may jump out at you

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.944
is if I have something, if I have,

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:45.944
if I have x to the a power, over y

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:50.678
to the a power, this is
the same thing as x over y,

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:53.160
to the a power.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.634
And in our situation right over here,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.954
256 would be x, two would be y,

00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:01.158
and then a is four-sevenths,
so we can rewrite this,

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:02.853
this is going to be equal to

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:08.342
this is equal to 256, over two,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:12.869
to the four-sevenths
power, and so this is nice.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.471
We're already able to simplify this,

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:19.137
because we know 256
divided by two, is 128.

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:24.137
So this is 128 to the four-sevenths power.

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:28.197
Now this might also seem
a little bit difficult,

00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:31.587
how do I raise 128 to a fractional power?

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:32.702
But we just have to remind ourselves,

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:36.463
this is the same thing, this
is the same thing as 128

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.878
to the one-seventh power.

00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:41.420
Then raised to the fourth power.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.243
We could also view it the
other way around, we could say

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:47.143
that this is also 128 to the fourth,

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:50.614
to the fourth power, and
then raise that to the

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.794
one-seventh, but
multiplying 128 four times,

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:55.872
that's going to be very
computationally intensive,

00:01:55.872 --> 00:01:57.614
and then you have to find
the seventh root of that.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:01:59.251
That seems pretty difficult,
so we don't want to

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.397
go in that way, but if we can
get the smaller number first,

00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:05.166
what is 128 to the one-seventh power?

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.126
Then that might be easier to
raise to the fourth power.

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:11.309
Now when you look at this,
and knowing that probably,

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.605
the question writer in this
case, I'm the person who

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:15.521
presented it with you is,
telling you that you're not

00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:18.283
going to use a calculator is,
it's a pretty good clue that,

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:20.197
all right, this is probably going to be a,

00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:21.305
this is probably going to
be something that I can

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.547
figure out on my own,

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:26.680
and you might recognize
128 as a power of two,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.441
and maybe two to the seventh
is 128, and we can verify that.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:34.319
So let's see, two to the first is two.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.382
Four, eight, 16,

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:42.594
32, 64, 128.

00:02:42.594 --> 00:02:44.963
Two times two is four, times two is eight,

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:48.251
times two is 16, times
two is 32, times 2 is 64,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.853
times two is 128.

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:52.732
So, two to the seventh power

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:56.517
is equal to 128, or another way of saying

00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:59.373
this exact same thing is that 128,

00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:02.112
128 is equal to

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.272
or 128 to the one-seventh power,

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.859
is equal to two.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.030
Or you could even say
that the seventh root,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.314
the seventh root of 128, is equal,

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:17.077
is equal to two.

00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:19.348
So, we can simplify this.

00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:21.334
This is two, so our whole
expression is now just

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.110
two to the fourth power.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.008
Well, that's just two times two,

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:26.430
times two, times two.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.250
So, that's two to the fourth power.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.036
Two to the fourth power, which is just

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:35.263
going to be equal to 16.

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:39.303
That's two, times two, times two, times

00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:40.511
two, right over there.

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.472
And so we're done!

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.858
This crazy,
complicated-looking expression,

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:45.042
it is simplified

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:47.370
to 16.
