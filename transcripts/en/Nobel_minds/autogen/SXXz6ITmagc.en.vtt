I did get a chemistry set as a fairly as

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040
I did get a chemistry set as a fairly as
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.910
I did get a chemistry set as a fairly as
a small kid and I tried it and found it

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920
a small kid and I tried it and found it
 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.499
a small kid and I tried it and found it
rather boring because all the

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509
rather boring because all the
 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.490
rather boring because all the
experiments were very safe and but then

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500
experiments were very safe and but then
 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.120
experiments were very safe and but then
I came across a book in the school

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130
I came across a book in the school
 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.720
I came across a book in the school
library and I'm guessing now that I've

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730
library and I'm guessing now that I've
 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.690
library and I'm guessing now that I've
reconstructed only a few days ago

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700
reconstructed only a few days ago
 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.130
reconstructed only a few days ago
because of the Nobel Museum for quest

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140
because of the Nobel Museum for quest
 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.470
because of the Nobel Museum for quest
for artifacts that this probably was

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480
for artifacts that this probably was
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.849
for artifacts that this probably was
actually when I was only about eight

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859
actually when I was only about eight
 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.459
actually when I was only about eight
years old and it had some much cooler

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469
years old and it had some much cooler
 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.410
years old and it had some much cooler
experiments that were a little more

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420
experiments that were a little more
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.349
experiments that were a little more
dangerous and required some corrosive

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359
dangerous and required some corrosive
 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.759
dangerous and required some corrosive
chemicals and things like that and

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769
chemicals and things like that and
 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.009
chemicals and things like that and
somehow maybe my father helped me get

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019
somehow maybe my father helped me get
 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.959
somehow maybe my father helped me get
some of them and I tried them and found

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969
some of them and I tried them and found
 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.020
some of them and I tried them and found
what they were really neat and so that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030
what they were really neat and so that
 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.540
what they were really neat and so that
got me started doing experiments at home

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
got me started doing experiments at home
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.790
got me started doing experiments at home
in the basement which was sort of

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800
in the basement which was sort of
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.229
in the basement which was sort of
worrying to my parents but they were

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
worrying to my parents but they were
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.899
worrying to my parents but they were
also a mixture of pride given the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909
also a mixture of pride given the
 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.790
also a mixture of pride given the
scientific orientation of the family but

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800
scientific orientation of the family but
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.389
scientific orientation of the family but
also feared and I was gonna either burn

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399
also feared and I was gonna either burn
 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.060
also feared and I was gonna either burn
myself up or or blow up the house or

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070
myself up or or blow up the house or
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.430
myself up or or blow up the house or
whatever

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440
 
 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.500
