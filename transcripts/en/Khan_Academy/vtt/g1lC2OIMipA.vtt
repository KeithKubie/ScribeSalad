00:00:00.911 --> 00:00:02.952
- [Instructor] In the last
video, we talked about

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:06.022
the short-lived and highly unsuccessful

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.772
English colony at Roanoke Island,

00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:13.620
which disappeared pretty
much without a trace,

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.401
and even today is still
known as the Lost Colony.

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:22.568
So as late as 1585, England
has still not successfully

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:28.530
established a New World colony.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.204
Well, all of that is about to change.

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:34.121
In 1607, when the Virginia Company,

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.758
a joint-stock company,
or an early precursor

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:49.140
to the modern corporation,
which spread out

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.557
both the shares, the wealth, and the risk

00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:57.191
of an expedition like one
headed to the New World.

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.917
They received a charter
for New World exploration

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:03.334
from King James I, who had now taken over

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:09.128
for Queen Elizabeth, and their
goals were kinda the same

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:12.494
as many of the goals of
explorers in this time period.

00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:15.398
They wanted to find gold.

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:18.981
They wanted to find a
passage to the Indies

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:24.995
that might make it easier for them to get

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:29.339
the luxurious materials
like spices and silk

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.006
that were so expensive to
get over the land route

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.232
that was the silk road.

00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:37.003
And, James in particular
was hoping that they could

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.670
maybe get one up on the Spanish,

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.736
who had been doing so well
for more than 100 years

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:48.022
in the West Indies.

00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:51.570
Now one of the important
things to note about this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.487
is that no one who went to Virginia

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:58.876
expected to set up a colony there

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.409
and live there for the
rest of their lives.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.827
What they expected was to
go for a couple of years,

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:08.968
mine tremendous amounts
of gold, which they hoped

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.684
were lying in giant piles
all over the ground.

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:17.099
Get tremendously wealthy,
and live like kings

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.110
for the rest of their lives in Europe.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.911
So this Virginia Company
expedition was intended

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.328
to be short-term.

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:30.959
But, as it'll turn out,
that will not be the case.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.650
So how did things go
for the Virginia Company

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.421
compared to the Roanoke Island colonists?

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.951
Well, not terrifically better.

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:43.118
They sailed in early 1607
into the Chesapeake Bay,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.060
and they spent some time looking for what

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.898
might be a good place to settle,

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:53.319
and they eventually chose a
site here on what they'll name

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.127
the James River, for King
James, and in the town

00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:01.127
that they'll call Jamestown
for the same reason.

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:06.530
It's hard to overstate
how terrible the land

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.844
that they chose at Jamestown was,

00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:12.418
and it was terrible for
a couple of reasons.

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:16.585
One reason is that the soil
isn't terrifically good there.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.016
It's marshy, it's not great
for growing subsistence crops,

00:03:25.654 --> 00:03:27.268
which you'll need to survive.

00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:30.018
And more importantly, it's buggy,

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:36.157
and by buggy I mean that
there are tons of mosquitoes,

00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:40.157
and mosquitoes carry
diseases like yellow fever,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.650
malaria, and those mosquito-borne diseases

00:03:49.073 --> 00:03:53.350
will have a tremendous
effect, a huge death toll

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.449
for the early settlers at Jamestown.

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.190
The other thing I can't
overstate about the colonists

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.860
at Jamestown was just
how incredibly unprepared

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.027
and unsuited they were to be
colonists in the New World.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.414
Remember, this was essentially
a get rich quick scheme.

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:16.816
Well, who are the sort of people

00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:18.579
who'd like to get rich quick?

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.578
Investors, for the most part.

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:25.060
These were gentlemen, and
the English definition

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.686
of a gentleman is really
someone who has title,

00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:31.310
someone who has status,
someone who does not

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.220
work with his hands, and all
through that first summer

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.154
when they probably should've
been planting crops

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.501
to try to survive through the winter,

00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:46.384
instead, these gentlemen
were busy looking for gold,

00:04:46.384 --> 00:04:48.582
which means that when
winter rolled around,

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:52.358
things got pretty dire at Jamestown,

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.936
and we'll talk about
that in the next video.
