00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:10.356
&gt;&gt;Students: Uno, dos,
tres [clapping]...

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the Bank
Street College of Education

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.996
in Manhattan playing hand
games is part of an effort

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.146
to teach language skills.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.696
Since 1960 Bank Street has been
making classroom learning meaningful

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:24.646
by connecting it

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.386
with student-centered
real-world experiences.

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:30.256
&gt;&gt;Costa-Garro: There's been
a study by anthropologists

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:35.236
and linguists trying to find how
we can connect what is natural

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.176
in language development with school.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:40.856
So what I'm trying to
get the teachers to see

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:45.016
that these hand games can be
integrated into the curriculum.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.059
&gt;&gt;Video: [students counting

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:49.102
in foreign language
along with hand game]

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:49.976
&gt;&gt;Snyder: In the graduate school,

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:52.226
we've stood for something
that's different

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:54.516
in the world of teacher education.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.386
And as opposed to starting
with, "Here's the content.

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.616
Now open up your head and
we'll just pour this in

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.676
and we'll test you to
see if you have it.

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:05.176
It's a very different starting point
to say, "Let's get an experience

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.896
that you're really interested in
that's going to open your own head."

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.876
And that takes a real
talented teacher.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So how did you
figure that out, Emanuel?

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.086
&gt;&gt;Emanuel: On my fingers.

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You counted
with your fingers?

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:14.906
Show me.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Bank Street thinks
talented teachers are developed

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:18.936
by connecting with kids.

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:19.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's that for?

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:22.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So they
created laboratory schools

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.456
within their teaching facility.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.606
The Family Center serves
the Pre-K set.

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:29.606
&gt;&gt;Boy: We need all the
pieces to make a building.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher 3: We need all the pieces?

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in the
K-8 School for Children,

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:37.016
student teachers work every day
with master teachers by their side.

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:39.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So the first
question is whether

00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:42.026
or not there's a beginning
of the story?

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:45.896
&gt;&gt;Boy: The beginning was when
the frogs were on the thing,

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.806
or when the weasel was there...

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:48.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The weasel?

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:49.936
&gt;&gt;Boy: Like there's a weasel
at the very, very beginning.

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:50.306
That's when...

00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:51.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Did I already
skip the weasel?

00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:55.896
&gt;&gt;Snyder: Really it's about engaging
kids in experiences so that they say,

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:57.196
"Hm, I wonder why that happened?"

00:01:57.436 --> 00:01:59.786
And then in the midst of
answering that question,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.346
that's a real question based upon
their real experience, they learn how

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:06.866
to read, write, do arithmetic as
well as how to think critically

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.986
and to do research and
to get along with others.

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:11.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Does anyone have something
different that your group said?

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:14.476
&gt;&gt;Snyder: We try to do the same
thing with our graduate students.

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.926
The experiences we engage
them in are teaching kids.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:20.546
And so they teach kids all day, and
then they come and we say, "Okay.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.056
What happened?

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:23.046
Why do you think that happened?

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:24.876
What do you need to know to
make that go better tomorrow?"

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:26.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, how
do you think that went?

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.676
&gt;&gt;Student Teacher: I think that
it actually went really well.

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:31.626
I mean, we kind of
had time constraints,

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:35.366
but a lot of people wanted to
contribute to the discussion, so.

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:35.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To prepare
new teachers for work

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:42.226
in challenging urban environments,
Bank Street partners with schools

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:46.796
like PS65, an under-resourced
elementary school in the Bronx,

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:50.726
that's now thriving with Bank
Street graduate Tashon McKeithen

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:51.436
at the helm.

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.096
&gt;&gt;McKeithan: One thing
that I learned from my time

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.596
at Bank Street is really just
the relationships that you build

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:56.156
with students,

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:59.526
and the social/emotional
aspect is really important.

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:01.506
I think once you make
those connections,

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.486
everything sort of falls into place.

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:04.936
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: What shape
is this one right here?

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.136
&gt;&gt;Girl: A circle.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:06.926
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: A circle!

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:08.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Second year
Bank Street student,

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:13.366
Steve Liverpool landed a job
teaching pre-kindergarten at PS65.

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.276
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Out of these two
objects, which one is a circle?

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:19.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While flying solo for the
most part, and learning on the job,

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:22.906
he relies on Bank Street
faculty for continuing support.

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:25.076
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Can you show
me which one's a circle?

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:29.726
Oh, does that look
like a circle, Natasha?

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.056
But that's close.

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:32.936
A circle is round.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:38.056
Okay, thank you, Miss Betsy.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:45.926
Natasha looked a little deeper than
what the actual object appears.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:47.016
What's on it!

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:47.856
Very good.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.236
Mr. Liverpool was looking
just at the content, totally.

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:56.456
&gt;&gt;I was so caught up and Miss
Betsy, she knew where I was going,

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:01.186
and totally just honed in on what
she was saying, and I was like,

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:02.356
"Oh, yeah, there it is, too."

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:04.656
We want them to see
outside of the box.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.816
Not just a regular a
circle is a circle.

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.146
It can be more than that.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.856
&gt;&gt;What color is that, boys and girls?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.156
&gt;&gt;Class: Blue!

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:11.726
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Blue!

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:14.426
&gt;&gt;I had each child
take a turn to show me

00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:16.676
which of the objects was a circle.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:20.396
And then afterwards we broke,
and went around the room,

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:23.356
just walking with a
partner to look for circles.

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:25.806
&gt;&gt;Brown-Franklyn: Okay, so
they'll begin to see circles

00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:27.436
in everything that they do.

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:30.776
&gt;&gt;We want to support our students,
so we stay with them for a year,

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:34.176
and I work with them
weekly in their classrooms.

00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:37.206
So I come and I meet with them,
I observe what they're doing.

00:04:37.656 --> 00:04:41.016
I help them to think further and
deeper around their work with kids.

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:42.696
And I'm their cheerleader.

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.566
&gt;&gt;So we could really
do a lot with that

00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:45.976
when we come back into the classroom.

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:49.726
We can think about how we can
go from circles to other shapes.

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.366
&gt;&gt;My role is to think, "Okay,
so what are we doing next week?

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:53.706
What are we doing next month?

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.056
How is this related?"

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:56.976
And so they go, "Oh, okay.

00:04:56.976 --> 00:05:01.026
Yeah, maybe we should connect
the circles to the pumpkins

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.276
to the apples, because we're
going to go on an apple trip

00:05:03.276 --> 00:05:04.456
and we're still doing circles."

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:06.406
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Anybody else
needs help with their milk?

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:08.996
&gt;&gt;Brown-Franklyn: I think Bank
Street realized that if you want

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:12.126
to place teachers in urban
education, you have to do more

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.976
than just educate them theoretically.

00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:16.066
You have to give them
practical support.

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:20.356
There's really no other way,
I think, to be successful

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:22.466
at keeping people in
schools like these.

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:27.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So let's see if we
can help each other balance.

00:05:27.686 --> 00:05:29.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Bank Street
encourages teachers

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:31.636
to put their personal
stamp on their classroom.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:33.746
For recent graduate, Kiera Morton,

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:36.196
that means teaching
first graders yoga.

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:37.216
&gt;&gt;Morton: Fly like a butterfly.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:40.636
&gt;&gt;Class: Fly like a butterfly.

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:41.166
&gt;&gt;Morton: Sting like a bee.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.726
&gt;&gt;Class: Sting like a bee.

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:47.136
&gt;&gt;Morton: One of my favorite courses
was Music and Movement, obviously.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:52.166
I really felt that it was that class
that I was able to start thinking,

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:55.516
"Hey, I can actually do yoga
in the classroom with my kids."

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:56.536
&gt;&gt;Sit nice and tall.

00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:58.146
Bring your hands on your belly.

00:05:58.186 --> 00:05:58.926
Breathe in.

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:02.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Trying to build a
lesson plan around reading,

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.006
but I have to motivate them to do
this, and I also have to get them

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:07.106
to start thinking about it.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:10.756
So you're going to take
the stickies that are

00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:12.156
on the table, those Post-Its.

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:16.746
And you are now going to go on
a gallery walk out in the hall.

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:20.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Bank Street, learning
is a process of constructing meaning

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:22.336
from personal experience.

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:25.156
For new teachers and
their future students,

00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:29.126
it is a demanding enterprise that
goes beyond teaching to the test.

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:32.696
&gt;&gt;Snyder: It takes a great deal of
confidence in yourself as a teacher,

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.336
and a great deal of faith in
children, that they're capable

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:36.576
of learning what's on the test,

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:40.656
when you're not telling them
what the answer is on the test.

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:44.206
Fortunately, we now have 90
years of history that says

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:48.736
if you have a really talented
teacher, a really expertly prepared

00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:51.246
and supported teacher,
then the kids do better.

00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:53.686
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Okay, everyone
can see Mr. Liverpool?

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:53.776
&gt;&gt;Class: Yes!

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:57.006
&gt;&gt;Liverpool: Yes, and
I can see you, too.

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.286
