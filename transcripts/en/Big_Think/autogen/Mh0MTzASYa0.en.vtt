think nearly well enough is that if you

are a hierarchical ruler you are right

to be paranoid and it's not just that

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719
to be paranoid and it's not just that
 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.580
to be paranoid and it's not just that
paranoid people tend to become dictators

paranoid people tend to become dictators
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590
paranoid people tend to become dictators
it's more that if you're a dictator you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
it's more that if you're a dictator you
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719
it's more that if you're a dictator you
need to be paranoid because the real

saw that for example in Poland

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
saw that for example in Poland
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.419
saw that for example in Poland
why did Poland of all the communist

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429
why did Poland of all the communist
 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.989
why did Poland of all the communist
regimes get into trouble first because

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999
regimes get into trouble first because
 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.330
regimes get into trouble first because
there was a really well-organized civil

religious some not that formed a network

even before the Solidarity trade union

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679
even before the Solidarity trade union
 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.809
even before the Solidarity trade union
came along and that's lethal to a

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819
came along and that's lethal to a
 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.840
came along and that's lethal to a
hierarchical system which is why Stalin

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
hierarchical system which is why Stalin
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.510

was right if you want to put it this way

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
was right if you want to put it this way
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.929
was right if you want to put it this way
to be paranoid about social networking

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
to be paranoid about social networking
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.269
to be paranoid about social networking
that he didn't control didn't know about

that he didn't control didn't know about

it he understood that it doesn't take

it he understood that it doesn't take
too many additional edges in the network

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019
too many additional edges in the network
 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.960
too many additional edges in the network
to destroy the dominance of that central

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210

so one way of thinking about this is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
so one way of thinking about this is
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.720
so one way of thinking about this is
imagine a paramedic old structure

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
imagine a paramedic old structure
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.950
imagine a paramedic old structure
imagine something kind of like a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960
imagine something kind of like a
 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.740
imagine something kind of like a
Christmas tree and there is the big guy

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
Christmas tree and there is the big guy
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.020
Christmas tree and there is the big guy
like the fairy on top of the Christmas

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
like the fairy on top of the Christmas
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.630
like the fairy on top of the Christmas
tree but imagine that on this Christmas

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
tree but imagine that on this Christmas
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.940
tree but imagine that on this Christmas
tree the lights are just connected to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
tree the lights are just connected to
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530
tree the lights are just connected to
the fairy they're not connected to one

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
the fairy they're not connected to one
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.410
the fairy they're not connected to one
another and therefore the fairy decides

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
another and therefore the fairy decides
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.530
another and therefore the fairy decides
if the lights go on or off it's it's a

if the lights go on or off it's it's a
 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.120
if the lights go on or off it's it's a
peculiar kind of Christmas tree that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
peculiar kind of Christmas tree that
 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650
peculiar kind of Christmas tree that
that's essentially a hierarchical

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
that's essentially a hierarchical
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.930
that's essentially a hierarchical
Network it wouldn't take too many

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940
Network it wouldn't take too many
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210
Network it wouldn't take too many
connections as it were lateral or

lights to reduce the centrality of the

fairy on the tree and ultimately you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
fairy on the tree and ultimately you
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.090
fairy on the tree and ultimately you
could end up illuminating the tree

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
could end up illuminating the tree
 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.480
could end up illuminating the tree
without needing the fairy altogether so

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490
without needing the fairy altogether so
 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.500
without needing the fairy altogether so
I think that's why dictators hierarchs

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
I think that's why dictators hierarchs
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.080
I think that's why dictators hierarchs

monarchy very often those suspicions
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.890
monarchy very often those suspicions
were well-founded what we call social

networks look like conspiracies to
 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.070
networks look like conspiracies to
absolute rulers and that's why very

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080
absolute rulers and that's why very
 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.320
absolute rulers and that's why very
often in history the terms seem to

often in history the terms seem to
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.440
often in history the terms seem to
overlap what looks like a social network

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
overlap what looks like a social network
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.320
overlap what looks like a social network
to you and me if we're in it looks like

to you and me if we're in it looks like
 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.570
to you and me if we're in it looks like
a plot to the king if you want to see

of government take a trip to China and

of government take a trip to China and
you'll see a system which is

you'll see a system which is

at doing engineering projects if this

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070
at doing engineering projects if this

system decides on building high-speed
rail networks around China it can do it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800
rail networks around China it can do it
 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.040
rail networks around China it can do it
with astonishing speed if the system

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050
with astonishing speed if the system
 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.039
with astonishing speed if the system
decides that it's going to build cities

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049
decides that it's going to build cities
 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.520

population to inhabit them it can do
that and so one of the most impressive

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310
that and so one of the most impressive
 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.490
that and so one of the most impressive
aspects of the last 30 years of human

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
aspects of the last 30 years of human
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290
aspects of the last 30 years of human
history has been the spectacular growth
