00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.776
&gt;&gt; Sally: I think this year's
iGEM competition is the best ever.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:14.126
The project we just heard about was amazing!

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:17.766
&gt;&gt; Dude: And that bacterial
flotation device was totally cool!

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:20.746
It's the balloon-o-genesis
module I've been looking for.

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:23.256
I want to try it with my Bacterial Balloon idea.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.676
I know it'll work.

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.456
&gt;&gt; Sally: I thought you were
done with Bacterial Balloons!

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.596
&gt;&gt; Dude: Sally, where's your curiosity?

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.736
We'll need to put the
flotation-thing-a-ma-gjiggy together

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:35.786
with the Gas-o-Matic module and this time
put some feedback program at the promoters

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:40.376
to make the devices stop...this
is SO going to work.

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:43.866
&gt;&gt; Sally: We can try to build it
when we get back to lab but some

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.236
of it looks like very specialized DNA.

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:50.196
First, we'll need a feedback
loop that works for Buddy.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:54.416
Second, the flotation module
is more than 6000 base pairs.

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.416
Didn't that team say that it works
better if these two sections are removed?

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:02.766
Maybe we should directly synthesize the shorter
flotation part with a Buddy feedback loop,

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.366
then we can hook it up to the Gas-o-Matic
module we already have in the lab.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:07.696
&gt;&gt; Dude: Now you're talking!

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:12.506
But I think I forgot how to directly synthesize
DNA...I mean we've done so many things

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.006
in the lab and I remember a lot of them but...

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:16.886
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude, we don't synthesize it.

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:18.726
We get a company to do that for us.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:19.216
&gt;&gt; Dude: Whew.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.396
So do I copy down this picture
from the board and mail it to them?

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:25.116
&gt;&gt; Sally: You could but they
wouldn't know what to do with it.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:30.926
We'll need to send them the exact DNA sequence,
and then they can string the Gs, As, Ts,

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:32.786
and Cs together in the right order.

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.045
Every DNA synthesis company
does it a little differently

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:38.216
but the chemistry is pretty standard.

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:41.876
It involves protection and
deprotection of a growing DNA chain

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:45.826
with specialized bases called
deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites.

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:47.116
&gt;&gt; Dude: Gesundheit!

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:48.286
Sorry. What's so special about them?

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:53.666
&gt;&gt; Sally: Only one base links to a DNA
chain at a time until you deprotect the end,

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.765
which then allows you to add
the next base in your sequence.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.096
&gt;&gt; Dude: That sounds like a pain.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:01:59.606
&gt;&gt; Sally: No, think about it.

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:04.856
All you have to do is attach your first base,
let's say a protected G, to some sort of polymer

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:09.925
or bead, and then when you deprotect the G
you can add a second base, how about an A?

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:14.386
Then when you deprotect that A, you can
add a third base, let's put a T there.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:14.856
&gt;&gt; Dude: Ha!

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:16.816
even I know that won't work.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.666
What if that A doesn't hook up?

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.666
Then you've got G-T instead of G-A-T.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:22.676
What good is that?

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:26.656
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude, you're smart, but so
are the chemists who worked on this.

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:30.416
There's one more step called
"capping" so that any deprotected base

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.296
that doesn't properly connect is
shut down and can't be added to.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:38.016
Those shorter pieces of DNA can be
taken out of the mix at the very end.

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.316
&gt;&gt; Dude: But won't there be a
lot of mistakes to get rid of?

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:44.626
Even if capping works half the time, you'll
be getting rid of half your sequence,

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:47.336
then half of that half...you'll
have nothing left.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:52.256
&gt;&gt; Sally: Luckily this construction
process is more like 99% efficient.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:57.266
But even so, you can't build something as
long as this 6000 base pair flotation device.

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:02.716
Most companies build a bunch of shorter
oligo nucleotides, maybe 60 base pairs long,

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:05.116
and then use PCR to stitch them together.

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:07.606
&gt;&gt; Dude: and you trust them
to do all this right?

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:12.066
&gt;&gt; Sally: They verify the final DNA by
sequencing it before they send it to you.

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:14.806
Sometimes there are problems
at one stage or another

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:19.226
but DNA synthesis is getting faster
and less expensive every year.

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:21.096
&gt;&gt; Dude: Sally this is great!

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:25.576
With your credit card and my ideas, we
can write some DNA that's completely new.

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:26.886
Race you back to lab.

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:29.326
I want to get this DNA ordered today.
