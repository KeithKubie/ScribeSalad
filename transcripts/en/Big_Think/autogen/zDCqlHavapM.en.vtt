00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 align:start position:0%
know all about time travel we're kind of
 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
know all about time travel we're kind of

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
so it's interesting to me that people
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
so it's interesting to me that people
keep<00:06:08.380><c> finding</c><00:06:08.680><c> new</c><00:06:08.830><c> variations</c><00:06:09.639><c> yeah</c><00:06:10.479><c> I</c><00:06:10.510><c> mean</c>

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
keep finding new variations yeah I mean
 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
but the best I can understand is that he
 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
but the best I can understand is that he
thinks<00:06:27.550><c> that</c><00:06:27.669><c> time</c><00:06:28.000><c> travel</c><00:06:28.270><c> is</c><00:06:28.570><c> some</c><00:06:29.200><c> kind</c><00:06:29.500><c> of</c>

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 align:start position:0%
thinks that time travel is some kind of
 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
thinks that time travel is some kind of

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
virtual reality machine where you're

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 align:start position:0%
actually it's just amassed all the data
 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.850 align:start position:0%
actually it's just amassed all the data
from<00:06:34.330><c> everything</c><00:06:34.810><c> that's</c><00:06:35.050><c> ever</c><00:06:35.169><c> happened</c><00:06:35.470><c> and</c>

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 align:start position:0%
from everything that's ever happened and
 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.890 align:start position:0%
from everything that's ever happened and
so<00:06:35.979><c> when</c><00:06:36.130><c> you</c><00:06:36.220><c> go</c><00:06:36.400><c> back</c><00:06:36.610><c> you're</c><00:06:37.150><c> creating</c><00:06:37.720><c> new</c>

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 align:start position:0%
so when you go back you're creating new
 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.830 align:start position:0%
so when you go back you're creating new
data<00:06:38.139><c> and</c><00:06:38.289><c> then</c><00:06:38.800><c> you're</c><00:06:38.950><c> it's</c><00:06:39.789><c> a</c><00:06:39.909><c> very</c><00:06:40.120><c> crazy</c>

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.290 align:start position:0%
