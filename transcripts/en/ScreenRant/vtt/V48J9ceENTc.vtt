00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.420
There's no denying just how much Netflix has
changed the game with its original series,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.530
making marathon TV sessions and binge watching
completely normal.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.680
But the streaming service's most ambitious
projects aren't without some mistakes, and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.560
you know how much we love to point them outâ€¦

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.630
So we've singled out some of our favourites
to watch for during your next binge.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.090
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Mistakes in Popular
Netflix Series.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.090
Narcos

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.410
When you set a series or film in the 1970s
or 80s, you find out fast just how much technology

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.280
has changed in the decades since.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.130
The lack of cell phones or gps is a plot point
in this look at Pablo Escobar's rise to power,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.750
but some laughably modern gadgets made their
way into the show regardless.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.400
When the main DEA Agent arrives in Colombia,
he has his passport scanned on a modern photocopier

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.650
- you can even spot the paper used to hide
the touchscreen.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.800
A xerox machine at that time would have looked
more like a printing press, but it's the compact

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560
satellite phones that put them to shame.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.480
The worst offender: an Ericsson R290, which
wasn't released until the year 2000, more

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.500
than a decade ahead of the show's setting.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.750
Jessica Jones

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.290
Marvel's alcoholic, superpowered private eye
is an expert at getting into and out of tight

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.580
spots, and finding a way past every locked
door.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.680
But when Jessica heads into a hospital emergency
room, she needs to find a disguise to fit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.740
in before getting what she's after.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
But back up: the "authorized personnel only
sign was on OUR side of the door, meaning

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.471
she was leaving the department, not heading
in.

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.210
It makes sense if the show was filmed in a
working hospital, but the writing gives the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.460
switch away.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.460
Bloodline

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
The family drama and tension of this series
all begins when a troublemaking son returns

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.799
to his childhood home - with his big brother
there to greet him.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.640
Except he doesn't arrive on the bus that he's
supposed to - or the one after it.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.830
It's a sign of the headaches he'll cause in
the coming weeks, but loses a bit of its impact

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.979
when you realize the producers only filmed
one shot, with the exact same passengers stepping

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.470
off of back-to-back buses.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.570
Maybe the show had even more hallucinations
than we thought?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.570
Daredevil

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.820
It isn't until the sixth episode of this series
that the hero Matt Murdock squares off against

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.511
the Kingpin - and it's not even face to face.

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:13.320
The pair have a tense conversation over police
walkie-talkies, which should be harder than

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320
it sounds.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.870
Two-way radios like that mean they can either
talk or listen, but they'd have to take their

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.090
finger off the call button to even hear the
other end.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.980
The sound effects pop in every once in a while,
but the two carry out the scene as if they're

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.110
talking on the phone.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.000
Probably for the best, since one interruption
or rhetorical question would make the entire

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.770
scene fall apart... if it was actually done
right.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.310
Orange is the New Black

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.280
Prison inmates can lose their cool at any
minute - a point proven when a secret cellphone

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.790
is discovered, sending the inmate using it
into a rage, taking her anger out on a washroom

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.849
stall door.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.520
It's a intense moment, but the production
didn't want things to get TOO violent.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.450
When the camera goes for a dramatic pan down
the stall, we can see the spring mounted on

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.319
the inside to keep the actual walls from getting
damage.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.099
Either that, or a heavy metal spring and duct
tape are standard issue for women's prisons.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.099
Daredevil

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.660
Not every mistake is so big, but even the
little ones are worth catching.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.040
When Matt shares a latte with his local priest,
he takes it without sugar.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.690
Probably because his super-hearing told him
that the sugar dispenser on the table was

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.690
only a prop.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.040
The priest didn't get the memo, so the audience
had to watch as he tries but fails to pour

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.070
any out, only to give up once he realizes
the mistake.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.280
House of Cards

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.780
Remember the good old days, when an angry
phone call could end with a slam, or a glass

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.690
of water thrown on a computer could result
in smoke and sparks?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.640
Apparently the makers of House of Cards think
the same rules apply.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.099
When one character is enraged at video footage
being shown on his laptop, he splashes his

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.659
drink, wrecking the monitor.

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.360
Except anyone who's ever spilled on their
laptop knows that's never the case in the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
digital age.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
The actor clearly matched the splash to the
video freezing - it's close, but still all

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.099
wrong.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.099
Bloodline

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.069
The more serious a story, the funnier the
mistakes become.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.970
Bloodline is filled with threatening characters
and scenes, but one is spoiled by a pretty

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.159
laughable mistake.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.319
When a character is getting beaten for information,
his assailant drives the point home by pressing

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.150
the barrel of his gun into his skull.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.090
Or, the barrel of his rubber gun, since it
can clearly be seen bending against the force.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.650
Nobody caught it but the viewer so no harm,
no foul.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.240
Orange is the New Black

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.129
Props are one thing, but we explained in a
previous video why giving major characters

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.169
visible tattoos can lead to some headaches
down the road.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.910
The mistake is repeated, when Piper shows
a brightly-colored fish tattooed on the back

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.550
of her neck in the pilot episode.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.749
The crew had clearly forgotten by season 2,
when the tattoo has magically vanished from

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.240
her neck completely.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240
Jessica Jones

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.840
The heroes and villains of the Avengers universe
may be no-shows in Marvel's Netflix series,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.749
but Jessica Jones still lives in the same
Cinematic Universe.

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:54.080
Or does she?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.210
When she heads to the top of Manhattan Bridge
to take in the city, Stark Tower, prominently

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.919
featured in The Avengers, is missing from
the skyline.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.550
What audiences CAN spot is the MetLife building,
the skyscraper that Stark's eye-catching tower

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.180
should be sitting on top of.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.169
It may just be a small effects mistake, but
shows that Marvel's Netflix and movie worlds

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.960
don't overlap as much as some fans hoped.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.199
Those are some of the mistakes, errors, and
accidents we spotted in hit Netflix originals,

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.659
but which of your favourites did we miss?
