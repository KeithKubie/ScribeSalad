Hi I'm Desmond Patton, I'm a new fellow
here at the Berkman Klein Center and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm a professor at the School of Social
Work at Columbia University.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.160
I'm from Gastonia North Carolina which is 
a small town outside of Charlotte

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.220
North Carolina, I'm a country boy!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.599
This year I'm really trying to understand how

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.609
communication on social media leads to
offline violence and so I'm studying a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.320
Twitter dataset of young people in Chicago to better understand how things like grief

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.490
and trauma and love and happiness all
play out on Twitter and the relationship

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.672
between that communication and offline gun violence.

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:37.760
So I started my research process in Chicago and I have been

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.210
just completely troubled by the amount of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.811
violence that happens in the city.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:45.600
And one of the ways in which that violence

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
happens or occurs is through social
media communication. And so I want to be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.480
a part of the process of ending violence
through learning how young people communicate online.
