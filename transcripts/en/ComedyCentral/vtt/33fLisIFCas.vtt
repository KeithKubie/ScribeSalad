00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.571
- I'm from Chicago, man,
you know,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.240
where I was raised mostly.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.876
There's a big gang culture,
don't know if you heard,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.146
and growing up, man, I looked
up to, like,

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.281
the wrong kind of people,
'cause I was just, like,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.217
one of those guys who wanted to
fit in with what I thought

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.053
was cool, and who I looked up
to was gangsters, man,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.488
gangsters and pimps.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.223
They were the coolest people to
me, man.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.792
They had, like, cars and shit,
right, with women, money.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.627
They the coolest outfits.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.429
Pimps had the limp, and I'm
like, "Are they hurtin'?

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.998
"Naw, nigga.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.434
That's just swag."

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.602
You know what I mean?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.936
And it was cool to me, man.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.905
I sort of looked up to that.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.907
My big cousin, he was, like,
the head of some gangsters,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.176
and it was so cool to watch
him do shit,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.145
and I was like, "I want to be
down with that,"

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.779
and I liked fighting too.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:54.947
I loved to watch fighting, but
I didn't know how.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.016
I had never been in a fight.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.519
The most I had ever done at
this point was be in the mirror

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.254
like, "Whoa, whoa.."

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.623
[laughter]

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.126
If that fist come, I'm gonna be
like, "No."

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.595
You're just stupid, 'cause you
don't know how fast fists move.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.130
Fists move fast.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.132
I don't know if anybody has
ever been hit.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:14.500
But it moves fast, and then
another one comes right after

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.968
like, "This is my brother."

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.539
You know what I mean?
Like, it's crazy.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.674
But I'm--this--my story is
about how I lost

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.509
my first two fights trying to
be down.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:28.014
And I remember it like it was
yesterday, because, you know,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.483
we all remember the things that
depress us the most.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:33.152
[laughter]

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.454
I remember when my cousins,
they parked their cars

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.657
outside and walked up to my
house, and they were like,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.493
"Yo, Chris, you want to walk to
the corner store with us?"

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:44.664
And my cousin, real thug, 6'5",
tattoos all over the place,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.132
tattoo tear in his face.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.700
He's not a killer.
He's just a crier.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:51.170
But the nigga is real, you
know.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:53.372
And he was hanging out with
so many gangsters, like,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.641
six other dudes, and they were
all gangsters that everybody

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:58.144
knew, and they wanted me to
walk to the store with them.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.179
And I'm like, "Hell, yeah,
dawg; I'ma walk."

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.515
And I was so excited and
terrified,

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:04.317
because these were dangerous
people.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.519
And I don't know if you've
walked somewhere

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.020
with somebody you scared of,

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.989
but you don't walk
like a normal person.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.924
I know it's one foot in front
of the other.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.993
I know how walking works.

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:15.861
But when you're around somebody
carrying a pistol

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:18.864
bigger than your head, you
start thinking about shit,

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.067
so I'm walking the streets,
like, one and two and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.668
one and two and one and two
and...

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.270
"What's up, dawg?"

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.505
I'm saying "What's up?"
to people I don't know.

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.107
My cousin's smacking my head
now.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.042
"Stop speaking to people you
don't know, nigga.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.712
What's wrong with you?"
And then his friend was like,

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.080
"Yo, what's wrong with your
cuz?"

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.281
He's like, "He retarded.
He's only..."

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.416
[laughter]

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.551
So I finally got cool, right?

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.219
I finally got comfortable.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.954
And it was a long--long walk,
so I finally, like,

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.422
"Oh, man, I'm walking with the
coolest guys

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.857
"in the neighborhood, man.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.225
I'm on my quest to be a
gangster."

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:48.127
That's right.
I was on a quest...

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.729
[laughter]

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.564
To be a gangster.
That's what I wanted to be.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.300
And then as--right before we
get to the corner store, right,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.136
this guy--he was about 20 years
old; I was 14 at the time--

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.805
he walked right into me full
shoulder, pow,

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:02.241
right in the middle of my
chest, boom, hit me, right?

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:03.709
And I knew he did it on
purpose.

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.077
But see, I have two parents.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.748
I was raised right, so
initially,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.450
I wanted to be like, "Excuse
me," but I...

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:15.821
[laughter]

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:17.490
I felt like this wasn't the
right environment

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.959
for manners, motherfucker.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.429
So I--so I didn't say that, but
what I did say was, "Huh!"

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.165
Which is not better.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.800
I was like a weak-ass James
Brown.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.101
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:30.770
"Huh. You gonna push me?
Huh."

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.938
[laughter]

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:34.774
And--and that sound was very
loud.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.910
The guy was confused, and he
thought I had said something,

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:39.612
so he turned around, and he
said,

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.315
"What the hell you say, bitch?"

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.283
Now, we're outside on the south
side of Chicago.

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.118
There's a bunch of people all
around,

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.120
and when somebody says "bitch"
like that

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:52.658
in the hood, everyone stops to
see

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.493
who the bitch is, you know?

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.162
[laughter]

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:59.832
'Cause it--and so people
stopped that had no business.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.033
There was a guy digging in the
trash.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.535
He was like, "Who the bitch?"

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.437
[laughter]

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.871
There was somebody in the store
that popped his head out like,

00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:07.506
"Who the bitch?"

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.275
One dude was riding a bike
minding his business.

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.143
Scrrrr!
"Who the bitch? Hold on."

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:12.978
"Let me get off the bike and
park this motherfucker.

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:16.148
I need to see who the bitch
is."

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.317
[laughter]

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.453
My cousins, they were not
phased at all.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.888
They just looked at me, 'cause
all of those gangsters knew

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:24.557
they weren't the bitch.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.158
[laughter]

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.660
And I was like, "Holy shit.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.295
"I've never talked shit to
somebody

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.996
"in front of people before in
public.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.300
This is my first time dealing
with this."

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.903
So I was like,

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.839
"That is not my name."

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.507
[laughter]

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.844
That is not the way to talk to
a grown gangster

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.879
with an alligator tattooed on
his face.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.647
[laughter]

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.850
I said that shit as if I was
gonna pull out my ID like,

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:54.487
"Look, my name is Christopher
Jarell Redd.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.189
And ain't no 'bitch' in there,
so..."

00:05:57.222 --> 00:06:01.193
[laughter]

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:03.763
I--I could tell it wasn't the
right way to respond

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.364
to this man by his face.

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.766
He was confused.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.034
He was like, "The fuck--what
the..."

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.705
The alligator on his face was
confused with him.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:15.775
And he slapped my hand, right,
'cause I was pointing at him.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.243
And he smacked my hand.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.044
Now, what I wanted to do was
be like...

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:20.846
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.049
I wanted to do something cool,
but what came out was, "Mm."

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:25.251
"That ain't hurt."

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.752
Which it did.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:28.053
And you could visually tell it
hurt,

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:30.856
because my face said, "Ohh."

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.026
[laughter]

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.761
And he was like, "Yo, never
mind all this shit, man.

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:38.063
I'm about to fuck you up."

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:43.068
And then I was like, "Oh, no,
no.

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:44.870
No."

00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:46.272
[laughter]

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.908
I say that in my head.
I was like, "No."

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.709
But I realized I hadn't spoken
yet,

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:52.878
and my cousin was like, "Dawg,
you got to prove yourself

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.280
in front of all these
gangsters."

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.248
So I knew I had to say
something, right,

00:06:56.281 --> 00:07:00.820
so I was like, "Ahh...
that is not the outcome,"

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.955
which is terrible.

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:04.757
That is not how you respond to
people.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.125
I said that shit like I had

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:07.927
some type of bar graph behind
me.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.063
"If you look here, this is you,
this is me,

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:12.898
"this is the outcome,
and they're very different.

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.769
Class dismissed."

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:19.071
I knew it wasn't enough, 'cause
my cousin was looking at me

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.340
like, "What the fuck is wrong
with you?"

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:23.809
He didn't say that, but his
eyes said it.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:25.778
His eyes was like...

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.413
[laughter]

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.081
So I knew I had to follow it
up, so I was like,

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:30.449
"You know what?
I'm not good at this.

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:32.117
"I'm gonna just say what he
said,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.786
'cause it sounded real
good, and..."

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.256
So I was like, "No, I'ma fuck
you"--

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.793
and before I could say "up"...

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:43.996
[laughter]

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.966
He hit me directly in my
throat.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.634
[laughter]

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.303
Like, direct--it was a direct
line to my throat.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:54.206
My Adam's apple checked out,
nigga.

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:56.208
It--I don't know if you've been
hit directly in your throat,

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.843
but a couple of things happen.

00:07:57.876 --> 00:07:59.011
For one, your throat says,
"Fuck it,"

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.846
and it just closes forever.

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.548
Your spit is, like, gets
suicidal.

00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:05.484
It's like, "Good-bye, I don't
need to be in the mouth."

00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:07.853
Dawg, I got hit so hard in my
throat

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:11.357
that I had a limp, and that is
not how science works.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.526
I was like, "Ooh, nigga, I'm a
pimp now.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.294
I'm halfway to my goal."

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:17.329
[laughter]

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:18.964
It made no sense, and I farted
a little bit.

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:20.332
I did.
I farted...

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:21.634
[laughter]

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.502
Yo, I've never been hit so hard
I fart.

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:24.970
I mean, but my throat was
closed,

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:26.071
so the air had to go somewhere.

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:28.073
I don't know.

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.342
IT was very embarrassing, man.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:33.312
But what was more embarrassing
is, this was outside, man,

00:08:33.345 --> 00:08:36.181
so people from across the
street saw a very different

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:37.816
fight than the fight that went
down.

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:39.652
You know what I mean?

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.353
They're like, "Yo, yo, dawg,
what happened over there, bro?

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:42.821
That was crazy over there.
What happened?"

00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:44.189
"All right, so let me tell you.

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:46.058
"So--so the bigger dude was
like,

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:48.260
"'I'ma fuck you up,' right?

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.663
And for whatever reason..."

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.399
[laughter]

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.702
"The little dude was like,
'I'ma fuck you.'"

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.939
[laughter]

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.411
"Like, why would you say that?

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.112
"So the bigger dude hit him in
the throat,

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:08.847
"saved his asshole for another
day.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.951
You know what I'm saying?"

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.520
And that was the story that
went around the hood for, like,

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:16.855
six months at least.

00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:19.391
And I was like, "That's not how
it went down."

00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:20.893
My cousin was very embarrassed.

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:22.561
He had a reputation to
maintain.

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:24.363
And I got my ass whupped before
the whole hood.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.298
He grabbed me and took me home
under my arm.

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.367
There's no way to keep your
masculinity when you being

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.235
grabbed under your arm by a
grown man."

00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:32.104
I'm like, "Let me go!"
He was like, "Make me."

00:09:32.137 --> 00:09:33.939
I'm like, "You know I can't,"
you know.

00:09:33.972 --> 00:09:37.209
[laughter]

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:38.911
Don't be...
[laughs]

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:40.746
So he threw me in the house.
You know what I mean?

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:43.082
He was like "Chris, stay out
these goddamned streets.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.783
"This shit ain't for you, dawg,
all right?

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:46.452
"Go to school
Be somebody.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.253
"But this shit ain't for you.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:51.423
"You got hit directly in your
throat, nigga,

00:09:51.456 --> 00:09:54.593
and you farted in front of
everybody."

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:59.398
[laughter]

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.100
And I was like, "Yo, keep it
down."

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.901
"From who, nigga?
Everybody saw it."

00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:07.606
[laughter]

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.108
And then he closed the door,
and I was like,

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.576
"No, I've got to avenge
myself,"

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.945
but he was gone already.

00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:14.947
And usually, you know, when
something like that happens,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.649
you're like, "You know what?
This isn't for me. He's right.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.617
I'ma go--I'ma go do something
else."

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.419
But I was a hardheaded kid with
goals.

00:10:20.452 --> 00:10:22.421
And I was like, "You know what?

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:23.689
"I'm gonna learn how to fight.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:24.957
"I'm gonna redeem myself.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.592
This is what I'm about to do."

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.360
So the whole year until they
asked me to fight again,

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:30.362
I was practicing, or I was just
fighting friends.

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:32.131
We would just be boxing and
wrestling in the yard and shit

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.766
getting my hands up.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.000
I would watch Bruce Lee,
because I didn't know what a

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.336
boxing class was yet.

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:39.471
Bruce Lee was the baddest
motherfucker around, dawg.

00:10:39.504 --> 00:10:40.839
You watch his tapes, he was
beating

00:10:40.872 --> 00:10:42.474
15 people at the same time,

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:45.444
people waiting in line to get
their ass whupped

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:47.312
by Bruce Lee, and I was like,
"Hell yeah.

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.048
I want to be that good."
I would practice all his moves.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.350
And I was like, "Yo, whenever I
get in a fight again,

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:53.185
I'm gonna be ready."

00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:54.486
And it was a year later when my
cousin asked me

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.388
to come fight
with them, right?

00:10:56.421 --> 00:10:58.490
He was like, "Yo, I heard from
a couple people, man,

00:10:58.523 --> 00:11:01.226
"that you got some hands now;
you've been in some fights.

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:02.861
"Listen, we've got to handle
some shit, man,

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:05.030
"me and some other dudes;
you want to ride with us?"

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:06.331
I was like, "Hell, yeah, man,

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:08.634
'cause I got to redeem
myself."

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:11.537
And my cousin was like, "Don't
ever say that again."

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.041
[laughter]

00:11:16.074 --> 00:11:18.477
"Nigga, you are not a coupon."

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.978
[laughter]

00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.547
And he was right.
I'm not a coupon.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.017
I'm...he's very right about
that.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.518
[laughs]

00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.721
So I jumped in the truck,
and it was me,

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:31.757
my cousin, and the five other
dudes that was with us

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.859
when I got my ass whupped the
first time,

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:37.529
so most of the conversation was
about how I got my ass whupped

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:39.898
the first time, which sucks,

00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:41.700
'cause they're like, "And this
bitch-ass nigga..."

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:45.838
I'm like, "I'm right here,
and I have a name."

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.773
At one point, I was like, "Hey,
y'all,

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.876
this isn't good for morale,"
and they didn't know what...

00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:52.845
[laughter]

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.546
And they didn't know what
"morale" meant.

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:57.182
They...they thought it was a
chick

00:11:57.215 --> 00:11:59.451
that wasn't giving me no
pussy.

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:01.053
So then they started talking
shit

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:02.621
about that for ten minutes
like,

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:04.556
"Oh, morale ain't givin' this
nigga no pussy.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:06.458
Ahh."

00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.093
I'm like, "Man, I wish y'all
didn't drop out

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:10.963
of eighth grade."

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.097
But I just let it happen.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.766
Wasn't nothing I could do.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.701
Now, in Chicago, we used to
fight in these, like,

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.970
old lots or these old fields so
that police wouldn't

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:20.372
lock you up for, you know,
extended amounts of time,

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:23.308
like they do black people in
America,

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:24.977
so we could fight and then go
home.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.779
You know what I'm saying?
It's before, like, shooting.

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.380
Well, there was still shooting,
but these guys

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:30.115
would fight it out, right?

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:31.917
And so we rolled up to this
field.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.153
It was my first time being in
this field and shit, right?

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.722
And I'm looking around.
He's like, "Get out the car."

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.290
And the Sun is set, and there's
flowers.

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:39.458
I'm like, "Yo, this is a
romantic place

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.593
"to get your ass whupped.

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:44.763
Why are we fighting on an R.
Kelly set?

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:48.433
I don't want to get knocked out
and fall in love, nigga."

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:50.102
I didn't say--this was all in
my head, though.

00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:52.004
I wasn't saying nothing.
I learned from my mistakes.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.605
I was like, "I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna say nothing.

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:55.507
I'm gonna be tough the whole
time."

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.343
So I was grabbing my dick way
longer than I should.

00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:00.779
I'm just walking around like,
"Yo, what's good?"

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.347
At one point, the gangsters was
like,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.615
"Yo, what's wrong with your
dick?"

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:05.284
"Nothin', nigga."

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:09.922
And I slowly...
[laughs]

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.356
He was like, "You've got to
make sure it's there?"

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:14.159
I'm like, "Shut the fuck up."

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:16.128
[laughs]

00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:19.131
So we waited; it's me and six
other dudes, right?

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:24.436
Now, two cars pull up, right,
two four-door Sedans.

00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:28.373
There was 20 dudes in these two
four-door Sedans.

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:31.543
And I don't know if y'all do
math quick,

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:35.848
but 20 dudes cannot fit
comfortably

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.616
in two four-door Sedans.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:40.619
That meant that these gangsters
rolled to this gang fight

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:44.389
lapped up, which is not a
gangster way to travel.

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.358
That means that y'all were
riding like,

00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.726
"Yo, we gonna fuck 'em up.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:49.127
"You know what I'm saying,
dawg?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.863
You know what I'm saying?"

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:52.297
And the dude's like, "Yeah,
yeah, but can you lift your

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.498
butt, 'cause you thick, dawg.

00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:57.502
Why you twerkin' on me, cuz?"

00:13:57.535 --> 00:13:59.671
20 dudes.
Y'all didn't have one more car?

00:13:59.704 --> 00:14:02.341
[laughter]

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:05.544
But I ain't say nothin'.

00:14:05.577 --> 00:14:07.312
And they pulled up.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:11.183
20 dudes clown-car'd out the
fuckin' cars.

00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:12.851
And they stretched along this
field.

00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:15.020
The Sun was behind them, and
for a split second,

00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:16.655
I was like, "Are these niggers
the heroes?"

00:14:16.688 --> 00:14:18.390
'Cause..."
[laughter]

00:14:18.423 --> 00:14:21.193
"They look like the heroes of
the story."

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:23.028
But I ain't sayin' nothin',
man.

00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:25.831
And as they walked towards us,
everybody was doing their--

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.199
whatever they do.

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:29.001
I was sitting there holding
my dick.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.335
I think I was holding it with
two hands,

00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:33.171
which is so weird to do.

00:14:33.204 --> 00:14:34.873
[laughter]

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:38.043
Like, "Don't kick me here,"
you know.

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:40.345
Then the guy in the middle,
he was like,

00:14:40.378 --> 00:14:44.549
"Yeah, man, hey, yo, we about
to fuck y'all"--

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:47.953
and before he could say "up,"
I was like, "Not again."

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:50.055
I ran.

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:53.392
Which had to be weird for the
guys, here me say "Not again."

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.594
'Cause that--'cause who does
that?

00:14:55.627 --> 00:14:57.729
Who does that ever in life?

00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:00.532
"Not again."

00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:02.200
But I ran so fast.

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:03.969
Everybody was shouting, like,
"Where's he going?"

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:05.570
You know what I mean?
They all had questions.

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:07.072
I ran up to the guy in the
middle.

00:15:07.105 --> 00:15:08.807
I jumped, and I realized he's
very tall.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.877
So I had to--so I had to bring
it up here, bow,

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.446
and I swung, and I hit, and I
connected to his chin, right.

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:16.548
Now, hitting somebody when they
don't deserve it,

00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:18.150
it's an asshole thing to do,

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:20.986
but when you hit somebody
that's trying to kill you,

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:24.556
ooh, it feels great, and I was
like, "Oh!"

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.558
Fireworks went off in my head.
It was amazing.

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:28.927
I was like, "I'm the king of
everything."

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.495
I saw his spit fly.

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:33.765
I was like, "I know what that's
like," you know?

00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:35.600
[laughter]

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:37.569
It was a solid punch, man,
you know,

00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:39.071
It was great, and I was
celebrating.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.606
I'm like, "Yeah, I'm finally a
gangster."

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:44.343
In my mind I'm saying this, and
as I'm saying this,

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:47.512
four fists hit me at the same
time.

00:15:47.545 --> 00:15:49.614
And I don't know if you've been
hit in unison,

00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:51.817
but the shit hurts a lot.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.653
One felt like it came from God
like, "You shouldn't be here."

00:15:54.686 --> 00:15:57.122
You know, like...
[laughter]

00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:59.825
And as I got hit, at the same
time, I yelled out,

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:01.860
"Y'all are supposed to wait,
like Bruce Lee."

00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:02.995
Like, that's...

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.030
[laughter]

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:07.432
Yeah, I yelled that dumb shit
out, yeah.

00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:08.967
Yeah.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.702
And I fell to the ground.

00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:12.304
I think I knocked out for about
30, 40 seconds, right?

00:16:12.337 --> 00:16:14.673
I came to, my face fuckin'
hurtin',

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:17.843
pulsating everywhere,
but I looked around,

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.978
and I noticed that nobody was
fighting,

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:23.215
because everybody was laughing
at what the fuck I just said.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.017
[laughter]

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.786
This grown gangsters holding
guns like,

00:16:27.819 --> 00:16:31.390
"This nigga thinks he's Bruce
Lee.

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.558
Ahh!"

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.194
Yo, they're reenacting what
just happened like,

00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:40.065
"Who am I? Ahh!"

00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:41.666
Have you ever seen a good
conversation,

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.702
and you try to laugh your way
into it?

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:45.737
That's what I did with this.
I'm like, "Ha-ha-ha, right?

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.240
That was crazy, huh?"

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.709
They pushed me away like, "Shut
your bitch-ass up.

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:52.177
Ahh!"

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.846
And after ten minutes of them
laughing at me,

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:58.583
pointing, laughing, reenacting,
and laughing,

00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:00.419
the gangster from the other
gang was like,

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:02.020
"You know what, dawg?

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:05.524
Ooh, yo, that was--that was
funny as hell."

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:06.658
[laughter]

00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:08.193
"Hey, dawg, you know what?

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:09.528
I forgot what the fuck we was
fighting about."

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.229
[laughter]

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:13.165
"Hey, dawg, let's go to
McDonald's, grab some food,

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.000
"go get some drinks, man, and
just chill,

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:17.269
and let's talk about your
cousin some more, nigga."

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:19.071
[laughter]

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.039
And all I'm saying is, "I'm
bringing communities together,

00:17:21.072 --> 00:17:23.208
so what the fuck are y'all
doing?"

00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:26.578
[cheers and applause]

00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:28.847
My name is Chris Redd.
Thank y'all so much.
