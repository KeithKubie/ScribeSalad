00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:04.337
- But I was on the side and
looking at these hooligans

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.873
and it was in the middle
of one of their sets

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.209 line:92%
and, what's his name, Ian?

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.277 line:92%
- Ivan.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.447
- Ivan, and he goes "I see
a little kid over there"

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.983
and there's a kid in the hot
tub.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.219
And he goes "bring that child to
me".

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.390 line:92%
And they lift this child up,

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.093
and the child crowd surfs to the
front.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.662
Can't be more that five, six
years old.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:33.066 line:92%
Little Latino, innocent child,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:36.569
eyes big, bright like
a fucking Disney show.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:40.907
And she's looking around, and
he goes "what's your name?"

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.342 line:92%
and she goes, I don't know...

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.143 line:92%
Whatever her name is.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:48.681 line:92%
And he goes "do you ever curse?"

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.417 line:92%
and she's like (gibberish).

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.587
And he goes, "well today
you're gonna curse".

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.957
And I remember he goes to the
little kid,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.792 line:92%
"are you ready to say this?"

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:00.827 line:92%

And the kid was horrified
and that's when I realized,

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.408 line:92%
what did we get ourselves into?

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:20.746 line:92%
- Yeah.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.582 line:92%
This is Fu Manchu Hatfield,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:26.018

Jim Breuer on the show.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.699 line:92%
Just having a fucking time.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:40.533 line:92%
- Thank you though.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.468 line:92%
- Drinking coffee.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.303 line:92%
- Crown and king nothing.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.338 line:92%
- Playing Metallica.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.340
Fu Manchu Hetfield, it's just
fucking--

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:51.077
Fu Manchu, you don't have a
problem when they cut the hair?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.179
I was thrown at first a little
bit.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.113 line:92%
- [Jim] I was too.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.247 line:92%
- But then I was fine with it.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.182
- I just remember Alice in
Chains on their unplugged

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.450 line:92%
the bassist had on his guitar,

00:01:57.483 --> 00:01:58.985
friends don't let friends give
haircuts

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.254
'cause Metallica was in the
audience.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.788
- Well they made you
deal with a lot at once.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.824
They cut their hair,
and they started making

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.959
three and a half, four minute
rock songs.

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:07.793 line:92%
- Yes.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:08.828 line:92%
- And that was a lot.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.863
You were like oh, you
start getting worried,

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.732
you're like, is this
about to become Bon Jovi?

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.368
Where they went from like the,
I thought they were so cool,

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.802 line:92%
to like music for my mom.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:17.770 line:92%
- Yeah.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.172
- And I was worried
that Metallica was gonna

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.007 line:92%
pull this in some way.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.110
Guns N' Roses got out
of the game quick enough

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.978 line:92%
they didn't have time to get old

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.281
and change their music really
together.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.482
you were like oh shit
it's gonna be the change,

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.885
but they hung in there
man and the music's solid.

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:33.886
- Every album they put out
you're like

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.888
fuck they still got it,
it's great, every time.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.691
I remember getting Death
Magnetic early,

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.460
and like super excited, that's
the last time it was a CD.

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:43.196
'cause everything after
that was like download

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.032
but I remember getting, Vic
Garcia and my old roommate

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.101
got me Death Magnetic from a
guy he knew at Warner Brothers.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.770
And I remember listening
to it and being like

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.039
this is fucking awesome, I loved
it.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.207 line:92%
Gave it to De Rosa.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.775
- They're still cool man,
they're still fucking cool.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:03:00.179
- I love the new album more
than...

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:04.250
To me it's the greatest
rock album in 30 years.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:07.253
Not Metallica, greatest
rock album in 30 years.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.754
- You went on the road with
them.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:09.621 line:92%
- Yeah.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:10.456
- You just got off the road with
them.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.757
- Just got off the road with
them.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.393
- Fucking awesome, what I
love even more than anything

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:16.529 line:92%
is you also do a Lars.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.999
Those are one of those
impressions where I'm like,

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.268 line:92%
how do I get him to do Lars?

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.136 line:92%
- It's easy,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.508
he was the one that
helped me through this.

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:34.814
First of all, the whole
thing happened where I got

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:38.818 line:92%
a text from Hetfield last March.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.521
And James is always, when they
ask me to

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:44.190 line:92%
do things he's very vague.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.693
So he's in Europe touring and he
went,

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:51.831
"hey would you be interested in
doing

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.699 line:92%
"some type of tour with us?"

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:56.969 line:92%
and I was like, oh my god.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:58.671 line:92%
- Yeah, what?

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.172
- And I immediately, I
probably geeked out Luta

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.808
and I'm like dude, I'll fucking
kill,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.210 line:92%
I'll do whatever.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:05.044
- I'll murder for you I love
you.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.647
- And he went, don't get excited
it's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.351
not really standup it's
more of something else.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.352 line:92%
- Alright.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:14.787
- And I haven't talked
to the rest of the band.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.188 line:92%
Okay.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:18.891
Two weeks later he sends me
ideas,

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:24.063
and the ideas are blasting
t-shirts into the crowd.

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.431 line:92%
- I'm not off-board yet.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:29.335
I'm still having this
conversation with Hetfield.

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.037
- You're happy with a t-shirt
gun?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.571
- If Hetfield brings
up t-shirt guns with me

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:33.906 line:92%
I'm going, continue.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.876
- Right, maybe there's a
hardwired Harry

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:41.180
that roams the crowd
or in the parking lot.

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:42.014 line:92%
And I'm going--

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:42.915 line:92%
- You're a mascot now.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:46.285
- He goes it's a fur
suit, here's the thing,

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:49.155
very breathable when you're on
the inside.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.657
- Before you get excited,
you're wearing a burlap head.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.662
- We're about to unveil the
magadon Metallica mascot,

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.397 line:92%
you're gonna be inside.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.366
- Yeah you're that golf
cart guy that drives

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.935
while everyone hits the ball at
you.

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:08.608
So he's throwing these
ideas, so I throw him ideas

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:12.312 line:92%
and I don't hear from him.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.382
I go, oh well this ain't
happening.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:19.719
And May comes, now it's
May and I'm at a gig

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.455
and I get a call from his
manager,

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:26.392
"hey man this is Mark, are
you round this Sunday?"

00:05:28.293 --> 00:05:30.162 line:92%
I go "yeah"

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.631
"matter of fact I'm alone in New
Jersey"

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.633
and went "I'll come to your
house".

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.369
And I went, "you're
gonna come to my house?"

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.938
- I always imagined
Metallica helicopters in

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.272 line:92%
anyone that they work with.

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:41.273 line:92%
- It was sorta like that.

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:43.709
- What's funny, even through
telling this,

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:47.713
is him reaching out to you
and saying don't get excited.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:51.650
There's so many comedians
and people in the world

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.652 line:92%
who view you on that level,

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:57.256
to say Jim Breuer just fucking
texted me.

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.458
And then you have a thing
where you've texted a guy,

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:00.760
you're like I reached out and he
goes,

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.161
ah James's probably busy he just
probably

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.130
didn't want to get back to me or
whatever.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.699
You're put in such a
weird flipped up position.

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:08.667
- Yeah, it's like Judah
you just feel all your

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.668 line:92%
momentum against you.

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.137
Where you're like, oh
fuck what, yeah dude,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.138 line:92%
I'll talk to you.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.206 line:92%
What you want to talk to me?

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.008
I'll call you right now, I love
you.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.576
- There's 20 people you walked
by there

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:18.644
and we're like oh my god wish
that guy

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.212
would talk to me for five
seconds.

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:21.480
You're going, I'm sorry
can't talk right now,

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:23.749
I have to keep my line
clear James might call me.

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.352
- Before the show, I
tensed up like a fucking

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:29.722
Prairie Dog in a Hawk
screech when I heard Jim

00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:30.790 line:92%
laughing with Lou down the hall.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.425
And I was like, that's fucking
Jim Breuer.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.293
I've never met him I was like,
"I'm Dan".

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.995
It's just like one of those
things where it's like--

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:36.829 line:92%
- I almost had to slap you.

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:37.997 line:92%
- Yeah.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.865
Jay's looking at me like
fucking pull it together dude.

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:41.233 line:92%
I'm like, okay.

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:43.602
- And so this guy Mark
comes into my house.

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:47.039 line:92%
And I got all my ideas lined up.

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:49.675 line:92%
- Do you have an easel?

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.944 line:92%
- Oh yeah, I got video ideas--

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.379
I got easels
- He's got PowerPoint.

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.681
I got everything, I got a whole
notepad.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.150 line:92%
So if he doesn't like this idea,

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:01.120
I got five other ones that are
gonna work.

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:02.922 line:92%
And he literally was like

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.658
"hey Jim how you doing, yeah I'm
in town"

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.426
and I was just thrown off
that he was at my house

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.862
in the middle of nowhere, New
Jersey.

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:12.398
I know he lives in San Fran,
like what is he doing here?

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.400 line:92%
So he goes in my kitchen and he

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.535 line:92%
opens up his laptop computer.

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:18.871 line:92%
And he's like okay so we start

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:22.675
in September in Madison,
Wisconsin...

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.845
And then we go all the way to
March.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.146
And it's basically like seven
days,

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.648
and I know you do a residency
and there's

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:34.353
only one date at The Paramount
that you'd have to change.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:36.255
I don't know if you
talked with your wife Dee

00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:38.457 line:92%
but are you into this?

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.758 line:92%
- That's so funny.

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.961 line:92%
- And I went "well yeah".

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.497
And he went "great" and
shuts it and he goes

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.733
"we're announcing this tomorrow
in Stern and Rolling Stone

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:49.168 line:92%
"and we have your name in it,

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:52.071
"we'll worry about
developing what the show is

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.073
"and I'll talk to your agent and
we'll

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.641
"figure out finances and all
that

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:57.209 line:92%
"as long as you're into it."

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:59.845 line:92%
And I went okay.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.680 line:92%
And before I can even think,

00:08:01.713 --> 00:08:02.882 line:92%
the next day was like bang,

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.917
Jim Breuer going on tour with
Metallica.

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:08.153
- That's the way they talk
about shadow government.

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:09.221 line:92%
They come in and they go

00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:11.590
Mr. Breuer you are now the
president of Venezuela.

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:13.092 line:92%
We will announce it tomorrow.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.760
On the news they're
like, a brutal takeover's

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:17.897
happened in Venezuela Jim
Breuer is now the president.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.331
And you're like, that guy
was in my fucking kitchen,

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:22.034
he knew my wife's name,
he fucking helicoptered in

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:23.702
I don't know what the fuck is
happening.

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:25.070
- He knew about your
gigs at The Paramount.

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:26.805
- He knows that I threw away the
band,

00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:28.607
I don't know if they
hired him to fuck with me

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.508 line:92%
I don't know what's going on.

00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:30.709
- What about my thing at The
Paramount?

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.445 line:92%
He goes, it's been handled.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:35.515
Mr. Breuer there in no more
Paramount

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:39.519
and you are also the
leader of 330,000 people.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.154 line:92%
Have a good night.

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.023 line:92%
That's some fucking crazy shit.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.925 line:92%
- Have a good night.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.428
- And I wracked my brain
trying to figure it out.

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:50.963
- What is the first day of
showing up

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.431 line:92%
for Metallica school like?

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.868 line:92%
You know what I mean?

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.971
You have your nicest shirt on
and

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:01.774
you're like hello Lars,
hello James, hello Kirk.

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.310
- I'll tell you exactly how it
went down.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.211 line:92%
Here's the thing I show up,

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:08.714
no first of all before it even
went down

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:12.919 line:92%
they fly me to Switzerland--

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.889 line:92%
- They are Metalocalypse.

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:20.326
- To see what the stage looks
like.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.096
- Something any comic
could have handled with

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:26.399 line:92%
a simple cell phone picture.

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:28.734 line:92%
Somebody else tells you come

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:29.768 line:92%
somewhere stupid for soundcheck,

00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:31.604 line:92%
like, I'll just trust you guys

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.105 line:92%
have a microphone that works.

00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:38.110 line:92%
Anyone can figure this part out.

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:39.345 line:92%
- Worse case scenario I'll ask

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:40.746 line:92%
you to bump the mic volume.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.414 line:92%
- You want to see if your shirts

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.016
blend in with the backdrop too
much.

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:46.752
- Mr. Breuer we are going to
bring you to

00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:49.021
the Metallica facility in the
Swiss Alps,

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:50.623 line:92%
it's where they all train.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.725
There's Lars in a pool just
drumming

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:57.463 line:92%
with a Wolverine mask.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:01.033
- He's got nodes all over
him just taking mechanics.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:04.436
- James is being flushed out
with fresh sheep's blood.

00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:08.708
- To heal, whatever he
basses, he destroys.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.747
- Dude there's different
rooms like Xavier Manor.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.949
Trujillo is hitting 13
hundred pounds of pressure

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:21.320
on each string, whatever
he strums, he destroys.

00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:24.156
- So they take you to fucking
Switzerland,

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:25.691 line:92%
just to show you the stage.

00:10:25.724 --> 00:10:30.730
- And I meet all the
production and I don't know

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.932
what I'm doing, what am I doing
here?

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.670
- That's every comic at any gig
that

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.371 line:92%
isn't in a fucking mall.

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:41.206 line:92%
We're like, what am I?

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:43.308 line:92%
Did you guys mis-hire me?

00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:44.143 line:92%
Why am I here?

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.712
- I'm gonna parallel this to
you,

00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:50.582
when I joined the first
show I did with Korn at all

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.184
was in a small place in North
Carolina

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:53.152 line:92%
called The Ballroom Blitz tours,

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.187
so it was like thousand seat
places,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.590
some were a couple of thousand
but for

00:10:58.623 --> 00:10:59.425 line:92%
the most part it was small.

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:00.526 line:92%
This was a small one,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.394 line:92%
it was the second day on tour,

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:03.128 line:92%
I joined the second day.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:03.929
When I get there, the opening
band is on

00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:06.732
who as you know ended up opening
my

00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:09.068
Comedy Central Special,
become dear friends,

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.370 line:92%
2Cents.

00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:12.805 line:92%
- [Dan] 2Cents yeah.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.507
- They were on stage,
Adam the lead singer is

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.745
a great front man and he's
bleeding, actively on stage.

00:11:19.778 --> 00:11:21.380
And I didn't know their music
before,

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:23.382 line:92%
and they're going for it.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:25.317 line:92%
I'm so intimidated and they go,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.518
you just go up in between them
and

00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.787
it's just for comedy,
while they set up for Korn.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.990
And I go, I don't think
that's going to work.

00:11:32.023 --> 00:11:32.958
At that moment if they would
have said,

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.460 line:92%
you want to go home to your mom,

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:39.498 line:92%
I would have went yeah I do.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:43.502
That particular show, my buddy
John whose in the military

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:44.570 line:92%
was stationed out there,

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.004
he just happened to be able to
go with.

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:48.073
And something about just
having a friend there also,

00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:50.275
was like I'm gonna go
give it a whirl dude.

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:53.545
Almost like I'll play to you
if no-ones paying attention

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:55.581
we'll laugh at how much this
just sucks.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.916
But I was nervous as shit,
but you do, you walk in

00:11:57.949 --> 00:12:00.652
and everyone even members of
Korn,

00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:04.089
I'd be like I'm Jay I'm
the comic (mumbles) goes,

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:05.691 line:92%
we have a comic?

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:06.692 line:92%
- [Dan] Oh dear.

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:07.793 line:92%
- [Jim] Yes.

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.628 line:92%
- So you show up in Switzerland,

00:12:09.661 --> 00:12:12.464
and is this basically where the
whole tour

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:14.333
is learning how to build
and take down the stage?

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.167
- No, they're in the middle of
the tour

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.869 line:92%
this is one of their last shows.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.337
- So they're gonna come off
this,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.938
rest for a little bit
and go back on with you?

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:21.240 line:92%
- Right.

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:23.575 line:92%
- Living fucking on the road.

00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:24.710 line:92%
- Yes.

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:25.778 line:92%
- They take breaks though right?

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.212
They go out for a stretch and
then--

00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:29.515
- Yes, but this is the end of
their tour

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:31.250 line:92%
and there's only two days left.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:33.152 line:92%
So I fly out there.

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.320 line:92%
The day of,

00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:38.123
at the hotel at nine in the
morning

00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:40.459
they pick me up at two,
bring me to the arena,

00:12:41.526 --> 00:12:43.062 line:92%
they show me the stage.

00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:45.664 line:92%
And I'm like okay.

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:50.302
- Did you go, can I get a
carpet out here I like to.

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:53.906
- You feel like you have
to change something,

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:57.609
I like if there can be candles
here.

00:12:57.642 --> 00:12:59.044 line:92%
- You go, can I test my mic?

00:12:59.077 --> 00:13:00.546
Like you're adding, you go like
this,

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.781
you guys ever thought that that
light

00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:04.349
would probably be better over
there?

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:06.385 line:92%
Just at least for my set.

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:09.922
- I did say, it'd be nice
if there were screens

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:10.989 line:92%
that people could see me.

00:13:11.022 --> 00:13:12.758 line:92%
- Yes, smart.

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.092
- I said that's all I need is
screens.

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.361 line:92%
- Game changer.

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:18.897
- And this is just a real quick
sidebar,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.334
what I've notice from the
ShipRocked story

00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:24.403
and the Metallica thing
is you're like a MacGyver

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:27.339
with performance where you
know how to just quick fix it

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:29.908
or you go drop it we're just
gonna improv.

00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:30.909 line:92%
And they're like fixed it.

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:31.910
- 'cause you're going
into these situations,

00:13:31.943 --> 00:13:33.445
they'd know a comic's
coming on these things

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.049
but when I first got there,
that was the question

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:38.750
that threw me for a major loop
they go,

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:39.885
you wanna give me your
microphone?

00:13:39.918 --> 00:13:41.920
He's like I'll set it up
for you before the show.

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:44.189 line:92%
I went, you want me to what?

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:45.924 line:92%
They go, your microphone.

00:13:45.957 --> 00:13:49.494
You're a comedian right,
you're basically like musicians

00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:51.597
like guitarists travel with
their guitar.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:56.969
I go this question's never
come up in 18 years of comedy

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:58.770
and no-ones ever asked me
if I had my microphone.

00:13:58.803 --> 00:14:00.906
- Please start Googling custom
microphones

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:03.609
'cause I want to start a
show up to half sold heliums

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.912
and going like this, can you
plug me in?

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:09.181 line:92%
- What's up Huntsville, Alabama.

00:14:09.214 --> 00:14:10.148 line:92%
It's a golden fist.

00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:11.483 line:92%
- I go, there's Delilah.

00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:17.089 line:92%
Oh god, dating is weird.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.460
Yeah that's good, that's
gonna really rip in this room.

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:22.961
I'm gonna take this
with me in my hotel room

00:14:22.994 --> 00:14:24.096 line:92%
I'm gonna nap with it.

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.131 line:92%
I'm totally down with that.

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.100
- I trust that I can
leave this here overnight.

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.501 line:92%
- Do you guys have a lock box

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:31.970
or something I can put my
fucking...

00:14:32.003 --> 00:14:34.072 line:92%
Like you're B.B. king.

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:34.907 line:92%
I need to put this somewhere.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.774 line:92%
- But that's the thing right?

00:14:35.807 --> 00:14:38.210
They want you to have some sort
of

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:39.545 line:92%
answers for what you need.

00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:45.417
- Yeah, I said just a
screen would be great.

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:49.154 line:92%
And then I watched the show,

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.791 line:92%
and I'm like what do ya...

00:14:52.824 --> 00:14:54.092
- Alright well we'll see
you back in the states.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:58.330 line:92%
Now before I leave someone goes

00:14:58.363 --> 00:14:59.898
"hey man Lars is in the food
room

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:03.068
"and he wants to talk to
you, he's got 15 minutes"

00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:07.506
okay, so I go in there and he's
eating

00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:12.645
he's like, "so basically why we
hired you

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:17.049
"is because you able to read
crowd

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:21.287
"and this is your fucking
thing just do what you want".

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:28.894 line:92%
- What's my thing.

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:33.765 line:92%
- Like, is that it?

00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:35.801
This is why I came to
Switzerland.

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:38.136
- Just so I could have a
conversation

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:41.239
while you eat fucking craft
services.

00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:43.942 line:92%
- Raclette, weird Swiss food.

00:15:43.975 --> 00:15:47.446
- He's like, "if you've got
ideas just run them by me".

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:51.583
And then I still was really
uneasy, I didn't know,

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:52.951
and people were like, dude
you're opening.

00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:55.253 line:92%
I'm like I'm not opening

00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:57.623 line:92%
I'm host MC

00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:01.026 line:92%
of their opening

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:01.994 line:92%
whatever it's called,

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:06.331
The Lighting Up Tour, I'm not

00:16:06.364 --> 00:16:09.301
I'm not doing a, it's Jim Breuer
and

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:11.403 line:92%
his 45 minute comedy set.

00:16:11.436 --> 00:16:15.707
So now it's a month before the
show goes

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.342 line:92%
and I'm stressing out.

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:18.143 line:92%
- Yeah, fuck yeah.

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:18.977 line:92%
You've got a big thing coming.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.645
- Dude, I fucking reached out to
Jay,

00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:21.980 line:92%
I'm calling Bill Burr.

00:16:22.013 --> 00:16:25.384
I'm like you want to
come join me on stage?

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.618 line:92%
I'm not the only one going down,

00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:27.552 line:92%
you're all going down with me.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.488
- Yeah, Bill Burr's going what
the fuck?

00:16:33.224 --> 00:16:35.093
You don't fucking call a
guy and fucking offer him

00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:39.331
a fucking beginning spot,
do the fucking opening.

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:42.300
- Can you pull up my
calender by any chance

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:46.038
on the screen to show,
after Jim had texted me

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:47.606 line:92%
I have Metallica date listed

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.975 line:92%
in every single, on my calender.

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:53.879
- He's waiting for James
Hetfield,

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.313
I'm waiting for him to call me
up.

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:56.782
- Dude, you got the uniform
before you got

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:57.816 line:92%
hired at the job.

00:16:57.849 --> 00:16:58.950 line:92%
- You're just wearing the shirt

00:16:58.983 --> 00:17:00.552 line:92%
and you're like here we go.

00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:02.587
- Papa Jones is gonna
call, I don't like green.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.721 line:92%
- I fucking love it.

00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:07.025
- So I call Jay, I'm like
hey man you available to,

00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:11.764 line:92%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:16.501
And then all of a sudden I flew
out,

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:19.137
pretended I had a gig in San
Francisco

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.074
knowing Lars was there
for a couple of days.

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:25.510
- I talked to James,
I'm friends with James.

00:17:25.543 --> 00:17:27.279
But James is always kind of
vague.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.647 line:92%
He's like, I don't know,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.017
just kinda, you know do your
thing.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.019
I'm like alright, this is not
helping me.

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:36.121
- A lot of people keep
telling you just do your thing

00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:38.690
and you're like I'm trying
to find what my thing is.

00:17:38.723 --> 00:17:39.891 line:92%
- Right.

00:17:39.924 --> 00:17:42.761
- That's great, they're speaking
in rock start vague-isms.

00:17:42.794 --> 00:17:46.398
- It's a theater in
around, so I sat with Lars.

00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.501 line:92%
I find Lars, I go to his house.

00:17:49.534 --> 00:17:51.003 line:92%
He's like "why are you here?"

00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:54.639
- Don't you ever come to my
home.

00:17:54.672 --> 00:17:56.842 line:92%
- I said I have a gig out here.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.810
And I went you know what, I
really don't,

00:17:58.843 --> 00:18:01.646
I want to wrap my head
around what you see.

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:05.650
He's laying down in a chair,
his legs are dangling over.

00:18:05.683 --> 00:18:06.785 line:92%
And he goes like this,

00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:09.420 line:92%
and we could see the entire

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:10.822
San Francisco Bay it's like a
movie.

00:18:10.855 --> 00:18:11.957 line:92%
- [Dan] Yeah, he's in Tiburon.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.926 line:92%
- Yes, well not anymore.

00:18:15.293 --> 00:18:17.162
- That's my shithead cousin's
knowledge,

00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:18.730 line:92%
Lars Ulrich lives in Tiburon.

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:20.432
- That house doesn't exist
anymore.

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:22.200
Been to that house,
had a great time there.

00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:23.034 line:92%
- [Dan] Can't wait to tell.

00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:24.068 line:92%
- Got good stories there.

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:28.473
He goes, "here's the
deal, first of all you're

00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:31.276
"writing bits and creating
things that are for

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:35.447
"like 15,000 people,

"lucky maybe 800 maybe
1000 people be in the

00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:40.252 line:92%
"arena when you're up there.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.787
"So you gotta think
nobodies gonna be in there,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.523 line:92%
"that's number one.

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:47.859 line:92%
"number two, you gotta remember

00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:51.163
"tell them why you fucking

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.831
"the band, you know me, you know
James,

00:18:52.864 --> 00:18:56.434
"you know stories, tell them
stories.

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:58.270
"The times work towards but the
most

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.907
"important thing is, you
don't have to be funny."

00:19:03.474 --> 00:19:05.777
- That's like one of those
things where you go what?

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.611 line:92%
That's my thing.

00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:07.879 line:92%
- Especially 'cause you go,

00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:09.815
that's what I thought my thing
was,

00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:12.150
that's the one thing I
thought my thing was.

00:19:12.183 --> 00:19:13.285
- Do you start doubting your own
name,

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.187
you go, I'm Jim Breuer I'm a
comic.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.322
- Do your thing man go out
there and don't be funny.

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:18.924 line:92%
- He goes "okay?"

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:21.026
and I went "okay, I
don't have to be funny."

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.828
He's like, "yeah just tell
stories.

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:27.999
"I trust you, I've seen you go
into a room

00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:31.636
"and you can work the room,
you know the situation

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:33.438
"and you just fucking go with
it,

00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:35.240 line:92%
"it's fucking brilliant,

00:19:35.273 --> 00:19:37.842
"you can do that in front of our
crowd.

00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:40.078
"we get bands, nobody goes to
see them

00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:42.547
"it's a bomb for the bands, a
bomb for us.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.151
"So why not give the
crowd a fan experience?

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:48.320 line:92%
"That's what we're looking for."

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:52.624 line:92%
And I went, okay, alright.

00:19:52.657 --> 00:19:55.160
And I planned this whole fucking
thing

00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:57.495 line:92%
for Madison, Wisconsin.

00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:01.266
And it was on, and I got
a DJ, a comedian that I

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:04.202
can banter with and he's gonna
play songs.

00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:06.171
And even that guy came to my
house

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:08.206 line:92%
and he's like a punk rocker,

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:09.741 line:92%
he doesn't know rock and metal

00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:11.576
and he goes here's the songs I
got.

00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:12.544 line:92%
And every song's like

00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:13.778 line:92%
(screaming gutturally)

00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:15.880
I went listen listen, everyone
in

00:20:15.913 --> 00:20:18.183 line:92%
that audience is Jim Breuer.

00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:19.751
They are married, there are
kids,

00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:21.486
they grew up with Metallica in
86.

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:22.821 line:92%

I learned everything after the
first show.

00:21:14.872 --> 00:21:16.207 line:71%
- 6:00 pm.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.879

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:24.749
player from their college
football team.

Wisconsin go Badgers.

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:32.991
So I got the Badgers runner
back, the Badgers quarterback

00:21:33.024 --> 00:21:35.827
I'm gonna run up on
top, give tickets away.

00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:39.497
Every fifteen minutes I
have something scheduled.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.565 line:92%

it's really early.

00:21:49.273 --> 00:21:51.943
- I bet at 6:00 you really
feel like hardwired Harry.

00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:52.811 line:92%
- Yes.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.814
- It's just too bright to
(mumbles)

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:59.351
- Now I gotta run to
the top and I don't have

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:02.454
a security guard and I don't
know how to get to the top.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.422
And the lights, they can't find
me

00:22:04.455 --> 00:22:06.725
they guys on stage are
like, Jim where are you?

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.927 line:92%
It's a fucking disaster.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.928 line:92%
- It's an around.

00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:13.965
- They are insistent that
Metallica goes up at 8:30

00:22:13.998 --> 00:22:18.636
and Metallica, Lars is
insistent I stay on stage

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:20.372 line:92%
until Metallica comes out.

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:23.141
Because Metallica is big Jim
Breuer fan

00:22:23.174 --> 00:22:25.710
and they want all Metallica fans
to start

00:22:25.743 --> 00:22:26.811 line:92%
following Jim Breuer.

00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:29.848
So that's the part where
I'm like wow thank you.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.222
- Jim do you want to do
a quick two hours and

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:38.423 line:92%
30 minutes set?

00:22:39.557 --> 00:22:43.828 line:92%
- 8:20 I go backstage, I go are

00:22:43.861 --> 00:22:46.131 line:92%
they still going up at 8:30?

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.132 line:92%
Hundred percent.

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:48.633 line:92%
Great.

00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:52.570
8:25 I go on stage I get
the okay, this section

00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:55.006
I think you're better that this
section.

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.007 line:92%
You guys do The Hokey Pokey,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.976 line:92%
you jump up and down,

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.010 line:92%
you're louder than them,

00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:00.178 line:92%
you say bla bla bla.

00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:01.513 line:92%
And they're fucking

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:02.680 line:92%
(crowd cheering)

00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:07.686
and the guy goes they're
not around here, stretch.

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:12.424
And I looked and went oh fuck,
okay.

00:23:13.724 --> 00:23:15.193 line:92%
I did ten more minutes.

00:23:15.226 --> 00:23:17.396
And now the crowd's
getting a little tired.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.832
I'm about to get off and
again, they're not ready.

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:23.435
I'm like, what the fuck it's
8:40, 8:45.

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:26.905
And now I'm getting the bottom
teeth.

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:28.073 line:92%
- It's turning hard now.

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:31.509
- Bottom teeth are going and
I'm getting a lot of this

00:23:31.542 --> 00:23:36.548
fuck you, get the fuck off this
stage.

00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:38.817 line:92%
- Three hours of anybody though.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.684 line:92%
- Correct.

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:44.422
I had the t-shirt cannons,
they're not working

00:23:44.455 --> 00:23:49.260
so I'd run out and I'm like are
you ready?

00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:51.830 line:92%
And it would go (clicks)

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:53.164 line:92%
- Just dribbles out.

00:23:53.197 --> 00:23:54.566 line:92%
- and they'd all start booing.

00:23:55.533 --> 00:23:59.003
And it's not five people, it's
sections,

00:23:59.036 --> 00:23:59.871 line:92%
boo.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.508 line:92%
- Just 114 now, boo.

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:06.711 line:92%
- Turn it.

00:24:06.744 --> 00:24:09.481
- So at one point, the funniest
part was

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:12.317
I had the DJ on stage
and he's wearing glasses

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.052
and he can't see what the fuck
he's doing,

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.688 line:92%
he calls me over, on stage,

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:19.791
people booing telling me to
get the fuck off the stage.

00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:24.129
And Metallica's management's
there,

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.798 line:92%
everybody's there watching.

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:29.467
- For some reason Cliff
Burton's family's all there.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.535 line:92%
- Everyone's there.

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:31.569
- and they're super
disappointed at everything.

00:24:31.602 --> 00:24:33.171 line:92%
Cliff's spirit is watching.

00:24:33.204 --> 00:24:34.039 line:92%
- It's like OB1.

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:35.907 line:92%
- Disaster.

00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:39.110 line:92%
- He's out by Hanoi Rocks.

00:24:39.143 --> 00:24:42.047 line:92%
- ♪ He's up on top ♪

00:24:43.714 --> 00:24:44.783 line:92%
it's a disaster,

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.019 line:92%
and all of a sudden

00:24:48.052 --> 00:24:52.357
they say they're ready, it's
8:55.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.659
- Yeah but that fucking 25
minutes.

00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:55.493 line:92%
- They go up

00:24:55.526 --> 00:24:59.330
I go backstage and I go oh my
god.

00:24:59.363 --> 00:25:02.234
But my attitude is always like,
okay

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.504
tomorrow night we're gonna kick
their ass.

00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:08.606
- Me and you were the same,
I know where me and you are.

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:10.942
- I'm taking a detective
shower in the fucking public

00:25:10.975 --> 00:25:12.310 line:92%
shower with it just running down

00:25:12.343 --> 00:25:14.312
with my hand against
the wall, like oh fuck.

00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:17.549
- Not me, I'm taking
the old tags off my bag

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.818
to get ready to put the
ones to go home with.

00:25:20.718 --> 00:25:21.553 line:92%
It was a failed experiment,

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:22.521 line:92%
look we did everything we could.

00:25:22.554 --> 00:25:23.788
We tried that one night,
it didn't work out.

00:25:23.821 --> 00:25:25.590 line:92%
I'm gonna get out of here.

00:25:25.623 --> 00:25:27.458
- I'll never listen to
you again, I'm sorry.

00:25:27.491 --> 00:25:29.928
- They guy I was with onstage
went,

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.963
"dude we gotta get the
fuck off the stage".

00:25:31.996 --> 00:25:35.900
Swear to god Josip, get
the fuck off the stage.

00:25:35.933 --> 00:25:36.834 line:92%
We go offstage he's like,

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:37.902 line:92%
dude we can't fucking do this,

00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:39.304 line:92%
I'm packing my bags,

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:40.672 line:92%
I'm fucking out.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:44.442
I went, hold on a second, let's
re-group

00:25:45.776 --> 00:25:49.047
we know what works, the
next night it was like okay

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.817 line:92%
I'm not going up till 7:30,

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.218 line:92%
you go out at seven

00:25:54.251 --> 00:25:56.354 line:92%
start playing songs.

00:25:56.387 --> 00:25:58.489 line:92%
Fuck me going up in the crowd,

00:25:58.522 --> 00:26:00.792 line:92%
you're going up in the crowd,

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:03.795
I'm gonna go up, talk as long as
I can

00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:05.496
I'm gonna fuck with the
audience,

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:07.966
talk as much, when I'm done with
that

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:10.335
you are gonna give ticket
giveaways.

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:13.171
You're gonna go up on
top, you go way up there.

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:16.741
After that we're gonna play
a trivia game with the crowd.

00:26:16.774 --> 00:26:18.710
After that we're gonna do a game
show,

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.144
I'm gonna bring a couple
of knuckleheads up

00:26:20.177 --> 00:26:22.747
and hopefully they get
booed the fuck off the stage

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.148
and it'll be the most
entertaining thing

00:26:24.181 --> 00:26:25.517 line:92%
in the world for the crowd.

00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:30.822
By night two and three I
found rhythm like (claps)

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:34.192
- When it comes every day it's
just like,

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.426
It's time to do my thing real
quick,

00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:38.363
then I'm gonna get to sit and
watch Metallica all night.

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:41.899
- I'm not kidding you, by the
second leg,

00:26:41.932 --> 00:26:42.867 line:92%
and there was a part of me

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.737
and I think only you
can understand this Jay

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.871 line:92%
I don't know, maybe you too Dan.

00:26:46.904 --> 00:26:48.039 line:92%
- No that's fine I get it.

00:26:48.072 --> 00:26:49.707 line:92%
- No, maybe you too.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.042 line:92%
- I'm green in this pasture.

00:26:51.075 --> 00:26:52.276 line:92%
- I love Metallica.

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:54.512
Let's say I wasn't opening for
them,

00:26:54.545 --> 00:26:58.516
I'd be in the crowd
banging my head so hard

00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:03.722
that it would hurt the next
day when I'm home alone.

00:27:05.656 --> 00:27:08.159
I'll never forget, this
was a game changer for me,

00:27:09.226 --> 00:27:13.331
I'm done with my set and
I'm not getting booed

00:27:13.364 --> 00:27:16.100
I'm not getting the go
fuck yourself, go home,

00:27:16.133 --> 00:27:19.704
die, get cancer, I'm not
getting those Tweets anymore.

00:27:19.737 --> 00:27:23.574
From night two on it was
like, oh I do, I get it.

00:27:23.607 --> 00:27:24.441 line:92%
- [Jay] It's fun.

00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:27.311
- So now there's this Korean guy
and he's

00:27:27.344 --> 00:27:30.181 line:92%
acting out every song.

00:27:30.214 --> 00:27:33.017
I don't know what happened,
I'm at the sound booth

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.519 line:92%
and I went up to him

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:36.988
and it went from Moth Into The
Flame

00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:38.189 line:92%
to Sad But True

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:41.926 line:92%
to Master of Puppets.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.763
And the two of us got in each
others faces

00:27:45.796 --> 00:27:48.800 line:92%
and we acted out every song.

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.869
And when we were done we
had a crowd around us.

00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:55.973
And it became a tradition every
night

00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:57.942
people called me out for every
song,

00:27:57.975 --> 00:28:01.379
they're like you gotta
come out here with us.

00:28:01.412 --> 00:28:04.849 line:92%
And I remember the third leg

00:28:04.882 --> 00:28:07.485
there was about 15 of us banging
our heads

00:28:07.518 --> 00:28:09.254 line:92%
so hard way in the back.

00:28:10.287 --> 00:28:12.323
And all of a sudden the song was
over,

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:14.859
and it was this song and I look
up and

00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:17.261
a pick comes flying by
my head and look up,

00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:19.163
it's Hetfield and he's looking
at me

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:21.566 line:92%
shaking his head but laughing.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:22.533 line:92%
- That's awesome.

00:28:22.566 --> 00:28:23.634 line:92%
- And after the show he's like

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:26.771
"dude, you're in there
with the fucking crowds

00:28:26.804 --> 00:28:27.705 line:92%
"you're a nutball,

00:28:27.738 --> 00:28:29.607
"you're a fucking nutball, I
love it."

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.078
- That's great, but also it
shows you man

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.515
with the crews and with the
fucking opener for Metallica,

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:39.050
by the second night you were
like

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.785 line:92%
a seasoned guy in a heist movie.

00:28:40.818 --> 00:28:42.854
You came in you were like
this is how it's gonna go,

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.456 line:92%
the car's gonna stay out front.

00:28:45.456 --> 00:28:47.125
He goes, this is a three safe
joint,

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:48.392 line:92%
alright we got 90 seconds.

00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:50.294
When they hit that button,
that's what you got,

00:28:50.327 --> 00:28:51.696 line:92%
90, you gotta get in and out.

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:53.131
To call it like that and then
just to

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:55.900
fucking solve it, they
don't know how many years

00:28:55.933 --> 00:28:57.302 line:92%
of comedy went into that.

00:28:58.569 --> 00:29:00.805
- The thing is the gig,
comedically rewarding

00:29:00.838 --> 00:29:02.473 line:92%
is gonna be what it's gonna be.

00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:03.641 line:92%
I didn't walk off of any,

00:29:03.674 --> 00:29:06.210 line:92%
60 shows I did with them,

00:29:06.243 --> 00:29:07.411
I've never walked off stage one
time

00:29:07.444 --> 00:29:09.547
and he goes, I gotta
write this down I think

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.682 line:92%
I got a new bit today.

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.385 line:92%
Jot that down.

00:29:14.418 --> 00:29:16.721
Especially as I said with
me when I went up there,

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.122
no-one knew who I was so they
go,

00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:20.258
is the fucking drum tech
grabbing the mic?

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.959 line:92%
Cut his mic off.

00:29:21.992 --> 00:29:23.394 line:92%
Look at this dickhead.

00:29:23.427 --> 00:29:24.462 line:92%
Fuck you.

00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:28.432
- What happens Jay, is
that whole crowd looks at

00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:29.566 line:92%
who is this guy?

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.069
And then they look you up,
and then they see videos.

00:29:32.102 --> 00:29:34.438 line:76%
They're like oh dude, he's, oh
wow.

00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:38.376 line:76%
And what I started seeing
was the Metallica crowd

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:40.044
went dude he's a real Metallica
guy.

00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:40.978 line:92%
- [Jay] Yeah.

00:29:41.011 --> 00:29:42.580 line:92%
- He really is a Metallica guy.

00:29:44.148 --> 00:29:47.218
And some people started going,
why don't you do material?

00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:48.853 line:92%
I'm like, I'm in a round.

00:29:53.724 --> 00:29:54.692
- That's the thing you have to
rely on,

00:29:54.725 --> 00:29:57.428
that's the instinct that
whatever I do

00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:00.565
if I was talking at a
funeral I just say something

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.067
funny because that's all my
thing is.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.203
- And I started going into
crowds, doing the thing

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.438
and the coolest thing in the
world became,

00:30:08.639 --> 00:30:12.109
I can honestly say it was the
greatest gig

00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:15.746 line:92%
I ever had in my entire life.

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:17.982
Better than t.v., better than
film.

00:30:18.015 --> 00:30:19.817 line:92%
It was the greatest gig,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.520
greatest experience I ever had
in my life.

00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:25.790
I said I wold retire
and do this for the rest

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:28.025 line:92%
of my life but guys like you,

00:30:28.058 --> 00:30:30.862
guys like Jay only we can do
this

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:33.197 line:92%
because we can appreciate,

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.399 line:92%
I can appreciate

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:36.834 line:92%
what life is.

00:30:36.867 --> 00:30:38.502
And these are moments
when we were kids like

00:30:38.535 --> 00:30:40.204
god if I got to meet ball
players,

00:30:40.237 --> 00:30:42.440
god if I got to hang
out with the metal guys

00:30:44.408 --> 00:30:46.911
and I'm the Forest Gump of
entertainment.

00:30:46.944 --> 00:30:50.348
I said from day one, I
want to work with Pesci

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:51.983
I want to work with
DeNiro, I want to do this

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.150 line:92%
I want to be with Metallica.

00:30:53.183 --> 00:30:54.485 line:92%
And I could sit there and go,

00:30:54.518 --> 00:30:55.953 line:92%
holy shit I did everything.

00:30:55.986 --> 00:30:57.722 line:92%
It's not what I envisioned,

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:59.090
I thought I'd have 50 million
dollars

00:30:59.123 --> 00:31:00.691 line:92%
and I'd be a blockbuster star.

00:31:00.724 --> 00:31:05.730
You know what, who's
gonna say I fucking toured

00:31:06.096 --> 00:31:07.198 line:92%
with Metallica?

00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:08.132 line:92%
- That's crazy.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.768
- Who's gonna say, I worked with
this guy.

00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:14.405
- You got beat by a fake bat by
Joe Pesci.

00:31:19.743 --> 00:31:21.779
- There's little marks
in my life when you go

00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:23.080
no-on can take this away from
me.

00:31:23.113 --> 00:31:24.214 line:92%
- Nobody

00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:25.416
- you just do a thing and
you go that's what I said

00:31:25.449 --> 00:31:28.185
I get bust my balls
for how much I bring up

00:31:28.218 --> 00:31:29.052
being on tour with Korn I'm
like,

00:31:29.086 --> 00:31:31.155
that's a pretty huge moment in
my life.

00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:33.925
But just for me, but also just
in comedy.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:36.427
I went from struggling,
and by the way when I

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.995 line:92%
came off of it, still struggling

00:31:38.028 --> 00:31:40.398
it wasn't a financial gig
it was like they asked

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:43.034
me if I would go on tour doing
comedy in

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.202 line:92%
front of Korn for 60 shows.

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:47.572
And Rob Zombie, and I did
Slipknot

00:31:49.873 --> 00:31:50.908 line:92%
and the ShipRock thing

00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:53.177 line:92%
I mean this is fucking crazy.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.545 line:92%
- But it's your passion too.

00:31:54.578 --> 00:31:56.480 line:92%
But we were on the poster.

00:31:56.513 --> 00:31:59.116
We both have that poster
framed from Bonnaroo.

00:31:59.149 --> 00:32:00.918
We did the comedy tent
but we're on a poster

00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:02.920 line:92%
with fucking Billy Joel.

00:32:02.953 --> 00:32:03.788 line:92%
- Crazy.

00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:06.123 line:92%
- The beginning of a gay porn.

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:07.959 line:92%
This guy's in gay porn.

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:10.428 line:92%
(rock music)

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.771
- This is where we pick up
the stranger at the bus stop.

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.407 line:92%
- [Jay] That's Louis Stacks.

00:32:23.674 --> 00:32:24.742 line:92%
- That's Lou Driller.

00:32:24.775 --> 00:32:26.577
- 'cause you got fat stacks
of dick in his pants.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.146 line:92%
- He drills chicks.

00:32:29.179 --> 00:32:30.514 line:92%
Lou drills.

00:32:30.547 --> 00:32:33.084
- We're doing an overnight
shift at a gas station scene

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:35.420
where Lou's alone, the
only employee there.

00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:37.355 line:92%
- And a lady needs her car fixed

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:38.889 line:92%
but she doesn't have any money.

00:32:38.922 --> 00:32:41.859
- She steals his Zagnut bar
while he's taking a shit.

00:32:41.892 --> 00:32:43.094
- [Dan] He comes out, catches
her.

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:45.796
Well there's only one
way to pay that back.

00:32:45.829 --> 00:32:46.731
- Black Lou, why do black
people always try to

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.366 line:92%
get in the background of t.v.?

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.200 line:92%
- They love it.

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.534 line:92%
- What's going on with that guy?

00:32:50.567 --> 00:32:53.004
That guy's already given
shout outs to his momma.

00:32:53.037 --> 00:32:54.539 line:92%
- What barber shop did he say?

00:32:56.673 --> 00:32:58.476 line:92%
- Yo, top cuts.

00:32:59.743 --> 00:33:01.512
- If internet has taught me
anything,

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:03.681
to make random black
people leave you alone,

00:33:03.714 --> 00:33:04.849 line:92%
street magic.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.985 line:92%
I go is that your car?

00:33:08.018 --> 00:33:08.853 line:92%
- Oh hell no.

00:33:15.325 --> 00:33:16.193
- [Jay] I don't always
deal with a sorcerer.

00:33:16.226 --> 00:33:18.429 line:92%
- [Dan] Oh man this warlock.

00:33:18.462 --> 00:33:20.765
- You gotta loosen the bottom
one.

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:22.333 line:92%
- Try to get the full Scotty...

00:33:32.142 --> 00:33:33.844
- I don't know if Mark face's
microphone's

00:33:33.877 --> 00:33:35.579 line:92%
even doing a god damn thing.

00:33:35.612 --> 00:33:37.181 line:92%
He's the furthest away from us.

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:41.285
- Do you like your new job as
audio?

00:33:41.318 --> 00:33:42.119 line:92%
- [Andy] I hate it.

00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:43.187
- You hate it?
- Why?

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.255 line:92%
- [Dan] Tell it straight.

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.623
- I feel like I'm not
part of the group any more

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:47.592 line:92%
- [Dan] Oh here, we'll try it.

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:53.397 line:92%
Look at that, this feels good.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.000
- I think both of you guys
are doing it terribly wrong.

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:58.002
- [Andy] Yeah I don't
think I'm doing it right.

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.137 line:92%
- Let me take it away.

00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:02.306 line:92%
- Only got so much cable here.

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:03.908 line:92%
Can't get too far away from me.

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:07.578
Yeah but your arm gets tired
quick dude.

00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:09.247 line:92%
- My jackass arm, you're right.

00:34:10.147 --> 00:34:11.649
- I should be working for a
local.

00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:18.122
- Hey, this is us standing in
for Jay.

00:34:18.155 --> 00:34:21.125
- That's not how you're supposed
to do it.

00:34:21.158 --> 00:34:22.493 line:92%
- [Jay] Now you say something.

00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:23.327 line:92%
- No.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.161 line:92%
- I spit on it.

00:34:24.194 --> 00:34:24.995 line:92%
- Getting too close.

00:34:25.028 --> 00:34:27.231
- [Jay] Hang on a second
(mumbles)

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.535 line:92%
- Alright, let's do a duet

00:34:31.568 --> 00:34:32.970 line:92%
like we're doing save the world.

00:34:33.003 --> 00:34:33.871 line:92%

and Jay.

00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:57.161
- You're doing just as bad a job
as Jay

00:34:57.194 --> 00:34:58.796 line:92%
- Mark face.

00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:59.630 line:92%
- It goes right to my ear.

00:34:59.663 --> 00:35:00.832 line:92%
- Do you miss the show?

00:35:02.432 --> 00:35:05.402 line:92%

00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:07.037 line:92%
(breathing heavily)

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.972 line:92%
- Mark face

00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:15.412 line:92%
- Right in there.

00:35:15.445 --> 00:35:17.748
- Ah, that's what made me leave
the show

00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:19.383 line:92%
in the first place.

00:35:24.154 --> 00:35:26.691
- I'll take these headphones
right off and throw em at you.

00:35:28.792 --> 00:35:31.562
- I can only finish if
I smells Dan's armpits.

00:35:31.595 --> 00:35:33.164 line:92%
- Do my armpits really smell?

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:34.331 line:92%
- Your mouth is so hot.

00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:36.667
- I'm on my tiptoes,
I'm trying to kiss you.

00:35:38.869 --> 00:35:40.738
Part of the Viet Cong and I'm
trying...

00:35:43.006 --> 00:35:44.809 line:92%
Hey Dan do you think, oh.

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:49.313 line:92%
- It's good lacquer.

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:52.517 line:92%
- [Man One] Let's go to work.

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.920
- [Dan] Did you guys see
that book had a little

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:57.321 line:92%
how to roll blunts for dummies.

00:35:57.354 --> 00:35:58.189 line:92%
- Really.

00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:01.092 line:92%
- Hold on I'm gonna go buy one.

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:02.226
- [Dan] Fuck I don't have any
cash on me.

00:36:02.259 --> 00:36:03.227 line:92%
- How much were they?

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.229
- [Dan] Ah, give me 20
and I'll pay you back.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.833
- [Jay] C'mon Dan, snatch n'
grab.

- Rashon.

00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.739
- Rashon, Dan nice to meet you
man.

00:36:15.772 --> 00:36:17.775 line:92%
- [Jay] Let's go to work.

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:20.344
- [Dan] Guys awesome, got two
for 20.

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:31.121
- You think your friends
would dig this video?

00:36:31.154 --> 00:36:32.690 line:92%
Then share it with them

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:34.258
and tell them to rate and
review.

00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:36.694
And you know, make us
feel good about ourselves.

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:39.463
- You tell a friend,
they tell two friends,

00:36:39.496 --> 00:36:41.565
yeah it's a pyramid
scheme of a radio show.

00:36:41.598 --> 00:36:42.633 line:92%
- Becomes a whole thing.

00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:44.568
I got some Cutco knives
also if you're interested.

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.539
- I've got Spyderco so call
me if you want the real one.
