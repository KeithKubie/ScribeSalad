00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.616
When you walk into your
neighborhood public library,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.256
you expect the librarian
to help you find your next favorite book

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.936
or some accurate information
on a topic at interest.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.256
You don't probably expect the librarian

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.936
to come running out from behind
the reference desk with Narcan,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.400
ready to revive someone
overdosing on heroin or fentanyl.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.256
But this is happening at some libraries.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.576
Public libraries have always been
about community support

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.816
with all kinds of services and programs

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.176
from assisting with job seeking efforts

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.856
to locating resources for voter rights

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.176
to providing free meals
to kids and teens even.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.136
But what we think of as community support
takes on new urgency

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.360
when you're in the middle
of an opioid and overdose crisis.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.336
I work at the McPherson Square Library
of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.216
It's located in Kensington,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.536
one of the lowest income
communities in Philadelphia,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.080
with a long history of being isolated
from resources and opportunity.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.936
And because of that,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.840
it has been the center to the city's
drug trade and drug use for decades.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.616
And so inside the neighborhood,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.696
our library is nestled inside of a park,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.056
which has unfortunately
garnered a reputation

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.856
for being a place to find and use drugs,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.496
especially heroin,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.336
out in the open,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.656
putting us and the community
in direct contact

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.416
with the drug trade
and use on a daily basis.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.096
And so inside the library,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.696
it is routine to see people
visibly intoxicated on opioids:

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.776
eyes closing, body swaying slowly.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.816
It is routine for me
to ask them if they are OK,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.416
but at the same time remind them

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.136
if they can't keep their eyes open,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.696
they have to go.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.096
It is routine for our volunteer, Teddy,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.440
to pick up dozens of discarded needles
on our property and throughout the park.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.216
And it is normal for kids
to come into the library

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.136
to tell me or our guard, Sterling,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.336
that someone is outside using,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.416
which typically means finding
someone injecting on our front steps,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.656
benches

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.936
or near the building,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.000
then asking them to move along
because kids see them.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.776
And it is normal for the community

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.776
to see people in various states
of intoxication and withdrawal,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.336
to see people buying and selling,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.080
and to see people act and react violently.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.096
I'm not sharing this
to sensationalize Kensington.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.640
I'm sharing this because
this is the reality of a community

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.216
that is constantly striving
to move forward,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.696
but due to factors like structural racism,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.216
urban segregation,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.576
the cyclical nature of poverty,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.896
of trauma --

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.296
the community has inequitable access

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.560
to education, health care,
employment and more.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.256
And this is also what it's like
when the drug trade and use

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.120
affects every aspect
of life in the neighborhood.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.360
And the opioid epidemic
has only amplified that stress.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.736
When I was hired
by the Free Library in 2013,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.816
I specifically chose to work at McPherson

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.896
because I understand what it's like
to grow up in an environment

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.096
where substance use disorder
shapes the everyday,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.816
and I wanted to use
those personal experiences

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.280
as a guide for my work.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.496
But before I get to that,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.176
I want to share what it was like

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.520
to witness this epidemic
grow in Kensington.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.376
Like many other communities,
we were just not prepared.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.936
We began to take notice
of IDs we were seeing:

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.816
addresses from nearby and upstate counties

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.176
and then slowly out-of-state ones.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.376
People from Arkansas,
Ohio, South Carolina, Alabama

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.760
coming to Philadelphia for cheap heroin.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.016
People began to linger longer
and longer in our public restroom,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.416
causing us to pay
more attention to the restroom

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.656
than to our daily responsibilities

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.080
because it was an accessible place
to use drugs just purchased.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.616
One day our toilet clogged
so badly in the restroom,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.456
we were forced to close
our library for two days

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.240
because the culprit of the clog
was discarded needles.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.056
For a while prior to that incident,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.255
we had been asking for a sharps
container for the restroom,

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.495
and after that,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.656
the library administration
quickly approved installing one

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.840
along with hiring bathroom monitors.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.336
And as the weather warmed,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.976
we struggled to respond.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.976
People began camping out
in the park for days, weeks.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.416
You could walk outside
on a sunny, warm day

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.616
to find multiple groups of people
in various states of intoxication

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.440
and children playing in between them.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.496
The amount of needles collected
by Teddy on a monthly basis skyrocketed

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.816
from 100 to 300 to 500 to 800,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280
to over 1,000,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.520
with many found on our front steps
and the playground.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.920
Then there were the overdoses.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.296
So many occurred outside in the park,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.520
some inside the library.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.776
Sterling, our guard, would spend his time
walking in and out of the building

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.056
and throughout the park,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.296
constantly making sure everyone was safe,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.176
because at times,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.520
our fear of having someone
overdose and die came close.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.376
One overdose in particular
occurred after school,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.776
so the library was full of kids,
noise and commotion.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.296
And in all of that,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.800
we heard the thud
from inside the public restroom.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.696
When we opened the door,
we found a man on the floor, unresponsive.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.936
He was pulled out
in plain sight of everyone --

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.776
kids, teens, adults, families.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.776
Someone on staff called 911,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.736
someone else escorted the kids
and teens downstairs,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.680
somebody went to flag down
the ambulance in the park.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.256
And the rest of us --

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.136
we just waited.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.256
This had become our overdose drill

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.136
because at the time,
it was all we could do.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.136
So we waited and we watched
this man lose air --

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.856
seize up.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.200
He was dying.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.736
I don't know how many of you
have witnessed an overdose on opioids,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.216
but it's horrific

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.856
because you know the gasping for air,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.256
the loss of color in someone's face,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.880
is a timer running down
on the chances of this person surviving.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.736
But luckily for this man,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.176
the ambulance arrived

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.680
and he received a dose
of naloxone through injection.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.816
And I remember he jolted
like he was electrocuted,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.286
and he pulled the needle out,

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:49.170
and he told the paramedics to back off.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.680
And then he stood up, and he walked out.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.296
And we --

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.936
we went back to work

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.136
because people were still asking
for time on the computers,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.336
kids still needed help with their homework

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.576
and this was our job --

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.800
our purpose.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.656
I think that incident stays with me
because of the waiting.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.240
It made me feel helpless.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.536
And it was that feeling of helplessness
that reminded me so well of my childhood.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.920
Before I was born,
both of my parents began using heroin.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.856
It made our lives chaotic and unstable:

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.336
promises being made and constantly broken,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.576
their fighting,
the weight of their secret --

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.400
the weight of our secret kept so much
so-called "normal" out of our lives.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.496
Every time we'd be dropped off
at our grandparent's house,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.776
I'd be stuck on the thought
that I was never going to see them again.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.376
Every time we'd be left in a car,
at a house, at a store,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.976
I'd cry.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.576
And every time I saw those El tracks --

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.816
the same ones I take
to work now to McPherson --

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.656
from the backseat of a car,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.176
I'd be angry,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.376
because even kids know

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
when their parents
are trying to score drugs.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.680
There was so little I could do
to control what was going on around me,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.336
that that feeling of helplessness
was overwhelming.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.216
I struggled in school, struggled to read,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.256
I was prone to anger and depression.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.616
When I was 11 years old,
I started smoking,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.480
which shortly after led to my own
experiences with drugs and alcohol.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.000
I convinced myself that my parents' past
would be my future.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.816
But eventually both of my parents
entered recovery

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.016
and maintained recovery from opioid use.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.576
And their strength and their commitment

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.256
provided support and stability
for me and my siblings,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.776
and it was those personal experiences
that brought me to McPherson.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.456
Choosing to be a librarian

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.216
and choosing to be at McPherson

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.015
was me letting go
of that feeling of helplessness

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:50.679
and finding ways
to be supportive to others.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.336
And one way to provide support

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.600
was learning how to administer Narcan.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.256
Public libraries respond
to the needs of their communities,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.336
and not knowing how to utilize Narcan

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.856
was a disservice
to the needs of our community.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.336
We were on the frontlines

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.320
and desperately needed
access to this lifesaving tool.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.616
So finally in late February of 2017,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.856
after much advocating,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.456
we finally received training
from Prevention Point Philadelphia

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.936
and about a month of so later,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.840
I utilized Narcan for the first time
to save someone's life.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.816
It was after school again,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.336
and Teddy came into the library

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.896
and said someone was overdosing
on a front bench.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.576
Someone on staff called 911 again,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.336
and I grabbed the Narcan kit.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.016
The woman was barely in her 20s
and barely breathing.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.656
Her friend was frantically
slapping her in the face

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.000
in hopes of reviving her.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.736
I administered the Narcan nasally,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.280
and thankfully she came to.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.496
But before the ambulance arrived,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.240
she and her friend ran off.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.456
And when I finally turned around,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.296
I saw the kids --

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.816
kids that come into the library
on a daily basis,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.456
some that I have known for years --

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.696
standing on the steps of the building.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.336
They saw everything.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.880
And they didn't seem
like they were visibly upset or in shock,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.256
and so I walked into the building,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.776
right into our workroom, and I cried.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.216
I cried partly from the shock
of what just happened

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.040
because I never thought
I'd be saving anybody's life ever,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.920
but I mostly cried because of the kids.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.000
This is their normal.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.840
This is the community's normal.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.856
This is a catastrophic normal,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.136
and in that moment,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.896
I was forced to confront once again
that this should never be normal,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.496
and as with my childhood,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.640
when you're in it, you just accept it.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.936
The opioid epidemic
is not just about those living

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.656
with opioid use disorder

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.136
because the reach of the epidemic
goes well beyond those living with this

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.416
and their families.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.560
It impacts the entire community.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.976
Kensington was a community
in crisis before this

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.976
for reasons that are endemic
and intertwined,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.056
and anyone familiar
with the neighborhood can think of why:

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.496
racial disparities,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.120
failure of local and federal government
to properly fund schools,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.880
lack of economic opportunity.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.216
And what we're trying to do at McPherson

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.240
is find ways to support
this community out of crisis.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.096
And perhaps now, because of the epidemic,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.336
more people are paying
attention to Kensington.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.416
But regardless of that,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.656
at McPherson,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.456
we will continue to do what we can
with the resources we have

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.096
and we will continue to provide
whatever help we can

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.520
in hopes of keeping our community
safe and healthy

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.120
because public libraries
have always been more than just books.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.416
We are physical shelter,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.640
a classroom,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.136
a safe haven,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.856
a lunch room,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.856
a resource hub

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.096
and yes,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.456
even a lifeline.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.696
Thank you.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.240
(Applause)
