00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.020
The Android M release is coming.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.019
And Android developers
across the globe

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.926
are busy testing their apps
against the developer preview.

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:08.550
If you've not joined
them yet, then now

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.240
is the perfect opportunity.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm Rich Hyndman, and this is a
quick guide to the M Developer

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.650
Preview, the core features
you should be testing,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.320
and a couple of new
APIs to look out

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.860
for, along with how to
provide feedback to us.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.180
Let's jump right in.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.710
The M Developer Preview consists
of SDK tools, emulators,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980
device images, documentation,
and sample code,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.830
and you can get it all from
developer.android.com/preview.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.290
If you're anything
like me, you're

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.850
going to want to get a device
image up and running first.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.244
So if you've got a Nexus
5, 6, 9, or Nexus player,

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:41.410
you probably followed the
link to the Downloads page

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.330
already and got
your device image.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.404
Stop.

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.070
I wish we could dive
straight into that,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.403
but if you're not running the
preview version of the SDK

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:51.350
Tools, you may run into a
missing system.img error.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.420
So let's get the SDK first.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.467
If you don't already have
Android Studio installed

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.550
or would like a separate
instance for the preview,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.230
then go to
developer.android.com/sdk

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.019
to download the current version.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.580
Then you're going to open up
the Preferences or Settings

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.800
depending on your OS.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.390
Go to Appearance and Behavior,
System Settings, and Updates.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.400
Switch it over to check
for studio updates

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.140
from the Canary Channel and
SDK updates from the Preview

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.410
Channel, hit Check Now,
and wait for the magic.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.651
Android Studio is going
to update and restart,

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.150
then you can head
back into Settings

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.090
and you'll be able to
update to the new SDK

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.860
platform, and the all
important Preview SDK Tools.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.170
Also, at the same time pick
up the new support repository.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.385
And you're all ready to go.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.760
If you're starting
a new project,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.489
you can now choose
Target SDK M Preview.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:39.030
Otherwise, update
your grade or build

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
files to use Android MNC as
your compile SDK version.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.400
You could also head into the AVD
manager and set up an emulator.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.180
Select a device of your
choice, and use the MNC x86

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.040
image for the best performance.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.910
And finally we can get back
to flashing our devices.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.860
So now ensure your
data's backed up,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.712
and follow the steps
in the preview guide.

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:00.420
If your boot loader's
locked, then you're

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.030
going to have to unlock it
first, which means on a Nexus 6

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.880
or Nexus 9 first checking
in the developer options

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.830
that OEM unlocking is enabled.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.320
Then use ADB to reboot
into boot loader,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.550
run fast boot OEM unlock,
and get your system images,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.780
and execute the
flash-all script.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450
To be secure, it's
recommended once

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.880
that's done to lock
your boot loader again.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.620
It should be smooth sailing,
and if you do hit that missing

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.537
system.img error,
then double check

00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:27.620
you're definitely using
the latest [? fast boot ?]

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.210
from the Preview SDK Tools.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.660
Now, you have an Android M
Preview device or emulator

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.770
ready for testing.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.070
As always with new releases, we
have some changes in behavior

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.990
that we recommend you test out.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.190
So please head straight over
to the Behavior Changes page.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.160
First and foremost, it's the
new runtime permissions model.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.230
Runtime permissions are here.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.630
They provide less friction
on install and automatic app

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.680
updates.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.920
But you can no longer
assume that just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.230
because your app's installed,
it has all the stated

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.785
permissions granted.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.410
Permissions are now
granted at run time

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.150
and users can also
revoke permissions

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.480
on a per app basis at any
time, even for legacy apps.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.070
For testing, we have all new
ADB commands and parameters

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.750
for granting and
revoking permissions.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.791
So check out the permissions
guide on the preview

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.275
site for details.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:15.900
Always check that
you have a permission

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.834
before trying to use it, and
if you don't, request it.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.000
If there's a set of permissions
that your app needs,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.150
like camera access
for a camera app,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.530
then it can be worth requesting
them upfront in a warm welcome.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.100
Next, Android Auto Backup.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.110
This is a new service
designed to simplify

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.390
building a robust
data backup service

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.690
and to improve the
lives of users.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.220
Up to 25 megabytes of data
is backed up per application,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.430
and you can watch Matthew's
video for full details.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.240
If your project
targets [? M, ?] then

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.280
backup's going to be
automatically enabled,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.900
and there are a couple of
things you should be aware of.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.910
If you have any data you
don't want backed up,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.390
like device specific
or encrypted data,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.700
then you can move it into the
Get No Backup Files directory.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.580
You can now also specify
an inclusive or exclusive

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.640
backup scheme or potentially
opt out of backup all together.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.790
For testing, there are new ADB
shell backup manager commands.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.290
And in the M Preview
Build, auto backup

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.580
is enabled for all applications.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.375
For the actual final
M release, we're

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:19.000
only going to do it for apps
that target M or higher.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.029
It's also worth mentioning that
for testing the new fingerprint

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.500
APIs, we've added a new
ADB finger touch command,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.200
and that's going to
simulate fingerprint input.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.030
Check out the preview site and
Maya's video for full details.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.010
Finally, some good news, this
year we'll be making updates

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.770
to the SDK and device images
throughout the preview,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.780
so join the developer
preview community

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.270
on +AndroidDevelopers, and you
only need to flash your device

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.970
once, as once you've flashed the
[? dev ?] preview system image,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.440
it's going to automatically
be upgraded over the year.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.690
So please, do check out the
preview for other features

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.970
like doze, app standby,
adoptable storage,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.940
data binding, and the
very powerful app linking.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.890
Test early.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.850
Join the Android M
Developer Community.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.140
File bugs in the issue tracker.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.710
Enjoy another tasty treat.
