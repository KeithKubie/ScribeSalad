00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.050
Now the answer to this can be a little

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.990
tricky and even somewhat debatable, but our answer here is

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.440
that the transcription factor would bind less tightly. Now it

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.690
probably wouldn't bind more tightly in this scenario. Because we

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.910
set it up as the protein binds the sequence

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.860
really well and then we change that sequence. So we

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.180
wouldn't expect a protein to be able to, at the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.810
very least, bind as well. It is possible in some

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.830
scenarios that we lose the ability to bind

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.400
all together. But in general, in any given

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.840
sequence of DNA one protein is making contact

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.540
at multiple points, at multiple letters. So any given

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.640
sequence, there are multiple important points of contact.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.850
And changing just one of them won't completely

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.080
obliterate the ability of the protein to bind.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.190
But you will diminish its ability to bind tightly.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.920
So if we had deleted this whole sequence altogether, at

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.580
that point we're looking at something where the transcription factor

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.290
wouldn't bind at all. Now as is true for virtually

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.129
everything in biology, there are exceptions to every rule. And

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.690
there may be a scenario out there where you delete

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.190
one letter and the whole protein can't bind anymore. And

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.190
we'll even talk about different scenarios at some point, where

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.370
one change in the letter might actually result in a higher

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.540
affinity binding. the protein binding more tightly.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.480
But for right now are basic purposes,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920
we just wanted to emphasize the point

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.040
that proteins bind specific DNA sequences. And when

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.900
we change those sequences, or when they're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.390
different of not optimal, that the protein

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.650
usually binds less tightly. There's less of

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.430
an affinity because we're talking about chemistry here
