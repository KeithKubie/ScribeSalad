00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I just introduced this Q function. It

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.970
turns out that baked into this one little Q function is

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.680
everything we need for, for dealing with U and pi without

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.110
knowing the transition function T or the reward function R. And

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.790
to you know, to demonstrate this for you, I'm going to

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.760
let you demonstrate it to me. [LAUGH] So, [LAUGH] here's what

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.788
I'd like you to do. I'd like you to rewrite these

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.920
equations, this U and the pi equation, in the little boxes,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.020
using Q instead of any references to T and

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.510
R, alright? So, imagine that we have Q, that somebody's

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.920
already solved this out for us. How can we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.370
define pi and U using Q? Does that seem okay?

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.065
&gt;&gt; Seems okay to me. I think I might even know the answer.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; Alright, that would be awesome. So let's, let's give people a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.090
chance to think about it and then just tell me what you think.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.
