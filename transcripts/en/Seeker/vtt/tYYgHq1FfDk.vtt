00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.680
Still confused as to whether the Moon is a
star or a planet?

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.140
I can fix that.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.259
Hey guys, Amy here to talk space on DNews.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.419
There has been a lot of talk recently about
dwarf planets vs. “regular” planets, comets,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.350
asteroids… not to mention some questions
what what exactly a natural satellite is.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.120
Well, let’s break down what exactly is kicking
around in our Solar System.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.370
At the centre is our Sun, which is a star.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.330
A star is a luminous ball of gas, mostly hydrogen
and helium, that is held together by its own

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.330
gravity.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.429
Nuclear fusion in its core produces photons,
the light particles we see, as well as heat

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.670
and trace amounts of other heavy elements.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.560
But not all stars are the same.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.149
Stars can be different colours depending on
their temperature, hotter stars looking slightly

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.039
bluer while cooler stars look slightly more
red.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.559
And stars are typically different sizes, the
cooler stars being smaller.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.809
As stars evolve and age, depending on their
mass, they expand and eventually puff up as

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.829
red giants and rip themselves to shreds (that’s
what happens to stars about the mass of our

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.510
Sun) and turn into a white dwarf or, if they
are really massive, they explode as supernovas

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.210
before turning into neutron stars or black
holes.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.650
Then there are brown dwarfs, which are sometimes
called failed stars because they just aren’t

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.580
big enough to start the fusion reaction that
makes a star bright.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.430
Brown dwarfs also have planet-like qualities,
making them a kind of bridge between stars

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.510
and planets.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.820
Orbiting all kinds of stars are the planets,
but for a body to be classified as a planet

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.230
it has to meet three additional criteria laid
out by the International Astronomical Union:

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.250
It has to be large enough to be round, it
cannot be a satellite of another body, and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.090
it must have cleared its orbit of all nearby
debris.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.030
This all basically puts a minimum size limit
on planets, but as long and they’re big

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.600
enough planets can come in different types
and sizes.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.460
Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet, as are
Mercury, Venus, and Mars.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.631
The outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune, are called gas giants, though

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.190
those last two are sometimes called ice giants
as well.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.920
When we talk about planets around other stars,
we have slightly different descriptors.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.950
There are super Earths, which aren’t exactly
what they sound like.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.680
These are planets more massive than Earth
but still far less massive than Uranus or

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.670
Neptune, which are 15 and 17 times as massive
as the Earth respectively.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.840
On the other end of the size spectrum are
dwarf planets, planets that are too small

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
to have cleared their orbital path of debris,
like Ceres, the dwarf planet we’ve talked

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.150
about before, in the asteroid belt.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.630
Pluto is a dwarf planet as well, though in
recognition of everyone’s favourite little

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.410
body, the IAU recently designated all dwarf
planets that orbit beyond Neptune as plutoids.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.571
But regardless of size, type, or distance
from its host star, any planet can have a

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.571
moon.

00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:29.120
A moon is a natural satellite, a body that
makes an orbit around a planet.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.420
Moons can have water like Europa, can have
thick atmospheres like Titan, or be, for all

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.010
intents and purposes, a dead world like our
own Moon.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.330
As long as it’s orbiting a planet, it’s
a moon.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.520
Of course, there are more subcategories and
intricacies in individual bodies, but those

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.670
are sort of the basics.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.920
Does that clear things up?
