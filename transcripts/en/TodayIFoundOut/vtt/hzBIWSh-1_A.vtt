00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.630
Her name was Virginia Hall, an American spy
born in Baltimore in 1906.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.170
She attended both Barnard College and Radcliffe
College—two prestigious all-women’s higher

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.160
education facilities—and continued her studies
at schools in France, Germany, and Austria.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.110
She had dreams of a career in foreign service.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.720
At just twenty-five years old, she was appointed
to the position of Consular Service clerk

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.290
at the American Embassy in Warsaw, Poland
and seemed to be well on her way to accomplishing

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.300
her goals.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.050
Unfortunately, shortly after her appointment,
she sustained an injury in a hunting accident—she

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.600
accidentally shot herself in her left leg.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.860
Repairing the leg was beyond the medical technology
of the time, and in 1933 it was amputated

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.970
from the knee down.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.351
Hall was given a prosthetic wooden “peg
leg” to use instead, and seemed to take

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.729
it all in stride.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.700
She later nicknamed the prosthetic leg, which
she would wear the rest of her life, “Cuthbert.”

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.850
Unfortunately, the disability made her ineligible
to pursue her career further.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.020
For the next several years, she worked as
a clerical assistant for the State Department

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.380
in Turkey, Italy, and Estonia, before “hitting
the glass ceiling” in her field of work

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.810
despite a few stunning bullet points on her
resume, such as that she was fluent in Italian,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.159
German, and French.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.681
She resigned in 1939 just as war started to
inch across Europe.

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.320
Being the powerful, ambitious young woman
that she was, Hall didn’t flee the continent

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.280
for the safer shores of her homeland.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.850
Rather, she volunteered as an ambulance driver
in France until the French surrendered in

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.850
1940.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.280
From there, she evacuated to England where
she took up another clerical position at the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.070
American Embassy in London.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.759
Hall soon caught the attention of the British
Special Operations Executive which was looking

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.189
for agents to work with the French resistance.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.560
Thus, in 1941, Hall posed as a correspondent
for the New York Post when she arrived in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560
Lyon, France.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
Her code name was Marie Monin, and she was
the SOE’s very first female agent in France.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
She spent the next fourteen months providing
courier services, helping downed fliers and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.820
runaway POWs escape, and obtaining materials
for clandestine presses.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.000
The sale of press materials, such as paper
and ink, was prohibited, making it difficult

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.410
for resistance newspapers to create and spread
their ideas.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.069
Thanks to help from Hall and others like her,
by 1942 resistance papers had reached over

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.260
two million readers in France.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.129
All the while, Hall continued to send documents
to the New York Post to maintain her cover.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.790
It was during this time that the Germans first
became aware of Virginia Hall.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.470
French double agents had informed them of
the “limping lady” who located drop zones

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.590
for money and weapons and had established
and strengthened resistance networks across

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.590
France.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.810
Needless to say, her laundry list of successful
missions, helping to boost the French resistance,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.260
were starting to make the Germans rather upset.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.090
A “wanted” poster appeared bearing her
likeness, and the Gestapo had clear orders:

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.909
“She is the most dangerous of all Allied
spies.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.200
We must find and destroy her.”

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.350
Germany seized France in 1942.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.010
The SOE said it was too dangerous for Hall
to remain in the country, especially since

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.590
the United States had since joined the war
effort, and in her current disguise she could

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.689
be tortured or killed as the enemy, whether
they discovered she was “the limping lady”

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.689
or not.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.010
She escaped to Spain by walking across the
snowy Pyrenees Mountains on her one good leg

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.010
that November.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.540
In a communique to headquarters on her journey,
Hall said simply, “Cuthbert is giving me

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.970
trouble, but I can cope.”

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.870
She needed to use a codename for her wooden
leg because the Germans were so intent on

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.030
finding her that she worried saying “wooden
leg” would give away her position if the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.829
message was intercepted.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.190
Headquarters misunderstood her meaning and
replied, “If Cuthbert is giving you trouble,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.379
have him eliminated.”

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.680
When she arrived in Spain after a grueling
journey, she was thrown into prison because

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.420
she didn’t have any entry papers.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.079
Six weeks later, she finally managed to smuggle
out a letter to the embassy in Barcelona alerting

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.280
them to her predicament.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
Hall continued with her work for the SOE in
Spain after she was released, but after four

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.549
months, she requested to be transferred elsewhere.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.549
She wrote:

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.879
“I thought I could help in Spain, but I’m
not doing a job.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.510
I am living pleasantly and wasting time.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.290
It isn’t worthwhile and after all, my neck
is my own.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.980
If I’m willing to get a crick in it, I think
that’s my prerogative.”

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.000
Hall made a convincing argument, and after
another brief stint in London—becoming proficient

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.310
in Morse code—she was sent again to France
via a British torpedo boat.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.680
This time, she was working for the United
States Office of Strategic Services.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.650
The mission was incredibly dangerous; the
Germans were still looking for her and if

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.330
she was found she would likely lose her life.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.310
Taking precautions, she disguised herself
as an elderly French milkmaid by dying her

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.040
hair grey, wearing full skirts to hide her
small frame, and walking with a slow, shuffling

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.970
gait to disguise her limp.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.280
She made goat cheese and went into town to
sell it—all the while listening to the oblivious

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.900
German soldiers chatter about their work.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.010
Forced to stay on the move by German forces
attempting to track her radio signals, Hall

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.070
proved a slippery spy and eluded capture.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.460
When she wasn’t listening in on German soldier’s
banter, she trained three battalions of French

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.360
resistance fighters to wage guerrilla warfare
against the Germans.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.380
Before Allied forces overtook her team, Hall
reported that they had destroyed rail lines,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.310
phone lines, bridges, and freight trains,
sabotaging infrastructure necessary to German

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.310
occupation.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.540
The team was credited with killing over 150
German soldiers and capturing 500 more.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.440
For all her efforts during WWII, she was made
an honorary member of the Order of the British

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440
Empire.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.430
She was also awarded the Distinguished Service
Cross, one of the United States’ highest

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.300
military honours—the only civilian woman
to be awarded the medal during World War II.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.111
President Truman wanted a public party to
celebrate the award, but Hall opted for a

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:41.720
private ceremony with just her mother and
General William Joseph Donovan in attendance.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.870
She said she was “still operational and
most anxious to get busy.”

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.390
She didn’t want a public ceremony to make
her face known.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.910
In 1951, Hall joined the CIA, working as a
French parliamentary intelligence analyst.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:10.170
It was quite a feat for a woman who thought
she 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.100
had reached the glass ceiling a decade before.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.780
By the time she retired in 1966, Hall had
shattered the glass ceiling and expectations

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.640
for women in her line of work—and all on
just one leg.
