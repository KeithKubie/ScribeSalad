[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.750
CAROLYN ALBURGER: I'm really
excited to be here today,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.950
sitting with Andy Ricker, who
is a known Thai food expert.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.780
He is a big part
of actually pushing

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.750
our American consciousness
around Thai food,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.290
and understanding of it
beyond pad thai, green curry,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.410
the things you see in so many
restaurants here in America.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.694
He has Pok Poks
in Portland and--

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:31.610
ANDY RICKER: New York.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.740
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
New York restaurants.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.190
He has won a James Beard
award, which is hard to get,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.790
so I hear.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.150
ANDY RICKER: Two.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.230
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Two?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.070
Two?

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.640
ANDY RICKER: Be accurate.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.015
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
In which years?

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:42.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.473
ANDY RICKER: Well, I won
for best chef one year

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:46.110
and I won for
writing another year.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.820
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Oh, nice.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.319
I didn't know about
the writing one.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.080
Wow, so many talents.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.120
And you've published your
second cookbook this year,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.030
which is why we're
all here today.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.384
It's called "The Drinking
Food of Thailand".

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:00.800
Before we dive
into that, I wanted

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.133
to ask you guys in the audience
quickly, how many of you

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.210
have been to Thailand?

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.710
Nice.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.085
ANDY RICKER: Wow,
a bunch of you.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:08.190
That's great.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.231
CAROLYN ALBURGER: And then how
many have been to a Pok Pok?

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:11.730
Very cool.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.720
ANDY RICKER: The same people.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.080
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yeah.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.970
ANDY RICKER: Except for you.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.120
OK.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.920
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Not super surprising.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.420
Well, great.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.490
So there are some people that
aren't fully acquainted, maybe,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.210
with your restaurants,
so I thought

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.410
it might be good for you
to dive into your expertise

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.890
and how you got here.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.494
You don't look like you're Thai.

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:29.160
ANDY RICKER: No.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.550
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Am I right?

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.760
OK.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.718
ANDY RICKER: It's true.

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:32.290
You're very right about that.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.460
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So
how did we get here?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.230
ANDY RICKER: So the
question, how did I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.230
start a Thai restaurant?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.500
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Your journey
to becoming a Thai food expert,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.204
basically.

00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:42.620
ANDY RICKER: Well,
first of all, I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.930
want to say that I don't
consider myself an expert.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.440
I consider myself
more of a student.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.280
And how I got here
was by traveling.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.284
Essentially, that's
the way, in my opinion,

00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:57.450
that's the best way to live.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.830
If you're curious
about something

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.417
that is a living culture, or
living art form or cuisine

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:05.250
or something that comes
from somewhere else,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.410
you go there and check it out.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.160
I went there initially as
a backpacker in the '80s,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.140
and I wasn't really
looking for anything

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.150
except for a good time.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.590
Which I had.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
And I went again
in the early '90s.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.920
'92, to be exact.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.310
And I had a really good friend
of mine who was living there

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.090
who had married a local woman
who worked at the university

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.890
as a professor.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.050
And they were-- she
is from Chiang Mai,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.030
and that's where
he had settled in.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.600
So they introduced me
to the local cuisine

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.280
while I was there, which was--

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880
they introduced me to
some seasonal dishes.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.380
ANDY RICKER: I
didn't really realize

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.780
that there was such a
thing as seasonal food when

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.030
it comes to Thai food,
because my experience was

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.889
much like a lot of other
folks in America, which

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.430
is that you get your experience
by going to a Thai restaurant

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.270
here.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.027
And for many, many years--
things are changing a lot now.

00:03:03.027 --> 00:03:05.110
Over the last 10 years,
things have changed a lot.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.070
But during that time
it was basically

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.400
the same menu wherever you
went and it never changed.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.930
So being in Chiang Mai
and being introduced

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.120
to a dish that was local,
seasonal, regional,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.550
was really kind of shocking.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.580
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
What was that dish?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.180
Do you remember?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.513
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, I mean,
I've told this story probably

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:30.460
a million times, but it's
a dish called gang het pok.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.970
Het-top is a type of mushroom.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.070
It looks like a puffball.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.010
It's kind of really
dark brown, it

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.610
has kind of a bitter taste to
it, very earthy and bitter,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.740
but it's really
prized wild mushroom.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.630
So right around
March, April, they

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.200
start coming up in the
forest and people--

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.590
in Chiang Mai, I lived in
a small village about 20

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.050
kilometers north of Chiang Mai.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.660
And during het-top
season, if you

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.330
try to go to the
market in the village,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.132
as soon as the het-top
start popping up,

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:01.840
all of a sudden all
the shops are closed.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.120
You're like, where is everybody?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.480
Why?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.710
And they're like, oh, they're
off gathering het-top,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.095
because het-top gets
200 baht a kilo or more.

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:13.200
And, you go get them for
free out of the forest. .

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.075
ANDY RICKER: So they're
really highly prized,

00:04:16.075 --> 00:04:19.980
but they only come up
for about a month, month

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.240
and a half out of the year.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.580
And when they come up,
they make some dishes

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.220
using that particular mushroom.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.660
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Amazing.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.580
ANDY RICKER: And
so that was the way

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.330
that I first connected
with the idea

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.770
that there was something
regional, local, seasonal--

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.040
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Ephemeral.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.400
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, like just
like regional American food

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.100
or Spanish food or Italian
food or French food

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.750
or anywhere where there's
a regional, seasonal type

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.589
cuisine.

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:55.130
CAROLYN ALBURGER: And from there
you just kind of got hooked,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.470
and you kept going
back to Thailand

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.660
and just became a real
true student of the food,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.200
sounds like.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.491
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, I started
going back again and again

00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:03.080
and again.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.927
And at first, it
was very tentative,

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:08.510
because I couldn't
speak the language.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.077
I couldn't read-- still
can't read the language--

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:13.910
and I didn't really
know that much about it,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.440
so I was relying on
my friends to guide

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.199
me, and friends of friends.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.990
I was just spending
all my time in markets,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.000
walking around looking
at stuff, slowly

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.220
learning how to speak the
language, until I started

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.670
to gain enough knowledge that
I could kind of start really

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.852
delving into it.

00:05:32.852 --> 00:05:34.310
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
And at that time,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.690
what were you doing for work?

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.590
Were you a cook, were you--

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.780
ANDY RICKER: OK,
so initially, I was

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.931
working as a cook or a
sous chef or whatever.

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:45.180
CAROLYN ALBURGER: In Portland?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.500
ANDY RICKER: In Portland,
yeah, it was mostly Portland

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.730
at this point.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.957
And then I started being
a painting contractor.

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.040
I was a painting contractor
for about eight years.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.460
And what that
allowed me to do was

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.830
I'd work really
hard from the spring

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.435
through the end of summer
into the holiday season,

00:06:03.435 --> 00:06:05.810
and then work would dry up
over the holiday season, which

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.750
was perfect, so I
could go to Thailand

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.550
and hang out for a
couple of months.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.830
And so that happened
every year, and that

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.090
was where I really
started digging in,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.200
during the mid-90s up
to the early 2000s.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So
let's talk about the book.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.615
The title is interesting,
"Drinking Food of Thailand",

00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:26.046
not "Thai Drinking Food".

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:27.170
ANDY RICKER: You know what?

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.270
I actually had a
little bit of a battle

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.802
with the editor over that.

00:06:31.802 --> 00:06:33.260
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Tell us about it.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.406
ANDY RICKER: OK, so--

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:35.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.290
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Tell
us about the fight.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.831
ANDY RICKER: It
wasn't a major fight.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.600
The first, we had a huge
fight about the photograph

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.380
on the first book.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.350
This was-- so the title of
it is [SPEAKING THAI],, which

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.800
means food with whiskey.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.230
[SPEAKING THAI]

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.320
And "The Drinking
Food of Thailand"

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.180
is, instead of "Thai
Drinking Food",

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.975
when you say-- when
I think of Thai food,

00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.600
I'm thinking of the
center of Thailand.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.720
I'm thinking of the
Thai people, and they're

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.765
the dominant culture.

00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:08.390
But they're not the
only culture there.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.810
There's the people of the
north, the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.520
and then there's subgroups
of ethnic groups, Yong,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.586
[? Hmong, ?] that type of thing.

00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:20.210
If you look back far
enough in history,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.720
you see that the Thai people are
the most dominant culture now,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.460
but they weren't always.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.080
And the language of the north
is different from the language

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.770
of the center is different from
the language of the northeast ,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.640
which is where mostly Lao
and Khmer people live.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.260
The climates are very different.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.390
Staple rices are different.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.210
The very south of Thailand
has its own culture, language,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.570
and food.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.100
And so when you say Thai
food to a Thai person,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.530
say we're in Chiang Mai
and you say to your friend,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.030
you want to go out
and eat, and they

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.950
say, what do you want to
eat, if you say Thai food,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.780
you're talking about
central Thai food.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.980
You're going to go eat--

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.420
or you want to eat
Issan food, you

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.530
want to go find a
northeastern restaurant.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.180
Or if you want to
eat Thai-Yai food,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.980
you're going to go eat
Shan Thai-Yai food,

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.030
it's not Thai food.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.030
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.570
ANDY RICKER: So I
know it seems petty,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.090
but I kind of went to the mat
with them, because they wanted

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.590
to say "Thai Drinking Food",
I'm like, no, really, it's not,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.680
because we're going the
country a little bit

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.940
and cherry-picking things.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.520
And some of the food
that's featured in here

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.470
has nothing to do with Thai,
central Thai food at all.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.100
So that was important to me
to make that distinction.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.210
In a lot of ways, that's
kind of what I've attempted

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.970
to do with the restaurants and
the books since the beginning,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.980
is kind of point out that
Thailand isn't a monoculture.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.280
Though if you ask somebody
from Thailand who's from Issan,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.320
they still feel Thai.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.420
ANDY RICKER: But there's a
back history to everything

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.399
that's not apparent.

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:51.440
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Got it.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.270
ANDY RICKER: It helps
to define the food.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.410
It helps people understand the
food itself and how to eat it,

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.950
and how it fits into the
context of the culture.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.480
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
So I'm guessing

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.810
that you can't get any
of this food in any

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.879
of your restaurants.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.920
ANDY RICKER: No, you can.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.130
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.000
ANDY RICKER: You
can, absolutely.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.570
We have a restaurant in
Portland called the Whiskey Soda

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.840
Lounge, which is dedicated
to this food, actually.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.071
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Amazing.

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:16.820
So if people are just
picking up this book

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.403
for the first time,
which I'm guessing

00:09:18.403 --> 00:09:21.170
a lot of people in the
audience here will be doing,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.310
is there a good icebreaker
recipe in the book?

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.820
A nice starting place?

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.810
ANDY RICKER: There is.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.270
Probably one of
my favorite dishes

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.040
in the genre is
something called yam

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.030
met mamuang himaphaan,
which is long--

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.230
CAROLYN ALBURGER: What page?

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.980
ANDY RICKER: It should
be pretty early on.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.420
It's in salads.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.540
But essentially it's a very long
way of saying cashew nut salad.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.210
So really, it's
very, very simple.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.780
You just roast cashew
nuts, either dry or in oil,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.250
and then you sprinkle salt,
scallions, and chilies

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.497
or top of it.

00:09:53.497 --> 00:09:55.080
And then you just
eat it with a spoon.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.400
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
That looks easy.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.600
ANDY RICKER: It's about
as easy as it gets.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.058
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
This is a recipe?

00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:00.990
ANDY RICKER: It's a
recipe, believe it or not.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.480
And that picture-- you see
the picture that's taken.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.250
I should talk a little bit--

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.050
show them the picture, yeah.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.977
So that was taken
at a karaoke in--

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.310
I'm trying to remember where
we were when we took this--

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:20.460
I think we were in Ang
Thong, north of Bangkok,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.350
when we took that, at a hotel.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:28.140
They had like a karaoke slash
stage shows place cabaret.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.327
And it's the table
number 35, there,

00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:31.410
in case you didn't notice.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.860
CAROLYN ALBURGER: I see that.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.360
So cool.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.540
So these are pictures
directly from your travels.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.456
ANDY RICKER: So what we
did was we went around

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:40.320
and we took photographs
of the food--

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.620
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
There's the karaoke bar.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.203
ANDY RICKER: That's
a different place.

00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:47.924
That's in Bangkok at
a Isaan-style cabaret.

00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:49.590
We went to these
various different types

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.640
of drinking establishments
and we shot the dishes there.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.620
They'd bring it, put it
on the table, and bam,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.680
we'd shoot it with a
hard flash to make it

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.260
so that the vibe should
feel kind of like you're

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.730
out somewhere at night.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.364
But that dish
itself is something

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:07.530
that you can find almost
anywhere where you're going

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.640
to go out and go drinking.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.900
Side of the road, anywhere
where they can cook stuff.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.150
It's such an easy thing to do.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.732
And people love it so much.

00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:15.690
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yeah.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.755
ANDY RICKER: And it's kind
of-- if you think about it,

00:11:16.755 --> 00:11:18.330
it's kind of perfect
drinking food.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.670
It's hot, it's nutty
and salty, crunchy,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.770
and it goes great
with beer and whiskey.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.640
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So
like a really good thing

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.847
to just throw together if
you're having people over

00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:29.430
and you want--

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.888
ANDY RICKER: You're watching
the football game or whatever.

00:11:31.888 --> 00:11:32.550
Yeah.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.800
It looks really dopey
simple, almost lazy,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.644
but it's one of the most
delicious things in the book.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:38.810
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Very cool.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.700
ANDY RICKER: Really good.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.810
CAROLYN ALBURGER: How about
something that is like

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.280
more labor-intensive, maybe
a little more daunting,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.640
but you just think it's so
amazing, you're so proud of it,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.140
and it's worth the
effort for people

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.050
to maybe spend a whole day
finding the ingredients

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.920
and cooking it?

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.500
ANDY RICKER: So one of the
premises of the book was,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.680
first of all, was to go
out and shoot it and then

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.230
do the recipes later.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.880
The other one was to have
a little bit of discovery

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.250
during the process
of making the book,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.880
like trying to find a new
dish or some interesting way

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.550
of cooking that I hadn't had
before in the process of making

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.050
the book.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.490
So there's this
one dish called sii

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:21.330
khrong muu tai naam, which means
pork ribs cooked underwater.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.740
And it's kind of a punny thing.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:29.290
Essentially, the trick
is that you pound up

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.530
a paste of aromatics and chilies
and garlic and stuff like that,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.300
and then you mix it either with
chicken wings or with pork ribs

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.670
and you put it into a pot with
maybe just a little bit of oil,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.600
but not much.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.700
And then you fire it up and
you put a bowl of ice water

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700
on top of it.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.420
And the ice water seals
the top of the pot.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.065
And as the moisture from
the cooking paste and meat

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:55.330
and everything, hits
the bottom of the bowl,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.520
it condenses and drops
back down into the pot.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.370
Now, how did I find this?

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.165
In the weirdest place,
I was in Slovenia.

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:06.670
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Not Thailand.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.160
ANDY RICKER: Not Thailand.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.743
But I was traveling with a good
friend of mine, this guy named

00:13:10.743 --> 00:13:13.860
David Thompson, who is a really
well-known Thai chef, also,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:19.400
obviously, not Thai, and his
sous chef, [? Pot, ?] said hey,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.049
have you ever heard of
this dish, tai naam?

00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:25.090
And I was like, no, I
never heard of that before.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:25.260
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yeah.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.260
ANDY RICKER: And he
explained it to me.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.710
So when I got to Thailand,
I started looking into it

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.270
and I asked a few people around.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.230
It turns out it's kind an Isaan
thing, a northeastern thing.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.112
And I didn't have a recipe.

00:13:36.112 --> 00:13:38.070
So I just kind of looked
around on the internet

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.470
to see if there was
anybody who was making it.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.200
I couldn't find anybody
in Chiang Mai area

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.269
that actually made it.

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.560
It's kind of-- I think it's
more kind of like something

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.730
that people do at home.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.270
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.436
ANDY RICKER: So I talked
to some friends from Isaan.

00:13:50.436 --> 00:13:52.940
They're like, oh, yeah,
yeah, it's this whole thing.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.556
So it was described,
like they described

00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:58.680
the various different things
you would put into it,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.450
so I just kind of tried it.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.640
And it took me probably
about six or eight

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.170
times to get it right.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.200
But it's a really
interesting technique.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.340
It's a delicious dish.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.150
It kind of smothers
the meat in this paste

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.830
and kind of sticks to the
ribs and it's really, really

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.226
spicy, really savory,
and if you want

00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:20.100
to impress somebody with
your cooking skills,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.809
it's a good one.

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:22.350
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
That's really cool.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.766
That story is so
interesting, too.

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:25.229
So you never actually
found someone

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:26.270
cooking it in their home?

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.686
ANDY RICKER: No,
I never found it.

00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:28.382
No, I didn't.

00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:30.090
CAROLYN ALBURGER: But
you know it exists,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.180
that people were making it.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.030
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, and
I talked to some people,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.830
some Isaan people about it,
and they were like, oh yeah,

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.390
we used to do that
with a whole chicken.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.770
Some people would
take a whole chicken

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.210
and chop it up and
do it, or some people

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.830
say we would just
do it with wings.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.420
But I thought it would
be really good with pork

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.980
because it would
allow it to cook

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.590
for a longer period of time.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.351
So anyway.

00:14:48.351 --> 00:14:49.350
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Smart.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.150
Wow.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.180
That's very cool.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.970
ANDY RICKER: That's the
chef-y bit of me coming out.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.430
I normally don't exercise that.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.846
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Well, you
are a chef, so we expect that.

00:14:57.846 --> 00:14:59.622
ANDY RICKER: That's
what they tell me.

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:01.080
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
So I know there's

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.290
a lot of maybe hard to find
ingredients in this book.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.540
I would love for you to
talk about some of those.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.124
Maybe--

00:15:07.124 --> 00:15:08.040
ANDY RICKER: Here, no.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.380
I think you guys are tight here.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.910
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
In San Francisco?

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.326
ANDY RICKER: There's very few
things that are in this book

00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:17.180
that you can't get in a
good southeast Asian market

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.170
in San Francisco.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.430
This particular book.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.480
There's a few things.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.231
Like occasionally, like for
one of the recipes for larb,

00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:26.730
there's a few spices
that are really

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.640
difficult to get
a hold of that you

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.340
have to really hunt it down.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.360
I found them in New York
through a purveyor there,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.060
and I bet if there's
anybody from Chiang Mai that

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.470
lives here, or
northern Thailand,

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.555
you probably would be able to
find a few of these things.

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:42.690
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.398
ANDY RICKER: There's
one called Makhwaen,

00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:47.220
which is kind of a black prickly
ash, relative of prickly ash.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.110
It's relatively hard to find.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.180
There's no real substitute for.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.091
CAROLYN ALBURGER: What
does that tastes like?

00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:54.924
ANDY RICKER: Kind of
like black prickly ash.

00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:55.338
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:56.580
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Delicious.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.496
I was thinking of just the
numbing, spicy peppercorns.

00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:00.870
ANDY RICKER: It's
peppery, but it

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.630
doesn't have that numbing,
that really numbing flavor

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.900
that Sichuan peppercorns have.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:11.520
And it's kind of got a bitter,
very distinctive flavor that

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.190
is not entirely unlike
Sichuan peppercorn,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.600
but also not quite
like it either.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.935
I think that that
particular type of tree,

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:21.810
I think there's a lot
of different varieties,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.100
a bunch of different variety.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.270
There's green, red,
black, and then

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.930
a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.340
The trees are amazing.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.930
The trees for the Sichuan--

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.805
I don't know if you've
ever seen them before,

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:35.580
but the trunks have these
crazy spikes on them.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.670
So whoever decided to climb one
to get the stuff out of there

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.070
the first time was
a real daredevil.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.250
CAROLYN ALBURGER: A
real hero of cooking.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.500
ANDY RICKER: It might not
have lived to tell the tale.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.874
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Are there
things that you have to order

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:48.540
online?

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.720
Like certain things that you--

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.040
ANDY RICKER: Again, really, I
think if you look around here,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.380
you're going to find
everything you need.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.630
Perhaps if you live
in Kansas City,

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.130
you might have to order stuff
online or use frozen things.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.640
But here I think
you're pretty good.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.040
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Awesome.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.750
So how about, if
people are going

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.680
to get this book for someone
for Christmas or as a gift,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.630
is there some kind of
a companion gift you

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.349
think might be good with it?

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.829
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, a bottle of
whiskey or six-pack of beer,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.720
I think, is probably the
best companion for it.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.260
CAROLYN ALBURGER: That would
be the most festive, for sure.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:23.790
ANDY RICKER: And
you probably want

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.540
to get it for somebody
who likes to drink.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.910
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yes.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.460
Actually, I'm
interested to know--

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.110
ANDY RICKER: Mortar and pestle.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.910
CAROLYN ALBURGER: A
mortar and pestle?

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.200
ANDY RICKER: I
mean, really, it's

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.090
really difficult to make
this food without a mortar

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.780
and pestle.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:33.990
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.365
ANDY RICKER: I don't really
know how to do it without it.

00:17:36.365 --> 00:17:39.390
So what you want is a
granite mortar and pestle.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.000
You should have one of those
anyway, if you're into cooking.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.166
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So where
do you find one of those?

00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.030
Do they have it at
Williams Sonoma?

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.280
ANDY RICKER: They might have
like a little crappy one.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.070
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right, I
know, because you said granite,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.730
so I'm like--

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.770
ANDY RICKER: You want to go
to a southeast Asian market,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.978
and they typically have them.

00:17:53.978 --> 00:17:57.140
They range in size
from this to this.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.140
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.980
ANDY RICKER:
Typically you can find

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.710
some that are about that big,
and try to get the biggest one

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.960
you can find, because it's
not going to be that big.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.410
And you can make
curry pastes in it.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.260
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Does almost
every recipe require that tool?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.343
ANDY RICKER: Almost every.

00:18:11.343 --> 00:18:11.970
Not all.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.164
The yam met mamuang
himaphaan doesn't.

00:18:14.164 --> 00:18:15.820
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.770
Noted.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.365
So that's just kind of
like a part of the pomp--

00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:23.490
not the pomp and circumstance--
but the preparation

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.620
of most Thai dishes,
is that people whip out

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.980
their mortar and pestle and
they're just smashing together

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.690
flavors.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.856
ANDY RICKER: I can give you
a story about that, too.

00:18:31.856 --> 00:18:34.920
So the name of the
restaurant, Pok Pok,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.045
is the sound of the
pestle hitting a mortar.

00:18:37.045 --> 00:18:37.920
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.890
ANDY RICKER: So the way that
I came up with that name

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:47.100
was many years ago, I was on
the diesel railcar from Khorat

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.960
back to Bangkok.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.530
And I'd come from all
the way up in Chiang Mai

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.360
and I'd come all the
way down through Isaan

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.350
and ended up in Khorat
or Ubon Ratchathani,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.370
and I went there to
eat larb, duck larb.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.740
And I was on the rail
car back to Bangkok

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.750
and I was sitting in
third class because I

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.730
was a broke-ass backpacker.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.290
And there were some folks there
who were workers from Isaan who

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.560
were going back to Bangkok
after the holidays,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.570
and we started talking.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.220
And they said, why are you here?

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.540
Why did you come to Khorat?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.391
Because at the time,
there were very few--

00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:28.140
there were some ex-pats
there but not many

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.320
tourists, even though
it's one of the biggest

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.970
metropolitan areas
in all of Thailand.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.100
Huge, the second
or third largest

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.450
in all of Thailand by size.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.130
And I said, well,
I want to eat food.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.480
And I named a few of the dishes.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.271
And they're like, oh,
you like to eat that.

00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:48.180
Can you cook too?

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.330
And I was like, yeah,
I can cook some things.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.965
And I said, yes, can you cook?

00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:57.360
And he said yeah,
pok, pok, pok, pok,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.364
making the motion of the
pestle hitting the mortar.

00:20:00.364 --> 00:20:02.280
CAROLYN ALBURGER: And
you were like, I got it.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.570
ANDY RICKER: Yeah.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.840
But it was very much an a-ha
moment, because in his mind,

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.880
he connected the idea of cooking
with the mortar and pestle.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880
That was immediate.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.410
He didn't kind of go like--

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.000
like that or-- he
was like pok, pok,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.640
it was mortar and
pestle right away.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.540
So it is literally--

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.480
there is no way to cook
Thai food without a mortar

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.600
and pestle that I know of,
that is going to give you

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.250
results that are anywhere near
what I think they should be.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.060
You can use-- some people use
blenders or food processors

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.750
or stuff, but there's
something about it

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.480
that's not quite right right.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.014
CAROLYN ALBURGER: As far as
drinking goes, I noticed--

00:20:46.014 --> 00:20:47.430
I was skimming
through the book, I

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.054
noticed you talk about a lot of
things that you can't get here,

00:20:50.054 --> 00:20:53.250
like some kind of Thai beer
that I've never heard of,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.530
rice whiskey.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.960
What do you recommend that
people drink with this food

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.220
here in San Francisco?

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.850
I'm guessing it's not going
to be a Sonoma Cabernet

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:03.970
or something like that.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.430
ANDY RICKER: Well, you can
drink whatever you want.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.804
Wine's actually
started to become

00:21:06.804 --> 00:21:09.150
quite popular in Thailand
with the upper middle class.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.920
It's kind of a luxury item and
kind of a big face thing to do,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.270
is buy wine.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.110
There's actually a couple
of wineries in Thailand now.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.540
They're not good, but
that's to be expected.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.750
It's not quite grape
growing country.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.760
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.370
ANDY RICKER: So beer
is probably the thing

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.440
you're going to have the
easiest time drinking--

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.900
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
That makes sense.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.820
ANDY RICKER: --using
as the main booze.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:45.720
But Thailand is a rice
liquor country, historically.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.660
Beer started out as
a luxury item there.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.654
For a lot of folks, I'd say
the vast majority of the poorer

00:21:51.654 --> 00:21:53.070
folks who live in
the countryside,

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.870
it's still a luxury item.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.000
So it was introduced to
Thailand back probably

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.760
60 or 70 years ago,
maybe a little longer,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.540
but it was imported from
Germany or Holland or something

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.560
like that.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.937
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Which brands?

00:22:05.937 --> 00:22:07.770
ANDY RICKER: Back then,
I couldn't tell you.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.640
I don't know.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:08.925
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Because now it's

00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:10.876
mostly the Chang and
the Singha, right?

00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:12.500
ANDY RICKER: And
there's a story there.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.310
It's actually in the book.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.560
I know this guy named
Nick Bhirom Bhakdi.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.910
He's the grandson of
the founder of Singha.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.800
And the Singha family is--

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.070
the Bhirom Bhakdi family
is very high [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.170
family in Thailand.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.220
They're very, very rich.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.947
They own Singha.

00:22:29.947 --> 00:22:31.530
They're connected
to the royal family.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.720
All that kind of stuff.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.726
And Nick's grandfather used
to own a ferry company that

00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.100
went across the
Chao Phraya river

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.490
from Bangkok to Bangkok Noi.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:49.000
And he started
seeing the motorcars

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.560
coming into play,
and then bridges

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.060
being built across
the river, and he

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.690
could see that his business
was probably not going

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.297
to be as strong in the future.

00:22:58.297 --> 00:23:00.130
So he started looking
for ways to diversify,

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.820
and he had studied in
Germany, and his brother

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.440
was in Germany as
well, studying,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.450
and come back as an engineer.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.370
Sent his brother back
to Germany to learn

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.140
how to be a brewmaster.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.390
His brother went back, learned
how to be a brewmaster,

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.350
came back, and they started
brewing beer, for which

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.630
there was almost no market.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.882
So he spent, I think,
the first few years

00:23:22.882 --> 00:23:24.340
that they were
open, several years,

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.560
they brewed like four or five
different brands of beer.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.580
And he went and he'd go to
towns and he put on a movie

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.440
night, give people
beer to taste.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.760
Out of the five or six
different formulas they had,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.560
the one that stuck
was the Singha,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.990
which is a kind
of a tiger-like--

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.930
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
A little bit sweet.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.181
ANDY RICKER: Well, the singha
is a mythological creature

00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:47.680
and it--

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.180
kind of tigery.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.870
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
It's a griffin, right?

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:50.830
ANDY RICKER: But
the beer itself--

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.550
yeah, kind of.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.050
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
It looks like one.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.485
ANDY RICKER: The beer
itself was whatever.

00:23:55.485 --> 00:23:56.860
It was the one
that people liked.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.210
So that's what they stuck
with and they got rid

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.126
of all the other crap.

00:23:59.126 --> 00:23:59.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.932
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Smart.

00:24:00.932 --> 00:24:02.650
It's not rocket science.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.650
ANDY RICKER: And then they did
a couple of really sneaky moves,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.350
which was to kind of
petition the crown

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.090
to kind of make it
difficult for other people

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.190
to compete with them.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.680
So that's why there's only
a couple of beers left.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.380
There's some really
arcane laws there,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.254
where it's basically
counter to what

00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:22.420
you would think it would be.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.490
You can only
commercially produce beer

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.335
if you produce a huge
amount at a time.

00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:28.210
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.126
ANDY RICKER: And sell a
huge amount at a time.

00:24:30.126 --> 00:24:33.220
So if you produce less than
that amount, you can't sell it.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.890
You can sell it in
your own establishment,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.924
but you can't sell
it commercially,

00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:40.090
which has been really
problematic for the people who

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.423
are into craft beer in Thailand,
because they can either

00:24:42.423 --> 00:24:47.170
import stuff at great expense,
or they can they can make it

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.880
but they can't really
sell it outside

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.950
of their own little pub.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:56.050
So they've had a kind of a
lock on the beer industry

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.600
there for decades,
decades, and decades.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.790
Slowly starting to change now.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.490
But even then,
beer was a luxury.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.160
And today, say you're
working on a rice farm

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.400
or you're working in a
factory, your median wage

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.010
there is probably around--

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.400
I think they'd pumped it up
to closer to 500 baht a day

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.010
and then they just cut the
minimum wage, recently,

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.760
back down to like 310 baht
a day or 270 baht a day.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.600
So it's possible--

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.920
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Is that
because the president

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.760
died, right?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.220
ANDY RICKER: It's because the
military took over and the--

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.290
it's long, we won't get
into the politics of it.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.290
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Outside
the scope of the talk.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.770
ANDY RICKER: There was
some populist shit that

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.895
was going on for a long
time that kind of got axed,

00:25:37.895 --> 00:25:44.140
and that was one of the
things that was very populist.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.500
The upshot of it is
that if you're a worker

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:53.320
and you're making 300 baht a
day, which is roughly $9 a day,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.150
and you go to 7-Eleven
and you buy a beer,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.510
it might cost you 100 baht
for a big bottle of beer,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.700
95 to 100 baht for a
large bottle of beer.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.630
But you can also go down
to the local Lao Khao stand

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.690
and you can buy a whole bottle
of rice whiskey for 80 baht.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.390
CAROLYN ALBURGER: That's when I
was reading about in the book.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.181
ANDY RICKER: Right.

00:26:10.181 --> 00:26:12.520
You can-- one bottle of
beer gets nobody fucked up,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.130
and one bottle of whiskey
gets four people fucked up.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.180
So it's a matter of economics.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.020
Plus it's a rice
culture going back

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.680
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.570
And so people are
used to drinking that.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.700
So that was-- a lot
of these things were

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.650
kind of made with that in mind.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.790
Now if you want to try to
replicate that here, go

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.490
and buy the cheapest
crappiest shochu you can find.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.790
And that approximates
what kind of a crappy

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.510
Lao Khao, or [? white ?]
whiskey will be like.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.010
Same thing.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.070
It's distilled from
rice typically,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.710
unless it's distilled
from barley or-- just look

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.590
for a rice-based shochu
that's not too expensive,

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.962
and you can get an idea of
what Lao Khao tastes like.

00:26:56.962 --> 00:26:58.420
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Sounds delicious.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.410
ANDY RICKER: It's fantastic.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.850
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So
when I was in Thailand,

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.940
I remember people telling me
that the beer was unregulated

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.280
and that there was amphetamines
in some of the Chang.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.020
ANDY RICKER: That's a total lie.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.280
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK,
I just had to ask.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.320
I know that's off topic,
but I was just curious.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.278
ANDY RICKER: I think what
they're talking about

00:27:16.278 --> 00:27:18.850
is that there's rumors
out there, that I'm not

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.500
sure whether
they're true or not,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.685
that the alcohol content isn't
regulated from batch to batch.

00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:27.020
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yes, I
remember hearing that too.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.440
ANDY RICKER: So that
sometimes you get the beer

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.730
and it's stronger than others.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.313
I don't know that
that's true anymore.

00:27:32.313 --> 00:27:35.457
I think that the beer making
in Thailand is very modernized

00:27:35.457 --> 00:27:37.540
and there's a lot of
controls and stuff like that.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.430
I doubt that's true anymore.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.260
But Chang, the
thing is that when

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.070
Chang came out and started
competing with Singha,

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.060
they did two things.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.775
They made it cheaper and
they made it stronger.

00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:49.650
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.025
ANDY RICKER: So that was
their-- and they made it sweeter

00:27:52.025 --> 00:27:54.330
and that was why Chang got
really, really popular.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:59.280
And Singha battled that by
producing Leo beer which

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.420
also is a little stronger,
cheaper, but not as sweet,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.540
a little lighter.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.070
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right, so
it's diversifying a little bit.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.939
ANDY RICKER: Yeah.

00:28:05.939 --> 00:28:07.230
And that happened a while back.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.850
CAROLYN ALBURGER: All right.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.090
So I'm kind of also
curious-- this doesn't

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.430
have to do with the book, but
I'm wondering, as a traveler,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.770
how you avoid tourist traps.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.930
I'm sure you're
pretty good at that.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.680
How do you make sure
you get the food

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.740
the people in the
country are eating

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.920
and not the crappy
diluted version of that?

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.010
ANDY RICKER: I think it's
important to not think about it

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.410
so much as, if I go
off the beaten track,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.510
I'm going to find
the true stuff,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.800
because unless you read Thai
and you know what you're looking

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.380
for, like you actually
know what to look for,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.910
like you know the
names of the dish,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.080
you know where you're
going to find it,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.780
you know what the good one is
going to be, you can read Thai

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.040
or you're with somebody
who can read Thai, that

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.180
trusts you're going to
be able to eat the food,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.513
you're going have a very
difficult time finding anything

00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:53.220
at all.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.130
And likewise, if you're in
the middle of a tourist trap,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.750
there's always some
good food there,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.950
because the people who work
in the tourist traps eat too.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.260
So if you go to, say,
MBK, Mahboonkrong,

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.800
is the most famous
mall, even though it's

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.590
kind of the oldest
and crappiest one now.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.090
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
And where is that?

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.190
ANDY RICKER: It's
near Siam Square

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.360
in the center of Bangkok.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.100
CAROLYN ALBURGER: OK.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.894
ANDY RICKER: And you
go inside, there's

00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:21.060
all these food courts there.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.610
And some are quite flashy,
and there's the place

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.870
where all the tourists go.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.390
But there's also a food
court on the fifth floor

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.930
in the back corner that's run
by Isaan folks, that's actually

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:35.040
really bang-on, hardcore,
country-style Isaan food

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.194
right in the mall.

00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:38.610
And that's where all the people
that work there go to eat.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:44.700
So you don't have to go off the
beaten path to find good food.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.330
You have to be willing to
dig in and see what's there.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.240
And the best advice I can give
is go to where the people who

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.430
are working where--

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.385
like you go to the airport,
you go to Suvarnabhumi Airport,

00:29:58.385 --> 00:30:01.175
you go down to the bottom
level where the taxicabs are,

00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:02.550
and you go all
the way to the end

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.990
and there's a
cafeteria in there.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.740
There's a food court.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.906
That's where all the people
that work in the airport

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:07.590
go for lunch.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.060
And it's actually really good.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.070
Same story at Don Muang.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.050
There's a place there
that all the workers

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.210
go that's really good.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.500
So you can be on
Patpong Road, or you

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.139
could go to Khao
San or something,

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:22.680
you're still going
to find good food.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.650
You just have to look
for it a little bit.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.567
Does that makes sense?

00:30:25.567 --> 00:30:27.191
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Yeah, I mean you just

00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.470
have to kind of watch where--

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.430
you have to pay attention.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.690
You have to have your
eyes open and watch

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.810
where people that live
there are going, basically.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.790
ANDY RICKER: Now, the good
thing is that nowadays there is

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.320
such a thing as the internet.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.890
So you can go on the internet
and go, best food in this area.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.570
And there's going to be some
English-speaking local or

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.880
English-speaking ex-pat
that lives in the area who's

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.260
mapped all these places.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.955
And you can find
them because there'll

00:30:50.955 --> 00:30:52.580
be pictures of the
damn place, there'll

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.785
be a pin dropped on it.

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.410
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Do
you feel like it's

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.140
getting harder, though, as
Thailand gets more touristy?

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.710
I know that tourism has
really exploded there

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.397
in the past eight
years, probably.

00:31:03.397 --> 00:31:04.980
ANDY RICKER: I don't
know that tourism

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.500
is at fault with the
changing food culture there.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.597
I think it's mostly
having to do with--

00:31:09.597 --> 00:31:10.930
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Globalization?

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.020
ANDY RICKER: Yeah,
globalization, modernization,

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.477
the existence of a middle class,
speaking about urban areas.

00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:20.340
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.830
ANDY RICKER: You know, the
tastes of the Thai people

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.160
are changing, but you
can still find things

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.710
made as they were decades ago.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.480
Still can.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.290
Still look a little bit hard.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.206
CAROLYN ALBURGER: The
question of authenticity

00:31:33.206 --> 00:31:34.680
is one that I know
comes up a lot.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.450
I feel like it makes
sense to talk about that.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.080
ANDY RICKER: Sure.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.920
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
It's definitely been

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.720
in the media a
lot lately, people

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.110
debating the authenticity
of certain foods.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.710
And I'm sure that you get
asked this question a lot.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.840
But how do you deal
with naysayers or people

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.369
that challenge the
authenticity of your cuisine?

00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:52.660
ANDY RICKER: Well, that's easy.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.060
We don't claim any
authenticity, to start with.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.630
CAROLYN ALBURGER: It helps.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.100
ANDY RICKER: Part of--

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.140
when Pok Pok opened,
I banished the word

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.650
authentic and traditional
from the vocabulary,

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.320
because they're such
loaded words that

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.070
mean different things
to different people.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.490
The absurdity of authenticity.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.100
You talk to any
chef, anybody who's

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.070
a cook, who has any
knowledge of food ways

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.550
and that kind of thing, and
the notion of authenticity

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.610
just kind of goes
out the window.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:32.490
Authentic is what you
experience as authentic.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:38.310
So if your mom makes, say,
[? tom ?] [? kha ?] [? kai ?]

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.980
one way, to you, that's
the authentic way

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.500
because that's what you
grew up eating, tasting,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.060
and you've been told by
everybody in your family

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.140
that's the best version.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.680
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.170
ANDY RICKER: Meanwhile,
the dude up the street,

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.910
their mom made it too, and
he's been told the same thing.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.700
As far as he's concerned,
his version is authentic.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.840
So no matter-- if I was to
come along and go here's

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.340
authentic whatever, people
would say that's not authentic,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.370
because I know what authentic
is, because my mom's Thai

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.520
and she made it this way.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.359
You like, well, I don't know.

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.150
That's why we don't
use the word authentic.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.930
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Right but do you

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.346
think there's
something to be said

00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:22.000
for the way in which you
approach a cuisine that is not

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.712
your own?

00:33:22.712 --> 00:33:24.670
ANDY RICKER: I think that
doesn't have anything

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.720
to do with authenticity.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.590
I think that that has to
do with something else.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.170
For me--

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:30.490
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Respect.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.240
ANDY RICKER: Yeah.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:37.320
I think authenticity is a
different subject from that.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.270
The way that you
approach cuisine,

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.770
if you were going
to learn about it,

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.370
you just learn as
much as you can,

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.410
and you don't assume
that you know anything.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.270
You don't assume that you've
learned the gold standard.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.290
You don't assume that
the way you're doing it

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.499
is the right way.

00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:53.290
CAROLYN ALBURGER: What
are you still trying

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:54.332
to learn about Thai food?

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:55.331
ANDY RICKER: Everything.

00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:56.380
I mean, the more I know--

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.760
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Are
there certain regions--

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.968
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, the south.

00:33:58.968 --> 00:34:01.316
The south of Thailand is
a giant mystery to me.

00:34:01.316 --> 00:34:02.440
I've spent some time there.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.950
I have the basic idea
of what it's about.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.400
I probably have maybe a little
bit more experience there

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.600
than most people.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.070
But by far, I feel like it's
a whole mysterious new cuisine

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.750
that I could spend
a lifetime learning.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.449
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Do you plan on it?

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:19.929
Or are you more
interested in the regions

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:20.900
you're already specializing in?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.580
ANDY RICKER: No, I plan on
spending more time there.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.480
I was just there shooting some
video with the Thai Tourism

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480
Authority, and we just
ate some amazing food.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.989
And it's a totally
different flavor palate

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.810
than the north,
different ingredients,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.409
and different traditions
that it comes from,

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.570
different way people think
about the food, the way

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.020
that they eat is different.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.020
And I look forward to
learning as much as I can.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.769
I mean, I've got--

00:34:45.769 --> 00:34:47.741
hopefully I'll live
long enough that I can

00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:48.949
delve a little bit into that.

00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:52.989
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So
what are your goals

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:54.072
right now, professionally?

00:34:54.072 --> 00:34:56.050
Like, do you want to
basically just retire

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.860
in Thailand as
quickly as possible?

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.318
ANDY RICKER: I'm just trying
to keep my head low right now.

00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:03.959
It's kind of a jungle out there
in the restaurant industry.

00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:05.250
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Explain that.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:05.792
In what ways?

00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:08.125
ANDY RICKER: We're going to
have to start all over again

00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:09.220
and be here for hours.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.095
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Are you talking

00:35:11.095 --> 00:35:13.340
about just the physical
opening of a restaurant?

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.548
ANDY RICKER: No, I can open
restaurants all day long.

00:35:15.548 --> 00:35:17.860
I can find a restaurant,
design it, do the menu,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.240
get it open, no problem.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.040
It's the managing
of them once you've

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.860
got it open that's problematic.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.470
We've got a huge
problem in the industry

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.840
with wage income disparity
between the front and back

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.840
of the house, with the
front of the house taking

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.700
the lion's share
of the money, back

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.010
of the house trailing behind.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:40.180
Meanwhile, restaurants work on
a very, very thin margin, very

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.020
thin, and there's no way
in our current system

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.700
of tipping to reconcile those
two things without a sea

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.600
change in the way that
the dining public looks

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.330
at restaurants.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.840
It's an extremely
difficult problem

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.120
and nobody knows
what the answer is.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.370
The more people try-- like
people like Danny Meyer,

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.887
who's an industry leader,
tries to change things,

00:36:02.887 --> 00:36:04.720
he started getting sued
by people for trying

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.636
to do the right thing.

00:36:05.636 --> 00:36:09.340
So it's very, very fraught,
and there's a lot of emotion

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.150
around it.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.787
There's not a whole lot
of facts being used to--

00:36:13.787 --> 00:36:16.120
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Disseminate
information to the public.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.990
ANDY RICKER: It's a
very difficult thing

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.550
to educate the public on.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.680
There's a bunch of
things that people

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.400
think are true that
aren't true that

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.160
are-- it's very
difficult to talk about

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.230
because they're political.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.367
So yeah, it's just not a
great-- like if any of you

00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:30.450
are thinking of opening a
restaurant, don't do it.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:32.620
Don't do it right now.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.947
Wait.

00:36:33.947 --> 00:36:36.280
CAROLYN ALBURGER: I know, but
it might never get better.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.186
ANDY RICKER: Professionally,
I think me, like most people

00:36:40.186 --> 00:36:41.560
I know in the
industry, we're all

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.950
just kind of looking at what
we do well, and work with what

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.070
we have and try to
kind of hone in on that

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:53.350
and really maximize whatever we
can out of what we already do.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:53.950
Most people.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:54.490
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
So you're not going

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.630
to be opening a lot
more Pok Poks, probably.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.296
ANDY RICKER: No.

00:36:57.296 --> 00:36:59.650
I mean, we've got a
quick service kind

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.311
of version of Pok Pok that--

00:37:01.311 --> 00:37:02.310
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Smart.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.685
ANDY RICKER:
--we're trying to do

00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:07.000
because we think we can keep
it very simple, relatively

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.010
low cost, and we can pay
everybody in the place

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.207
the same amount, which
is higher than average.

00:37:11.207 --> 00:37:13.540
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yeah, that's
the way to go these days.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.000
That's why you're seeing so
much fast casual everywhere,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.940
because it's sustainable.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.272
ANDY RICKER: Well, in theory.

00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:21.730
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
More sustainable.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.540
ANDY RICKER: People keep on
trying to crack the code.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.830
It's proving to
be difficult, so.

00:37:28.786 --> 00:37:31.160
CAROLYN ALBURGER: So what else
do you want to talk about?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:31.690
ANDY RICKER: I don't know.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.640
Maybe we can ask the people
of if there's something

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640
they want to talk about.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.430
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Do
you guys have questions?

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.440
Yes.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.550
AUDIENCE: So my first job ever--

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:45.820
well, first paycheck
job was as a fishmonger.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.030
So I always love going to
fish markets when I travel.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.910
And I went to Thailand this
February, went to Bangkok,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:52.830
to the big--

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.080
ANDY RICKER: [? Chatuchak. ?]

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.000
AUDIENCE: --market.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.132
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:37:55.132 --> 00:37:57.340
Do you have any other
recommendations within Thailand

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.455
of really cool--

00:37:58.455 --> 00:37:59.330
ANDY RICKER: Markets?

00:37:59.330 --> 00:37:59.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:59.955 --> 00:38:02.920
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, I
mean every major city

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.100
has some kind of large market.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.500
In Bangkok, when you go
back, go to Khlong Toei.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.580
That's a real education.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.160
That's a real kind of crazy--

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.410
that's the biggest market in--

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.030
[? Chatuchak ?] is
this cleaned up,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.010
nice place with
organic food and--

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.920
ANDY RICKER: Oh, you
want to Khlong Toei.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.419
OK.

00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:23.650
Khlong Toei like
really down and dirty.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.500
You're wading through effluent
on the floors and stuff.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.350
It's pretty crazy.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.264
It's also full of all
kinds of weird shit,

00:38:30.264 --> 00:38:31.180
to be honest with you.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.750
There's lots of
formaldehyde being sprayed,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.280
or whatever they
call that stuff,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.070
formalin getting sprayed on
vegetables and meat and stuff.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.000
So it's a little bit hectic.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.250
If you go up to Chiang Mai--
so go to [? Chatuchak, ?]

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.670
then, next time you go.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.660
It's an amazing market.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.201
It really is.

00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:50.500
It's beautiful, there's lots
of really good prepared foods

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.380
there.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.460
There's a lot of
organic food, like

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.650
sustainably-caught seafood,
all this kind of stuff.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.970
It's a really great market.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.506
If you go up to
Chiang Mai, there's

00:38:59.506 --> 00:39:00.880
a couple of places
you can visit.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.980
One's called
[INAUDIBLE] Muang Mai,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.340
and that's kind of New
City Market, is what--

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.600
it's a big central market.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.390
Kind of like the Khlong
Toei of Chiang Mai,

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.180
except for not hectic.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.540
It's very busy, but not hectic.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.956
And that's really
cool because you

00:39:15.956 --> 00:39:19.350
can see a lot of the
very, very local stuff.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.850
Anytime you go to any
new part of Thailand,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.780
you want to go to
the morning market,

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.780
because you get to see
what the local people are

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.917
buying and eating.

00:39:26.917 --> 00:39:29.000
And you'll see the same
thing over and over again,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.260
but you'll also see some
very local stuff as well.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.330
So it's just--

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.280
I believe there's
a couple of people

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.497
that are working on a
whole book on it right now.

00:39:38.497 --> 00:39:40.080
The folks from "Eating
Asia", I think,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.390
are working on a
book on markets.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.640
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about the seasonal mushroom

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.660
in Thailand.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.200
You were talking about they're
only available for one month.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.640
Which month is that?

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.070
ANDY RICKER: Typically
March, April time.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.360
Yeah, it's in the
hot season right now.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.020
AUDIENCE: Is there like
a specific instruction

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.800
to pick them?

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.100
Like before raining,
after raining?

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.600
ANDY RICKER: I've never gone
out and found them in the wild,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.480
but typically it's
during the dry season.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.570
So it's right--

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.880
April is typically
very hot, right,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.830
and it rains sporadically.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.006
So it's probably right after
it rains a little bit, I guess.

00:40:19.006 --> 00:40:20.505
But they're kind
of like a puffball.

00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:22.186
They're round,
they're really dark.

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:22.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:23.020
ANDY RICKER: Yeah.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.478
AUDIENCE: I think
they taste better

00:40:24.478 --> 00:40:26.120
when they're inside the casing.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.670
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.930
Definitely.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.210
AUDIENCE: What are your
thoughts on Thailand

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.282
trying to close down the
street vendors, street markets?

00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:36.740
ANDY RICKER: It's
a great question.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.470
So I don't know if
you guys are familiar,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:44.034
but sometime in the last year,
somebody from the government

00:40:44.034 --> 00:40:46.450
announced that they were going
to shut down all the street

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:53.680
vendors in Bangkok, right
after they got named best

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.450
street food city in the world.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.050
And so it was kind
of a PR nightmare,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:02.720
and the cultural minister
popped up and said, no, no,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.970
no no, we're not doing that.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.800
We're just clearing
up some places

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.080
and we're going to make it so
that you have to get a permit.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.870
We're going to regulate it.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.120
We're not going to ban it,
we're going to regulate it.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.810
But I think, actually, the
guy who piped up actually

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.280
was telling the hidden truth,
is that there is and always has

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.660
been this sort of cadre
of elite folks in Bangkok

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.850
who feel that it should
be more like Singapore.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.310
They don't like the
dirtiness of it.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:35.560
To be fair, a lot of the
food that you find on

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.020
the street in Thailand,
in Bangkok, especially,

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.180
these days, there's problems.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.500
First of all, they clog the
sidewalks so you can't walk.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.360
It's a difficult city
to walk in already,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.980
and they clog the
business areas.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.170
So you can't-- it's very
difficult if you're trying

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.450
to do business there.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.820
Also, a lot of the food that
they're selling is crap.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:56.740
It's just not good.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.650
The bummer of it is,
though, that this

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:07.240
is work for people who are
coming from the country

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.360
or they're very poor, and this
is a way for them to make money

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.310
and they're serving
people who want it.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.815
So it's a very difficult
thing to balance.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:18.500
It's already happening.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.874
If you go to Bangkok now, if
you were there two years ago

00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:23.720
and you go to Bangkok now,
Sukhumvit is now clear.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.160
There is no vendors
on Sukhumvit at all.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.640
And it used to be from
basically from Soi 1

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.040
all the way up to Soi 24,
solid vendors day and night.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.940
Daytime, it was-- not
just food vendors,

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.110
but all the vendors are out.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.540
It is weird.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.740
It's really weird.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.660
They've been pushed
onto the side sois

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.547
and into doorways and
down little side streets

00:42:45.547 --> 00:42:46.380
and stuff like that.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.960
And I think at the
end of the day,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.270
if Bangkok turned
into Singapore,

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.280
it would be a terrible shame.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.440
I don't think the Thai people
will allow that to happen.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.390
I don't think that
that's going to happen.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.300
I think that it'll happen
in central business areas

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.300
and it'll happen in the
heavily touristed areas,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.197
except for places where they
kind of form food courts

00:43:09.197 --> 00:43:10.030
and stuff like that.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.739
But I don't think
it'll go away entirely.

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:13.113
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Singapore still

00:43:13.113 --> 00:43:14.810
has a good reputation for its--

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.217
an excellent reputation.

00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:18.300
ANDY RICKER: It's got a
great reputation for food,

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.580
but it's all in food
halls and in restaurants.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.050
And I think there
are those in Bangkok

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.050
who wish that was how it was.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.770
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.870
ANDY RICKER: And
Singapore, honestly,

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:34.680
the food in Singapore, I think,
has gotten better recently.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.150
Like in the last
10 years, I think

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.360
that whole food
court, food hall thing

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.300
has made the vendors--
it's gotten competition.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.457
So you got to be good
or else you're not

00:43:44.457 --> 00:43:45.540
going to get any business.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.456
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Yes,
I've had amazing street

00:43:47.456 --> 00:43:52.590
food in Singapore, top notch,
super clean, delicious.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.920
ANDY RICKER: So, yeah, I
miss that vibe walking around

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.070
in certain areas,
but in other cases,

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.950
it's kind of, what
are you going to do?

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.060
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Right.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.560
Yeah.

00:44:05.712 --> 00:44:07.670
AUDIENCE: Do you think
the US has gotten better

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.540
about representation
of regional cuisines?

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.450
I've gone to an Isaan restaurant
in Houston and New York

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:15.897
and enjoyed that a lot.

00:44:15.897 --> 00:44:18.230
ANDY RICKER: Yeah, as far as
Thai food goes, absolutely.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.410
Over the last 10, especially
the last five years,

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.890
there's been a big explosion.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:26.660
I think that a certain amount
of it has to do with the fact

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.830
that younger Thai folks who
either have grown up here

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:34.640
or have come here as
students who are more hip

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.390
and in tune with what
people are willing to eat

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.700
have finally gone, you
know what, we can do this.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.690
One of the things that you
find, the old guard Thai

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.160
restaurant owners, they just--

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.410
there was a cultural
thing that's

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.500
changing, where
they just culturally

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.630
couldn't believe that you as a
farang can eat what they eat.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.480
They look at you and go, no way.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.130
You can't eat spice and
you can't eat funky,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.750
and there's no way.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:07.080
But that's not really true, I
think, for a couple of reasons.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.880
Number one, we as a
country, as a population,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.560
have gotten a lot more
adventurous, and number two,

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.810
we've gotten a lot less white.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:21.590
And there's is people out
there whose parents are

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.170
from another country
or they've grown up

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.700
in a home where the food
wasn't Bologna sandwiches.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.180
And they go to school
and go to college

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.790
and they're with other
folks from African culture

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.540
or southeast Asian culture,
south Asian culture, Middle

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.550
Eastern culture,
all mixing together,

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.330
and I think there's just
a broader acceptance

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.030
because the people who
are spending money on food

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.850
now are not lily white anymore.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.870
So I think that has a lot
to do with it as well.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:55.160
But yeah, as far as Thai food
goes, virtually every city

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.020
you go to now, there's
something popping up

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.760
that is kind of regional.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.420
You go to Atlanta,
there's Talat.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.210
Guys calling it Talat Market.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:06.545
Means Market Market.

00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:09.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.740
And in New York,
especially, when

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:17.510
we opened Pok Pok in New
York five-plus years ago,

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.460
there was us and
there were a few--

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.550
there were the old school,
like Ayada, [? SriPraPhai, ?]

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.910
that kind of thing.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.886
And since we've opened,
there's now probably

00:46:26.886 --> 00:46:28.260
eight or 10
different restaurants

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.540
that are specializing in Isaan
or northern food or really

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.770
high quality central Thai food.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.080
So it's definitely a trend.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.580
AUDIENCE: For those
who maybe aren't

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.850
familiar with the different
varieties of Thai food,

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:46.700
what would you say characterizes
each of the regional food

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.390
cuisines?

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.950
ANDY RICKER: OK.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:52.370
So there's four basic
regions in Thailand.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.910
The north, northeast,
center, and south.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.050
Starting in the north, a lot of
the food that we do at Pok Pok

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.040
is from the north.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.150
The staple rice
there is sticky rice,

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:08.090
and the food tends to be--
because it's landlocked,

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:13.100
mountainous, rivers,
tends to be-- and jungle--

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:21.260
tends to be herbaceous, salty,
spicy but not super spicy,

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.840
little elements of sour
that come from leaves

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.680
and other kind of fruits aside
from lemons and limes and stuff

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.310
like that, and
bitter is a flavor

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.100
that features pretty heavily
in northern Thai food.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.810
Isaan, which is the arid
northeast part of Thailand,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.960
where the folks are
mostly Lao and Khmer, food

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.660
there tends to be very simple.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.260
They don't have a
lot of resources.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.280
So a lot of fermentation
there, a lot

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.700
of relatively spicy things.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:58.770
So hot and kind of salty tends
to be the predominant flavors,

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.000
sour, in Isaan.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.090
Sticky rice is a staple.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.860
They eat a lot of things--

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.570
that's a place where
a lot of things

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:16.230
like ant eggs, insects,
a lot of things--

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.577
like I said, it's a very arid
region and the resources,

00:48:18.577 --> 00:48:19.910
there aren't a lot of resources.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:22.260
So people get food
where they can.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:25.020
And over the years,
over the centuries

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.880
they've kind of
developed a taste

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.330
for things that are
probably not prime meats.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.247
CAROLYN ALBURGER: What
do ant eggs taste like?

00:48:33.247 --> 00:48:35.205
ANDY RICKER: Ant eggs
are actually really good.

00:48:35.205 --> 00:48:36.210
They're red ant eggs.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.650
They're little, they're white,
and they're about that big.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:39.410
They kind of pop in your mouth.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.215
They're good.

00:48:41.215 --> 00:48:43.710
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Like caviar?

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:45.440
ANDY RICKER: They're not fishy.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.700
CAROLYN ALBURGER:
Anyway, continue.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.290
ANDY RICKER: Then
central Thailand,

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:53.646
where the Thai people, for
the last, I don't know,

00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:57.210
500-600 years, that's been
where the seat of power is.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.620
That's where the
royal palace is.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.040
That's where the real
cuisine has really blossomed.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.260
It's also the breadbasket
of the country.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:10.530
It's where most of the produce
and rice and fruit are grown.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.300
And so the food there tends to
be richer, more sophisticated.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.330
There's access to
the coconut groves

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:23.250
from the south, and quite a
sophisticated cuisine there.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.490
So it tends to be hot,
sour, salty, and sweet,

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:30.360
with sweetness being a little
more prominent there than most

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.360
other places in the country.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.370
And then the south, which
is peninsular Thailand

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:41.550
below Bangkok, where the
further south you go,

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:46.550
the more Malaysian
folks get down there.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.930
Sea on both sides.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:54.230
So lots of seafood, lots
of fish, lots of shellfish.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.770
Coconut groves, so a lot of
really rich coconut curries

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.650
down there, and the spiciest
food in the country.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:01.820
Really the hottest stuff.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:07.460
They've really developed a taste
for ultra-hot food down there.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:12.840
A lot of influence from
Malaysia-Indian flavors there.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.920
So I think that's
a broad, that's

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.787
very general overview
of what you might find.

00:50:20.787 --> 00:50:23.120
AUDIENCE: I have a more general
question about Thai food

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.130
and the way you mentioned
Thai as a country,

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.010
and the food as the
embodiment of the culture,

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.690
the way people
eat it indicates--

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:33.440
what you think makes Thai food's
impact on culture and vise

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:33.954
versa.

00:50:33.954 --> 00:50:35.870
How would you define
what is unique about Thai

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.130
food and the culture?

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.250
ANDY RICKER: Well, I think
these days, probably,

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.240
food is the most common
way that Thai culture is

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.190
expressed outside of Thailand.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:49.820
Most people who go
to Thailand have had

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.920
some experience with Thai food.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.030
It's kind of the outreach,
the cultural outreach.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:58.190
It's also-- you've got to
understand that Thailand

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.510
is a foodie culture.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.910
They're not foodies, but food is
such a huge part of the culture

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.800
there.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.080
It's very rare to go to
any kind of occasion or fun

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.000
happening where
food isn't involved.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.800
It's involved in
every single thing.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.190
There's foods that you
eat for special occasions.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.130
There's foods-- it's not
uncommon to go to the beach

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:28.070
and see people in the water
eating while they're swimming.

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.310
There's this element of
sanuk, they call it, sanuk.

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:34.490
Thai people, in
any occasion, want

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.950
to have this feeling of sanuk.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:40.880
And having food and
having discourse,

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.220
like being with your family.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.210
So I would say, as an outsider
observing Thai culture,

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:51.500
I'd say that probably family is
the most important thing, then

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.800
the king, the royal
family-- or then Buddhism,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.100
then the king, and then food
after that, in that order.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.790
So it's hugely
important, and it is

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.200
kind of part of the cultural
identity of Thai folks outside

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.320
of Thailand.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.130
AUDIENCE: So you've been going
to Thailand for about 30 years,

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.060
right?

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.740
And not wanting to
fetishize the past

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.220
or pretend that changes
isn't a good thing,

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.620
is there anything that
you've seen sort of vanish

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.685
over that period that
you regret seeing go?

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:35.630
ANDY RICKER: I mean, there is,
from a culinary standpoint,

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:41.060
I think that there's been a
broad acceptance of processed

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.050
food.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.680
That's unfortunate
to me, because it's

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.550
having an impact on the health
of the people of the country.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:51.920
Youth culture is kind
of focused on things

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.430
that are kind of fast food.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:57.320
If you watch TV there,
there's lots of ads for KFC

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:03.420
and Pizza Hut and [INAUDIBLE]
and stuff like that.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.690
People are eating [? CP, ?]
eating a lot of processed foods

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:07.680
these days.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.470
Palate has swung towards
the sweet side of things

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:12.840
and the fatty side of things.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.310
But if you think about
it, it's kind of natural.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.560
It's a natural thing.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.700
When there's more
disposable income,

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.460
the people who have
that disposable income

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.660
want the things that were out of
reach before, the richer foods,

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.000
eating more meat than
vegetables, that kind of thing.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.120
It's inevitable.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.350
But you can still, like I
said before, you can still

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:37.620
find the old ways of cooking.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:41.580
It's just disappearing, like
anywhere else in the world.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.640
Young folks aren't as interested
in hanging out at the family

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.120
kitchen and learning at
the foot of their dad

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.740
and then taking
the business over.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.670
And the parents
don't want him to.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.503
The parents want him
to go off to university

00:53:52.503 --> 00:53:56.130
and become a doctor or
a lawyer or whatever,

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.125
because it's a better life.

00:53:58.125 --> 00:54:00.000
So it's just like anywhere
else in the world,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.032
I think, changing.

00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:05.240
AUDIENCE: Please tell me if
this is a silly question.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.440
But one of the things that I
noticed when I visited Bangkok

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.890
is how a lot of the street
cooking was done with woks

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:13.350
and it was very hot.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.970
And so woks are cooked
at a hot temperature.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:16.930
ANDY RICKER: Sure.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.305
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious if you have

00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:20.830
any tips for people that
live in an apartment

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:23.620
or with the ventilation
that an apartment offers

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.780
or the types of stoves that
apartments often have for--

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.820
ANDY RICKER: I do, I do.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.070
AUDIENCE: How to deal with it?

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.486
ANDY RICKER: Avoid the dishes
that you need a very hot wok

00:54:32.486 --> 00:54:33.123
to cook.

00:54:33.123 --> 00:54:34.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.010
So [INAUDIBLE],, for
instance, you probably

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.676
don't want to do that
in your apartment,

00:54:37.676 --> 00:54:40.150
or pad see [? ew, ?] something
like that, that really,

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.030
to get the really great
taste, you need that really,

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.080
really smoking hot.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.020
If you have a balcony,
just go against your condo

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.120
association's thing.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.950
Got to get out there
and do it anyway.

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:54.010
But yeah, I mean, look,
anything that's cooked in a wok,

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.370
is if you look closely
enough at, has probably got--

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:01.260
if you need a wok to make it,
it's a Chinese-influenced dish.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.290
And a lot of the dishes that
are very, very Thai or very

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:08.230
northern, the original
cooking techniques would

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:14.040
have been boiling, grilling,
steaming, that kind of cooking.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.630
So a lot-- like
curries, you don't

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.610
need a wok to make a curry.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:20.340
You don't need a wok to
make a yam or a salad.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.780
You don't need a wok
to make grilled foods.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.290
You can get away with
just using a nice aluminum

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.500
pan that's shaped like a
wok for a lot of stuff.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.520
Or just a regular pot.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.617
So that would be my answer.

00:55:34.617 --> 00:55:36.450
Wait till you go home
to your parents' house

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.550
and burn up their place.

00:55:41.539 --> 00:55:43.080
AUDIENCE: So I have
some in-laws that

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.190
are sticky rice farmers in a
village outside of Chiang Rai,

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.090
and whenever I eat
with them, the food

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:51.330
is delicious, but so
spicy that I'm literally

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.499
sobbing by the second bite.

00:55:53.499 --> 00:55:55.290
So I was wondering,
what is your experience

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:59.160
with adjusting or not
adjusting dishes to better suit

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.840
American palates,
and how does that

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.390
relate to your refusal to
use terms like authenticity

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:04.270
and tradition?

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:08.970
ANDY RICKER: OK, so
there's one of two things

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.580
that I'm going to guess
about your situation.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.779
Number one is that your family
really loves spicy food,

00:56:14.779 --> 00:56:17.070
and number two, maybe you
don't have a strong tolerance

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.512
for spicy food.

00:56:19.512 --> 00:56:20.970
AUDIENCE: I get--
maybe the former.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.470
ANDY RICKER: Maybe
the former, yeah.

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.540
So heat is a relative term.

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:29.370
And to me, in the north,
the vast majority of people

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:32.640
up there don't eat
things super spicy.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.442
A lot of the dishes that you
have, and you could argue,

00:56:35.442 --> 00:56:37.650
well, you're a white guy so
when they see you coming,

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.733
they tone it down for you.

00:56:38.733 --> 00:56:40.740
But the problem-- the
thing is about that

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.590
is there's ways around that.

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:47.580
You go to the restaurant
where the food is pre-made

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.800
and just order what
everybody else is having,

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.680
and you can get a really
good sense of what it is

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.080
that they're making there.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.760
The other thing to
remember about food

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.660
in Thailand and eating there,
is that if the food isn't

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.330
pre-made, Thai people
have a lot of say

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.890
in how their food turns out.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.950
They can tell the vendor, make
it spicy, and tell them exactly

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.959
how spicy to make
it, or not spicy.

00:57:10.959 --> 00:57:12.500
Or they avoid the
place that's spicy,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.970
or they avoid the
place that's not spicy.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:18.150
Whereas here, culturally,
we expect the food

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.940
to arrive at the table
exactly the way that we

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.650
expect it to arrive there.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.410
And a lot of times, unless we
have familiarity with the food,

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.380
we lack the vocabulary
to say how we like it.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.020
So this whole thing with five
stars, that has no meaning.

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.570
That's literally a
no meaning thing.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.600
All that means that there's
more chili powder goes in.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.070
And there's no standard across--

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:42.270
if you ask 10 restaurateurs
what does five star mean,

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.370
they're going to have a
different answer for what

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.160
they do to make it
five star chili hot.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:53.220
So how do I determine the
spice level of the food

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.810
that we serve?

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:56.220
I don't make any kind of--

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:02.520
I don't tone it down,
per se, but I might not

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.290
make a dish at the
restaurant that's

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.659
just ballistically
spicy, or I won't have

00:58:06.659 --> 00:58:07.950
all the dishes on the menu be--

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.410
I'll have a dish that's
appropriate to be

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:14.280
really, really spicy, and
that's just the way it is.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.830
Like our muu paa kham
waan, or boar collar,

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:18.732
that spicy as fuck, and
that's the way it is.

00:58:18.732 --> 00:58:20.190
And I'm sorry if
you don't like it,

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:21.930
you shouldn't have the dish.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.370
That's it.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.230
Just eat lots of
sticky rice with it.

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.720
But there's other
things, like, say,

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.520
kaeng hang leh, the northern
Thai Burmese pork belly curry.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.540
That's not a spicy dish.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.410
It just isn't.

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.480
It is not a spicy dish.

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.606
So when it arrives at the
table and it's not spicy,

00:58:41.606 --> 00:58:43.480
and people are like, I
need this to be spicy,

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.690
it's like, well, sure, here,
have some chili powder.

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.898
I don't really know what to
give you to make it spicy

00:58:47.898 --> 00:58:51.360
because that's not
a dish that's spicy.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.310
Khao soi, same story, khao soi.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.190
That's a mild dish.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.930
It's not spicy.

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.130
It really isn't.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:59.910
You have to add chili
paste to make it spicy.

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:03.600
[INAUDIBLE] the southern
Thai minced meat

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.520
curry that has lots and lots,
that's ballistically hot,

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.090
and it wouldn't
taste right unless it

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.710
was ballistically hot.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:15.908
So that's a lot of words
to not give you an answer.

00:59:15.908 --> 00:59:18.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:20.250
CAROLYN ALBURGER: Well done.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.430
I think we are finished.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:24.420
We're out of time, so
thanks everyone for coming.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.060
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.832
ANDY RICKER: Yeah.

00:59:26.832 --> 00:59:27.220
Pleasure.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:27.910
Thank you guys.

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:28.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.970
I think we got some
books to give away, too.
