00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.770
You know what always makes me mad?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.919
How come banana candies never taste like actual
bananas?

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.050
If not actual bananas, what the heck makes
that flavor?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.040
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
So I don’t know if you’ve noticed lately,
but there’s been a trend for big companies

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.630
to remove “unnatural” ingredients from
their products.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.340
General Mills is just the latest, joining
others like Panera and Nestle.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.600
General Mills says “90 percent of its cereals
will have no artificial ingredients by the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.930
end of 2016.” and they want to move towards
ingredients people will recognize.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160
They want to move towards products that people
“see as natural”.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.010
And that’s the rub though, do most people
know what natural is?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.010
When you look on the side of a box of cereal,
you might see a few ingredients you can pronounce,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.290
like wheat and sugar, and words like “natural
flavor” and “artificial flavor”.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.530
We use words like “artificial” and “natural”
as a short hand, and just kind of assume every

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.559
knows what we mean.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.739
We assume that natural is anything nature
makes and artificial is man made or made from

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.739
chemicals.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.739
The FDA sort of agrees.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.350
Basically they say an artificial flavor means
it’s not derived from plant material, meat,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.320
or dairy products, or fermentation products
thereof.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
But the real difference between artificial
and natural flavor is a little more complicated

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.580
and little bit fuzzier.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.000
I mean processed food can be really tasteless,
it’s been frozen, bleached, dried, whathaveyou

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to smithereens.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.490
but hey, at least it has a long shelf life.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.820
To make up for that lack of taste, scientists
have to add a little something extra.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.390
Most of those flavors in your food, natural
or not are made in a lab, by scientists called

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.280
flavorists, who are something like a mix of
chemist and artist.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.700
Their entire job is to mix minute amounts
of chemicals to produce just the right flavor.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.740
They can whip up a few chemicals and make
you think it’s a turkey dinner.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.130
And it’s big business.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.240
One study from the Freedonia Group estimates
the Flavor and Fragrance industry to be worth

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.650
over 5.7 billion dollars.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.810
I know that word “chemical” might be scary
to some of you.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.549
but I mean everything is chemicals.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.860
APPLES HAVE CHEMICALS IN THE THEM.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.479
Like apples contain fructose, sucrose, pantotheic
acid, ethyl hexanoate, 3-decanol, and a bunch

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.860
of others I can’t even pronounce.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.619
So you could have chemicals derived from a
pit of an apricot and heavily processed or

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.700
the same exact chemicals synthesized in a
lab and one would be considered natural and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.700
one not.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.830
Eric Schlosser, gives the example of Amyl
acetate, or banana flavor in his book Fast

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.830
Food Nation.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.600
He says “When you distill it from bananas
with a solvent, amyl acetate is a natural

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600
flavor.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.730
When you produce it by mixing vinegar with
amyl alcohol, adding sulfuric acid as a catalyst,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.790
amyl acetate is an artificial flavor.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.790
Either way it smells and tastes the same.”

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.749
So the same exact chemical can be considered
natural or artificial.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.450
And natural doesn’t always mean better.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.510
Natural flavors goes through the same process
in a lab with those flavorists, just like

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.069
an ‘artificial’ flavor would.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.559
Some aren’t remotely related to the food
they supposedly taste like.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.709
Some “almond” flavors can come from apricot
pits or in some rare cases that “natural”

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.999
vanilla flavoring has been known to come from
the anal glands of beavers.

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.930
And even flavors made by fungal or tissue
cultures are considered natural.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.620
So these companies have a lot of lee-way with
the word “natural” when it comes to processed

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.720
foods.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.561
Just remember like arsenic and rattle snake
venom are technically natural, doesn’t mean

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:55.561
they’re good for you.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.579
So when you pick your favorite cereal off
the shelf.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.579
Just be smart, be skeptical.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.579
And the next time you drink a vanilla latte,
just think, you're probably taking a nice

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.579
sip of beaver butt juice.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.579
Okay not really it’s very rarely used.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.579
But hey, it’s natural.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.579
speaking of another great debate in the food
wars lately…

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.579
GMOS. what’s the deal with those?

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.760
Laci really separates the wheat from the chaff
in this great episode right here.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:22.370
So, how do you feel about this “natural”
vs “artificial debate”?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:32.459
Health conscious or marketing baloney?
