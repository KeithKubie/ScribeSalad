beautiful memories of people and events

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920
beautiful memories of people and events
 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.139
beautiful memories of people and events
and joys that I've had at Carnegie

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149
and joys that I've had at Carnegie
 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.499
and joys that I've had at Carnegie
Mellon as an undergraduate student and

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509
 
 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.249
 
who still when I think of academic

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259
who still when I think of academic
 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.499
who still when I think of academic
scholarship and when I think of having a

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509
scholarship and when I think of having a
 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.889
scholarship and when I think of having a
good time I think of bagpipes I think

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899
good time I think of bagpipes I think
 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.169
good time I think of bagpipes I think
somehow Carnegie Mellon is the thing

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179
somehow Carnegie Mellon is the thing
 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.270
somehow Carnegie Mellon is the thing
that connects the bagpipes do everything

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280
that connects the bagpipes do everything
 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.809
that connects the bagpipes do everything
else that it is it's such a great

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819
else that it is it's such a great
 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.949

on the slides a lot more detail than

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269
on the slides a lot more detail than
 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.860
on the slides a lot more detail than
non-experts would be interested in and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
non-experts would be interested in and
 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.080

would like but I could if they have
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.679
would like but I could if they have
questions for the experts I would be

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689
questions for the experts I would be
 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.000
