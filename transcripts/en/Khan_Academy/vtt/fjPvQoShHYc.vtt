00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.760
Problem 5.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.180
Use the expression below
to answer the

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.560
question that follows.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.150
OK, there's my expression,
and here's the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.350
question that follows.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.100
Which of the following is the
best estimate of the value of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.240
the expression above?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.770
So when they want best estimate,
it's really just

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.600
saying, look, you don't have
to do all of the math.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.810
Just kind of round out
everything and try to figure

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.980
out what this is saying.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
So if I wanted to round this
out at the 32,629, I'd say

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.980
that's approximately equal to
30,000 times-- instead of 484,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.600
I'm going to say that's roughly
equal to 500, and then

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.400
divide that by 306,751.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.090
I'm going to say that's roughly
equal to 300,000.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.440
So the first thing I want to do,
maybe I'll divide the top

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.842
and the bottom by 3, so this
30,000 will become-- let me do

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.810
it in darker color-- will
become 10,000, and this

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.239
300,000 will become 100,000.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.030
And then I can start
canceling out 0's.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
If I divide the top and the
bottom by 10,000, I could

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.070
essentially get rid of four 0's
on the top and the bottom.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.090
So then, I'd just, 10,000
divided by 10,000

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.530
will just become 1.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.680
100,000 divided by 10,000
is just 10.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.720
That just becomes 10.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.690
And then we're left with
500 divided by 10.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.380
We can just cancel out
some more 0's.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.790
Divide the top and the bottom
by 10, you get a 1 in the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.800
bottom and you get
a 50 on top.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.520
So you could say this is roughly
equal to 50, and lucky

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.280
for us, that's actually
one of the choices.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.120
Problem 6.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.330
question that follows.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.710
The measurements in the diagram
above are shown

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.840
rounded to the nearest
whole number.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.740
Which of the following is a
possible value of A, the area

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.570
of the rectangle?

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.940
So what they're saying is that
these numbers, these aren't

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.730
the actual values if we were to
be precise about it, they

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.050
just rounded them to the
nearest whole number.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.190
When you just multiply these two
things to figure out the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.830
area, you get an area of 8
inches, or 8 square inches.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.720
But when you look at the
choices, I don't see an 8

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.440
square inches.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.100
It seems like it's either
going to be B or C.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.370
And if you just look at these
two numbers, which one's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.640
closer-- see, 8 to 5.5, so
8 minus 5.5, that's what?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.710
8 minus 5 is 3 inches, so this
is 2 and 1/2 inches.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.990
So we're 2 and 1/2 inches from
this one, and we are 3 and 1/2

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.960
inches from this one.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.110
So if I was stuck for time,
I would go with this one.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.720
But just to verify that this
definitely could be an answer,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.020
if these are rounded to the
nearest whole number, then

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.760
this one could be as low
as 1.5 inches, right?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.550
If this dimension is actually
1.5 inches when they rounded

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.380
it, they would have made it 2.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.270
It couldn't have been 1.49,
because then they would have

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.750
rounded it down.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.600
Similarly, this could have
been as low as 3.5.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.980
When they round it, they would
have rounded it to 4.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.910
It couldn't have been 3.49,
because then they would have

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.900
rounded it down to 3.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.310
So if this dimension was 3.5,
and this dimension was 1.5,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.120
what would the area have been?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.422
So 3.5 times 1.5.

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:26.420
Let's see, 5 times 5 is 25.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.160
3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 is 17.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.350
Put a 0 down.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.490
1 times 5 is 5.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.010
1 times 3 is 3.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.610
5, 7 plus 5 is 12.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.580
And then you have 1 plus
1, plus 3 is 5.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.840
You have two numbers behind
the decimal point, 5.25.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.990
So the minimum possible area
for this rectangle is 5.25.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.170
That's the minimum.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.270
So 5.5 is definitely
a valid answer.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.240
So I'm going to stick
with my answer, B.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.490
Next problem.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.000
All right.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.340
Use the table below to answer
the questions-- the question--

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.240
that follows.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.750
OK, they have a store, different
stores, discount for

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.459
manufacturer's recommended
price.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.700
OK, there we go.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.120
So they're all discounting
games.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.320
Samantha wants to buy two
computer games, each of which

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.260
has a manufacturer's recommended
price of $20.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.110
She checks four different stores
and finds the prices of

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.940
the games discounted as shown
in the table above.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.960
At which store will Samantha be
able to buy the games for

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.730
the least amount of money?

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.370
That makes sense.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.210
You want to find the
cheapest place.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.280
So this is $4 off the
price of each game.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.950
Remember, she's buying two.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.800
The manufactured price is $20.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.320
So she's going to pay $4 off of
$20 for each game, so she's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.890
going to pay $16 plus $16,
which is equal to $32.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.680
That's at store number one.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.260
30% discount on each game.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.400
So 30% discount, so $20 times
30% discount is 0.3.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.770
So you can imagine 3 times 20
is 60, and then you put the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.410
decimal sign.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.990
It's going to be a $6 discount
on each game for this one.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.720
So $6 discount.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.970
Remember 30% of $20 is $6, so
$6 discount will be $14,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.270
right? $20 minus $6 per
game that she buys.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.360
So she's going to spend $28
at store number two.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.610
Switch colors.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.110
1/3 off the price of
the two games.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.090
Well, you know, you could
immediately say that 1/3 is

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.380
33%, so that's a bigger discount
than this one.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.560
You could do the math.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.470
You'll figure out, you know,
instead of this being $6,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.960
it'll be $6.66, and it's going
to be $13 and something

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.230
something, plus $13, and
something something.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.130
You're going to get something,
you know, $27 and some change.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.770
But you know that this is a
better deal than this one,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.880
because this is the same thing
as 33% off, which is clearly

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.720
better than 30% off.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.570
And then this fourth one-- buy
one game, and get the second

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.560
at 1/2 price.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.620
So here, she's going to spend
$20 on the first game, and

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.400
then the second one is going
to be 1/2 price.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.790
So she's going to spend
a total of $30.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.790
So the best deal is store number
three, where it's going

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.910
to be $27 something.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.230
Right?

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.210
I mean, store number two is
definitely better than store

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.030
number four, which is definitely
better than store

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.820
number one.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.650
And then store number three is
definitely better than store

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.950
number two.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.520
It's a 33% discount.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.180
So I'm going to go with
store number three.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.550
Next problem.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.560
Go to the next problem.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.020
8.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.450
Use the procedure below
to answer the

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.760
question that follows.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.640
OK, n is equal to 0.632, OK.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.690
100n is equal to 63, just
multiply it by 100.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.280
OK, they're trying to eliminate

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.430
the repeating decimals.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.520
I get it.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.410
The procedure above shows how to
convert a repeating decimal

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.360
to a fraction.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.520
All right.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.270
If 0.12561256 is a decimal with
four repeating digits,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.920
which of the following
represents this

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.590
decimal as a fraction?

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.640
So what you do, we'll just do
what the procedure we did

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.540
before, and this might bring you
back memories from algebra

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.150
class, or pre-algebra
class, you get

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.960
when you first started.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.670
You say n.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.920
Or we can just do exactly what
they did there, is equal to

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:45.230
0.12561256, and then we
can multiply that.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.500
And you can even
pattern match.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.510
Here, you had two digits
repeating, they

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.025
multiplied it by 100.

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:52.430
And 100 has two 0's.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.800
Here we have four digits
repeating, so we're going to

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.240
multiply it by something
with four 0's.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.430
So we'll have 1, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.420
There's our four 0's.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.970
So that's 10,000n is going
to be equal to what?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.660
What's 0.1 of 10,000?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.020
It's 1,000.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.800
What's 0.02 of 10,000?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.350
I think you get the idea.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.710
It is 2,000.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.870
Sorry, it's 200.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:25.340
So you get 1,256.12561256.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.860
It just keeps repeating,
on and on and on.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.560
You get the idea.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.230
We just multiplied this by
10,000 because that allowed us

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.159
to bring one whole repetition
to the left of the decimal.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.990
You could verify that.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.770
Actually, let's multiply it out,
just to verify that this

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.559
actually works.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:50.920
If I multiply 12561256 times
10,000, what you could do is,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.340
you could just multiply
it by 1.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:01.190
So you get 12561256, add
four 0's, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.200
And then count how many decimal
points you have, 1, 2,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.590
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.770
And we verify that it works.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.210
Now, of course, I didn't
multiply the

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.420
entire repeating part.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.380
If it just kept repeating, then
we'd have a 1256 and it'd

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.550
keep repeating, so
on and so forth.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.900
But you saw it worked in the
pattern, and it works here.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.240
So once we get that, we just
essentially want to subtract

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.820
this guy from this guy.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.390
So we say minus n, or you could
say this is equal to

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:38.200
minus 0.12561256, and we are
left with-- on this side,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.330
what's 10,000 minus 1?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:49.610
Well, that's 9,999 is equal
to-- well, when you do the

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.230
subtraction, this and this part
are going to cancel out.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.610
The decimal parts cancel
out, and you're

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.160
just left with 1,256.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.960
So 9,999n-- remember, there's
a coefficient there, I don't

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.920
want to lose that--
is equal to 1,256.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.430
Or if we divide both sides by
9,999, you get-- so n is equal

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:15.620
to 1,256 divided by 9,999.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.230
And that is one of
our choices.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.280
1,256 divided by 9,999.
