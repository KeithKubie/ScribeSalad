THIS SIMILAR --

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.761 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT
OF BAD VERSIONS BEFORE US.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:49.762 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:52.365 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%

REALLY HARD TO DO.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:56.402 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
IT COSTS MONEY AND TV USED TO
NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY.

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:59.205 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S ALSO HARD I THINK
TO KEEP IT FROM BECOMING

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.407 align:start position:0% line:91%
PARODY. I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
DIFFICULT THING.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.844 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE OFTEN MAKE IT PARODY ON
SET.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.313 align:start position:0% line:91%

IT IS SUCH A FINE LINE.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.517 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES. BUT TO PULL THAT IS
NOT EASY.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.718 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:17.990 line:91%
