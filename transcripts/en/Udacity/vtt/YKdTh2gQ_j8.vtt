00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.118
Take a second to think about your best friend. What kind of personality traits

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:08.788
stand out? How did you come to that conclusion? Meaning, how did you determine

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:13.642
that they have these traits? Well, psychologists don't often have the luxury of

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.618
measuring personality in people that they know. And frankly, there'd be a lot

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:22.160
of problems in doing that, such as being biased or having a small sample size.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.314
So, we've developed many different methods to measure personality, including

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:30.220
behavioral observations, interviews, projective tests and self-report

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.984
questionnaires. Susan and I are going to talk about each of these in detail.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:38.390
But let's start with Susan who's going to go over behavioral observations.
