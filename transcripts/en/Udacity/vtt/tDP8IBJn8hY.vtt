00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.007
Let's make that another quiz.

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.283
So what bandwidth does our kernel achieve?

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:08.844
And so remember the last version I showed you ran with a value of N equals 1024,

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:12.415
and I told you it took 0.67 milliseconds.

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:16.748
And once again, I'd like the answer in gigabytes per second.
