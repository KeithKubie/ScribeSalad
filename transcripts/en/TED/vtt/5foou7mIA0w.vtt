00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.268
Theater matters because democracy matters.

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:21.572
Theater is the essential
art form of democracy,

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:25.864
and we know this because
they were born in the same city.

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:28.332
In the late 6th century BC,

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.215
the idea of Western democracy was born.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.748
It was, of course,

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:34.234
a very partial and flawed democracy,

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:39.213
but the idea that power should stem
from the consent of the governed,

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:42.665
that power should flow
from below to above,

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:44.300
not the other way around,

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:45.884
was born in that decade.

00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:51.092
And in that same decade, somebody --
legend has it, somebody named Thespis --

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:53.260
invented the idea of dialogue.

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:55.190
What does that mean, to invent dialogue?

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:57.840
Well, we know that
the Festival of Dionysus gathered

00:00:57.864 --> 00:00:59.398
the entire citizenry of Athens

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:01.130
on the side of the Acropolis,

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:04.453
and they would listen to music,
they would watch dancing,

00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:07.922
and they would have stories told
as part of the Festival of Dionysus.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:11.009
And storytelling is much like
what's happening right now:

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.588
I'm standing up here,

00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:14.633
the unitary authority,

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.215
and I am talking to you.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.629
And you are sitting back,
and you are receiving what I have to say.

00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:23.087
And you may disagree with it,
you may think I'm an insufferable fool,

00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:24.719
you may be bored to death,

00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:27.878
but that dialogue is mostly
taking place inside your own head.

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.677
But what happens if,
instead of me talking to you --

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:34.681
and Thespis thought of this --

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:37.456
I just shift 90 degrees to the left,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.150
and I talk to another person
onstage with me?

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.326
Everything changes,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.275
because at that moment,
I'm not the possessor of truth;

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.549
I'm a guy with an opinion.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.856
And I'm talking to somebody else.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.031
And you know what?

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:55.508
That other person has an opinion too,

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.936
and it's drama, remember,
conflict -- they disagree with me.

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:02.467
There's a conflict between
two points of view.

00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:08.787
And the thesis of that
is that the truth can only emerge

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.083
in the conflict
of different points of view.

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:13.841
It's not the possession of any one person.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:17.675
And if you believe in democracy,
you have to believe that.

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:20.576
If you don't believe that,
you're an autocrat

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.266
who is putting up with democracy.

00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:25.298
But that's the basic thesis of democracy,

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:28.451
that the conflict of different
points of views leads to the truth.

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:30.434
What's the other thing that's happening?

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.101
I'm not asking you to sit back
and listen to me.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.376
I'm asking you to lean forward

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.482
and imagine my point of view --

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:42.105
what this looks like and feels like
to me as a character.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.061
And then I'm asking you
to switch your mind

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:48.437
and imagine what it feels like
to the other person talking.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.940
I'm asking you to exercise empathy.

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.515
And the idea that truth comes
from the collision of different ideas

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.432
and the emotional muscle of empathy

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:03.031
are the necessary tools
for democratic citizenship.

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:05.705
What else happens?

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.976
The third thing really is you,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.802
is the community itself, is the audience.

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:15.311
And you know from personal experience
that when you go to the movies,

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.583
you walk into a movie theater,
and if it's empty, you're delighted,

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.265
because nothing's going to be
between you and the movie.

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.501
You can spread out, put your legs
over the top of the stadium seats,

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:26.233
eat your popcorn and just enjoy it.

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:28.159
But if you walk into a live theater

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.626
and you see that the theater is half full,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.942
your heart sinks.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.477
You're disappointed immediately,

00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:36.500
because whether you knew it or not,

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:38.420
you were coming to that theater

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:40.299
to be part of an audience.

00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:43.232
You were coming to have
the collective experience

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.827
of laughing together, crying together,
holding your breath together

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.576
to see what's going to happen next.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.083
You may have walked into that theater
as an individual consumer,

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.734
but if the theater does its job,

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:59.441
you've walked out with a sense
of yourself as part of a whole,

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:00.881
as part of a community.

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:05.654
That's built into the DNA of my art form.

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:11.220
Twenty-five hundred years later,
Joe Papp decided

00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:15.203
that the culture should belong to
everybody in the United States of America,

00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:19.023
and that it was his job
to try to deliver on that promise.

00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:21.925
He created Free Shakespeare in the Park.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.045
And Free Shakespeare in the Park
is based on a very simple idea,

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.639
the idea that the best theater,
the best art that we can produce,

00:04:29.663 --> 00:04:32.473
should go to everybody
and belong to everybody,

00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:34.238
and to this day,

00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:36.651
every summer night in Central Park,

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:39.052
2,000 people are lining up

00:04:39.076 --> 00:04:42.700
to see the best theater
we can provide for free.

00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:45.566
It's not a commercial transaction.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.061
In 1967, 13 years
after he figured that out,

00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:51.732
he figured out something else,

00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:55.313
which is that the democratic
circle was not complete

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.564
by just giving the people the classics.

00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:02.125
We had to actually let the people
create their own classics

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:03.964
and take the stage.

00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:06.045
And so in 1967,

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.128
Joe opened the Public Theater
downtown on Astor Place,

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:13.370
and the first show he ever produced
was the world premiere of "Hair."

00:05:13.394 --> 00:05:16.182
That's the first thing he ever did
that wasn't Shakespeare.

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:19.517
Clive Barnes in The Times said
that it was as if Mr. Papp took a broom

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.803
and swept up all the refuse
from the East Village streets

00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:25.166
onto the stage at the Public.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.194
(Laughter)

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:27.995
He didn't mean it complimentarily,

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:31.550
but Joe put it up in the lobby,
he was so proud of it.

00:05:31.574 --> 00:05:33.050
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:37.494
And what the Public Theater did over
the next years with amazing shows like

00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:41.042
"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf,"

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.834
"A Chorus Line,"

00:05:43.858 --> 00:05:47.890
and -- here's the most extraordinary
example I can think of:

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:53.168
Larry Kramer's savage cry of rage
about the AIDS crisis,

00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:54.514
"The Normal Heart."

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.929
Because when Joe produced
that play in 1985,

00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:01.995
there was more information about AIDS

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:05.210
in Frank Rich's review
in the New York Times

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:08.660
than the New York Times had published
in the previous four years.

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:13.084
Larry was actually changing
the dialogue about AIDS

00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:14.495
through writing this play,

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:15.922
and Joe was by producing it.

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:20.391
I was blessed to commission and work
on Tony Kushner's "Angels in America,"

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:24.063
and when doing that play
and along with "Normal Heart,"

00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:27.435
we could see that the culture
was actually shifting,

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:29.488
and it wasn't caused by the theater,

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.967
but the theater was doing its part

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:36.266
to change what it meant to be gay
in the United States.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.130
And I'm incredibly proud of that.

00:06:38.605 --> 00:06:40.498
(Applause)

00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:45.318
When I took over Joe's old job
at the Public in 2005,

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:49.077
I realized one of the problems we had
was a victim of our own success,

00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:54.126
which is: Shakespeare in the Park
had been founded as a program for access,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.701
and it was now the hardest ticket
to get in New York City.

00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:01.640
People slept out for two nights
to get those tickets.

00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:02.821
What was that doing?

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:05.438
That was eliminating
98 percent of the population

00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:07.291
from even considering going to it.

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:09.545
So we refounded the mobile unit

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.648
and took Shakespeare to prisons,
to homeless shelters,

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:15.160
to community centers in all five boroughs

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:17.875
and even in New Jersey
and Westchester County.

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:22.103
And that program proved something to us
that we knew intuitively:

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:26.867
people's need for theater
is as powerful as their desire for food

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.135
or for drink.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.403
It's been an extraordinary success,
and we've continued it.

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:35.116
And then there was yet another barrier
that we realized we weren't crossing,

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.404
which is a barrier of participation.

00:07:37.428 --> 00:07:38.726
And the idea, we said, is:

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.269
How can we turn theater
from being a commodity, an object,

00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:45.535
back into what it really is --

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:48.098
a set of relationships among people?

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:51.014
And under the guidance
of the amazing Lear deBessonet,

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:52.916
we started the Public Works program,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.832
which now every summer produces

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:57.698
these immense Shakespearean
musical pageants,

00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:00.486
where Tony Award-winning
actors and musicians

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.356
are side by side with nannies
and domestic workers

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.254
and military veterans
and recently incarcerated prisoners,

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:09.873
amateurs and professionals,

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:12.331
performing together on the same stage.

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:14.352
And it's not just a great social program,

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:16.486
it's the best art that we do.

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:20.954
And the thesis of it is
that artistry is not something

00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:23.069
that is the possession of a few.

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:26.461
Artistry is inherent
in being a human being.

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:30.084
Some of us just get to spend
a lot more of our lives practicing it.

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:32.403
And then occasionally --

00:08:32.427 --> 00:08:34.325
(Applause)

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.452
you get a miracle like "Hamilton,"

00:08:36.476 --> 00:08:42.596
Lin-Manuel's extraordinary retelling
of the foundational story of this country

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.426
through the eyes of the only Founding
Father who was a bastard immigrant orphan

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.006
from the West Indies.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.768
And what Lin was doing

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:53.255
is exactly what Shakespeare was doing.

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:57.854
He was taking the voice of the people,
the language of the people,

00:08:57.878 --> 00:09:00.135
elevating it into verse,

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:01.723
and by doing so,

00:09:01.747 --> 00:09:03.548
ennobling the language

00:09:03.572 --> 00:09:06.909
and ennobling the people
who spoke the language.

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:11.717
And by casting that show entirely
with a cast of black and brown people,

00:09:11.741 --> 00:09:14.204
what Lin was saying to us,

00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:16.832
he was reviving in us

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.451
our greatest aspirations
for the United States,

00:09:20.475 --> 00:09:22.826
our better angels of America,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.255
our sense of what this country could be,

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:29.418
the inclusion that was at the heart
of the American Dream.

00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:33.668
And it unleashed
a wave of patriotism in me

00:09:33.692 --> 00:09:35.014
and in our audience,

00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:38.865
the appetite for which
is proving to be insatiable.

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:43.225
But there was another side to that,
and it's where I want to end,

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.420
and it's the last story
I want to talk about.

00:09:45.444 --> 00:09:48.216
Some of you may have heard
that Vice President-elect Pence

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.962
came to see "Hamilton" in New York.

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:55.040
And when he came in,
some of my fellow New Yorkers booed him.

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:56.899
And beautifully, he said,

00:09:56.923 --> 00:09:58.973
"That's what freedom sounds like."

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.171
And at the end of the show,

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:04.388
we read what I feel was a very
respectful statement from the stage,

00:10:04.412 --> 00:10:07.267
and Vice President-elect Pence
listened to it,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.695
but it sparked a certain amount
of outrage, a tweetstorm,

00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:15.293
and also an internet boycott of "Hamilton"

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:19.453
from outraged people who had felt
we had treated him with disrespect.

00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:24.067
I looked at that boycott and I said,
we're getting something wrong here.

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.410
All of these people who have signed
this boycott petition,

00:10:27.434 --> 00:10:29.699
they were never going to see
"Hamilton" anyway.

00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:32.637
It was never going to come
to a city near them.

00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:35.220
If it could come,
they couldn't afford a ticket,

00:10:35.244 --> 00:10:38.736
and if they could afford a ticket,
they didn't have the connections

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.161
to get that ticket.

00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:42.546
They weren't boycotting us;

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:45.098
we had boycotted them.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.483
And if you look at the red and blue
electoral map of the United States,

00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:51.820
and if I were to tell you,

00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:53.899
"Oh, the blue is what designates

00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:56.879
all of the major nonprofit
cultural institutions,"

00:10:56.903 --> 00:10:58.338
I'd be telling you the truth.

00:10:58.362 --> 00:10:59.568
You'd believe me.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:04.195
We in the culture have done
exactly what the economy,

00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:07.849
what the educational system,
what technology has done,

00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:11.548
which is turn our back
on a large part of the country.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.110
So this idea of inclusion,
it has to keep going.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:18.256
Next fall, we are sending out on tour

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.469
a production of Lynn Nottage's brilliant,
Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Sweat."

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:27.872
Years of research in Redding, Pennsylvania
led her to write this play

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:31.121
about the deindustrialization
of Pennsylvania:

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:33.793
what happened when steel left,

00:11:33.817 --> 00:11:36.077
the rage that was unleashed,

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:37.732
the tensions that were unleashed,

00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:40.016
the racism that was unleashed

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.532
by the loss of jobs.

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:44.924
We're taking that play
and we're touring it

00:11:44.948 --> 00:11:47.737
to rural counties in Pennsylvania,

00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:49.989
Ohio, Michigan,

00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:52.340
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

00:11:52.364 --> 00:11:56.825
We're partnering with community
organizations there to try and make sure

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:00.775
not only that we reach the people
that we're trying to reach,

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:03.677
but that we find ways
to listen to them back

00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:07.334
and say, "The culture
is here for you, too."

00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:09.115
Because --

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:11.567
(Applause)

00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:13.737
we in the culture industry,

00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:15.860
we in the theater,

00:12:15.884 --> 00:12:19.496
have no right to say
that we don't know what our job is.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.546
It's in the DNA of our art form.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.229
Our job "... is to hold up,
as 'twere, a mirror to nature;

00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:28.932
to show scorn her image,

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:31.989
to show virtue her appearance,

00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:35.277
and the very age its form and pressure."

00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:39.670
Our job is to try to hold up
a vision to America

00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:43.757
that shows not only
who all of us are individually,

00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:48.088
but that welds us back into
the commonality that we need to be,

00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:49.922
the sense of unity,

00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:51.618
the sense of whole,

00:12:51.642 --> 00:12:53.790
the sense of who we are as a country.

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:57.125
That's what the theater is supposed to do,

00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.778
and that's what we need to try to do
as well as we can.

00:12:59.802 --> 00:13:01.078
Thank you very much.

00:13:01.102 --> 00:13:06.000
(Applause)
