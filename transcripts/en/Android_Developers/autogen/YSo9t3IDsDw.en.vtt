00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.912
 [MUSIC PLAY] 

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:09.810
 AARON MARSHALL: I'm part of a small percentage 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.880
 people in the world who can literally work from anywhere. 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.280
 And it's freedom for me. 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.990
 One of my family values ​​is that we think 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.130
 life is about living fantastic stories. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 And so to get to Cape Town, start this business, 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.892
 And to live like that, we think is a fantastic story. 

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.350
 The possibilities here are endless. 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.570
 We love it. 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 Over is a simple application to add text to photos. 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.750
 You can rotate the text, change the color, 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.500
 really fit in with customization. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.939
 We offer hundreds of fonts. 

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.730
 And we constantly upload new fonts 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.154
 you can unlock. 

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:42.945
 We also have artwork, some of which are exclusive. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.790
 The decision for us to go to Android was obvious. 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.880
 80% of the global market is currently using Android. 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.970
 And we were really passionate about helping people 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.260
 to be creative, and that was an easy way 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.785
 to get many more people. 

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:58.160
 JONATHAN ORFORD: It's everywhere. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.493
 It is growing very, very fast. 

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.930
 And we want to be part of it. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.429
 The high-level and low-level devices 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.310
 support everyone Over, which is great for us. 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
 When we decided to develop the Android app, 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.080
 I already had two developers in mind. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.220
 They had Java experience, but very limited Android 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.140
 experience. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.370
 They were able to get to know much, very quickly, 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.465
 and we could start writing code within days. 

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.360
 JOHAN NELL: I joined Over with no previous Android experience. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.090
 And I and Herko and I could get a working prototype 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.900
 to Aaron within the first week. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.650
 HERKO LATEGAN: My experience 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380
 About to develop Android was really fast. 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.570
 It took us two months. 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.260
 And originally our product manager 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.440
 thought it would take a lot longer. 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.110
 And I think the biggest advantage of working on Android 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 is that the tools are incredible. 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.074
 You have Android Studio. 

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:42.740
 And you have all this documentation 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.932
 Immediately at your disposal, making it easy for us. 

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:46.890
 JONATHAN ORFORD: We offer our program 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.440
 to as many countries as we possibly can 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.710
 and therefore we need to adjust the prices. 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 And some countries want rounded prices, some not. 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.401
 We have full control over our pricing with Google Play 

00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.150
 Developer. 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.204
 This is one place where I can go and see everything. 

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.370
 I can look at statistics. 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.045
 I can look at my deployments. 

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.195
 I can see ratings and reviews. 

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:06.820
 This is brilliant. 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.185
 And it's all in one place and very, very easy to use. 

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.560
 AARON MARSHALL: I love the Google Play experience. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280
 I can even talk to the customers in the reviews. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.544
 And that customer commitment is extremely valuable. 

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.210
 If you don't know what they think, 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.054
 if you can't interact and talk and ask questions, 

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.720
 It's hard to work out what is valuable. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.870
 And to drive value to customers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.710
 what a company and a new business is all about. 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.020
 JOHAN NELL: I remember the first day we started, 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.054
 just look at the analyzes and see how people 

00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:34.470
 the program starts and uses it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.120
 and then moving on to the social networking services 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.100
 and to see these artwork, these pictures that people 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.310
 create with codes we wrote. 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.895
 The creativity that inspires it makes your mouth hang. 

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:48.290
 It was really exciting. 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.165
 AARON MARSHALL: All around we have a mantra. 

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.470
 We always say: go big and go home. 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130
 We don't think you should sacrifice your family 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.760
 to acquire wealth or create value or the world 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.500
 to change. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.970
 What helps it to have all those things 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.040
 if you do not have a family for that success 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.690
 to share? 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 So for us success is twofold. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.950
 We want to go big, and we want to go home.
