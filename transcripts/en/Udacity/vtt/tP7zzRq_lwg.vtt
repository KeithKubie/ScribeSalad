00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.050
The 3rd main category of connector are the data access connectors. And this is

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.570
as the name indicates, this, is where the connector is responsible for

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.900
dealing with access to some kind of data repository. Hence,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.800
there is a communication service provided.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.080
Moreover, the, the access connector may provide some kind of translation.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.520
Surfaces could be character set translation, or something at a higher level.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.180
Hence, there's a conversion service being provided. Some of the variations and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.190
data access connectors include locality that is. Are the connectors specific to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.970
a particular thread, or to a particular processor are they global?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.580
What kinds of access are allowed? Is it simply query retrieval, or

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.000
might there be changes allowed? What's the availability of the data access?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.690
Is it transient? Is it persistent that is could it be

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.379
long lasting as with the earlier connectors accessibility in terms of private,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
protected or public. With respect to, to life cycle who is responsible for

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.890
doing the construction or building and who's responsible for

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.510
cleaning up when things are. Over think your instructors and destruction, and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.770
as far as, cardinality is concerned who, who's responsible for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.160
defining the messages and who's responsible for receiving them or using them.
