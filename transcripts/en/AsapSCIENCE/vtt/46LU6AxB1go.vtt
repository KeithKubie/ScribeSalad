After puberty, pubic hair begins to
surround our external genitalia. But with

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.740
hair removal and grooming becoming a
popular personal practice, is it really

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.690
the best idea to shave or wax down there
or is a full bush the way to go?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.210
Humans lost most of their thick body hair
around seventy thousand to one hundred

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.410
and twenty thousand years after the last
ice age, but despite becoming mostly bare,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.410
being retained plentiful hair in our
armpits and crotches becoming the only

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.440
mammalian species in the world to have
long course pubic hair. Researchers

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.550
hypothesize that pubic hairs after
puberty as a visual signal to potential

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.800
partners that one is ready to mate, while
the bushes itself act as protection from

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.559
friction during sexual intercourse.
Another theory involves sweat. Humans have

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.519
two types of sweat glands, one type
secretes mostly water and salt producing

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.440
no odor, while the other apocrine glands
are found specifically in the armpit and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.920
the pubic areas and using the pubic hair
follicles secrete fluids rich in

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.880
proteins, lipids,  and pheromones. When bacteria on the
skin breakdown these molecules, you get

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.229
body odor. We may have evolved to retain
these hairs to trap pheromones to be

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
wanted towards potential mates. This is
further supported by the fact that women

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.600
release different pheromones during
ovulation signaling fertility in order

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.380
to become more attractive to others. But
a study of over 1,000 students in America

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.370
found that 96% of females and 87%
of males had either partially or completely

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.300
removed pubic hair within the past month.
As pubic hair its course, the regrowth

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.810
after any type of grooming can be
irritating to the skin. In fact 75% of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.950
people sorting out their pubes have
experienced genital itching, and 40% have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.060
experienced a rash of some sort.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.450
Shaving and waxing can create here that
grows inward instead about to the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890
surfers resulting in red and inflamed
raised bumps. Interestingly, the incidents

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.270
of pubic lice has actually decreased due
to shaving and waxing.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.659
However these practices can also create
microscopic abrasions on the skin, which

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.659
can become infected and even transmit a
myriad of sexually transmitted diseases.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.820
It has been theorized that pubic hair
removal also correlates directly with

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.750
the rise of gonorrhea, chlamydia and HPV
infections. Even with infections put

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.799
aside, the most common genital injuries
reported in American emergency rooms are

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.500
a direct consequence of pubic hair
removal. At the end of the day, no matter

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.190
what grooming trends are currently
popular, there's no harm in growing that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.190
bush the way that nature intended.
