00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.280
Plants! You're familiar with
their work: They turn all that

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.870
carbon dioxide that we don't
want into the oxygen we do want,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780
they're all around us,
and they've been around

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.259
for a lot longer than animals.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.530
The plants that we see today probably
evolved from a single species

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.410
of algae that noodged itself onshore
about 1.2 billion years ago.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.820
And from that one little piece of
algae, all of the half million

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.550
or so species of plants
that we have today evolved.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.859
But of course all this
didn't happen overnight.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.040
It wasn't until about
475 million years ago that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.430
the first plants started to evolve.
And they were very simple

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.180
didn't have a lot of
different tissue types,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.370
and the descendants of those plants
still live among us today.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.969
They're the nonvascular plants:
the liverworts, the hornworts

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.770
and everybody's best
friends, the mosses.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.449
Mmm, fuzzy!

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.449
Now, yeah, it's clear that
these guys are less complicated

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.840
than an orchid or an oak tree,
and if you said they were

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.770
less beautiful, you probably wouldn't
get that much argument from me.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.010
But by now I think
you've learned enough

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.399
about biology to know that when it
comes to the simplest things:

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.000
sometimes they're
the craziest of all.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.219
Because they evolved
early in the scheme

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.540
of things they were sort of able
to evolve their own set of rules.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.230
So, much like we saw with
archaea, protists and bacteria,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.780
nonvascular plants have some bizarre
features and some kooky habits

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.080
that seem, to us, like,
kind of, just, like, what?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.030
Especially when it
comes to their sex lives.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.250
The main thing to know
about nonvascular plants

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.440
is their reproductive cycle,
which they inherited from algae

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.670
but perfected to the point where
now it is used by all plants

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.300
in one way or another,
and there are even traces of it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.640
in our own reproductive systems.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.100
Usually when we're talking about plants, we're
really talking about

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.460
vascular plants, which have stuff
like roots, stems, and leaves.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.820
Those roots, stems and leaves are
actually tissues that transport

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.300
water and nutrients from one
part of the plant to another.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.820
As a result, vascular plants
are able to go all giant sequoia.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.670
The main defining trait of
nonvascular plants is that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.170
they don't have specialized
conductive tissues.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.000
Since they don't
have roots and stems,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.390
they can't reach down into the
soil to get to water and nutrients.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.860
They have to take moisture in
directly through their cell walls

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.720
and move it around from
cell to cell through osmosis,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290
while they rely on diffusion
to transport minerals.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.860
Another thing nonvascular
plants have in common

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410
is limited growth potential.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.420
Largely because they don't
have tissues to move

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.040
the good stuff around, or woody
tissue to support more mass,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.840
the way for them to win is
to keep it simple and small.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110
So small that when you
look at one of these dudes,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.250
you sometimes might not
know what you're looking at.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.200
And finally, nonvascular plants
need water for reproduction

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.000
This is kind of a bummer for
them because it means they can't

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.210
really survive in dry places
like a lot of vascular plants can.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.230
But I'll get back
to that in a minute.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.570
Other than that,
nonvasculars are true plants:

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.510
They're multicellular, they have
cell walls made of cellulose,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.300
and they use photosynthesis
to make their food.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.320
All the nonvascular plants
are collectively referred

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.600
to as bryophytes, and who
knows how many different sorts

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.880
there used to be back
in the olden days,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.430
but we can currently meet three
phyla of bryophytes in person:

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.940
the mosses, in phylum Bryophyta,
the liverworts, in phylum

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.180
Hepatophyta, and the hornworts
in phylum Anthocerophyta.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.900
Taken together, there are over
24,000 species of bryophytes

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000
out there: about 15,000 are
mosses, 9,000 are liverworts

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.440
and only only about
100 are hornworts.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.319
Hornworts and liverworts, funny
names, but are named after

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.990
the shape of their
leaf-like structures

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.260
horns for the hornworts and
livers for the liverworts

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.010
with "wort," stuck on the end
there, which just means "herb."

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.170
And you know what moss looks
like, though some things that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.470
are called moss like "Spanish moss"
in the southern United States,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.700
and "reindeer moss" up in the alpine
tundra of Alaska, are imposters,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.410
they're actually lichens and
lichens aren't even plants!

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.780
The very oldest fossils of plant
fragments look really similar

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.450
to liverworts, but nobody really
knows which of the bryophytes

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.020
evolved first and
which descended from which.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.290
We just know that something very
bryophytic-looking was the first

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.180
plant to rear its leafy head
back in the Ordovician swamps.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.580
So, now we've got these ultra-old
timey nonvascular plants to provide

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.300
us with some clues as
to how plants evolved.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.880
And like I mentioned,
the most important contribution

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.660
to the Kingdom Plantae, and
everything that came after them,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.130
is their wonderfully
complex reproductive cycle.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.599
See, plants,
vascular and nonvascular,

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.269
have a way more complicated sexual
life cycle than animals do.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.250
With animals, it's pretty
much a one-step process:

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.910
two haploid gametes, one from
the mom and one from the dad,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.440
come together to make a
diploid cell that combines

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.550
the genetic material
from both parents.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.790
That diploid cell divides
and divides and divides

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.000
and divides until, voila!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.090
The world is one marmot
or grasshopper richer.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.810
Plants, on the other hand,
along with algae and a handful

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.950
of invertebrate animal species,
have evolved a cycle in which

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.870
they take on two different forms
over the course of their lives,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.030
one form giving rise
to the other form.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.850
This type of reproductive cycle is
called alternation of generations,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.690
and it evolved first in algae,
and many of them still use it today.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.270
However, the difference between
algae and plants here is that,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.990
in algae, both generations
look pretty much the same,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.810
while in land plants, all land
plants, the alternating generations

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.550
are fundamentally
different from each other.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.220
And by fundamental, I mean that
the two don't even share

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.070
the same basic
reproductive strategy.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.150
One generation, called the
gametophyte, reproduces sexually

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.320
by producing gametes, eggs and
sperm, which you know are haploid

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.320
cells that only carry
one set of chromosomes.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.050
And the bryophyte sperm is a lot
like human sperm, except they have

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.970
two flagella instead of one,
and they're kind of coil shaped.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.870
When the sperm and egg fuse, they
give rise to the second generation,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.050
called the sporophyte
generation, which is asexual.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.930
The sporophyte itself is diploid,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.770
so it already has two sets
of chromosomes in each cell.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.970
It has a little capsule
called a sporangium,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.620
which produces haploid reproductive
cells called spores.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.880
During its life, the sporophyte
remains attached to its parent

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.620
gametophyte, which it relies
on for water and nutrients.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.699
Once its spores
disperse and germinate,

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.699
they in turn produce gametophytes,

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.040
which turn around and produce
another sporophyte generation.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.410
And so on. Weird, I know,
but that's the fun of it.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.220
Life is peculiar and that's
what makes it so great.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.729
This means that the nonvascular
plants that we all recognize,

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.810
the green, leafy, livery
or horny parts of the moss,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.320
liverwort or hornwort,
are actually gametophytes.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.270
Sporophytes are only found
tucked inside the females,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.030
and they're super
small and hard to see.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.300
So in this gametophyte generation,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.919
individuals are always
either male or female.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.930
The male makes sperm through
mitosis in a feature

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.800
called the antheridia,
the male reproductive structure.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.979
While the female gametophyte
makes the egg, also through mitosis,

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.820
inside the female
reproductive structures,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.800
which are called the archegonia.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.500
These two gametophytes might be
hanging out right next to each other,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.460
sperm and eggs totally ready to go,
but they can't do anything until

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.550
water is introduced
to the situation.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.280
So let's just add a sprinkle
of water and take a tour

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.699
of the bryophytes'
sex cycle, shall we?

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.000
By way of the water, the sperm
finds its way to the female

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.280
and then into the egg, where the
two gametes fuse to create a

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.080
diploid zygote, which divides by
mitosis and grows into a sporophyte.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.470
The sporophyte grows inside
the mother, until one day it

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.250
cracks open and the sporophyte
sends up a long stalk

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.910
with a little cap on
top called the calyptra.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.080
This protective case is made
out of the remaining piece

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.240
of the mother gametophyte,
and under it a capsule forms

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.940
full of thousands of
little diploid spores.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.729
When the capsule is
mature, the lid falls off,

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.020
and the spores are
exposed to the air.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.419
If humidity levels are high enough,

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.550
the capsule will let the
spores go to meet their fate.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.690
Now, if one lands on a
basketball court or something,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.150
it will just die if
it doesn't get water.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.160
But if it lands on moist
ground, it germinates, producing

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.470
a little filament called the
protonema, that gives rise to buds.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.680
These eventually grow
into a patch of moss,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.850
which is just a colony
of haploid gametophytes.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.520
That generation will mate,
and make sporophytes,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.740
and the generations will continue
their alternation indefinitely!

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.810
Now because nonvascular plants are
the least complex kind of plants,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.789
their alternation of
generations process

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:56.479
is about as simple as it gets.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.030
But with vascular plants,
because they have all kinds

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.919
of specialized tissues, things
get a little more convoluted.

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.660
For instance, plants that
produce unprotected seeds,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.990
like conifers or gingko
trees, are gymnosperms,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.500
and it's at this level
that we start to see pollen,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.479
which is just a male gamete
that can float through the air.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:16.050
The pollen thing is taken to
the next level with angiosperms,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.910
or flowering plants, which
are the most diverse group

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.400
of land plants, and the
most recently evolved.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.530
So the main difference between
the alternation of generations

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.699
in vascular and nonvascular
plants is that in bryophytes

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:29.180
you recognize the
gametophyte as being the...

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.539
you know, the plant part. The moss
or the liverwort or whatever.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.579
While the sporophyte is less
recognizable and smaller.

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:38.550
But as plants get more complicated,
like with vascular plants,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.159
the sporophytes become
the dominant phase,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.089
more prominent or recognizable.
Like the flower of an angiosperm,

00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:47.980
for instance, is, itself,
actually the sporophyte.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.100
Now I maybe just stuck a spoon in
all the stuff that you learned

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.129
and stirred it up
to confuse you more.

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:54.910
But we'll get into this
more when we talk about

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.679
the reproduction of vascular plants.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:59.279
But whether they have a big
showy sporophyte like a flower

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:03.329
or a little, damp gametophyte
like a moss, all land plants

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:06.839
came from the same, tiny little
ancient nonvascular plant

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:09.839
who just put their sperm
out there, hoping to find

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:12.389
some lady gametophyte
they could call their own.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:13.899
And I think that's kind of sweet.

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:15.999
Thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Biology.

00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:17.920
And thanks to all the people
who helped put it together.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.959
There's a table of
contents over there if you

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.769
want to go review anything.

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:22.889
And if you have any
questions for us,

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.470
we're on Facebook and
Twitter and, of course,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.600
we're down in the comments below.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.199
Thanks a lot.
