00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
Now that we have our quadratic inequality written out very nicely, I'd like you

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.320
to figure out what the critical values of x that are going to divide up our

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.434
number line are, and then what intervals those critical values determine. Just a

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:15.263
hint. You should probably start by factoring the expression on the left. Also

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:18.803
when you write your intervals out at the end, I'd like you to write them as

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:19.596
inequalities.
