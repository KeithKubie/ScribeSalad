00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
So they made it much more

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.440
Commodore 64 like in its layout

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.220
In fact it'd be quite funny to open up and point and laugh at the chips because it's a ridiculous waste of space

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.980
Can we open it up?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Yeah, we can open this one up

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.669
Three simple screws in this one, but this one at some point has overheated. You can see the tracks of the motherboard

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.240
Here on the case. It's no wonder this machine was dead when I got it. So this is one of my restoration ones

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.269
Cassette has absolutely killed the board and yet it's still amazingly worked

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.220
There's a fair bit of space in there

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.980
There is a lot of space in that, so of course it's a Commodore 64 case

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Just painted

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.219
black with um

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.930
Rather nice fetching charcoal grey keys. As you can see, I have heatsinked the main processor so that is an 8501

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.899
Processor this is the Ted chip

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.309
Which is the 8360 so that does all the sound, video

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.809
joystick,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.739
tape player,

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.478
everything is on that chip really. And then we have the three chips next to it is the kernel ROM, the PLA, and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.140
The third one that escapes me. But a lot of things that can go wrong with this

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.309
Apart from the two chips that they're the ones that really need heatsink in straight away

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.939
These voltage regulators can crack a bit under stress and also it's been known to kill one of these machines

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.159
Just pulling the joystick out while it's on

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.500
So if you need to adjust which joystick you have in there, you should really turn the machine off first

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.880
It can just put a bit of an extra strain on the Ted that you don't need, so um

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.520
If you opened up a commodore 64 it would fill that would it? It's a lot bigger

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.919
So for instance, I think we're the sid chip and everything is would cover this grill. That's the reason that grill's there

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.419
So, as you can see, we've gone from the little c16 machine and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.430
They've literally just elongated the board. So it fits all the ports. It's an evolution of the 1-6. Yes, I believe it was given to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:08.038
Commodore Japan again who I think just thought let's turn it into a replacement for the vic-20 and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.910
There it is is. Absolutely no changes

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.419
To the functionality between this and the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.399
C11 6 it's possibly a little

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.360
less reliable because it hasn't got all the heat protection that the 116 has in so

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.109
yeah, if you get one of these, add your own heat sinks immediately. Also, I should mention as well that

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.849
Both the 116 and the Commodore 16 can be upgraded relatively easily to 64k

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.569
I've got one

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.819
I haven't got like a little daughter board sits on top

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.660
with the extra memory on and it's got a little switch in there to switch between

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.410
16 and 64 K as far as I know there is one single game

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.799
Contemporary to when these machines were about between 84 and 86 that does not work on both machines

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.310
As it actually says Commodore 16 for some reason

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.549
It doesn't work on the +4 that might be something it's likely to do with the ever so slightly different processors

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.369
There are ways to know whether you have got a dead

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.280
Ted or a dead processor in one of these

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.639
So if you turn it on and you've gotten Hera light and you've got a totally black screen then your Ted is dead

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.259
If you've got a gray slightly noisy screen

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.660
Then your processor is at fault. Also, if we have a little look around the machine the power lead now goes in the side as

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.549
does the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.690
joystick

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.209
We've got the cassette port we've got the serial port for printer as well as its own

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Disk drive it will use

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.709
1541 or any of the other commodore disk drives we'll work on that. We've got the video out the RF out and then

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.219
Much like the other Commodores we have the cartridge port

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.389
so

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.418
They were not very many cartridge games released for the 264 series. There was one or two games

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.599
I think scott adams had all these adventure games released on cartridge

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.810
there's quite fun puzzle one called the dazzles a

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:22.309
Diagnostics car as well, but what this is very handy for on the commodore 16 and the commodore one one six is

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.699
Expandable ram packs. I know of only two games

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.119
that ever used 32k all and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.129
One of them is bandits at zero where you just get slightly better sound effects

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.640
But getting hold of a 64 K round pack for this these machines now is nigh on impossible

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.009
I haven't seen one in the wild for years

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.070
So it's far easier to get them upgraded

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.119
internally to 64 K than to try and track down a

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.770
64 K round peg, how will that work in terms of the game itself?

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.300
Then would be a separate version

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.749
If you've got a ram pack, would you load in something different audit just load more stuff. It just seems to like more stuff in

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.390
also

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.480
There are very few versions like that that have got a little extra on there I'm now struggling to find a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.219
64 K game much as I did back in the day. Here we go. We've got

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.200
This one here. So this is +4 only so all these games are 64 K

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.630
Versions of 16 K games if you had an expanded Commodore 16 there just load straight in the commodore + 4 did have its own

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.450
64 K games, but they weren't very numerous what tended to happen was

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.659
You got games for the machine that sold by far the best and the machine that sold by far?

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.630
The best was the Commodore 16 it was far cheaper

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.089
Commodore as she didn't make as many mistakes of it particularly in the UK and

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.580
This is where we see all these most of the games

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.609
Say C 16 straight + 4. So they'll work on either Commodore in America. They I don't think they did much with it

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.799
far more successful were Commodore of UK who sold it very very well as a learning computer as your first computer and

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.110
It was a pretty reasonable price where I think it was. I think they tried to get 129 pounds first

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.130
It very quickly went down to 89 pounds and it's it sold

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.179
Particularly over what a Christmas period in 85 really well

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.150
There's a lot of things on the internet so total disaster it didn't sell

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.140
But one of the biggest software houses in the UK at the time was master tronic and they were sending messages out to their

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.099
Freelance programmers. Can we get some software for this machine for some reason it's selling like hotcakes

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.839
Can we get some game sold and in the end I think math electronic produced from 53 games for it

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.500
Which they certainly wouldn't have been bothering to do that

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.089
If the machine had been a total disaster sales rise and muster tronic in my memory

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.530
So I remember every one or two of these titles. We're kind of pocket money games were theywere

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.420
So these were like $1.99 each

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.719
I think we've got one of the biggest sellers certainly on Commodore 16 here was Rockman which is a

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.220
Boulder desk loan. So most of these ones are $1.99. There is the odd one here. So we have one on the mad title

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.220
So milestone tronic added dimension

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.830
These were a bit partially Salar $2.99 big money

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.750
Also master tronic were also doing little compilations

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.619
I mean this did an absolutely brilliant version of pack mania or the

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:39.630
Another huge seller was formula 1 simulator and it's totally different to the other versions because master tronic and a few other companies

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.670
we've got

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.670
gremlin graphics

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.430
Do games like The Magicians curse? They seem to really understand the Machine and they play to its strengths

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.180
so

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.750
nice colorful short little action games

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.230
They're always

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.539
Amazing artwork on the front of these games and they're you'd see that picture and then you turn it over

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.520
Straightaway and say what did it actually look like? Yeah. We've got a good example here. So we've got gun law

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.110
the actual M

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.940
game, then it's incredibly slow to play and

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.559
Also to keep the memory down you couldn't move diagonally

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:23.429
So you can move up down left and right so there was no diagonal control Shree lowborn up. Yes

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.640
What should we ever go at? I do actually want to show you

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.339
What is one of the most criminally?

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:36.000
Awful games but I can understand why it was criminally awful because they tried to cram it into one load Green Beret

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.490
So they never bothered with a full-price release of it. These are the advertised screens on the back

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:51.449
So spectra version there, I think that's BBC Amstrad and Commodore I think now let's have a look at the Commodore 16 version

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:58.929
I'm cringing already. Yes. Don't even put it in the tape though. If anyone knows what green beret should look like I

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.319
Wouldn't be at all surprised if the tape player chews it up in disgust

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.989
So to give you some idea of the difficulty with the game all the weapons apart from a knife for missing

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.510
from the Commodore 16 version

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:20.410
So everyone's coming at you with guns and you have literally only got a knife to ward them off obviously graphically

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.350
You're severely compromised sonically as well. So I think there's one sound effect in this entire game and

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.670
detail in the graphic so you couldn't have too much detail, which is

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.150
Why the horror of what you're about to see makes?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.860
You've literally got wireframe graphics. It looks like it's been written in basic

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.920
Sorry - whoever wrote green beret for singling this game out

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.979
But it is a great demonstration a lot of the machines at the time

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:51.069
They were increasing their memory and then Commodore took this somewhat backwards step trying to basically turn their

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.440
What should have been a cheap business machine?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.910
Into something. It wasn't really capable of being right. Here we go

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:04.449
You can already see the lack of sprite capabilities is the first problem. So everyone's got a huge lack now at random

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.190
Let's try and get a bit further

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.410
I think he's only got about four frames of animation as well as more and more things appear on the screen

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.410
Obviously we're starting to struggle. Oh

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.940
I don't know what then

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.270
from behind

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.320
back

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.320
And of course yes, or no, then it got a knife

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.340
So it's the whole thing of bringing in a knife to a gunfight, isn't it? It really is

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.739
It's it's just what else is there to say about the 16-bit if it's a flop in the States, did they have other plans then?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.970
so

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.410
For the Commodore 16, not really so it sold for a couple of years

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.460
pretty well in the UK and a couple of other countries and then

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.670
Commodore quietly bend it and

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.650
But at least it was far more successful than its larger brother. I

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.240
Would do a shout out to a couple of programmers

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.850
so I'm going to load in a game called Earth annoyed and

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.180
This is by a guy who any Commodore 64 owner should know Sean southern

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.389
microchip software who if it hadn't been for Sean southern and of others who donates
