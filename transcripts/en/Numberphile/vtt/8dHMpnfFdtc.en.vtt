00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.500
A 2-manifold is a thin piece of surface, like this piece of paper, or

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.340
this piece of thin plastic. But a 2-manifold must not have any branches. A book that has many pages,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.729
but has a spine where they all come together, that would not

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.160
qualify as a 2-manifold.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
But even a weird thing like that would qualify as a 2-manifold.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.429
2-manifold may have borders such as this Möbius band.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.569
Or it may have holes, like this particular Klein bottle. Or it may be

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.279
completely closed, like this surface of an icosahedron, or the shell of an egg. Now for topologists,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.329
all objects are made of infinitely stretchable rubber. And so the geometry really doesn't matter. And if I deform this Möbius band,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.740
you know, it stays a Möbius band, and the topologist would still classify this in exactly the same way as the original shape.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.000
From this point of view, all of these 2-manifolds can be classified by just three integer numbers.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.739
The first one is the number of borders. This particular Möbius band has just a single border. I can run my finger around the border

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.280
here, and if I go around the loop twice, I'm coming back to where I started.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.940
Brady: "So this is like the edge."

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.360
This is the edge of the thin surface. This particular plastic piece has two borders,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.760
you know, one is a circle here, and the other one is this particular edge here.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.480
Brady: "So this is the part where if an ant was crawling on it, it would cut itself in half."

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.660
That's right. And if we look at this piece of paper,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.320
this one has three borders. One is the rectangular frame on the outside, and then we have, you know, a circular border here,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
and sort of kidney shaped border over on this particular case. So this is the first number.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.239
The second number is the sidedness of a surface. So this piece of paper is clearly two-sided. As a matter of fact,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.710
It has a blue side, and it has a white side, and you cannot get from one side to the other without

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.038
crawling over this very sharp edge where

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.860
an ant would cut itself to death. The Möbius band, on the other hand, has a single side.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.800
If you start painting and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.209
spreading your paint without ever crossing one of the edges you would come around, and you would notice that by the time you're done,

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.569
you have actually painted both sides of this particular surface.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.160
So that's a single-sided surface with a single edge. On the other hand, the Klein bottle here is also single-sided surface,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.649
but, as you can see, it has no edges. However, we cannot really create a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.330
completely closed

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.559
Klein bottle in three-dimensional space, without having either some opening, some punctures, or a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.750
self-intersection line. And you can see here, here is one of those self-intersection lines.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.969
Now if I don't like these self-intersection lines, I could cut a slightly larger hole into the wall of the thick arm,

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.199
so that the thin arm then can be passing through. So in this model, rather than living with the self-intersection,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.670
I have cut a large enough opening into the green body so I can bring out the thin arm without creating a self intersections.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.639
But for the price of creating an opening, a so-called puncture, which has its own border.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.729
So this would still be a Klein bottle, but now it is a Klein bottle with one puncture.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.380
There's an important message here.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.979
And that means that simple holes that you cut in a surface do not change the type of surface for a topologist.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.479
Even though this little thing has a whole lot of little holes, it would still be considered a Klein bottle,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.700
but with many many many many many punctures.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.709
Now from that point of view, this little cylinder

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.730
is really just a sphere with two punctures.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.309
And this becomes a little bit more obvious if you try to cap off these openings.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.919
So we put a cap on here.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.179
Now it would be a sphere with only one puncture, and by the time I'm adding the second cap, it becomes more obvious that

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.549
this is topologically just a sphere.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.279
There is a third number that is important for the classification of all 2-manifolds,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.440
and that has to do with the connectivity of the surface. It's called the genus of a surface.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:31.660
A sphere, or equivalent topological shapes, would be of genus zero. A donut would be of genus one. A two-hole donut

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.320
would be of genus 2.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.380
And here is a more complicated object,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.599
and the surface of that would also be a 2-manifold of genus 2.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.430
The genus is clearly related to how many holes you have in your donut,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.520
or how many handles that there are. A more precise definition would be, how many closed loop lines

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.639
can you draw on that surface, that if you were to cut along them, the surface would still hang together?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.420
If I take my piece of paper, cut a circle loop into it, then the inner part of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.640
that hole falls out and is clearly no longer connected.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.779
On the other hand, if I take my simple torus, and I cut along this red line

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.369
then I simply get some kind of, you know, tubing, but it still all hangs together.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.450
So this is of genus one, because I draw one such line.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.430
If I had a two hole torus, I could draw two such lines, and I can cut along those,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.020
and after both those cuts the surface still all hangs together.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.189
So that's a surface of genus 2. If I take my Möbius band,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.400
and I'm cutting along that red line,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.199
I maintain that this Möbius band will not fall apart.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.130
Now, what do I get?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.150
I get a loop twice the size. It has a twist of 360 degrees in it,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.260
but it is still in one piece. And since I could do one such cut, that means that Möbius band

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.710
had a genus of one. Try to cut it again in the middle,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:28.450
then it actually would fall apart. There's only one way of cutting the Möbius band along a line and then we're done.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.740
to see whether it's not perhaps genus two.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.460
Here, ah, now I've two

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.559
individual pieces,

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.068
and I cannot get from one piece to the other, so the surface is no longer connected.

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:52.979
So clearly Möbius band is only genus one. The Klein bottle is actually of genus two,

00:06:52.979 --> 00:07:00.958
and I've tried to indicate that by drawing two such lines which I could cut along. The red line on the one side,

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:06.839
and the green line on the other side, and if I did that, the surface would still be hanging together. So, the Klein bottle

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.419
is a single-sided surface

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.060
with no borders, and it is of genus 2. Now I would like to make

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.280
better Klein Bottles of a higher genus.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.179
Now how could we do that?

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.900
I would like to build these

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:29.789
super Klein bottles in some modular way. The first possible way of making a module is what I'm showing here.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:34.679
I'm essentially taking the top half of the classical Klein bottle that has the important mouth.

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:40.078
The way it is, this is still a two-sided surface. To make that clear,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.849
I essentially painted the inside here in silver, so the inside of this green toroidal body is silvery, and then it is being brought out

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:54.898
here in this silvery stem, which by itself, on the inside, is still green. I want to use two of these

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.860
modules to make my super Klein bottle, and I'm contemplating on essentially bringing together

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.019
into a ring underneath these curved connectors.

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:10.709
But I can see if I try to put them together like that, then silver meets silver in the upper branch,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.089
and green meets green in the lower branch. And so I never really stepped from

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.859
green to silver, and so that cannot possibly be a single-sided surface.

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:25.708
It's a perfectly good, you know, two-sided surface. Ah! But what if I turn this thing around?

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:32.518
So maybe I want to connect it like that. Let me actually try to do that. Some assembly required.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.720
So now I have created this contraption.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.900
And it looks good, you know, I'm getting from green to silver over this branch

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:48.640
But then wait. If I go through lower branch, I get, once more, a green silver transition.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.100
And that means I have an even number of changes between the two surfaces,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:00.939
and so I'm not really getting a net single-sided surface. So again, it's two-sided. That's disappointing.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.649
Maybe we can put three of those into a loop. So here you can see a loop of

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:09.669
three of those Klein bottles. We have three transitions.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.990
Clearly, it's an odd number of transitions between the surfaces, so the whole thing is single sided,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.740
but if we analyze it in details,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.849
we find that the genus is still only two. So there's really nothing new over the ordinary Klein bottles.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.129
So maybe we should make something more complicated.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.439
What do we need to do in order to get a super Klein bottle of higher genus?

00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:34.779
You know, nothing seems to really work. Well, in order to get this done right, we need to do what mathematicians call

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.519
a connected sum of two or more Klein bottles. You start with two ordinary Klein bottles, and then you cut the puncture in each one of them,

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:47.589
you connect those two openings with an umbilical cord. And now if we do that,

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:54.188
we actually get a single-sided surface of genus four. Here is my simple Klein bottle.

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:59.469
But now I have added this branch with a puncture, and here is another Klein bottle

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.470
with a puncture, and if I put the two together,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.040
now I have what I call the first super bottle, which is a surface of genus four.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.880
The crucial thing was to create this extra branch here that allows me to have this component

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:16.149
coupled into another component,

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:22.779
and this is a modular component that now allows me to make higher genus Klein bottles or what I call super bottles.

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:29.438
So truly, now, this is a single-sided surface of genus for with two punctures.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.040
Because that's what I need if I want to see this thing in three-dimensional space.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.640
Brady: "But in four dimensions this would work"

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.160
In four dimensions I could do it without those self-intersections.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.550
Here is a more compact version of one of those

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.949
genus four single-sided surfaces. There are clearly many possible ways of creating such a

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:56.019
branching Klein bottle module, and I wanted to be this as general as possible, to make many different sculptures, and so I have chosen

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.899
to use this particular version, which has the three arms come out

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.180
in three mutually orthogonal directions.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:11.130
By doing that, I can then put eight of those around the corners of a cube frame.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:16.679
But even this special cube corner component can be done in quite a few different ways.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.010
This is one of my first modules. Then I have made

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.159
another module, and here the third module, and they all have one thing in common. The ends of the arms

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.820
come out in three mutually perpendicular directions,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:36.510
and they all have the same distance from the end of the arm to the center of the three intersection lines.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:42.929
So they all can replace one another, and I can put them in arbitrary ways around the corners of a cube to make

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.750
a modular super bottle based on a cube frame. They're quite different, but they're so similar in style

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:55.950
I have made sure all of them rely essentially on one toroidal body somehow that makes them belong to the same family.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.299
But in some instances, you can see here, I'm branching out the thick part,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.510
where in this case I'm

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.980
feeding out the thinner tube,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.870
and then the thinner tube is the one that branches in two. And in the third module, the thinner tube branches in two, but the actual

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.980
branching occurs on the

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.230
inside of the module. Each one of these different modules can go in different places,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.070
and each one of them can be rotated in three different positions.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.850
A few additional curved elements. I can make different shapes. For instance, a three-sided prism.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.439
This is a version where I have a fairly regular prism by adding three

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:42.719
pieces of curved branches that each one turn through 30 degrees. Here is a different version where rather than having three

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:49.199
inserted pieces, I have two pieces of 45 degrees, to make this, you know, somewhat less regular triangle.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.520
And then I just copy two of these triangles behind one another,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:59.909
and I get something that looks a three-sided prism. Another option is curve scatter through 39 degrees,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:06.659
and then in this, I can use four of my modules, and six of those bent pieces, and I get something that emulates a

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.840
tetrahedral frame, a super bottle of genus six.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.540
Whereas, this here was a super bottle of genus eight.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.380
Of course, once I had all these parts lying around, I was just playing, and here are a few more fancy shapes that are

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.230
much less regular. So, the inventiveness now has no limits, you know, with enough parts lying around.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.690
If we introduce a new Klein bottle module that actually has a four-way branch,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.220
Then one four-way branch gives us the same increase in connectivity

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.569
that we would get from two three-way branches.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.300
With only six of those four-way branches, I can make a super bottle of genus 14.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.020
Brady: "Wow, that's genus fourteen!"

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.340
I also did something a little bit special in one of these branches,

00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:00.620
I pulled the inside of the toroid out into this funnel shape thing, so it can serve as a stand

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.920
of this particular sculpture.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.520
Brady: "But that's still, the stand is part of the topology that, you haven't, like broken, you know..."

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.480
The stand would simply be one more puncture that this particular module has, and as we saw before,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.119
adding punctures does not change the genus of a surface, the classification would not change because of that.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.389
This is one that uses five of those parts, and here is another one that uses six of those parts.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.200
But of course we can also combine

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:34.060
the three-arm modules and the four-arm modules. If I combine eight of my three-way parts

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.399
with six of my four-way parts, I get this, what I would almost call a super-duper bottle,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.840
and this one now is of genus 22, and this is based on the frame of a rhombic dodecahedron.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.440
What if I want a single-sided surface of genus seven?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.500
The key thing is to start with a Möbius band as a building block, because the Möbius band

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.870
has only genus of one.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:05.230
So as you add Möbius bands together, you can increment the genus one by one. So here is an

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.930
Möbius band of a quite different shape.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:14.319
And I would have to cut some hole in it in order to be able to graft it on to something else.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.830
Now here's a component where I have already done that.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.410
Here again, you see almost the same shape in a Möbius band,

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:26.019
but then here at the bottom, here is the hole that we're using now for grafting. Two of those components

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.160
and graft them on to one another. I have added genus one plus genus one,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.320
that's genus two, and so you should know what that is. If you've seen some of the other

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.420
videos on Klein bottles, you know, two Möbius bands together make a Klein bottle of genus two.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.520
Now, to get to even higher genus,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.249
I would have to use a third component. I would have to graft a third component onto

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.520
this combination, and then I would have a single-sided surface of genus three.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.480
Now if you know that you want to make genus seven what you need to do is

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.840
find a sphere, drill seven holes into it,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.649
and then simply graft one of these punctured Möbius strips on each one of the seven holes.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:20.689
And voila! you get yourself a genus seven single-sided surface. And this works for any positive integer number.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.196
Brady: "What did you eat for breakfast? Something sort of Swiss?"

00:16:26.196 --> 00:16:27.789
Oh, seven or eight Klein bottles.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.779
Brady: "For breakfast!"

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.440
You know, like bagels, you know, those Klein bottles are so much tastier!

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.380
Brady: "...Klein bottles to digest them?"

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.220
Well, digest fast because you digest from the inside and from the outside.
