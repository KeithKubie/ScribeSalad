00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.240
Based on the fact that you're all in
this class, I'm reasonably sure you're

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.560
all familiar with online learning,
because you're all doing it right now.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.119
When most people think
about online learning,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.150
I think what they think about though,
are MOOCs, massive open online courses.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.870
MOOCs got very big for a few years
there, and they're still very big.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.650
And so we're actually going to have
an entire separate section on MOOCs.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.010
But online learning is more
than just MOOCs nowadays.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.140
You're all doing online learning,
but you're not in the MOOC.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.990
This class is not massive, it's large,
but it's not massive, and it's not open.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.260
You all applied to this program and
you were accepted, so

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.530
it's neither massive nor open.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.528
But it's still an online course.

00:00:32.528 --> 00:00:34.426
What we do here at Udacity
nowadays is similar.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:36.656
We no longer do massive
open online courses.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:40.053
We do smaller, very large, but
still smaller than massive open online

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:42.487
courses, programs that
are somewhat more gated,

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:45.849
that have a cost associated with them
and have a credential at the end.

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.490
And I think programs like
Udacity's Nano degrees and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.128
the Georgia Tech OMS CS program are
really the future of online learning,

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:54.730
these more closed and
more gated experiences.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.110
So what we're going to talk about here,
is the different ways that online

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.000
learning can be done
separate from MOOCs.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.880
So what are the experiences we can
have in online learning that would be

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.990
difficult or
impossible to have on campus?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.068
Are there things we can do here that
are actually even better than we can do

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:07.580
on campus?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.790
And there's certain things we can do
in person that we can't do online, but

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.850
how do we make up for them?

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.510
How do we create an equivalent
experience in this online environment

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.930
to what you might get on campus?
