Hey, I'm here with Larry, and

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.019
he's been having a problem with
a webpage he's been working on.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.810
I think this is a great opportunity to
both help Larry out with his problem and

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.230
to show you what version
control can be useful for.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,
I've been working on a website, and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.540
it looks a lot different
than it did before.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.610
There used to be a banner at the top.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.110
And like the design looked
a lot better before.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.670
&gt;&gt; Hm, so, what did it look like before?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; I have an old version
saved on this tab.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, I see.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.530
It looks like you
changed the description.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I filled it in.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.320
&gt;&gt; Cool.
Did you change anything else?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810
&gt;&gt; I think I might have,
but I'm not sure.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.638
&gt;&gt; Do you still have the HTML for
this version?

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:32.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.820
&gt;&gt; Cool, so you could compare
the two and see what changed.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try it.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.700
&gt;&gt; Now I want you to find the
differences between the two versions of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310
this HTML.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.490
Go ahead and
find the lines that have changed,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.570
then enter the line numbers in this box,
separated by commas.
