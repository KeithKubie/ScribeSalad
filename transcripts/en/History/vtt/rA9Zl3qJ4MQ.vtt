00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.878
NARRATOR: "Viking."

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:07.048
Derived from the old Norse term
"vikingr," generally referring

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:10.552
to Scandinavian men who
traveled, traded, and raided

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.762
through parts of Europe,
the Mediterranean,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.848
Russia, and North America.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.391
Men.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.811
The standard history
popularized in the 19th century

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.273
tells us that only men
were Viking warriors.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.319
But Norse mythology and now
science tell us differently.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.031
History does teach us that Norse
women were much more liberated

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.075
than other women at the time.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:38.538
They could own property,
conduct business, get a divorce,

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.624
and gain custody
of their children.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.335
And Norse folklore and
mythology claim that women

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.921
were also fierce warriors.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.466
Poems and stories
feature weapon wielding

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.260
women called shields maidens.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.763
There were characters
like Freyd s Eir ksd ttir,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.223
daughter of Norse
explorer Erik the Red,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.226
who wielded a sword in battle
while eight months pregnant.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.978
[screams]

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.690
Or Lagertha, who won over her
future husband Ragnar Lodbrok

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.609
with her fighting skills.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.112
And the mythical Valkyries, who
wore armor and carried weapons

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:14.157
on the battlefield, choosing
which fighters would die

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.787
and ushering them into the grand
afterlife known as Valhalla.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.665
But there was no hard proof that
great female Viking warriors

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:26.753
ever existed until
2017, which saw

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.339
the culmination of a
forensic investigation

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.550
that began in the 19th century.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.387
In the 1980s, archaeologists
unearthed a well-preserved

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:39.349
and elaborately furnished
grave in the Viking trading

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.851
post of Birka, Sweden.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.396
Alongside the body were
weapons and two horses.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:48.525
On the lap was a chess-like
board game known as a king's

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.902
table, indicating
the grave inhabitant

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:54.072
was a commander that
made strategic decisions.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.658
Based on these items,
scientists concluded

00:01:56.658 --> 00:02:00.286
the burial site belonged to
a powerful military leader.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.582
And by default, the body
was classified as male.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.627
But no one checked the bones.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:11.589
Over a century later, Stockholm
University osteologist Anna

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.300
Kjellstrom was analyzing
the Birka remains

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.220
for another study when she
noticed the pelvic bones

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.806
and mandible were feminine.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.518
She estimated the bones belonged
to a woman over the age of 30

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.771
and approximately 5
foot 6 inches tall.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:30.775
Kjellstrom published her
provocative findings in 2016,

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.485
which caused some controversy.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.237
What?

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.948
NARRATOR: Since the Birka bones
were found over a century ago,

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.576
some argue they may
have been mislabeled

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:43.246
or possibly the bones of
several people mixed together.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.624
But in 2017, another
woman stepped up

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.877
to answer the critics.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.796
A research team led by
archaeologists Charlotte

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.592
Hedensterna-Jonson at
Sweden's Uppsala University

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.012
extracted two types
of DNA from the bones.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.598
They confirmed
Kjellstrom's hypothesis.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.768
The bones belonged to one woman.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.271
In the findings, the
researchers concluded

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.106
that it was rare
to find evidence

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.942
of high ranking
female Viking warriors

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.195
not because they didn't
exist, but because of sexism

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.448
in scientific research.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.659
Though some Viking women
buried with weapons are known,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.620
a female warrior
of this importance

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.205
has never been determined,
and Viking scholars

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:29.042
have been reluctant to
acknowledge the agency of women

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.668
with weapons.
