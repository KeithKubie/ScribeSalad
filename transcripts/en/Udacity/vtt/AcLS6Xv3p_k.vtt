00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's come at this from the bottom up, in terms of the atomic elements out of

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.920
which connectors are built. The base element is called,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.850
in the meta-paper, ducts, as in air-conditioning ducts. Okay? This,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.120
this is the channel, has no associated behavior, with it.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.810
It could, for example, be some kind of internet connection. Or

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.315
it could be all on one machine in terms of the underlying electronics.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.280
It could be provided by the program language implementation, for

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.720
example in a virtual machine. It could be the operating system through some kind

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
of system call. Okay? Or it could be an inter machine communication, for

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.350
example with sockets. Ducts provide the mechanisms for transmitting the data,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.650
and it could also be control information among the components.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.940
Connectors go beyond ducts, by providing the protocol used by the ducts for

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.710
doing that communication. That is the sequence of interactions.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.110
In addition to ducts, connectors may include internal mechanisms. For example,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.849
some storage,uh, like, like would be used for buffers. Or computation,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.990
computational elements such as might be involved if you,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.640
if the, if the connector were fighting some kind of translation capability.
