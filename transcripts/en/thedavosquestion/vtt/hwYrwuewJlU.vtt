&gt;&gt; [Music playing]

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.900
&gt;&gt; This generation, unlike any other generation
in history, could, if

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.840
we choose, end the most terrible forms of
poverty.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.389
&gt;&gt; It's only by raising the standard of living
in the poor countries

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.540
that we will ever be able to increase the
educated status of women,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.740
reduce population growth, decrease deforestation
by poor farmers, and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060
globally move towards cleaner and more efficient
technologies.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; It may be good to give countries grants
and financial incentives

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.140
for reducing their population and creating
a sustainable economy.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.160
&gt;&gt; Can we not create a single common second
language.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.730
&gt;&gt; Actors in the developed world must assume
responsibility for a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.260
century of dumping and use the wealth we amassed
to avert disaster.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.910
Actors in the developing world must take a
long view of economic

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.980
development and should bravely lead their
economies forward in a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.980
sustainable way.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.219
&gt;&gt; Giving the entire world access to the internet.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.630
&gt;&gt; We can now make very inexpensive computers
to run internet and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.289
consequently new levels of education to some
of the most remote

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.340
countries in the world.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.360
&gt;&gt; To begin a global conversation that connects
us as citizens of the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.389
world regardless of our geographic boundaries.
Communications and ongoing dialogue breaks

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:25.079
down some of the -- some of
the philosophic boundaries that separate us

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.470
as a people in societies
and cause a lot of conflict in our world.
