00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.560
What's the definition of comedy?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.108
Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:16.875
to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.706
including anyone misguided enough

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.247
to try to explain a joke,

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:21.322
have pondered it,

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.581
and no one has settled it.

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.037
You're lucky you found this video to sort it out.

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:26.576
To define comedy, you should first ask

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.377
why it seems comedy defies definition.

00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:30.303
The answer's simple.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:31.962
Comedy is the defiance of definition

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:35.290
because definitions sometimes need defiance.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.933
Consider definition itself.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.841
When we define, we use language

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.513
to set borders around a thing

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:43.373
that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence.

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:44.676
We say what the thing means

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:46.756
and fit that in a system of meanings.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:48.666
Chaos becomes cosmos.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.280
The universe is translated

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.146
into a cosmological construct of knowledge.

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:54.111
And let's be honest,

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:56.232
we need some logical cosmic order,

00:00:56.232 --> 00:00:58.006
otherwise we'd have pure chaos.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:58.871
Chaos can be rough,

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.834
so we build a thing that we call reality.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.420
Now think about logic and logos,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.919
that tight knot connecting a word and truth.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.209
And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny,

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.173
because some people say it's real simple:

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:12.253
truth is funny.

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:13.774
It's funny because it's true.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.890
But that's simplistic.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.421
Plenty of lies are funny.

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:18.100
Comedic fiction can be funny.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.056
Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious.

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:22.665
For instance, florp --

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.810
hysterical!

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.009
And plenty of truths aren't funny.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.852
Two plus two truly equals four,

00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:30.617
but I'm not laughing just because that's the case.

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:31.890
You can tell a true anecdote,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.747
but your date may not laugh.

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:37.487
So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny?

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:39.746
How do these laughable truths and untruths

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:42.063
relate to that capital-T Truth,

00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:44.861
the cosmological reality of facts and definitions?

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:46.617
And what makes any of them funny?

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:48.205
There's a Frenchman who can help,

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.291
another thinker who didn't define comedy

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.786
because he expressly didn't want to.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:55.077
Henri Bergson's a French philosopher

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:56.696
who prefaced his essay on laughter

00:01:56.696 --> 00:01:59.254
by saying he wouldn't define "the comic"

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.584
because it's a living thing.

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:03.031
He argued laughter has a social function

00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.601
to destroy mechanical inelasticity

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.609
in people's attitudes and behavior.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.443
Someone doing the same thing over and over,

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:12.442
or building up a false image of themself and the world,

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:14.023
or not adapting to reality

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:17.074
by just noticing the banana peel on the ground --

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.518
this is automatism,

00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:20.525
ignorance of one's own mindless rigidity,

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:21.965
and it's dangerous

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.098
but also laughable

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:25.459
and comic ridicule helps correct it.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.707
The comic is a kinetic, vital force,

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:29.520
or elan vital,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.714
that helps us adapt.

00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:32.222
Bergson elaborates on this idea

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:34.465
to study what's funny about all sorts of things.

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:35.849
But let's stay on this.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.229
At the base of this concept of comedy is contradiction

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.349
between vital, adaptive humanity

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.100
and dehumanized automatism.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.650
A set system that claims to define reality

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.344
might be one of those dehumanizing forces

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:51.532
that comedy tends to destroy.

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:53.433
Now, let's go back to Aristotle.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.264
Not Poetics, where he drops a few thoughts on comedy,

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:57.739
no, Metaphysics,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.207
the fundamental law of non-contradiction,

00:03:00.207 --> 00:03:01.950
the bedrock of logic.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.914
Contradictory statements are not at the same time true.

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:06.998
If A is an axiomatic statement,

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:07.889
it can't be the case

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.992
that A and the opposite of A are both true.

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.096
Comedy seems to live here,

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:14.758
to subsist on the illogic

00:03:14.758 --> 00:03:17.713
of logical contradiction and its derivatives.

00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:20.227
We laugh when the order we project on the world

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.313
is disrupted and disproven,

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:23.984
like when the way we all act

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:26.099
contradicts truths we don't like talking about,

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.395
or when strange observations we all make

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.361
in the silent darkness of private thought

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.138
are dragged into public by a good stand-up,

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:34.734
and when cats play piano,

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.652
because cats that are also somehow humans

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.695
disrupt our reality.

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:41.365
So, we don't just laugh at truth,

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:44.210
we laugh at the pleasurable, edifying revelation of flaws,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.998
incongruities,

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:46.930
overlaps,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.316
and outright conflicts

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:50.834
in the supposedly ordered system of truths

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:53.529
we use to define the world and ourselves.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.450
When we think too highly of our thinking,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.967
when we think things are true

00:03:56.967 --> 00:04:00.102
just because we all say they're logos and stop adapting,

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:02.556
we become the butt of jokes played on us

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:04.763
by that wacky little trickster, chaos.

00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:08.395
Comedy conveys that destructive, instructive playfulness,

00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:09.979
but has no logical definition

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.558
because it acts upon our logic

00:04:12.558 --> 00:04:13.800
paralogically

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.827
from outside its finite borders.

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:18.359
Far from having a definite definition,

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.695
it has an infinite infinition.

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:22.429
And the infinition of comedy

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.362
is that anything can be mined for comedy.

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:27.330
Thus, all definitions of reality,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.780
especially those that claim to be universal,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.389
logical,

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.079
cosmic,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.507
capital-T Truth

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.794
become laughable.
