00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.520
MANISH BHARGAVA: OK.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's get started.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.650
I'm Manish Bhargava,
product manager for

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.550
internationalization and

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.420
localization efforts at Google.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.960
And we have Andrew
Warren, a product

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.430
manager in the same team.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.390
He'll help us with the awesome
demos that we have

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.120
lined up for you.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.480
So today, we are going to talk
about developing for global

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.020
audience for every web user,
for every smartphone user.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.720
Let's start by me asking
you a few questions.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.030
How many of you here speak
more than one language?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.840
Great.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.590
How many of you here are
Chrome developers?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.780
How many of you are Android
developers?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.130
OK.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.250
Looking at the audience, we'll
focus more on the Android

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.680
developer perspective.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.840
And then, how many of you have
your app or product localized

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.950
in more than one language?

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.870
More than five?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.110
More than 10?

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.750
More than 20?

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.730
More than 40?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.769
Great.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.690
You are definitely ahead
of the pack.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.370
So let's talk a little
bit about what we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.700
going to talk today.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.900
We'll start by talking
about developing

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.120
for a global audience.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.730
Is it worth it?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.000
What does it entail?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.850
How do I go about doing it?

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.610
And then once I've done it,
how do I get the global

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820
customers that I intend
to reach?

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.790
In our journey of the what,
[INAUDIBLE], why and how, we

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.670
will essentially also do an
in-depth look at various

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.610
internationalization and
localization tools

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.860
available to you.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.680
So the very first question is
is it worth developing for a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.880
global audience?

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.750
To answer that question, let's
first look at what is needed

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.960
to have a successful business.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.480
You need users and
a lot of them.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.320
And you need revenue,
and probably, a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.030
lot of that as well.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.950
But the question is where
are these users located?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.580
How do we get to them?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.830
So let's quickly do
a quick demo.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.810
Here, we have the--

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.980
OK, full screen.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.850
So what we're looking at is
a gapminder.org chart.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.670
We are looking at internet users
in terms of how internet

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.460
users have changed over time.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.390
We'll do a time travel starting
from 1990 onwards.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.930
The size of the bubble
represents the number of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.830
internet users.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.750
So the bigger the size, more
internet users in that region.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.430
So let's start in 1990.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.340
Only noticeable dots at this
point are US and Japan.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.180
And even within that scenario,
it's mostly coming from

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.500
universities, I believe.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.535
So now, let's fast
forward to 2000.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:00.380
Notice here.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.720
In addition to US and Japan, we
now also have some of the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.470
European languages show up.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.450
Now let's fast forward
from 2000 to 2010.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.820
And during this phase,
I would like you to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.970
focus on two aspects.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.620
One is the explosive growth in
terms of internet users in the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.720
BRIC countries--

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.730
Brazil, Russia, India,
and China.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.070
And especially, look at
the last five years.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.810
So let's run through that
starting from 2000 And notice

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.500
how it changed.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.130
Let me, again, run it from 2005
again just to highlight

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.220
the difference.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.900
So based on the chart, what is
the percentage of internet

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.140
users that do not use English
as a native language?

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.390
That is correct.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.570
26% use English as their
native language.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.625
Now let's look at another
similar chart.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.940
This time, we are looking at
cellphone users instead of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.980
internet users.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.160
And the size of the bubbles
would represent number of cell

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.510
phone users over time.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.149
Let's do a time travel starting
from 1980 to the

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.700
current time.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.370
So let's first fast forward
from 1980 to 2000.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.710
Notice the penetration or the
number of cell phone users is

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.600
nearly very similar to what we
saw in internet users with US,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.380
Japan, and some of the European
countries having

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.570
enough presence.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.150
Now, let's do the same
from 2000 to 2010.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.310
What we see is very similar
phenomenon that we saw in the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.560
number of internet users.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.520
The number of cell phone users
have grown in explosive

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.750
numbers during the
last five years,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.000
especially in the BRIC countries.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.090
OK.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.430
So clearly based on what we
have seen, you can nearly

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.390
triple the number of users by
essentially developing for the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.370
global audience.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.540
And when you triple the number
of users, you thereby increase

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.760
your revenue as well.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.210
So let's look at the
revenue numbers a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.480
little bit more carefully.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.710
So we'll talk about the Android
opportunity available

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.600
to you from a global
perspective.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.810
Remember the keynote speech
on Wednesday?

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.090
We talked about, and we showed
on the world heat map the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.930
explosive growth in terms of
Android activations over the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.500
last few years, especially
outside United States.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.980
The same is true for the
app installs as well.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.940
And we believe your app should
now take advantage of this

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.570
huge opportunity.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.870
And we have the right
infrastructure in place for

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.810
you to do that.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.450
So starting with Apps
availability, the free Apps

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.210
are available in
190 languages--

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.120
190 countries.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.500
And 132 of these countries
have access to the

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.760
paid apps as well.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.350
Globally, 92% of all Google
Play users have

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.650
access to paid apps.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.810
And not surprising, 67% of all
Google Play revenue comes from

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.490
outside United States.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.590
We have revenue infrastructure
in place.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.250
Carrier billing is available in
seven key countries and is

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.290
expanding rapidly.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.020
Why is that important?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.440
Because 73% of all Google Play
app purchases happens using

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.260
carrier billing when
it is available.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.700
And you also have access to all
monetization methods that

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.790
include the in-app billing, paid
apps, subscription, as

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.860
well as ad funded as well.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.360
Last but not least, we have now
the dev infrastructure in

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.220
place with the Wednesday
announcement

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.620
of the new Dev Console.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.720
You can now localize your
listing in 22 languages as

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.940
well as tweak your international
offerings based

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.110
on slicing and dicing on
country and language

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.940
dimensions available
on the analytics

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.818
section of the Dev Console.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.960
So clearly, there's
a huge opportunity

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.550
which cannot be ignored.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.450
But the next question is,
what does it entail?

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.230
How do I make use of
this opportunity?

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.820
What you need to do to make this
happen, the two things

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.350
that you need are
internationalization and

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.350
localization.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.320
Internationalization--

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.860
i18n, I followed by 18
characters and N. And

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.570
localization--

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.860
L followed by 10 characters
and N.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.520
What does internationalization
mean?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.240
It essentially means designing
and coding to enable support

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.330
for languages, countries, and
cultural differences.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.650
It includes things like
extracting your strings for

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.620
localization, presenting date,
time, currency, number formats

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.300
in the local relevant form,
sorting in language specific

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.790
ways, able to work on or process
user input in the

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.890
given language.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.400
It also means handling
bi-directional display in

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.640
Middle Eastern languages,
handling diacritics for

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.060
central European languages,
handling double byte

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.020
characters for East
Asian languages.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.520
And what is localization?

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.650
Localization is the process of
adapting the look and feel of

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.450
your app for languages,
regions, and culture.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.700
What does it entail?

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.100
Essentially, it includes things
like translation, local

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.780
defaults, and custom features.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.290
Let's take an example.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:55.120
So what you're looking at is
Google Sites, specifically the

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.900
image upload menu.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.770
What is wrong here?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.730
And again, I've given you
a hint right there with

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.430
highlighting the region.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.510
Anyone knows Arabic here?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.300
What's wrong?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.050
Yes.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.430
Notice how in English, we have
the size of the image-- small,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.770
medium, or large--

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.700
where translated in Arabic, it
actually became Saturday,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.850
medium, and then large.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.600
Why?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.290
What happened?

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.940
Well, two aspects.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.340
When this was sent for
translation, the small,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.340
medium, and large were sent as
separate words and with no

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.840
description being provided.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.830
And the second, when the
translator got this for

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.830
translation, they had little
context of where these were

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.400
coming from.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.190
So again, S became Sat,
which essentially was

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.790
translated as Saturday.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.200
Let's take few more examples.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.330
Here, what you're looking at
is Google Earth mobile app.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.160
And we are focused in
the Zurich view.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.410
Anybody from Zurich here?

00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:06.780
Can you tell us what is wrong?

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.150
Notice how the two places, the
names of the two places have

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.720
been garbled.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.350
The non-ASCII characters have
been removed, specifically the

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.580
u with the umlaut is not being
displayed correctly.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.330
This is clearly an example of
an internationalization, or

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.110
i18n, issue where the text has
not been rendered correctly.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.720
When we talked to the engineers
and tried to find

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.770
out what happened, the real
issue was that third party

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.940
JSON library was being
leveraged to do

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.410
deserialization of
the JSON file.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.430
And that did not handle the
escaping characters in

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.070
meaningful ways.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.650
So here was an example of
internationalization.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.850
Let's look at another
example of--

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.760
here, we are talking about
Google Maps in Swedish.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.900
And on the on the left-hand
side, you also see the

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.860
corresponding English
version as well.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.700
I'll tell you a little bit more
background on this one.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.780
A phenomenon that we saw was
in Sweden, specifically

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.490
driving direction functionality,
we were seeing

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.970
about 10% to 15% less usage of
that functionality compared to

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.560
nearby places, compared to all
our average worldwide.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.590
And we wanted to understand
what is happening.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.520
So we put an engineer in
Mountain View for about a week

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.750
to try to find what
is happening.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.500
This person essentially, very
smart engineer, went through

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.980
all the algorithms that we're
using for driving directions

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.830
and how we are pulling them.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.270
They looked at all our data
sources in terms local data

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.330
and displaying the
street names and

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.450
all of those correctly.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.410
And it turned out, yes, all of
that was being done correctly.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.522
Anyone know Swedish here?

00:11:56.522 --> 00:11:58.560
Can you tell what might
have been wrong?

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.980
And the problem was the Get
Direction as in English was

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.160
translated as Instructions
in Swedish.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.990
And again, as a Google Map user,
when I see instruction,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.640
I would not really think of
getting driving directions

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.180
based on seeing that
instruction.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.000
And that really what happened.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.040
When we changed that to really
mean get direction in Swedish,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.610
we suddenly saw a sudden jump in
terms of the usage for the

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.550
functionality.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.870
And then, it became on par
with other regions in the

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.520
world as well.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.940
So what we want to highlight
from these examples is that

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.990
the user experience is impacted
in a big way by how

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.910
you do internationalization
and localization

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.160
implementation.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.360
So we have talked about what
i18n is, what localization is.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.490
But the next question is
what do I need to do?

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.840
What does it really
mean for me?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.480
So let's talk a little bit about
a globalized application

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.650
architecture or the design in
terms of how you will design

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.710
your application in meaningful
ways to make it happen.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.030
First is your application or
your common code base.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.980
And that would essentially be
common across all countries.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.530
It would contain the code
of your functionality.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.090
And this would be language
neutral.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.780
This is where all your
key algorithms and

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.220
everything would go.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.430
The next set, which you would
essentially separate out in

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.230
meaningful ways, is the
globalization services.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.590
Anything that is
language-dependent, so it

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.130
could be things like handling
of date, time, currencies,

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.730
displaying them correctly,
extraction, anything which is

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.260
language-dependent would
essentially fall under here.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.220
And you would essentially use
different libraries to handle

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.660
them effectively.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.000
The next set is the
locale data.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.670
So essentially, it's important
to separate localizable

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.280
resources from your
main code base.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.300
So examples of localizable
resources would be text,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.730
images, and so on.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.050
So notice here how the English,
Japanese, and French

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.710
version are all separated out?

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.720
So if you were to use, for
example, Java, you would

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.790
essentially use the resource
bundles to handle these

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.570
language sources.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.430
And having those separated
makes it easy for

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.090
localization as well.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.910
And then, finally, is the
plug-in, which essentially,

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.810
think of that as a
custom feature

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.250
for your local markets.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.160
Why is that important?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.570
It really brings the wow
factor for your app.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.430
Think of like we had the
transit app in German.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.630
And when we introduced German
train schedules, that really

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.570
made people feel, wow, this
app has been made for me

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.990
rather than something which will
just ported over from US

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.230
with some cosmetic changes.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.590
Another example is we introduced
cricket scores on

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.930
Google News in India.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.150
When we did that on the days
when the cricket match was on,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.310
we saw about 8% to 10% increase
in daily traffic.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.080
Why?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.600
People were able to
essentially-- again, cricket

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.910
and Bollywood are pretty
popular in India.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.900
And people would essentially
come and see those scores on

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.650
Google News when the game
was on those days.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.780
So here is the complete
picture of

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.760
internationalization.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.800
It is how you would typically
do your internationalization

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.710
from a design perspective and
how you would have your

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.080
different parts of your code
base separated out in

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.970
meaningful ways so that you can
essentially then extend in

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.370
meaningful ways and make your
code base ready for

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.930
localization.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.720
Now, let's look at some of the
available tools that will help

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.700
you to make this happen.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.360
Here are some tools that
are listed for

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.230
internationalization.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.870
Some of these tools, we are
actively working on.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.090
Some of these tools, we actively
contribute to.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.530
But in either of those
scenarios, these are the exact

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.190
same tools that we use
at Google for our

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.640
internationalization as well.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.910
So the first is the
ICU, International

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.810
Component for Unicode.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.100
Think of that as a hidden
gold mine for you.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.980
It really provides you the right
libraries in various

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.850
programming languages--

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.890
C/C++, Java--

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.460
for you to handle Unicode
and globalization

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.700
in meaningful ways.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.660
So you can handle things like
date, time, currency,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.340
formatting, and much more
using this library.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:22.160
The next library is the
libphonenumber library.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.270
It essentially handles
the international

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.240
phone numbers for you.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.770
It essentially incorporates all
world regions, so things

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.590
like area code, country
codes, and all of

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.730
the intricacies involved.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.860
It essentially encapsulates all
of that and gives you a

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.310
simple interface by which you
can essentially do parsing,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.850
formatting, storing, and
validating of phone numbers

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.650
across any region
in the world.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.680
And again, pretty powerful
in respect to that.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.500
In terms of JavaScript, the
Google Web Toolkit and closure

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.630
tools provide
internationalization support

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.860
for JavaScript.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.730
We're extending that support
using the ECMAScript standard

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.370
process for that as well.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:10.599
For input, research has clearly
showed that users tend

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.119
to use an app more if they're
able to input

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.760
in their own language.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.819
And that's where Google Input
Tools, a Chrome extension

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.060
comes into play.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:26.780
It is a tool that allows users
to input in 80 plus languages

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.920
on any text box on
any web page.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.390
Why don't we first look at a
quick introductory video?

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.200
And then, Andrew will do a quick
demo of that as well.

00:17:47.196 --> 00:17:48.990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.600
-There's this word in Chinese,
Xiang, that kind of means

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.330
smells good.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:01.965
It could describe flower,
food, really anything.

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:08.220
But it's always a positive
description for things.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.185
It's hard to translate into
something other than Mandarin.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.740
-We have this word in Fiji-Hindi
called Talanoa.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.780
Really, it is the feeling that
you get late on a Friday night

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.380
surrounded by your friends
shooting the breeze.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.890
But it's not quite that.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.600
It's a sort of warmer and
friendlier version of small

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.400
talk, just about everything that
you could think of off

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.650
the top of your head.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.180
-There's this Greek word,
Meraki, that means to really

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:50.700
put your soul, put your entire
being into what you're doing,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.140
whether it's your hobby,
or it's your work.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.860
You're doing it with love
for what you're doing.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:03.000
But it's one of those cultural
things that I've never been

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.076
able to come up with
a good translation.

00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:11.290
Meraki, with passion,
with love.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.812
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:22.812 --> 00:19:23.830
MANISH BHARGAVA: Great.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.100
Andrew, why don't you give us
a quick demo of lesson.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.970
ANDREW WARREN: Certainly.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.310
So as Manish was mentioning
earlier, the majority of web

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.760
users online, and the majority
of users of cell phones, and

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.290
the majority of pretty much
all of Google's users and

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.180
internet users are not from
English-speaking countries and

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.170
don't speak English natively.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.690
What's more, and much more
important, the majority of

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.520
users coming online at this
point, the majority of users

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.330
who are just beginning to use
these technologies are not

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.750
native English speakers, and in
most cases, are not English

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.910
speakers at all.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.370
So one of the things that we're
trying to do at Google

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.830
is make it easier for these new
users to actively engage

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.420
online to create content, to
communicate with people in

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.340
their own languages.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.420
And so one of the ways that
we're doing that is this

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.060
project called Input Tools,
which is a project to make it

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.990
easy to enter text in whatever
language you'd like to.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.820
So I'll be giving a brief
demonstration of the Chrome

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.120
extension that we've recently
put out for this purpose.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.270
All a user needs to do after
installing the Chrome

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.680
extension is choose the
languages that he or she might

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.460
want to type in.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.660
So in this case, I'll add some
Chinese input methods and some

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.150
Hindi input methods.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.430
And then, that's
pretty much it.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:41.060
From there, If the user wants to
enter text in one of those

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.220
languages or in a language that
they don't have the right

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.800
keyboard for, don't have the
right input tools for on their

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.630
computer, all they need to do is
enable the Chrome extension

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.330
and tell it which language
they'd like to type in.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.630
And from there, we use server
side dictionaries and language

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.150
models to determine what words
they're looking for and what

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.840
words they might want to type.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.880
So we have this available for
IMEs for Chinese and Japanese,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.820
which includes the keyboard
shortcuts that Chinese and

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.960
Japanese users are probably
familiar with already from

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.790
clients site IMEs.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.460
We have a number of
transliteration tools for

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.190
speakers of Indic languages
and others.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.540
And then, we also have a number
of virtual keyboards

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.110
which we offer which can both
be used to literally type

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.200
using the mouse, or which can
be used just as a keyboard

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.100
mapping if the users already
familiar with that keyword but

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.620
doesn't have it available where
they are at the moment.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.410
So this is something that we
have available for over 80

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.960
different languages already in
the Chrome extension for

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.450
online users and are also
working to bring to other

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.340
platforms as well.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.120
So we have all of the 20 plus
transliteration languages and

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.720
Chinese and Japanese available
on Windows.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.480
And then, we also brought
Chinese, Japanese Korean, and

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.580
a number of other languages to
Android and are continuing to

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.780
build out the number of
languages we support so that

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.050
more users can create content.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.490
More users can communicate with
one another in whatever

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.800
language they like to.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.790
So, post demo, there's
a couple of important

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.780
implications of this
for developers as

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.610
well for input tools.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.240
The first of these is that you
never know what tools people

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.700
might be using to enter text
into your website or into your

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.390
application.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.000
So specifically, they
may be using

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.320
this Input Tools extension.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.150
They may be using a client
site IME of some kind.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.540
Or they may be using other
accessibility tools, like

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.330
Chrome Box, to read what's on
the screen, or what's in a

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.660
text box, or know where
a text box is.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.730
And so it's very important
that when you build

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.350
applications, particularly web
applications but also Android

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.310
applications, that you're using
standard components and

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.540
standard pieces of HTML and
don't do anything terribly

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.970
fancy with input boxes, with
editable DIVs, so that these

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.190
tools will work for users not
just within the US and Europe,

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.140
but also for users
around the world.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.210
The second key takeaway for
developers is that you don't

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.720
really know what types of
content are coming into your

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.650
application or where they're
coming from.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.680
So you may be getting all types
of content, in all kinds

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.550
of languages, in all kinds of
encodings, where you may not

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.530
have designed it for that.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.500
So it's important for
applications to be built from

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.240
the ground up supporting Unicode
and assuming Unicode

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.810
is coming into the application
and processing all of the

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.930
strings in any other aspects of
what the application does

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.420
assuming Unicode
and in Unicode.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.670
So from the developers'
perspective, there's a lot of

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.730
other things that need to go
into an application to ensure

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.360
that technologies like
these work for

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.581
users around the world.

00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:47.440
MANISH BHARGAVA: Great.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.420
Thank you, Andrew.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.940
So up to this point,
we have looked at

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.180
internationalization, what it
entails, what does the global

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.710
design look like, global
architecture looks like.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.210
And then, we have also
looked at some other

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.900
internationalization tools.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.290
Now, let's do the same
for localization.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.560
First of all, here are the five
points that you would

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.420
need to do for localization
irrespective of what you're

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:09.990
localizing.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.590
So it could be your
Android apps.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.840
It could be your Chrome maps.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.200
It could be a website.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.520
It could be your static
files documents.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.900
First of all, you need
to determine your

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.940
target language set.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.570
And again, that's a very
important decision

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.430
that needs to happen.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.150
And again, that may change
over time as well.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.440
We will talk about some of the
considerations for that in our

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.540
next slide.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.040
Second is separating localizable
resources from

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.770
your source code.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.500
And again, we saw on the global
architecture design,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.930
that was essentially the
third set of boxes.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.030
And that is very critical for
you to essentially have a good

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.140
localized experience.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.100
You don't own hard-coded strings
in your application to

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.100
show up, especially when
people are accessing in

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.130
different languages.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.620
The third aspect is test
your application for

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.120
localizability issues.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.170
How do you know whether it's
ready for actual localization?

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.010
You would essentially at the
point when you are ready for

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.360
translation, you should not
require any re-engineering or

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.290
code changes.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.800
In that case, we have taken
care of most of the

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.390
localizability issues.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.230
And so the localization tools
are really your friend here at

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.750
this point for that.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.000
If those tools can help you
find problems like text

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.530
swirling, hard-coded strings,
not handling accented

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.870
characters, even before you
actually do the localization.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.010
And again, we would highly
encourage you to use that

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.680
phase in terms of your
pseudolocalization.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.500
The fourth is you will choose
a localization vendor.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.860
And either them or you will
choose the localization tool

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.720
that you use.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.410
Important consideration for
localization tools are, it

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.040
should have advanced
technologies like translation

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.910
memory, glossary, and so on.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.800
As we've talked in the previous
slide, let's talk a

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.600
little bit more about the key
considerations that you have

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.410
when deciding which locale, a
combination of your country

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.850
and location, you would like
to have your app or your

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.260
product available in.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.300
Broadly, the considerations
could be

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.120
divided into two types.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.780
One is the key matrix based
on various key metrics.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.890
And again, there could
be a variety of them.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.250
And the second is based on
the effort required for

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.470
implementation of these.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.960
So let's talk more about
the key metrics.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.830
So again, there could be a
variety of different key

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.480
metrics that you could base your
decision in terms which

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.110
countries or which languages
to go after.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.180
You could essentially
decide based on top

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.820
languages used on the web.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.770
You could essentially base it on
top countries by cell phone

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.220
usage, top countries by
paid app installed.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.690
You could essentially go by
what my competitor offers.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.650
If competitor is localized in 15
languages, you might do the

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.720
same as well.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.210
And then, finally, there
could be some

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.380
app-specific metric as well.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.110
So for example, if you are a
game developer, you might want

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:13.650
to go by the top countries
by paid game downloads.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.040
So let's say we picked one.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.670
We go by top languages
used on the web.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.400
And we localize in
10 languages.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.780
So you essentially pick the
top 10 languages on the

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.220
internet and say, OK, I will
localize in those.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.480
Question for the audience?

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.970
What is the percentage of users
you can cover if you

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.740
essentially do that?

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.560
You would essentially localize
your app in top 10 languages.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.825
What percentage of internet
users would you cover?

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:40.780
Yes.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.520
It is 82%.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.540
Absolutely right.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.900
You essentially-- and again,
let's see a little bit more

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.660
details here.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.700
So this is the breakdown of the
top 10 languages and then

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.760
the remaining set.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.300
So notice English
is about 26%.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.360
Chinese is pretty close, 24%.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.490
And then, you can see
the remaining ones.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.990
After the top 10, which is about
82%, the rest of the

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.000
languages constitute
about 17.8%.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.020
So let's look a little bit
more carefully here.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.150
If you pick the top 5, you
include Chinese in here.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.130
If you include the top 10, you
also include Arabic here.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.540
These are languages that require
special handling for

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.970
doing localization and
internationalization correctly

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.280
for these languages.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.010
So you might want to do some
cherry picking in terms of

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.120
which languages you want to
localize your app into based

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.570
on where you are.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.360
And that's a good segue into our
second aspect in terms of

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.560
effort required for implementing
those languages.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.380
So there's a natural grouping
of languages.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.150
So let's say your app currently
is in English.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.090
Now, what is the next set
of languages that

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.140
you could go after?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.220
The next set, which adds a
little bit of complexity but

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.110
not that much is the Latin
script languages.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.190
These are languages which
include FIGS--

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.160
French, Italian German,
Spanish--

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.280
Indonesian, Romanian,
Vietnamese, and so on.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.010
There are three things that this
set of languages add in

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.810
terms of complexity
for your app.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.850
First is the ability to handle
the language preference.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.730
So users should be able to
choose from a dropdown, so a

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.420
language picker, and say OK,
I want now my app to be in

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.810
German, Spanish, and so on.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.270
The second is the ability
to search in those

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.100
languages in your app.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.860
And for that, you need
language detection

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.850
mechanism as well.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.040
So with those, you can pretty
much try and target the Latin

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.820
script languages.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.480
You will probably need some
bit of testing as well.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.280
The next set of languages that
you can target are non-Latin,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.530
European languages.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.480
These would include languages
like Russian, Ukrainian,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.010
Serbian, and Greek.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.340
In addition to what we described
for Latin script

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.990
languages, there are added
complexities in terms of

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.710
transliteration is important
for these languages.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.960
Plus for languages
like Serbian, the

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.270
interchangeability between the
Latin script keyboards and the

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.130
Cyrillic keyboards becomes
an important aspect

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.680
to consider as well.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.190
The next set of languages
are the CJK--

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.440
the Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.120
Here, the complexities first
is the font size.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.270
You need to take care of that
because characters typically

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.540
tend to be bigger in size.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.490
The second is the display
mechanism might change.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.470
So some of these languages are
displayed vertically as well.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.990
And the third aspect is input.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.340
So input method iterators become
an important aspect.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:26.950
Why?

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.410
Because just the enormous
number of

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.760
characters in these languages.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.840
The next set of languages are
the South and Southeast Asian

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.980
languages, specifically
Thai and Hindi.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.880
They are typical because
you need to handle

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.090
the contextual display.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.330
Characters in these languages
essentially change based on

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.690
the context.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.450
And the second important
aspect is the size

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:53.250
segmentation.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.430
So in Thai, where the words
are not separated by wide

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.690
space, you need to take care of,
especially from a search

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.750
perspective, how the

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.680
segmentation is done correctly.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.410
And the last of languages are
the bi-directional languages,

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.420
which include Arabic, Hebrew,
Persian, Urdu.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.930
And these are really the most
challenging languages from

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.540
engineering perspective.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.910
Why are these called
bi-directional languages?

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.580
Mainly because the text flows
from right to left and the

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.520
numbers go from left to right.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.080
Special attention is needed
for the user interface,

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.330
especially in those languages.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:36.910
Now, let's look at some of the
available tools for each of

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.680
these kind of applications, so
Android apps, Chrome web store

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.820
apps, your website, and your
static file and docs as well.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.950
So let's take them one by one.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.320
So first is localization
of your Android apps.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.330
As we mentioned earlier as well,
it is important for you

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.290
to have a localization
strategy.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.840
By that, we mean you need to
know which languages and which

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.550
countries you are going to
localize your app into, which

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.890
is your default set of language
and country, and

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.050
finally, what happens when
somebody accesses your app in

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.740
a locale in which you are
not localizing into.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.020
So here are the three
things where that

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.400
happened in that scenario.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.030
First, as I said, you create
your resource sets for each of

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.930
the locale that you
want to go in.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.170
At run time, the resource
set is matching the

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.370
device, locale is loaded.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.210
And if locale specific resources
are not available,

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.990
Android falls back
to the defaults.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.790
Let's talk a little bit more
about some of the technical

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.950
details here.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.340
So strings.xml file contains
your translated strings.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.300
So under res/values, that's
where your strings.xml in that

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.040
directory would contain the
default translations.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.180
So let's say if you were to
translate in French and

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.490
Arabic, you would also have
directories called

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:02.440
res/values-fr and res/values-ar
respectively.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.320
And strings.xml within those
directories would contain the

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.190
translated strings for French
and Arabic as well.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.280
And let's say you had other
resources as well that needed

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.020
to be translated.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:19.380
So graphics, for example, you
would have res/drawable-ja for

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.800
handling the graphics in
Japanese, for example.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.870
So here's the typical Android
localization process.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.860
You essentially have
three steps here--

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.750
the planning and design phase,
the actual translation, and

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.910
then, finally, testing
and publishing.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.640
Right at the very bottom, you
see the link to the guide for

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.840
localization in
developers.android.com.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.480
In that, you will find
essentially all details for

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.590
each of the steps what
you need to do there.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.090
What I would highly encourage
for everyone to do here, if

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.750
you haven't done that already,
is to take the Hello L10

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.670
example, so Hello Localization
example, similar to the Hello

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.840
world example when you
try a new language.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.190
You would list in a very simple
way all the steps that

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.960
you need to do to
have your first

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.040
localized version of that.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.960
And it's a very simple app, just
has few phases, and the

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.699
map for that country
and displays that.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.570
So again, if you haven't done
this, I would highly encourage

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.290
you to try this, the
Hello L10n example.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.190
And again, you will find that
in localization guide at

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.440
developers.android.com.

00:34:24.275 --> 00:34:27.960
So let's look at localization of
the Chrome web store apps.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.000
One important aspect here is
that you can do your listing

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.179
in 43 locales from the Chrome

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.520
dashboard, developer dashboard.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.449
And the second, depending on
whether you have an extension,

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:46.159
or packaged app, or hosted app,
your app localization

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.219
mechanism would be different.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.830
So let's look a little bit
more at the extension and

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.050
packaged app where you have more
control over the files

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.250
right in your dashboard.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.400
From a technical perspective,
your messages.joson will

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.220
contain the translations.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.890
You will define your default
locale in your

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.700
manifest or JSON file.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.880
And you would essentially have
your different translations in

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.060
_locale directories.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.120
So for example, again, taking
the same example, if you are

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.830
French and Arabic, you would
essentially have _locale/fr.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.680
And then, within that,
you will have the

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.120
message or JSON file.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.920
And same form, _locale/ar/json
file to contain the Arabic

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.880
translations as well.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.470
In terms of localization
process, it is again very

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.030
similar to what we described
in the Android process as

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.580
well-- the planning and design
phase, the translation phase,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.380
and then the testing and
publishing phase.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.570
One important distinction is
that you essentially provide

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.420
the localized description and
screenshots and the time when

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.500
you're uploading for each
language at one time.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.760
So again, the reference
there at the bottom,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.320
code.google.com/
chrome/extensions/i18n.html,

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.080
you will find all the details
about the Chrome web store

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.420
localization as well.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.010
Now, let's talk about localizing
your website.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.020
With Google Website Translator,
you can instantly

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.390
translate your website into
60 plus languages.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.250
Sounds interesting.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.710
Want to find out more?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.960
Let's look at a video.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.010
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.290
-The Website Translator plug-in
powered by Google

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.010
Translate allows you to quickly
and easily make your

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.490
website or blog instantly

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.150
available in 60 plus languages.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.760
Just add the plug-in code
snippet to your page, where

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.090
you'd like to language
selector to appear.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.410
And whenever an international
user visits your page, they

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.770
can select their language in
the dropdown, and your page

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.630
will be instantly translated
into the language.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.660
While the quality of translation
from Google

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.180
Translate is quite good, it's
not always perfect.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.920
For these situations, the
Website Translator plug-in

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.230
allows you to publish and
improve the translation.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.340
After you translate the page,
just hover over the translated

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.170
sentence you'd like to improve
and enter the correction in

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.100
the pop-up.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.990
Your correction will now be
used whenever someone

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.550
translate your page.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.040
Users visiting your site can
also suggest translations

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.890
using the same process.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.210
However, these suggestions
won't be

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.060
used until you approve.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.920
You can manage these suggestions
in the Website

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.840
Translator's web management
interface.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.030
Just select and improve the
suggestion, and it will be

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.260
used whenever someone translates
your page.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.990
Add the Website Translator
plug-in into your website now

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.000
and make your website
globally accessible.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.220
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.390
MANISH BHARGAVA: This was Jeff
Chin, again on our team, who

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.113
works on the Google Website
Translator.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.200
So again, as was described in
the video, you can instantly

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.110
translate in 60 plus
languages.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.350
But what we launched about a
month back is very powerful.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.110
We're not just using the
machine translation.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.630
You can now customize and
improve your website

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.540
translation by manually going
in and correcting

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.090
what might be wrong.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.380
In addition, you can also
collect and use the

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.160
translation selections from
your users as well.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.400
And again, you can invite
editors to manage your

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.070
translations.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.770
And that way, you essentially,
again, make your website

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.820
instantly available for a
lot of users worldwide.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.410
So we already did that.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:29.800
Let's now look at localization
of your documents,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.360
localization of your
static files.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.870
You could essentially use Google
Translation Toolkit,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.130
GTT, for doing that.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.350
What is GTT?

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.380
GTT is Google's localization
platform for human

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.470
translators.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.620
They can essentially use this
to do translation faster and

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.640
more correctly.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.120
You edit by technologies
like Google Translate.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.920
It essentially supports a wide
variety of document types.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.280
To name a few, you essentially
get your Word documents, your

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.830
Open Office files, your rich
text file formats, your HTML

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:07.940
text files, PO flies, Android
resources, Chrome extensions,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.090
Edward campaign, Wikipedia
articles.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.140
So again, a slew of stuff that
you can essentially localize

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.160
using the tool.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.820
It supports more than
300 standard

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.560
source and target languages.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.050
And it has a simple what
you see is what

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.030
you get wizard editor.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.230
And the best part of all of
this, it's essentially a

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.430
totally free tool.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.320
So you can essentially leverage
that for your

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.720
translations as well.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.420
We would also like to talk a
little bit more about things

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.760
that are in works.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.060
Given what you have heard over
the last two years, Android

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.990
apps and Chrome apps are a very

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.580
important part of our ecosystem.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.840
And given that, we want to
now optimize on our app

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.180
localization platform,
especially for Android and

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.910
Chrome apps.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.550
We also would like to--
essentially working on

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:58.450
optimizing our YouTube caption
localization process as well.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.380
With respect to the apps'
localization platform, Andrew,

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.150
why don't you give us a
sneak peek into that?

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.400
ANDREW WARREN: Sure.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.570
So as Manish mentioned, we're
working on a new form of the

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.300
Google translation toolkit that
is focused on application

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.490
translation and localization.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.200
So in particular, the main point
of this tool is to make

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.870
it so that developers don't
really need to understand what

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.540
goes on behind the scenes for
translator and all of the

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.370
tools that they need to use to
properly localize something.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.610
And a translator doesn't need to
understand what's going on

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.150
behind the scenes of an
application and need to

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.380
understand the structure of the
application and where the

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.200
files sit in the application,
all of that information.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.130
So we're trying to make it
as easy as possible for

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.360
developers and for translators
to do their job without

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.320
needing to understand each
other's roles as much.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.350
So given that, all the developer
needs to do upon

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.350
coming to the system is add the
resource files from their

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.190
application, from whatever
framework they've been using.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.440
So we support Java properties
files, Ruby on Rails YAML

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.500
files, a number of other file
formats from popular

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.490
frameworks, and are continuing
to add more

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.660
files as we go along.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.990
And then, choose the languages
that the developer wants their

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.310
app to be translated into.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.030
So in this case, we've chosen
Arabic, Chinese,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.980
Spanish, and Thai.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.650
And then, the last step from a
developer's perspective is to

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.250
add collaborators
to that project.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:25.200
So decide who you want to come
help you translate this.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.840
It could be friends or family
who speak other languages and

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.760
have offered to help
translate.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.860
It could be community members
or members of your user base

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.230
who offered to help
translate your

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.910
application to their language.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.580
Or it could be professional
translators who you decided to

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:42.170
hire to come in and translate
your application in your first

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.910
international launch to
five languages or

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.860
something of that nature.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.660
So after adding collaborators
and the translators, the

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.350
developer's job is effectively
done here.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.300
They don't need to understand
what happens after that point.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.530
But if you want to, you can go
into that part of the process.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.120
And we'll show you a little
bit of what that

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.250
looks like as well.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.560
So when a translator gets an
invitation to come in and work

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.510
on a translation project for
any of the apps that

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.730
developers might upload here,
what they'll see is the actual

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.420
translation interface where we
basically laid out all of the

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.230
messages that need to be
translated and kind of

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.790
abstracted away all of the
different files those came

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.040
from, where they sit
in the application.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.450
And the translator can just go
ahead and enter translations

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.360
as they go along.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.480
A few other features that make
this a little bit more

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.010
convenient is we've also
abstracted away the individual

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.310
placeholder support
for each language.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:39.440
So a translator can use
placeholders without needing

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.330
to understand how the
programming language that was

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.650
used actually implements
placeholders.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.990
And we just go ahead when the
developer comes back to export

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.390
the file and replace it with
the placeholders that that

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.500
language is using.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.350
Another thing that's convenient,
particularly for

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.910
application translation, is the
suggestions feature, which

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.850
allows us to offer suggestions
both from Google Translate,

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.000
but also from previous
translations within that

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.970
application or within
that project.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:10.410
So if you have a number of
translators coming in, and the

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.510
word photos has been translated
somewhere earlier

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.530
on, but you now have a new
phrase in the application,

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.860
view my photos, then that
translator will get a preview,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.400
a suggestion, of what word to
use there so that you maintain

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.670
a consistent translation
throughout the entire project.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.450
The most important thing that
we found when looking at why

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.940
applications are very different
from static files

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.960
and from other types of content
that you might want to

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.120
localize is that applications
have very short UI strings.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.570
And so it's very difficult
to get a sense of what an

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.080
individual string or message
might mean for a translator,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.930
which leads to issues like
Manish described before.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.830
Small, medium, and
large becomes

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.990
Saturday, medium, and large.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.890
These sorts of things stem
from translators not

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.870
understanding what a message
is supposed to be in the

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.120
actual application.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.130
So what we worked hard to do
is make sure that we give

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.090
developers the ability to
capture very easily the

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.260
context of their application
and to capture snapshots so

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.720
that the translator can
translate in context exactly

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.740
what the message means and can
see in real-time how that

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.680
impacts what the message
looks like in the UI.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.195
A couple of other very
convenient aspects of this

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:27.990
that help the localization
process significantly is that

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.540
the developer can come through
after the fact and take a look

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.160
at all messages that have or
haven't been translated and

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.360
get a sense of everything looks
fine in Chinese except

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.430
there's this English word over
here that's still in English.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.970
So clearly I missed something
when I was putting things into

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.820
my resource bundles.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.860
The other thing that's somewhat
nice about this is a

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.990
developer can come back to this
UI if they want to after

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.020
the translation is complete and
can see the impact that

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.860
the translation has on the UI.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.480
Because the process we used to
capture the messages from the

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.550
application not only captures
the HTML and the actual

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.620
snapshot, but it also
captures the CSS.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.640
So we actually have the
style information.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.390
And you can see in real-time
what happens when a particular

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.050
message breaks the UI.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.320
In this case, a very long
message might push some of

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.300
these items onto the next line
which would break the UI and

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.440
break the CSS.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.750
So the developer can get a sense
of where problems are in

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.130
their interface and can fix
those problems before

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.200
redeploying the app
in new languages.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.560
So this is something that we're
continuing to work on

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.210
and are looking forward to
making available publicly in

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.492
the near future.

00:45:37.492 --> 00:45:38.210
MANISH BHARGAVA: Great.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.340
That was great, especially
the screenshot part.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.590
Thank you, Andrew.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.500
OK.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.060
So we are at the point where
we have looked at

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.120
globalization and getting your
app for a global audience

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.340
makes lot of sense.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:58.740
We also looked at what it
entails and how do we achieve

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.690
that in terms of both
internationalization and

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.110
localization.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.850
We looked at available tools.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.520
Now, let's say you have
done all of that.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.250
You have now a localized app.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.170
What's next?

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:12.660
The natural question is how
do I get my app now

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.550
to the right audience?

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.520
So how do I find the customers,
and do the global

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.660
customers find me?

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.140
So listed here are some of the
practical tips for you to

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.160
market your app, especially
where is Google marketplaces,

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.120
including Chrome web store,
including Google Play for

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.860
Android app as well.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.940
So first and foremost, if you
do nothing else, you should

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.540
localize your marketplace
metadata

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.080
into different languages.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.930
That by itself significantly
boosts your app's ranking in

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.840
the marketplace, especially
for that locale.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.590
So that's the first
and foremost part.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.110
The second is maximize your
search potential.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:52.250
Why is that important?

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:58.670
Because search accounts for
about 2/3 of all installs and

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.690
sales on Google Play.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.590
How do you do that?

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.360
How do you maximize your
search potential?

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.230
Think of the keywords.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.920
Think of the keywords that
somebody would search for when

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.920
your app should show up and
include those in your title,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.630
in your description.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.980
Both of these fields are
indexed from a search

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:15.760
perspective.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.540
And once you have included
those keywords in the

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.140
respective locales as well, the
findability of your app

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.270
increases multi-folds in terms
of a search perspective.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.950
One key insight in terms of,
again, ranking of your app in

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.140
these locale, there are
three main factors

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:33.990
that go into that.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.180
One is high number
of installs.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.650
The second is low number
of uninstalls.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.250
And the third is long
term usage.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.414
So how many users are using
your app over a

00:47:43.414 --> 00:47:44.590
long period of time?

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.500
So for that, the steady effort
on your part for

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.870
internationalization and
localization becomes a very

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.190
key factor here.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.680
So think of your investment in
terms of advertising campaign

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.680
and so on over a period of time
rather than just be in

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.750
short bursts.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:04.620
And lastly, localize
your app listing.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.940
Localize your app screenshots.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.090
If your apps screenshot reflect
the actual user

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.540
experience, the number of
the installs go higher.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.510
And more importantly, number
of uninstalls go lower.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:23.240
And that again helps in terms of
findability of your app on

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.490
various marketplaces.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.750
So take home message.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.700
Important thing to
note here is--

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.810
like again, we covered a
lot of details here.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.170
If you forget most of the stuff,
please remember these

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:35.960
four things.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.200
First is it is never
too late to start.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.820
So if you haven't done that, you
still have your app only

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.510
in English or one of the
languages, get started now.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.430
Get started today.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.950
Opportunity, as we have showed
in the initial slide,

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:51.840
opportunity is just too
big for you to ignore.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.800
So focus on that.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.050
The third is it is relatively
very simple to get started.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.940
And again, it will not get you
in the perfect state right

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.370
away, but you will get there.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.180
So things like just remove
any hard-coded string.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:04.610
Externalize them.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:08.980
Make them as resource bundles
and send them for translation.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.500
Use a few libraries so that
you do the number handling

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.740
date format, currency formats,
et cetera, correctly.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.300
And then, get your friend, get
your family to come and help

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.910
you translate in just
one language.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.110
So you can essentially take all
your strings and say, OK,

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:23.740
we're good to go.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.340
Let's essentially use
these and just

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.700
do it for one language.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.020
It will not be perfect
as I said.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.270
But it will put you in
the right direction

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.870
on the right path.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.250
Finally, localize
your marketplace

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:37.270
metadata as I just mentioned.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.890
This, by itself, significantly
improves findability of your

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:44.300
app on marketplace, specifically
the Chrome web

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.810
store as well as Google
Play as well.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.670
That brings us to the conclusion
of our talk.

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:55.330
Most of the stuff that we have
referenced here, you can--

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.700
reference what we have covered
here, you can essentially find

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.950
on developer.google
.com/international.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.840
As the [? GTTA ?]

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.980
comes out, you will essentially

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.950
find the updates here.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:16.480
So again, it's
developers.google.com.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.450
That's pretty much it.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.450
We are out of time
for questions.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.700
Thank you.
