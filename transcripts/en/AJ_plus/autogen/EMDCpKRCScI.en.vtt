00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.660
 the idea is like having the 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.519
 continuation of the sky as if it were 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.820
 as if it were a curtain or that it gets 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.590
 opposite then when one is and what 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.230
 we did precisely here in this 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.150
 space because there is a street that 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.330
 continue that is whether it starts in Mexico and 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.609
 continued in the USA but there is this border 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.519
 this barrier that prevents movement to 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.470
 through this street then creating 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.340
 with what the feeling as if one more 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.340
 was the sky 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.040
 why not see this space as if 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 we were a humanity we are not two 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 cultures say yes we are different 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.400
 cultures but that under the same sky there 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.860
 then like that one unit and bring 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.860
 bring or create that sense of union
