00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.180
JESSICA: Last year, we
introduced Android for Work,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.790
a new way to make
Android awesome at work

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.970
for employees and businesses.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.930
In Lollipop, we put some
sugar-coated efforts

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.740
into making Android devices
suitable for managed

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.020
deployments.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.510
IT admins can now securely
deploy company-owned devices.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.620
They can also support bring
your own device, or "BYOD."

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.740
I'm Jessica.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.880
I'm going to tell you how
we've enhanced Android for Work

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.280
in the M release with even more
APIs for device administration,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.440
a better, more polished BYOD
experience, and an entirely

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.010
new way to deploy
devices called "COSU."

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.210
More about that later, but
if you build or deploy apps

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.060
for business, you will
want to watch this video.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.260
Here's a quick recap
for those of you

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.170
who don't already know all
about Android for Work.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.810
Millions of people are
bringing their own devices

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.120
to the workplace.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.850
In Android Lollipop, they can
set up a secure work profile

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.920
managed by their IT admin.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.660
The work profile contains
apps and data that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.200
are separately administered.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.470
Users just install their
company's Enterprise Mobility

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.690
Management app and sign in.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.870
Hooray.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.290
another acronym-- "EMM."

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.590
We've partnered
with some great EMMs

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.290
to bring Android for Work
solutions to the market.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.550
We also added a
way for companies

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.740
to deploy corporate-owned
devices on L.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.330
We call this model Device Owner.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.880
And it's perfect
for when IT requires

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.780
control over the whole device.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.900
All this is pretty much business
as usual for the employee.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.100
Once they've enrolled
their personal device,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
they see a Workbench
version of the Play Store.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450
Here, they can download
enterprise apps

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.890
that were approved
by their employer.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.140
Personal and work apps
are available side

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.930
by side in the launcher.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.790
Work apps and notifications
are batched so they're

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.270
instantly recognizable.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.280
So let's move to the new
APIs in the M release.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.140
IT admins need to keep a handle
on the amount of mobile data

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.220
work apps are using.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
So we've added a new network
usage API for the work profile.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.990
IT can even break down
data usage by app.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.220
Admins can spend
an enormous amount

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.580
of time configuring access
to corporate resources

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.660
for each device.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.030
Well, we've addressed
this issue with a new API

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.300
that can install certificates
from an IT-approved app.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.200
So now users just enter
corporate credentials once,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650
and work apps have the
necessary certificates

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.160
to access resources securely.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.720
To make life easier
for IT, they now

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.420
have the ability to add
read-only Wi-Fi configurations

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.340
on corporate-owned devices.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.560
This way, they
can ensure devices

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.450
get on the corporate
network with no hassle

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.740
or accidental deletions.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.940
It will also reduce the
volume of support requests.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.850
Work should never get
in the way of using

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.740
the device you know and love.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.740
So we've made a few
improvements to work

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.590
profiles to make the BYOD
experience in M even better.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.060
Firstly, with both personal and
work apps on the same device,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.620
users will now see a work
icon in the status bar

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.860
so they know when
they're in a work app.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.020
Secondly, apps that set up
virtual private networks

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.580
are popular with consumers
and used in business.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.880
IT will often deploy a VPN
app into the work profile

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.520
to provide secure access
to corporate services.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.980
VPN apps will now appear in a
unified settings control panel.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.970
We've refined the
user experience

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.090
so corporate VPN
apps are clearly

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.370
shown alongside personal ones.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.920
Finally, we've enhanced
the contacts provider.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.880
Now work contact names can be
made available to system apps,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.110
so no more mystery
calls from your boss.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.920
You'll see your boss's name
instead of just a number.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.320
So far, we looked at how to
make life easier for IT admins

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.840
and better for users.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.710
Now let's talk about an exciting
new use for Android devices.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.360
Have you ever checked in
for a flight, rented a car,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.640
or ordered room service?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.110
Wouldn't it be
great if you could

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.510
do that from a securely managed
Android device in the terminal,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.480
at a kiosk, or in
your hotel room?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.470
Android for Work now lets
IT manage these devices.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.380
We call them COSU--
Corporate-Owned Single-Use

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.470
devices.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.230
In one single provisioning
step, such as an NFC bump,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.030
IT can now set up a new
device and lock it to an app.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.300
Device owners can use new
APIs to manage apps on devices

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.180
like these in public spaces.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.000
That's about it for our update
on Android for Work in M.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.360
I really hope these work-related
goodies make you as excited

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.970
as we are.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.980
Our job is to make your job
just a little bit easier

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.820
by making Android even
more tasty at work.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.240
My name is Jessica.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.580
Thanks for watching.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.915
I'd better get back to it.

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.720
