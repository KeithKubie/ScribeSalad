00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.210
Identify 15/8, or 15
over 8, as a proper

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.237
or an improper fraction.

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:10.820
So this is actually
just a good review

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.560
of proper and
improper fractions.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.970
And there's a pretty easy
way to identify them.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.720
You have a proper fraction if
your numerator-- so this right

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.210
here is your numerator,
the number on top.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.465
Let me just label them,
numerator and denominator.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.620
You have a proper
fraction if your numerator

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.276
is less than your denominator.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.220
And if you don't have
a proper fraction,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.470
you have an improper fraction.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.200
So your improper fraction
is if your numerator

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.951
is greater than or equal
to your denominator.

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:55.200
And over here, actually, all
the numbers are positive.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.950
But if you had some
negative numbers here,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.830
then you would actually say the
absolute value of the numerator

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.180
is less than the absolute
value of the denominator,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.480
for a proper fraction.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.280
And the absolute
value of the numerator

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
is greater than or equal
to the absolute value

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.810
of the denominator for
an improper fraction.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.850
So let me just write
that down, just

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.520
to be a little bit
more particular here,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.950
because we could have negative
numbers in either the numerator

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.750
or the denominator.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.770
Anyway, let's go
back to this problem.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.960
15 is clearly greater
than or equal to 8.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.230
So 15 is greater
than or equal to 8,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.809
so we are dealing with
an improper fraction.
