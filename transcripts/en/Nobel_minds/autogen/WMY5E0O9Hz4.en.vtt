lot of attention and and I guess at that
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.330 align:start position:0%
lot of attention and and I guess at that
point<00:00:13.049><c> in</c><00:00:13.290><c> time</c><00:00:13.349><c> was</c><00:00:13.620><c> the</c><00:00:13.740><c> first</c><00:00:13.920><c> time</c><00:00:14.040><c> I</c><00:00:14.099><c> had</c>

prize and so at a fairly young age I was
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179 align:start position:0%
prize and so at a fairly young age I was
I<00:00:30.840><c> was</c><00:00:30.990><c> able</c><00:00:31.140><c> to</c><00:00:31.320><c> share</c><00:00:31.500><c> that</c><00:00:31.529><c> I</c><00:00:31.740><c> guess</c><00:00:32.040><c> that</c>

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 align:start position:0%
I was able to share that I guess that
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 align:start position:0%
I was able to share that I guess that
was<00:00:32.309><c> an</c><00:00:32.520><c> indicator</c><00:00:32.969><c> that</c><00:00:33.059><c> the</c><00:00:33.930><c> work</c><00:00:34.110><c> was</c>

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
was an indicator that the work was
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 align:start position:0%
was an indicator that the work was
getting<00:00:34.530><c> some</c><00:00:34.680><c> attention</c><00:00:34.800><c> I</c><00:00:35.570><c> remember</c><00:00:36.570><c> being</c>

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
getting some attention I remember being
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780 align:start position:0%
getting some attention I remember being
very<00:00:37.640><c> much</c><00:00:38.640><c> kind</c><00:00:39.000><c> of</c><00:00:39.170><c> enthusiastic</c><00:00:40.170><c> and</c>

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
very much kind of enthusiastic and
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.369 align:start position:0%
very much kind of enthusiastic and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 align:start position:0%
excited by the research but it was very
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 align:start position:0%
excited by the research but it was very
hard<00:00:43.620><c> to</c><00:00:43.649><c> tell</c><00:00:43.980><c> that</c><00:00:44.399><c> how</c><00:00:45.030><c> you</c><00:00:45.450><c> know</c><00:00:45.620><c> which</c>

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
hard to tell that how you know which

portions of the research we're going to
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 align:start position:0%
portions of the research we're going to
command<00:00:48.149><c> the</c><00:00:48.329><c> biggest</c><00:00:48.600><c> attention</c><00:00:49.020><c> in</c><00:00:49.140><c> fact</c><00:00:49.289><c> it</c>

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 align:start position:0%
command the biggest attention in fact it
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.779 align:start position:0%
command the biggest attention in fact it
even<00:00:49.620><c> now</c><00:00:50.010><c> when</c><00:00:50.160><c> I</c><00:00:50.280><c> work</c><00:00:50.430><c> on</c><00:00:50.520><c> research</c>

even now when I work on research
projects<00:00:52.610><c> yeah</c><00:00:53.610><c> sometimes</c><00:00:54.149><c> they</c><00:00:54.449><c> get</c><00:00:54.570><c> very</c>

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
projects yeah sometimes they get very

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 align:start position:0%
little attention sometimes they get a
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
little attention sometimes they get a
lot<00:00:56.399><c> and</c><00:00:56.610><c> I</c><00:00:56.699><c> mean</c><00:00:57.210><c> while</c><00:00:57.420><c> I'm</c><00:00:57.539><c> doing</c><00:00:57.780><c> it</c><00:00:57.989><c> it's</c>

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 align:start position:0%
lot and I mean while I'm doing it it's
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.709 align:start position:0%
lot and I mean while I'm doing it it's
not<00:00:58.379><c> always</c><00:00:58.590><c> so</c><00:00:58.710><c> easy</c><00:00:58.800><c> to</c><00:00:59.100><c> tell</c><00:00:59.370><c> which</c><00:01:00.300><c> are</c><00:01:00.660><c> the</c>

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
not always so easy to tell which are the

not always so easy to tell which are the
