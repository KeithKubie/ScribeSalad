- [Rob] So there's a tremendous amount of
excitement about the microbiome at the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.400
moment in part due to the $173,000,000
dollar NIH Human Microbiome Project where

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.270
the results catapulted from the pages of
Science and Nature to the cover of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.630
Scientific American to the cover of The
Economist in record time and into public

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.100
consciousness. How did the excitements
that we're finding due to the decline in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.590
cost in DNA sequencing over a million-fold
in the last 15 years? The microbes do all

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760
kinds of things that we never suspected.
For example, they determine how attractive

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.360
we are to mosquitoes. So you're not crazy
when you go camping. You might really be

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.720
10 times as attractive to mosquitoes as
the person you're camping with. They

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.890
determine how we respond to drugs. And
they even determine traits like obesity

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.640
and a wide range of other diseases have
subsequently been linked to the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.320
microbiome. So a lot of what we're trying
to do at the moment is understanding how

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.450
can we map our microbes across our bodies
or across our planet? And the intuition is

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.880
here is that as you go to different parts
of the world, you see different species in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.250
different locations that immediately
identify a scene that's coming from one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.880
place or another or another. So with
microbes, it's more or less the same, but

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.210
we have the problem that they basically
look the same under a microscope, unlike

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.270
these charismatic mega-fauna [sp]. So
instead what we do is we turn to the DNA

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.780
to understand them. Now, the Human
Microbiome Project together with a team of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.720
about 400 researchers across the country,
we collected about four and a half

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.950
trillion As, Ts, Gs and Cs. But then the
problem with the data is it looks like

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.580
this. So this is the first 0.1% of the
first file. There's another 17,000 of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.800
these. It's pretty hard to tell who lives
where in the environment from that, right?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.950
So what we do is we use computational
techniques to develop these kinds of

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.480
abstract maps where each point summarizes
all of the complexity in a given microbial

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.460
community summed up by its DNA. And two
points close together are more similar in

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.820
terms of the evolutionary history of their
microbes. Two that are further apart are

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.000
more dissimilar in their microbial
evolutionary history.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.540
And so when we do this, we see
automatically emerging these major

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.570
patterns where the mouth is very different
from the skin, the vaginal microbiomes and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.740
the fecal microbiome down the bottom there
is distinct yet again. And so what this

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.760
implies is that two samples from the same
person can be real different in terms of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.560
the microbes. So here I'm highlighting one
oral sample and one fecal sample from the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.710
first person with the Human Microbiome
Project. So these are pretty different on

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.490
this map, but we only really understood
this when we cross-referenced the data to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.500
the Earth Microbiome Project where we can
go out into different physical

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.630
environments and ask what two samples are
as different from each other as the mouth

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.330
and the gut of this one person. And so, if
we compare your mouth to being kind of

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.930
like a coral reef, you have these complex
mineralized structures covered with

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.070
biofilms that maybe your dentist pesters
you about. The microbes in the gut are as

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.890
far away from the microbes in the mouth as
the microbes in this reef are from the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.140
microbes in this prairie in Kansas; so
essentially, non-overlapping communities.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.540
And what that means is that a few feet
along the length of your GI tract can make

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.670
as much difference to your microbes as
hundreds of miles across the Earth's

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.800
surface. And what I'll show you is that
the skin which is like yet another

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.660
microbial continent, has tremendous
diversity as well both within you as an

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.210
individual and between different people.
So this might lead you to wonder how

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.600
stable our microbiome is, at least if
we're healthy. And my partner, Amanda

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.670
who's--I've got her put up with a lot in
the name of microbiome research. And I

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.110
addressed this question by sampling our
own microbiomes every single day for a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.820
period of six months. So when I project
that into a slightly simpler version of

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.730
this data frame, basically, the dark
points on this are me. The light points

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.090
are her. Now, what you can see when I
start this going, so each frame on this

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.260
animation is one day as we move through
this landscape in microbiomes defined by

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.170
different people. And you can see
immediately how the skin in blue is much

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.150
more variable even within one person than
the other sites. The mouth in green is the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.740
most constant, and then the gut down at
the bottom is intermediate between the

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.490
two.
You can also see how we retain our

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.580
separate microbial identities through the
six-month period, and that's especially

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.390
remarkable when you consider we work
together and have all kinds of

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.620
opportunities to exchange microbes with
each other. I'll just rotate this around

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.910
so you can see how we retain those
separate microbial identities there. So

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.180
all of this might lead you to wonder where
do we get these personally unique microbes

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.990
from. And if you have dogs or kids as I
do, you probably have some dark suspicions

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.750
about that all of which are true by the
way. So it turns out I can actually match

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:53.460
you up to your dog by the microbes you
share. Now that's not to say that your

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.240
microbes are exactly the same as the
dog's. So here what we can see on a map

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.060
that includes both humans and dogs is that
every site of the body whether it's the

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.130
tongue, the stool, or the skin, the dog
and the human are separate from one

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.350
another. And again, you can see that the
dog's skin is very variable just like the

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.140
human skin is. But in all seriousness, our
first microbes depend tremendously on how

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.420
we're born. And so, this is like we did
with Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello now at

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.860
NYU, looking at microbes of mothers now
before they gave birth and then of their

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.480
babies within 20 minutes of birth. And
what you can see in red is the vaginal

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.590
communities from the mothers and then in
pink, we have microbes from all over the

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.220
bodies including the skin and including
the gut of babies 20 minutes after they

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.210
were born. Whereas in contrast, in the
dark blue, we have all the skin

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.310
communities from the mothers. And in light
blue, we have all the habitats from all

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.970
over the body of babies delivered by
C-section. So what you can see is that if

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.790
you're delivered by C-section, you're
denied the vaginal microbes you would

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.600
ordinarily have as you pass through the
birth canal. We think that the lack of

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.570
that co-evolved microbial community may
explain some of the differences in health

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.070
between vaginally delivered and C-section
babies. Of course, the most likely outcome

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.650
if you have a kid by C-section is that
your kid will be fine, but there are

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.870
slightly somewhat higher risks of all
kinds of diseases including ectopic

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.920
dermatitis, food allergies and even
obesity, all of which have now been linked

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.320
to the microbiome.
So again with Maria Gloria, we're doing

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.260
this trial at the moment to try to figure
out, can you restore the microbial

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.110
community to kids delivered by C-section.
And so, what we're doing here is

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.650
essentially collecting the vaginal
microbes from mothers then delivering them

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.050
to the babies. And this is very
preliminary data at this point, but we are

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:43.670
able to show partial restoration of the
microbial community both in the gut and in

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:49.680
the skin by applying this procedure. And
so, we're hoping to develop this into a

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.600
large enough study to develop clinical
recommendations based on this microbial

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.790
restoration. So you might be wondering,
"Well, what happens after that?" What I'm

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.810
going to show you now is the trajectory of
one child--this is what we did with Ruth

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.340
Lee [sp], tracking one child over the
first two and a half years of life. And so

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.650
what we're going to be looking at his gut
community. He was delivered vaginally, and

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:17.660
you can see that his initial fecal sample
is up there in the vaginal region with

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.240
perhaps a little skin contribution as
well. And so the question is, "How long

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.550
does it take him to move through this
landscape towards the adult fecal

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.930
community over two and a half years? How
complete is that progression down towards

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.230
the bottom? And is it smooth or is it
chaotic?" So what you can see is at some

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.970
weeks, he changes a little bit whereas
other weeks, he changes a lot. And

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.010
remember what matters on these plots is
the distance from one point to another. So

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.560
it really is true that one week to the
next, your kid can look like a completely

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.690
different person at least when you compare
the distances between these points to the

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.800
distances between healthy adults in the
Human Microbiome Project which are those

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.550
points in brown at the bottom. Now, coming
up here is something fascinating. So he

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.350
gets antibiotics for the ear infection.
See that tremendous regression of the

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.400
microbiome and then the recovery. That
went by pretty fast, so I'm just going to

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.390
rewind it for you and play it again. So
what you can see is on administration of

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.280
oral amoxicillin for an ear infection, you
see this tremendous regression of the gut

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.000
microbiome and during months of normal
development, followed in this case, by

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.930
rapid recovery.
Then by the time he gets to two and a half

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.600
years, he's more or less in the healthy
adult distribution. But we just don't know

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.540
in general what the effects of antibiotics
are on the rest of the body and on the

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.560
sites they're targeted and whether those
early life changes can have profound and

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.800
lasting effects. There's some evidence in
both humans and experimental animal models

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.590
that early life antibiotics in the first
six months can lead to increased rates of

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.020
obesity, but we don't know about the
impact on the skin, on the mouth and on

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.260
other sites on the body yet. We can also
do this sort of thing cross-culturally. So

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.270
here in which we have gotten and we've got
an African population in red, South

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.490
American population in green and then the
US population in blue, the gut communities

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.040
converged on one another after the first
three years of life. However, where they

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.810
wound up in the three populations was very
different. So the rate of approach to the

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.600
adult stage is very similar
cross-culturally, but the final stage

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.260
where you end up can be very different.
And you can see the Western population in

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.960
that right-hand panel in blue is very
different from the two non-Western

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.750
populations. And in that respect, it's
important to remember that even

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.490
large-scale projects like the Human
Microbiome Project have largely only

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.440
looked at healthy Western adults. And as
soon as you start to go into children and

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.010
as soon as you start to go to non-Western
populations, you see very different

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.470
things. This is true not just in the gut,
but in every site in the body. So for

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.170
example, this is what we did with Maria
Gloria Dominguez looking at previously

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.860
uncontacted Yanomami in South America. And
what you can see is the Yanomami

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.170
population is more diverse in the skin, so
that's the left panel, than the US

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.590
population. And then the microbes that
they have on the skin are completely

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.990
different. So those green points separate
completely from the yellow points of the

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.140
US population.
So this might lead you to wonder, "Well,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.320
we've seen that the skin can vary
cross-culturally, but how does it vary

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.410
over the human body?" And this is like
we've been doing with Pieter Dorrestein

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.390
here at UCSD in the Skaggs School of
Pharmacy. And across the skin, it's just

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.750
so fascinating. It's this interface
between ourselves and the physical

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.650
environment that we're in contact with. So
Pieter was interested in how microbes were

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.770
over the skin. So he recruited two
subjects one of which was him, and sampled

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.680
the skin at 500 sites over the body and
then analyzed each of those sites using

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.480
two kinds of mass spectrometry. And
re-sequenced the DNA of the bacteria to

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.140
give a readout of where they are all over
the body. And one thing that was

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:54.190
fascinating is that all of the microbes
can differentiate the two subjects from

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.450
one another. They're not nearly as
distinct subject to subject as the

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.130
metabolites are. So you can see that the
metabolites from these two completely

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:06.380
separate clouds, one from the male in blue
and one from the female in red. And so,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.270
the metabolites we can track down where
they are in the body. And some of them are

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.570
broadly distributed all over the body.
Some are localized to the armpit or to the

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.190
groin or to the toenails or other
particular sites. And we can do the same

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.540
kind of thing for the microbes. So for
example, staphylococcus is mostly in the

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.760
moist regions like you'd expect so the
nose and feet. Propionibacterium are on

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:32.666
the head and shoulders and corynebacterium
broadly over the body. So one thing that

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:37.983
was really fascinating about this was when
we built these molecular networks to try

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.256
to figure out how the chemicals related to
one another, what we could see is that

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:45.447
most of the chemicals we found on human
skin did not come from pure bacterial

00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:50.048
cultures or from human skin cell cultures,
but instead came from beauty products. And

00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:54.283
in fact, 90% of chemicals that we
identified on skin in the study came from

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:58.356
sunscreen and moisturizer and shampoo and
other things that our subjects applied to

00:13:58.356 --> 00:14:02.216
their bodies. So that's just fascinating,
right? That 90% of the identifiable

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:07.914
chemicals on your body probably come from
consumer products that you apply. So to

00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:13.740
address this problem, I've been working
with the Hadza in Tanzania together with

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.200
Jeff Leach through the Human Food Project.
And so, these are people who have not been

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.032
exposed to any of these products at all.
And essentially, what we've been doing is

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:31.653
sampling a wide range of things there
including the gut, the skin, the various

00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:36.319
dwellings and so forth on different
projects. And so what you can see is that

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:41.452
the Hazda, shown here in yellow, have very
different metabolic communities from the

00:14:41.452 --> 00:14:46.382
Westerners even when we were out at the
field site. So we're at the same location,

00:14:46.382 --> 00:14:50.642
but you see these very different skin
metabolite profiles. And what you can see

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:56.913
is of the metabolites that we saw, only
about 25% of what was identified was

00:14:56.913 --> 00:15:00.725
shared by the Hadza skin and the skin of
Westerners. You can also see that the

00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:04.448
Hadza skin is much closer to the
environmental samples, mostly water

00:15:04.448 --> 00:15:09.109
samples that we collected on-site in green
there. They also have a fairly large

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:13.105
contribution from honey which can make up
a lot of their calories in the dry season

00:15:13.105 --> 00:15:17.490
which is when we were doing the sampling.
And we can also see a number of plants

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.080
that are contributing to the Hadza and not
to the Westerner metabolites. And so these

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.730
are things like baobabs and other major
sources of food that we can track down the

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:33.740
specific metabolic links between the food
and the person. So this is a kind of

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.070
molecular network where essentially you
can think of this as basically being like

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.590
constellations of the different
metabolites where you connect up the ones

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.630
that are related to each other and match
them up to different kinds of

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.050
environmental samples. And so what we can
do with this is we can identify clusters

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.640
that their specific to particular niches.
So for example, we can see plant

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:00.236
flavonoids. We can see monostearate which
is more on the healthcare products in the

00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:09.820
US population. And we can zoom in and for
example, look at the flavonoids and how

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.500
the profiles are somewhat similar, but
then with subtle differences between the

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.710
US and the Hadza individuals in the study.
And then similarly, we can do this sort of

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.240
thing with seterols which again are mostly
coming from plant metabolites and from

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.140
sucrose from the beehive which is found
predominantly in the Hadza. So we can also

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.160
do this sort of thing looking at the
bacteria. And what I'm doing here is just

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.630
coloring it by body site. So for example,
the green is stool. The pink is skin, and

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:44.040
you can see this tremendous heterogeneity
in the skin. And we also got some samples

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.740
from three collaborators at the Yerkes
Primates Center, and I'm just going to

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.100
make some of the balls bigger for the
chimpanzees. Those of you familiar with

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.730
chimpanzee anatomy will understand why.
And so, what you can see is that the fecal

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.510
samples from the chimps are distinct from
the fecal samples from the humans. Then

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.450
correspondingly, the few skin samples we
have from one chimpanzee individual, those

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.320
large pink balls, are substantially
distinct from the skin samples from any of

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.390
the humans including the Hadza. And then
within the human population like you can

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:20.390
see here basically the gray samples of
skin are samples from Westerners, and the

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.100
colored balls are from Hadza from
different camps. And you can see that

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.800
again, like the South American Yanomami
group I showed you before, the Hadza skin

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.510
samples are distinct from what we see in
Westerners. So we're just starting to

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.870
uncover the links between microbiology and
different lifestyles. I should point out

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:45.170
that most of this data from the Hadza and
from the chimpanzees was assembled over

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.090
the past week, and many of these figures
we made last night on the spot, so this is

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.770
still very preliminary data. We're still
trying to fully understand the results. So

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.540
anyway, one thing that's exciting about
matching up the metabolite and the

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.340
bacterial profiles is we can get an idea
of what bacteria are doing what functions.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.310
So if I show you something like
proprionibacterium which is mostly on the

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.860
head and shoulders and then--sorry, mostly
on the head and shoulders and then

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:14.480
something like oleic acid which is on the
head and on the hands. You can see in the

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.660
third figure that oxidized oleic acid,
which is a metabolic product of oleic

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.440
acid, that's on the head where you see
proprionibacterium but not on the hands

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.560
where you don't see it.
And then similarly with palmitic acid, we

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.930
can see it getting degraded to monoolein,
monopalmitin only with proprionibacterium

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.500
mostly. So what we can do then is we can
test that hypothesis by taking the

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.990
bacteria cultured off skin, and then
incubating it with a precursor and just

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.580
verifying that that particular bacterium
in the lab can do the chemical reaction

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.270
that we attribute to it. Okay, so I'm just
going to talk very briefly about how we

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:57.420
exchange our skin microbes with our
environment. And for example, we can match

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.290
up the keys on your computer keyboard to
the tips of your fingers and the palm of

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.820
your hand with your computer mouse with up
to 95% accuracy based on the microbes you

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.520
share. So this came out in the scientific
journal PANS a few years ago. Here, I'm

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.760
just showing you the skin of the
fingertips from the keyboard keys

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.780
clustering together by subject for three
different people. But more importantly, it

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.890
was on the TV show, CSI: Miami so you
really know it's true. In any case, we can

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.190
use this kind of mapping technique towards
sources of pathogens in the kitchen where

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.950
you can see in that top panel that you're
leaving your skin communities primarily on

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.050
the door handles and the trash can and
other things that you touch. We can do the

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.990
same kind of thing in bathrooms. So here
you can see that the skin's mostly on the

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.020
door handles and the toilet seats. Our
stool's fortunately mostly confined to the

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.010
bathroom. Then there's a big signal from
soil on the floor and intriguingly also on

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.900
the flush handle where apparently, a lot
of people were using their feet to flush.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.380
And coming from New Zealand, I had never
heard of this cultural practice, but

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.290
apparently it's fairly common in the US.
We can also do the same sort of thing in

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.610
homes. So this is what we did with Jack
Gilbert looking at what happens when you

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.310
move into a new house, and you can imagine
some different scenarios. So for example,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.320
you might stay the same, and the house
might stay the same.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.340
You might unpack your microbes all over
the house with the rest of your

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.120
belongings. Maybe the house instead
contributes microbes to you, or finally,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.260
maybe you and the house blend into a new
community state. One thing we saw was that

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.030
the house microbes were very highly
correlated with human microbes from the

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.000
same dwelling. There was one case where
there were two lodgers--sorry, where there

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.240
was a couple and a lodger, and to
everyone's immense relief, the two people,

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.630
the couple were more similar to one
another in their microbial community than

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:46.170
either was to the lodger. And so there was
no difficult explaining to do. But one

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.370
thing we can do is we can track the
individual contribution to different

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.750
surfaces. So here what we're looking at is
each individual and each dog's

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.020
contribution to different surfaces like
the bathroom doorknob, the bedroom floor

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.410
and so. You can see that black line.
That's where person one went away on a

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.970
trip, and you can see their particular
contribution to all of these surfaces

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.850
disappearing during that period when
they're away. So we can even tell who's

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.610
inhabiting a particular space by the
microbes that they're leaving behind. But

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.970
more seriously, we can apply this sort of
thing in the hospital environment to where

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:23.850
the hospital acquired infections. And we
can also apply these techniques to really

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.230
compelling questions in animal health. So
for example in the Earth Microbiome

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.080
Project, we've been looking at a huge
number of different microbial samples so

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.740
over 30,000 samples provided to them by
members of the community. And for example,

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.535
looking at komodo dragons--so this is me
swabbing a baby komodo dragon at the

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:47.876
Denver zoo called Bintang. What we can see
is that each komodo dragon in their

00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:52.527
enclosure shares a whole lot of microbes
with the particular enclosure it's in just

00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:56.661
like we do as humans with the enclosures
in which we capture ourselves. But what's

00:21:56.661 --> 00:22:00.678
fascinating is that the microbial
communities of the captive komodo dragon's

00:22:00.678 --> 00:22:05.441
soil don't resemble at all the communities
that we see in soil in the wild. So you

00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:09.720
see these two completely distinct clouds
of points. And what's interesting is the

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.750
degree of sharing is pretty similar to the
degree of sharing we see between humans

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.980
and pets in the same houses, but not the
degree of sharing that we see with wild

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.020
amphibians and their environment where a
constant input of microbes seems to be

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.210
really important for health.
Speaking of amphibian health, one thing

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:30.520
that's really important is this fungal
disease called Bd which is leading to

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.700
amphibian declines worldwide. And one
thing that's fascinating--and this is with

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.160
Val McKenzie at Boulder--is that we can
look at a whole lot of different

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.330
amphibians and actually put them along
this axis of resistance from the least

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.700
resistant to the most resistant to Bd
based on the skin microbial community. And

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.780
then the really cool part is like Rich
showed you in humans, we can actually

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:56.880
transfer the microbes from one frog to
another and confer resistance to the skin

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.820
fungus. And so, this idea of microbial
transplants is turning out to be

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:06.770
incredibly compelling. So I'll just wrap
up very briefly by mentioning that you can

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.010
put yourself on these kinds of microbial
maps now through this project called

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:15.010
American Gut, that will also accept skin
and other samples. And not everyone wants

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.190
to know what's in there, these middle
schoolers reacting to the idea we're going

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.740
to use robots and lasers to look at their
poop. But just to re-orient you on the map

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.490
in cases like clostridium difficile, what
you can see is this extreme dysbiotic

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.900
microbial community if you have this
profound form of diarrhea where you're

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.580
going to the bathroom many times a day. I
just want to show you what happens when

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.440
you do ecosystem restoration where you
have one donor who's down on the healthy

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.980
state there and transmit that to four
patients. So this is with Mike Sadowsky

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.660
and Alex Khoruts of the University of
Minnesota. And what you can see is that on

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.440
transmission of that microbiome from the
healthy donor to the four of these

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.530
patients, and each frame on this is just
going to be one day in the life of the

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.090
microbiome. What you can see is
essentially immediately, they go from the

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:05.260
unhealthy stage into the healthy stage,
and then they stay there. And so the

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.600
prospects to do this kind of thing--and
this is [inaudible 00:24:08] to clinical

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.150
remission of their symptoms within a day
or two.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.270
The ability to do this sort of thing in
all body habitats whether it's the gut or

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.140
the skin or elsewhere is an incredibly
compelling area of medicine today given

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.040
the large number of diseases we now know
are linked to the microbiome. But what we

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.060
really have to do is develop not just
these microbial maps, but the kind of

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.660
microbial GPS that tells you not just
where are you right now but where do you

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.720
want to go in terms of your microbiome,
and what do you need to do step by step in

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.760
order to get there. We need to develop
this and make it so easy to use that even

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.640
our children can use it. So you can
imagine the kind of smart toilet that's

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.500
going to do an analysis of your microbes
and your metabolites. It's going to

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.210
deliver it to your smartphone which, let's
face it, I bet you're using it in there

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:56.040
anyway. And it's going to tell you whether
you're going in a good direction or a bad

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.050
direction and maybe what, specifically,
you need to do in order to improve the

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.980
health of any of your microbiomes whether
it's your gut or your skin. So with that,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.630
I'll briefly thank again the many people
who contributed to the specific week I

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:14.100
showed you, the large number of amazing
people I've had working with me in my lab

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.063

thanks for your attention.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.880
- [Mark] I first got interested in lice
many years ago when my now 25-year-old son

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.020
was in elementary school and he came home
with one of those fliers saying that one

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.960
of the kids in his class had genital lice
and what sorts of things parents should be

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.070
on the lookout for. Also included was a
flier with a bunch of what I refer to as

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:57.330
fun facts about human lice that I didn't
know about. These includes the facts that

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:02.320
our lice only parasitize humans. They
don't live on cats or dogs or your other

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.710
pets. You don't have to worry about
picking it up from them or transferring

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.690
them to your pets. In other words, this
means they're obligate parasite of humans.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.540
They can only live on human hosts.
Secondly, they can't survive more than

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.630
about 24 hours away from the human body.
That means they can't take up residence in

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.630
your bedding or your clothing or except,
you know, be infected from that source. I

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.120
thought, well if this is true, then what
that means is that the spread of lice

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.380
around the world must have been
accomplished by the spread of humans

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.540
around the world. And since human
migrations is something that I'm

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.400
interested in, that maybe by studying
lice, we can learn something more about

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:43.200
human migrations. Then, a few years later
when I actually had time to start looking

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.940
into this in more detail, I found out that
was actually potentially even more

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:52.760
interesting because us humans, we like to
think about what and look into what makes

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.670
us special, what makes us different from
other creatures. One of the things that

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.020
makes us unique, as far as I know, in the
animal world, is that we were the only

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.960
species parasitized by three different
types of lice. Lice are ubiquitous. All

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.880
mammals have lice, birds have lice, fish
have lice, but we alone have three

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.020
different types of lice. Two of these,
that I'll talk about, start out, and then

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:21.190
mention the third one later, are the head
louse, pediculus capitis, and the body

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.300
louse, pediculus humanus, or sometimes
also classified as a subspecies of

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.630
pediculus capitis. As you can see,
morphologically, they look quite similar.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:34.650
What actually differentiates them is their
ecology. The head louse, as the name

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:40.900
suggests, lives and feeds exclusively on
the human scalp. Body louse feeds on the

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:46.890
body but actually lives in the clothing
and lays its eggs in clothing. Now you ask

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.820
yourself, how would this difference come
about? Why would we have two different

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.660
kinds of lice that do these two different
things? The answer that seems to make the

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.420
most sense is that this ecological
difference between head and body louse

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.970
probably arose when clothing became
important in human evolution. Then, it

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.850
became available as a new niche, a new
ecological niche that lice can move into

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:13.490
and start exploiting and start adapting
to. It evolved to become body lice. If

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:18.350
that's true, if you buy that, what we can
do is use a molecular clock approach and

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.270
we can date the origin of body lice, the
divergence between head and body lice. By

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.930
inference, that tells us when clothing
became important in human evolution. Will

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.370
we need to do the molecular clock? Well
the molecular clock is a long-standing

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:38.640
idea in evolutionary genetics and it goes
back to the idea that the rate of

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.750
evolution, the rate of change of DNA
sequences is approximately constant over

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:50.290
time. This idea is supported by a good
deal of observation. You take pairs of

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.580
species where you have some idea when they
diverge from fossil to bio-geographic

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.400
evidence, you measure the amount of DNA
divergence between them and you plot that,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.550
and you see very strong and astonishingly
close correlation between how much

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.070
divergence there is in DNA sequences and
how long ago those two species last shared

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:11.570
a common ancestor. It's also supported by
theory, but I'll skip over the gory

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:17.580
details of that. So what do we need in
order to use a molecular clock approach?

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.820
Well, we need a calibration point. We need
to know how fast the clock is ticking. We

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.800
need to know what is the rate of change in
our DNA sequences. What we did, in order

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.090
to do this, is we assume that when
chimpanzees and humans diverged, chimps

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.380
being the the closest living relative of
humans, so did their lice.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.080
The idea that when hosts diverge, their
parasites also diverge is this

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.990
co-evolution between host and parasites. A
long standing observation biology. There

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.730
are certainly many exceptions to it, but
by and large, it is the rule. When host

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:57.150
speciate so do their spare parasites. We
therefore, can get an idea of how fast the

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.590
clock is ticking, if we can take
chimpanzee lice, compare them to human

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:05.390
lice, measure their DNA differentiation,
and we assume that differentiation

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.540
occurred about six million years ago.
Well, that then gives us our calibration,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.260
that tells us how fast the clock is
ticking. In addition to do this work, we

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.020
need our lice samples. We got head lice
and body lice from all different sources

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:24.400
around the world. Not everyone was pleased
to hear from us and sometimes, we got

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.970
rather indignant responses about how dare
we suggest they might have lice at their

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:32.130
facility. But nonetheless, we got a good
worldwide sample of lice. We also got

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:38.500
chimpanzee lice, pediculus schaeffi from
the chimp sanctuary in Uganda. What is

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.560
also very important, since we have no clue
as to what these things are actually

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.140
supposed to look like, we had a local
expert examine them and confirm that the

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.580
identifications are indeed correct. Then,
what we did was we obtained DNA sequences

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.460
from these lice. We obtained two
mitochondrial DNA gene sequences which

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.930
gave the same results when analyzed
separately so we combine them, analyze

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.430
them together. Also, just to make sure
that there wasn't something strange about

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.790
the mitochondrial DNA, we obtained and
analyzed sequences of two nuclear genes.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.530
Then, we did a couple of sanity checks to
make sure that the results we were

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.260
getting, they're corresponding to what we
might expect. One who things we looked at

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:22.260
was a genetic diversity in the African
lice versus the non-African lice. What you

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.800
can see is that all of these genes have
different amounts of diversity which is

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.490
what we always observe because the amount
of diversity in a gene is a reflection of

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.730
the functional constraints on that gene,
but what we also see is that for each

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.130
gene, there's more diversity in the
African lice than in the non-African lice.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.390
Greater diversity implies that's where the
source is, that's where the origin is

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.860
because you had the most time, you
accumulate the most diversity. That's good

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.210
because what this indicates is that
greater diversity in African lice implies

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.830
an African origin of human lice. And since
that's where we think humans arose, that's

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.740
a good sanity check. The other check we
did on this is to compare the head lice

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.120
and the body lice. Again, you can see for
each of these three genes more diversity

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.930
in the head lice than in the body lice.
That fits with the scenario I told you

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.490
about that body lice are more recent in
origin than the head lice. They've had

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.650
less time to accumulate diversity. Now we
can do a phylogenetic analysis, putting

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:25.170
together all of these lice sequences using
the chimpanzee louse as an outgroup. The

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.380
Hs are the head lice, the Bs are the body
lice, the numbers in parenthesis are the

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.940
numbers of individual lice that had that
particular sequence. When we apply the

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.260
molecular clock approach, we see that the
clay here that contains all of the body

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:44.610
lice sequences as well as some of the head
lice sequences has an age of about 70,000

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:50.210
years ago, give or take, a few tens of
thousands of years. What we can also see

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.400
in this tree is that there is a particular
clay there which contains all of the body

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.740
lice as well as some of the head lice
sequences which has lots and lots of

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.900
little short branches. And that's a
signature of a population expansion. But

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:06.710
we also see in this analysis is evidence
for a population expansion occurring in

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:13.480
lice around this time. The conclusion we
came up with, from the study, is that body

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.300
lice arose about 70,000 years ago, which
then implies that that's when clothing

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.190
became important in human evolution,
provided the niche for the body lice to

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.000
start diverging. Now, how does this
compare to archaeological evidence

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.670
concerning the origin of clothing? Well,
clothing itself doesn't fossilize, so what

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.160
we have to do is rely on indirect
evidence.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.000
If we look at the indirect evidence, stone
tools and bone tools, that would be

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.700
unequivocally associated with clothing;
things, like needles for example. Those

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.280
are on the order of about 40,000 years old
at the most. Now, there are certainly

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.050
other tools around like scrapers that
potentially could have been used to

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.890
prepare hides for clothing by scraping
them off, but they also could be used for

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.170
other purposes. We don't really know for
sure what all they were being used for.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.420
The overall conclusion is if we look at
the archaeological evidence, it does not

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.340
contradict a fairly recent origin of
clothing, only about on the order of

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.550
70,000 years ago or so. To summarize the
results of this study, we see that body

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:18.000
lice originated from head lice, again
70,000 years ago or so. We see that

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.480
there's also population expansion that
occurred in lice at right around this

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.950
time. While this is all very speculative,
what is very tempting to try to relate

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:30.630
this to is the expansion of modern humans
out of Africa which is been dating

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:36.090
directly in DNA evidence in humans to be
between 50 and 100 thousand years ago.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:40.510
Both suggest that perhaps is when humans
expanded out of Africa, began growing in

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:45.210
size, developed clothing and that this
clothing became available as a niche for

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:52.940
the origin of the body lice. What about
Neanderthals? Whenever you work with

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.220
modern humans, sooner or later, someone
will ask you, "Well what about

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.860
Neanderthals?" What does this tell us
about Neanderthals and other archaic

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.350
humans? Did they have clothing? Well, this
is what we think are the evolutionary

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.590
relationships of modern humans and
neanderthals. They shared a common

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:14.190
ancestor 600,000 years ago, give or take a
few tens of thousands of years. Clothing,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.090
if we believe the lice results, originated
sometime here around the dispersion of

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:23.420
modern humans out of Africa. This would
suggest one of two possibilities for

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.480
Neanderthals. Either they did not have
clothing, or if they did have clothing

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.090
they invented it independently of modern
humans.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.740
In other words, they did not inherit
clothing from a common ancestor of

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:42.690
Neanderthals and modern humans. Now,
there's nothing in what we can infer from

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.010
the cognitive abilities of Neanderthals,
based on the archaeological record and so

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.520
forth, that would suggest that they were
just too stupid to come up with the idea

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.460
of clothing, right? Certainly, quite
feasible, they would have come up with the

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.690
idea of clothing on their own, invented it
independently from modern humans. It

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.450
certainly is the case that if you look at
reconstruction of Neanderthals, they're

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:11.230
almost always shown in having clothing.
Something like this. There's another

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.090
potential view about what Neanderthals
were like. Maybe, they were more like

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.530
this. Now, this is a pretty terrible
reconstruction of a Neanderthal from most

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.580
perspectives, but I show it here because
it shows neanderthals as having body hair,

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.600
as having retained their body hair. That
brings up the question, "Well when did we

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.200
actually lose body hair during our
evolutionary history?" We have no clue

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.240
about that from fossil evidence, and
modern genetics so far has not been able

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.350
to come up with that answer. When did we
lose body hair? If we lost body hair

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:45.530
recently maybe Neanderthals still had body
hair. Maybe then, therefore, when they

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.200
moved out of Africa into the colder
climates, they didn't need clothing

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.420
because they already their body hair.
There's lots of other mammals that moved

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.790
out of Africa at the same time. They
didn't invent clothing. They got along

00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:01.490
perfectly well without. That brings up the
question, when did we lose our body hair?

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:06.630
A potential answer from that comes from
the third type of lice that we have.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.870
That's this lovely creature here. This is
a public louse. Pubic lice, as the name

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.380
suggests, they live and feed exclusively
in the pubic region. As I've already told

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.090
you, the head lice live and feed
exclusively on the scalp. Now, you ask

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.400
yourself, how would this difference come
about between these two different types of

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:30.400
lice. The answer that seems to make sense
is that at one time we had body hair, we

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.520
had hair all over us, we had one type of
lice then we lost body hair so that we

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.420
only have hair in the pubic region and in
the head region. Now, we have a barrier

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:45.230
that the lice can't cross. We have
geographic isolation, we get classic

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.300
allopatric speciation, and now we have our
two types of lice.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.620
Well, again, if you buy that, then we can
use the molecular clock approach and ask,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.520
"When did the difference between public
and head lice occur?" and date that

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.600
divergence. That might tell us something
about when humans, then lost their body

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:09.350
hair. Now, that all sounds very nice and
neat, however, it's not quite that simple.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:13.270
Life is never that simple. Here's the view
of lice evolution that I just told you

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:17.510
about. Going back as far as the gorilla
lineage. Gorilla lineage branched off

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:21.000
before the chimpanzee and the human
lineages. If we start with the gorilla

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.080
lineage, we have a common ancestor,
gorillas, chimps, and humans. The gorilla

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.790
lineage branches off that leads to the
evolution of gorilla louse. Chimp lineage

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.760
branches off, that leads to the
differentiation of chimp lice and the

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.680
origin of all human lice. We then have
loss of body hair, that leads to the

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.280
origin of the pubic louse and finally, we
have clothing and that leads to the origin

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.750
of the body louse separate from the head
louse. That looks all very reasonable,

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:54.280
however, the complication is that the
taxonomy, classical taxonomy, of lice does

00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:01.590
not agree with this. The classical
taxonomy looks at things this way. Body

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.860
louse, in the genus pediculus as I told
you, as is the head louse, as is the

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.690
chimpanzee louse, but the pubic louse is
put into a different genus by the

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:19.290
taxonomists, the genus phthirus. That is
the same genus as the gorilla louse. I

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:25.390
will refrain from any speculation as to
how humans might have gotten pubic lice

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:31.560
from gorillas, but one possibility is that
the taxonomy based on morphology is wrong.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.400
There are many examples we know where
taxonomy based on morphology differs from

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.770
that based on the DNA.
Clearly, what we need is DNA evidence to

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:44.820
see what's going on here and we also need
DNA from gorilla lice to see what's going

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.490
on here. David Reed's group at Florida did
just that and found out that lo and

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:55.480
behold, the taxonomy is recorded by the
DNA. You get the same picture from the

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:01.140
DNA. When did this divergence between
human public lice and gorilla lice occur?

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:07.430
About 3.3 million years ago. If you
believe that this colonization, this

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:13.170
transfer, from gorillas to humans would
have occurred only after humans would have

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:17.230
lost their body hair, which I think is
probably the most reasonable scenario,

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.790
then that would suggest that body hair
loss occurred relatively early on in human

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.800
evolution, not too long after the
divergence from the chimp lineage which

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.650
fits with some other ideas that people
have had about loss of body hair. It would

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:41.710
appear that our ancestors do have some
explaining to do with this. To conclude,

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.330
genetic analyses of head and body lice do
indicate that clothing became important

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.500
somewhere around 70,000 years ago, seems
to coincide with the expansion of modern

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.440
humans out of Africa, maybe had something
to do with that expansion. Genetic

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.890
analyses of pubic lice suggest our
ancestors had lost their body hair by

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.260
roughly 3, 3.3 million years ago, not so
long after the divergence from

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.940
chimpanzees, so it was relatively early
on. On with the acknowledgments, I

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.500
especially want to single out Ralf
Kittler, Manfred Kayser, the two people in

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.270
my group who did the work we've done on
lice, and all these other people for

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:17.600
contributing samples not necessarily their
own lice samples of course. And the Max

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.532

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.480
- [Christopher] I'm going to start with a
family photo. This is my niece, Allison.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:43.320
She's about seven years old. And this is
also my niece, Allison, right after birth.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.050
So what's going on here? There's something
very unusual about our species, right? We

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:52.650
take it for granted that our newborns come
out with a very large amount of body fat

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.480
under the skin, or subcutaneous fat. We
even have a name for it; baby fat, and we

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.710
consider it a mark of health. But this is
actually a very unusual characteristic. If

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.840
you look across other species, like
gorilla for instance, they come out

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:10.340
skinny. Here's a baboon, also very skinny.
Almost 20 years ago, I compiled all the

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.240
information I could about body fat and
newborns, and published a paper

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.470
on it. And this is what I found. These
species here, as you can see, are all

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.790
about 3% body fat or less at birth. And
this includes species like elephant,

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:28.410
seals, black bear, pigs, so typical
mammals. Over here you have harp seals,

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:32.580
guinea pigs, and the very fattest species
that I could find evidence for was us, at

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.820
about 15% body fat. Now preparing for this
talk, I went into the literature and tried

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.750
to find any more data points that had been
published, especially on primates. Notice

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.220
here that the only primate that I could
find was a baboon, at about 3%. We have

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.270
some more data points now. We have
macaques, squirrel monkeys, another

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:52.810
species of macaques all have less than 3%.
Over here on the left you will see that

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.550
there is a new species that I found that
is actually a little bit fatter than us,

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.430
it seems. But there are only two
individuals in that sample and they are

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:03.200
clinical. They are a clinical sample, not
a wild sample. We will see how that shakes

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.700
out, but it really does not fundamentally
change the story. It is pretty clear that

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.280
this is an unusual characteristic for us.
We are born with a lot of body fat and not

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.710
only that... Look at body fat development
post-natally. What this shows is skinfold

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.430
thickness. This is how you measure the
thickness of the subcutaneous fat. You

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.200
take a skinfold and you literally measure
it with a caliper.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.600
This is the average here, this red line,
within the population. You see that we are

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.680
born with a lot of fat, but then right
after birth we put lots of calories into

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.450
putting on more fat. Our fat actually
peaks out during the first year of life.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.540
And then it declines until that very low
point that I showed you earlier, in mid

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.610
childhood. The question that I want to
pose today is, why are our newborns so

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:49.760
unusually fat and yet our children are so
lean? Before getting into this, I want to

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.660
dispel one myth that you will find out
there. If you look at old pediatrics text

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.330
books, there is this idea that yes, this
is an unusual characteristic for our

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:03.110
species. Perhaps it is insulation because
we lost hair. We lost our hair and we need

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:07.060
this insulatory layer of blubber to
compensate for that. There is a lot of

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.800
evidence against that. Sounds like a neat
idea, but we don't have any evidence that

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.730
humans preferentially deposit fat under
the skin. What happens is the more fat you

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.020
put on the more fat you get under the
skin. It is a good place to put it. There

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.190
is nothing that suggests that we have
anatomically adapted ourselves for that

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:27.980
kind of insulatory layer. There are human
populations that live in the high Arctic,

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:33.990
places like Alaska and so forth, where you
see biological adaptations to conserve

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.930
heat. You see shorter limbs and you see
shorter stature. What this does is it

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:43.960
reduces skin surface area and reduces heat
loss. In this populations you see no

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.750
evidence for thicker skin folds, in fact
they tend to have slightly thinner skin

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:54.660
folds than the temperate populations.
Finally, you can look at newborns and see

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.970
studies that have done this to try to
figure out what it is that predicts

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.940
thermal stability. It is not the skin fold
thicknesses that matter. It seems to be

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.880
the muscle mass, which is where the heat's
being generated. I didn't find a lot of

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.500
evidence to support this idea that this
excessive amount of subcutaneous fat,

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.760
especially in our newborns, is related to
insulation. So I've proposed a different

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.670
idea, a competing idea. The key to
understanding our unusually fat babies may

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.520
lie in another unique human trait, our
unusually large and energetically costly

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.820
brains.
The idea here is that if you have a large

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.060
and energetically costly brain, you're
going to need, effectively, a bigger

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:36.670
battery to back it up during a period of
shortage. That's the idea I want to dig

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:40.110
into today. We're going to explore, we're
going to talk a bit about the human brain,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.820
its energetic costs, and why we need a
bigger energy backup. Then I'm going to

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.190
tell you about some new work that some
collaborators and I published last year

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:52.850
that quantifies the cost of the brain
across the life cycle, from birth onward.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.770
Finally, we're going to bring all this
together with some other information and

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.930
try to make sense of this pattern of fat
development that we see in humans. Let's

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:03.160
start with this first point. We're a
brainy species. The last four million

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.820
years, as you see here, you see a lot of
increase in brain size. As I've already

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.200
alluded to, this is important
energetically because brain is costly

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:18.060
tissue. A gram of adult brain uses about
15 times the energy of a gram of muscle.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.030
All of you sitting here right now are
adults, your body is putting off heat at

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:26.450
about 100 watts. That's the amount of heat
you're generating, warming up the room.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:31.610
Twenty of those watts or 20% of your
resting metabolic rate is accounted for by

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:35.610
the brain. That may not seem that
impressive. It may even seem a little dim,

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.780
but if you compare us to other species,
you'll see that that's actually pretty

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.880
remarkable. All these species up here are
in the order of 2 to 3% of resting

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.110
metabolic rate goes to the brain. Here you
see there's a couple primate species,

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:55.680
spider monkeys and chimpanzees, at about
10%, and then human adults are at 20%. If

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.810
you look at a newborn of course, the size
of the head is so much larger compared to

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:03.620
the body, so that number is going to be a
lot bigger in the newborn. Sure enough, in

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.540
the old literature, the estimate had been
that 60% of the resting metabolism is

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.410
necessary just to keep the brain going.
This is important. It's not only just

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:18.480
costly, but it has other ramifications,
because unlike other tissues and organs

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.850
you can't turn the brain down. You can't
dim it. Let's say that you're starving or

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:26.490
under nutritional stress, the brain has a
constant metallic rate whether you're

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:31.600
sleeping, active, what have you. It has to
be maintained. Without access to that

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.250
energy you get brain damage.
Naturally, it makes sense that we need to

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.410
have a bigger energy backup. You can think
of an analogy from day to day life that I

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.060
think illustrates this. That would be a
mortgage. Every month, if you have a house

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.480
and you have a house mortgage, you have to
pay that mortgage. If you don't you have

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.660
to foreclose. If you lose your job, you'd
better have money in your savings account

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.440
in order to cover that mortgage for the
period you are unemployed. The bigger your

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.460
mortgage, the bigger the savings account
you're going to

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.780
need to have to avoid a foreclosure. It's
the same sort of logic. Effectively, our

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:11.090
newborns have a mortgage that accounts for
60% of their budget, so they need to have

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:16.980
a very big savings account. Maybe this
gives us some insights into what's going

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.430
on at birth, but we also have to
understand why we become so lean by

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.470
childhood. We set up both of this
problems. Maybe it's the change in the

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:28.290
size of that mortgage that matters. Let's
go ahead and start to look at that. What

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:32.340
this shows here is the percentage of body
weight that's accounted for by the brain

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:38.210
at different ages in humans. At birth, as
you can see, it's about 12% of body

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:47.640
weight. Then it declines as that ratio of
brain size to body size also declines.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.470
Perhaps we need this big energy buffer
back here because our brains really

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:55.180
dominate the budget, but down here less
so. Maybe that's what's going on.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.060
Unfortunately, it's not that simple
because all we're looking at in that last

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.950
graph is the size of the brain. There are
other factors to take into account. Energy

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.970
used by a gram of brain is actually very
dynamic very development and this relates

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:11.560
to the high cost of learning during
childhood. What makes the brain costly is

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:16.470
synapses, that is, the connections between
nerves. The number of synapses changes

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:20.980
very dramatically. Let's take a look at
that. These are classic data on synaptic

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.530
densities. This is telling us how many
synapses there are, how many neural

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:28.730
connections there are within a gram of
brain. You can see that it goes way up

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:32.830
quickly after birth, peaks out during
childhood, and then it declines again.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:38.530
There's a process of pruning. This entire
period of very high synaptic connectivity

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:42.320
is all about learning during childhood.
What it means from our perspective is that

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.090
there's a need for energy to buoy that
excess neuronal activity. So how does one

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:52.380
go about measuring that energy? Well,
positron emission tomography imaging, PET

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:56.340
imaging, is one way you could do this.
This is what allows you to measure the

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:01.870
rate of glucose uptake in the brain. Harry
Chugani, in a classic paper from 1987 that

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:06.910
I'm showing here, did this in kids from
birth all the way up to adulthood. You can

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:11.130
see these folks over here on the right,
are the adults. So this dotted line is the

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:17.800
adult level of glucose uptake. At birth,
each gram of brain tissue is using about

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.760
30% less glucose than the adult brain.
That's because the synapses haven't

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.760
proliferated yet. Then by
childhood, it's actually twice the adult

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.040
rate, so it's much higher. Then you get
the pruning and it prunes down to the

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.690
adult level eventually. What we need to
really take into account what's going on

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:40.050
with the brain, is not just to account for
the size of the brain. But we also need to

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:44.870
take into account this changing energy
density, this changing energy use rate

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:49.910
related to learning. This is actually
something that I and my collaborators in

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:55.550
Northwestern University, at Wayne State,
and at George Washington University set

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.260
out to do. We published a paper on this
last year. I'm going to tell you what we

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.530
did, very quickly. We started with
Chugani's pet data, which I've already

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:06.960
shown you. That tells us how much glucose
each gram of brain is using. To get the

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.320
global cost of the brain, we need to know
how many grams of brain there are. For

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:17.770
that, we used brain volume data from MRI.
You do the numbers and you get total brain

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.090
energy cost. There are many more steps
involved, but that's a simplified version.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:27.070
When you do that, this is what we find.
This shows brain glucose uptake from birth

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.980
until 15 years of age. Fifteen years is
the last PET measurements, that's where we

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.530
stopped.
You can see that it peaks out at about

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.260
five years of age. It's higher in males
because they're just bigger. There's no

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.590
real biological difference there. There's
a remarkable story here. Brain glucose

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:46.970
uptake at five years of age is about twice
the adult level. You can see this dotted

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:51.890
line here. Their brains are using twice
the energy of the adult brain, despite the

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:56.860
fact that their brains haven't fully
reached adult size yet, and despite the

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.300
fact that their bodies are one-third the
size. This is a remarkable burden on their

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.690
bodies, energetically. That's what we want
to take into account. Let's look at the

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.970
next step here. Instead of looking at
grams of glucose, let's consider brain

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:14.910
energetics as a fraction of the resting
metabolic rate, like we did earlier. When

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:19.620
we do it that way, we see that it's
peaking out at about four to five years of

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:25.820
age again. And at that point, two-thirds
of all resting calories are going to the

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.550
brain, which is pretty remarkable. This
leaves only one-third of the calories to

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:34.880
do everything else. So clearly, some other
functions must have been short-changed in

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:39.210
us. One of those functions that did get
short-changed, it looks like, was body

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:44.450
weight growth. What this shows here is the
rate of body weight gain. As we all know,

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:49.060
infants grow very quickly, and then the
rate of weight gain slows down. They start

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.280
to grow quite slowly by age five or so, or
during childhood. You almost don't see

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.380
them growing. You notice their development
but you don't see them getting bigger and

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:02.650
bigger. Then, gradually, weight gain takes
off again with puberty. Let's superimpose

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.860
the brain energetics curve on that.
There's pretty clearly a nice relationship

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.490
between these two. As the brain becomes
increasingly costly, because of brain

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:16.480
growth and the proliferation of those
costly synapses, body weight growth is

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.830
going down. When the brain is at its most
costly, body weight growth is at its

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.890
lowest. And then it reverses with puberty.
So clearly, there is something very

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:28.610
interesting going on here. It looks like
one of the ways that we were able to

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:33.480
support these very high energetic costs
related to brain development is by taking

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.740
calories that would have gone into growth
and putting them into the brain. So we're

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.270
kind of subsidizing that.
One of the things that suffers from that

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:46.040
is fat stores. That's why we have such low
adiposity during this era, because we're

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.040
basically shutting down growth and we're
shutting down fat deposition. This leads

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.370
to a bit of a paradox in what would appear
to be a challenge for a hypothesis. We've

00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:00.950
got the age of lowest energy reserves,
when our savings account is at its lowest,

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.400
coinciding with the age when our mortgage
is at its highest. This looks very

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.650
precarious. Doesn't this potentially pose
a problem for a hypothesis? If baby fat is

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.520
a brain battery, how can body fat reach
its lowest level at the age when the

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.920
brain's energy needs are greatest. The
answer is, you don't necessarily need a

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.230
large savings account if you've got
wealthy relatives and friends who are

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:28.770
willing to lend to you. That's what goes
on. Let's take a look at this. As children

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.360
grow and develop they shift from relying
on their onboard energy buffer, their body

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.060
fat, to social buffering. The
effectiveness of social buffering

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.780
increases and as that happens, the
reliance on body fat goes down. We're

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.270
going to take a look at this. Let's start
early on, when there's this high reliance

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.050
on body fat as we've already talked about.
Why do we rely on body fat early? The

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:52.860
reason is this; because of the cause of
nutritional stress. Early in life, the

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.780
main causes of nutritional stress are
infectious disease. Forget about the

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:02.540
common cold. Think about environments that
are less sanitized than ours. Infections

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.290
can be quite severe. This is really the
cause of, for instance, under-five

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:09.070
mortality, infant mortality. It's all
about under nutrition and most of it is

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.220
driven by infection. It's easy to see why.
Kids when they get sick, they get

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:20.270
anorexia. They stop eating. Diarrheal
diseases are very common in infancy. This

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:24.230
impairs digestion. Your parents and your
caregivers can have all the calories and

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.770
the food in the world, but if you stop
eating and you don't digest, you're not

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:31.660
going to get access to them. Which forces
you to go internal and rely on your on

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.710
onboard energy reserves. That's really the
only strategy that you have.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:39.500
Add on top of this, fever that actually
increases your energy expenditure and sort

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.580
of makes the whole thing worse. That's the
point. The common symptoms related to

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.670
infections, cut the baby off from
caregivers and force a reliance internally

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:55.570
on their own battery. Here we see the age
trends in diarrheal illness, globally. And

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.220
you see that it really peaks out in late
infancy and the second half of the first

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:02.860
year. This coincides with weaning and the
introductions of foods that are often not

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:08.420
sterile. Newborns are born without
antibodies which is why they get sick so

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.900
much. Every time they get sick, they
acquire antibodies and they become more

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:16.590
and more protected moving forward. As
infants age, they acquire these protective

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:21.110
antibodies, and the infections then
plummet. They're really not a problem by

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:26.020
four to five years of age, or not as much.
As those infections go down, they're no

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:30.070
longer being cut off from their caregivers
and they can start to benefit from the

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:33.750
unique features of the way we raise our
kids. I'm going to talk about that. It'll

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:38.780
be the last point we talk about. If we
look at other mammals, food comes from the

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.950
mother, breast milk. Eventually you get
weaned and you self-provision. In our

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:47.060
species, fathers are a part of the
picture, both in terms of provisioning and

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.240
care, but there's a whole cast of other
characters. This is something fairly

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.210
unique to us. We're considered cooperative
breeding species because many individuals

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:59.570
are involved in raising our kids.
Importantly, those human caregivers, in

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.380
turn, are embedded with the networks based
on cooperation and food sharing. Let's

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.950
take a look at this. Here's an example
where there are four hunters that are not

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:11.120
sharing. The second individual down has a
kill and the others don't, so they go

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.770
hungry. On this day, the first individual
has a kill, but the others go hungry, and

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:20.710
so on. It's kind of a feast/famine
scenario. Here's the same scenario where

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:24.260
this individual shares with other folks
under the assumption that they're going to

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:31.260
share with him when they have a kill. In
this kind of system, with food sharing,

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:35.000
everybody gets to eat every day. You don't
have the feast/famine. This is what we do.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.860
If you look at data from hunter/gatherer
societies like the Hiwi and the Ache from

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:44.400
lowland Amazon in South America, this
shows the number of families that receive

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:50.140
part of the kill. This is very common.
Food flows between families. Here's an

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:55.240
other interesting study that was done
among the Hadza. Here, the individuals

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.900
were given honey sticks. There was an
economic game and the researchers

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.330
evaluated how honey flowed through the
society. As you can see, it's flowing all

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:09.010
over the place to both genetic kin, to
in-laws and to friends. If somebody up

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:14.260
here comes up short one day, there's going
to be food coming from elsewhere. Our

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.920
caregivers, there are not only multiple
caregivers taking care of our kids, but

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.330
they're embedded in these networks of
cooperation of food sharing which buffer.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:25.160
It's for this reason, I think, that we can
go out on a limb as children. Our children

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.580
go way out on a limb, because they're
maxing out the size of their mortgage at a

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.660
point when the have a minimal savings
account. They can do it because they're

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:38.640
embedded within those networks. To
summarize and come back to where I began,

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.350
our babies are born with a lot of fat. The
reasons for this are that they have

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:49.700
extremely high energy requirements for
their brains that are fragile, combined

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.630
with the fact that the primary cause of
nutritional stress at this age is

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:57.000
infection, which cuts them off from
caregivers and forces a reliance on

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.850
internal stores. The situation's very
different by childhood. The brain is even

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:05.110
more costly, but now they're embedded
within, and benefit from that social

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:09.950
buffering that's so effective. They no
longer need to put those calories away in

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:13.420
a savings account. They can use them for
things that matter at this age; learning

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.404
and child development. That's all. Thanks.
