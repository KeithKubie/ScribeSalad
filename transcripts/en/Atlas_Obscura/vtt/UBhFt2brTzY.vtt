00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.570
- There was a guy playing
here at the Sip 'n Dip

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.610
and he decided he wanted to
go on a vacation, so he came

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.723
and asked me if I would
play his two-week vacation,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.320
and his two-week vacation
ended and he didn't come back.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.153
He blew town.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.040
And I've been here ever since,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.923
for 56 years.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.303
Oh, I love Montana.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.510
They come from all over the world,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.830
and they say that they
don't know of a state

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.010
where people are any friendlier.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.670
They're strangers when
they walk into the bar.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.070
Before they know it, everybody's
talking to everybody else

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.730
and visiting, and they
haven't even known each other,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.770
you know, but...

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.697
I play everything.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.083
I'm an Elvis freak,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:10.500
and people have a fetish for Johnny Cash,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.903
and so I do two, three from him.

00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:17.440
But nothing new lately,
because my eyes have gone bad

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.390
and I can't read my music anymore,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.763
so mostly from memory.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.740
The old boy up above,
he's been good to me,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.500
giving me my health and
letting these fingers work,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.150
that I, you know, didn't get arthritis.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.050
When I started, I worked
six nights a week.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.440
The guy that built it,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.695
he went all over,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:46.990
to islands, and got all
kinds of statues and stuff

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.620
and that's why the lounge is what it is.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.913
How it got popular, we don't know.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.218
They're trying to make a
celebrity out of me at my age.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.794
God, I walk in a store and
then some guy will recognize,

00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:07.870
"There's Piano Pat," you know.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.237
I have to have my picture
taken with them all.

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:13.080
You know. It goes on, and on, and on.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.460
I don't know how real movie stars do it,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.233
because it's a drag.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.708
It is.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.330
If it happened when I was
younger, eh, you know,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.100
but, it's just what can happen in life.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.350
You don't know.

00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:34.331
- So 10?

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.899
- 10. There's 10 merpeople.

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:36.732
- Yes.

00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:38.899
- So we have 10 merpeople.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.910
- [Belle] My day job is,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.090
I'm a LPN at the local hospital.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.996
My friends are always the ones

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:01.783
that are saying, "She's a mermaid."

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:02.616
- [Saoirse] Mm-hmm.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.557
- [Belle] And I'm like,
"Okay, let me get my phone out

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:06.430
and show you the photos,"
'cause they're like,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.263
"No you're not." Like,
"I don't believe you."

00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:11.380
- [Saoirse] Yeah. Yeah, I
work at the university here in

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.890
Great Falls. I'm the assistant registrar,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.050
so at our commencement, there
was a family from out of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.680
of town discussing, like,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.250
this place where you can go see mermaids.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.960
And so my boss snuck in

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.070
and was like, "We have
our very own mermaid,"

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.240
and they're like, "Oh my god!"

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.450
And I'm just like, "Hi, yeah."

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.697
- [Belle] Makes you more unique.

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:33.520
- [Saoirse] Mm-hmm.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.080
- [Belle] Makes things go quicker.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.980
- [Saoirse] Yeah, my husband's in the Army

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.270
and he lives in Texas,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.600
so I got a nine-month
deployment to get through,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.580
and you had a six-month?

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.350
- [Belle] Yes, uh, this kinda
just fills the extra void

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.650
when they're gone, and lets you get out

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.213
of your shell a little bit.

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.050
[Saoirse] Mm-hmm.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.773
When I swim, I feel more beautiful.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.960
Putting on the wig and the lipstick,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.143
and the tail, you know, just kinda,

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.318
you get to be someone that you aren't.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.241
- [Saoirse] When you get the
compliments people telling you,

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.570
"You look so graceful, it's
so natural, it's so pretty,"

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.890
it's nice and it's kinda humbling

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.090
that you can do something

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.830
that, you know, not a lot of
people can, and you didn't

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.830
really know you could do
until you started this job.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.160
- [Pat] I had a kid in his
twenties not too long ago

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.650
and he says, "Well who's
going to play when you,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.650
you..." You know, I
mean, he can see I'm 84.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.453
He says, "Well, you better
start teaching somebody.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860
You better give them lessons."
