00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.911
Thank you very much.

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.410
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for joining us.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.202
ROGER L. MARTIN:
It's a pleasure.

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:26.160
SPEAKER 1: So I'd like
to begin by asking you--

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.390
so you developed the
theory of integrative

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.410
thinking 15 years ago.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.710
How did the idea
come to you, and what

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.284
is it, in its simplest form?

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:36.200
ROGER L. MARTIN: Sure.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.780
Well, in its simplest
form, it is the notion

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.920
that when you're faced with
an either/or choice, where

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.440
it seems like you can only
do one or the other thing,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.340
what I found is that highly,
highly successful leaders take

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.540
that as a sign that they
shouldn't choose or compromise.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.670
It's their job,
their leaderly job

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.740
to come up with a better answer.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.510
And the way I got interested
in it was I was really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.720
interested-- you mentioned
Monitor Company--

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.570
and a bunch of business
school buddies--

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.239
myself, a couple of
professors-- thought the world

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.530
needed another consulting firm.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.410
And we sort of called
ourselves-- internally,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.900
we're sort of Young
Punks Consulting--

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.760
because all the
McKinsey and Bain

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.890
and BCG people were
much older than we were.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.920
And I was exploring the
question of why on earth

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.240
did clients hire us and for
what particular kinds of things?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.750
And what I found was
that they hired us

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.940
for that sort of problem--

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.440
was when they were facing kind
of a big either/or choice.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.560
It wasn't like-- we need
to improve our marketing,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.390
or we need a sort of ploy--

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.480
we could do this or
we could do that,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.080
and we're a bit flummoxed.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.530
And so I just started
observing how they thought

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.900
and how the most
successful of them

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.180
thought and came
to this conclusion

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.070
that the only thing
I could figure out

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.020
that was consistent
across the really highly

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.640
successful leaders that I
interviewed was this one thing.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.050
And the tricky thing was I
first looked at what they did.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.781
And what I found is that there
was no commonality in what they

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.280
did.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.940
And it was because they had a
completely different context.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.400
So I interviewed all these
highly successful leaders--

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.370
you know, Jack Welch and
Michael Dell and Bob Young,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.720
and you know, Issy Sharp,
founder of Four Seasons,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.480
et cetera.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.390
And I couldn't
figure out something

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.320
that they did that was
similar, but I realized

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.740
it was so context
specific-- and Jack Welch

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.490
was an interesting one
for me, because early

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.050
on in Jack Welch's
time as CEO of G.E.,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.012
he said to all
businesses, unless you're

00:03:51.012 --> 00:03:53.470
really big, unless you're a
number one or two market share,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.200
I'm going to divest you.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.940
And they all thought he was
fooling, because it never

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.940
happened in the history of G.E.
And he divested about a third

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.320
of the portfolio.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.170
But then later on in
his long tenure as CEO,

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.890
he basically told his
businesses the opposite,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.720
which is be small.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.260
He said, do not come to your
strategy review with me,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.170
defining yourself as any
bigger than 15% of your market.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.235
And you could ask why?

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:25.210
So those are, like,
the opposite--

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.545
define yourself as small
or define yourself as big.

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:31.970
And the reason, of
course, is early on,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.920
he had the problem of having a
really messy portfolio that he

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.389
needed to clean up.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.930
Later on, he was
worried about growth

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.384
and was tired of
the jet aircraft

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:41.800
people coming in
and saying, Jack,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.450
we've got 70% market
share already,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.990
there's no growth, there.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.340
He said, yeah, that might be of
building and selling engines,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.650
but if you add in leasing,
sales, repair, trading,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.770
all of that, you've
got a 5% share, shut up

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.320
and get back to work.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.660
So because there
wasn't a pattern

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.180
of doing something
similar, I started asking,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.950
is there a thinking pattern?

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.420
And I started asking him
what are the five hardest

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.670
decisions you've ever
made in your life

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.950
and came to the conclusion
that what made them successful

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.180
was not accepting trade-offs,
just refusing, and saying

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.042
there's got to be a better way.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.750
SPEAKER 1: And then
so, 10 years ago, you

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.960
wrote the "Opposable Mind."

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.930
What was the idea of that book?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.520
ROGER L. MARTIN: It was to
describe that phenomenon

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.040
and give examples of
highly successful leaders

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.020
who faced what appeared
to everybody else

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.360
to be an either/or choice, and
they did something different.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.940
So when related to the world
you're in, Bob Young Co-Founder

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.850
of Red Hat, dominant
Linux software,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.120
he faced a challenge of--

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.890
there's two things I could do--

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.590
free software, which is
what he started in Red

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.830
Hat or proprietary software.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.670
And he liked how much money
proprietary software companies,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.060
like Microsoft,
made, but he hated

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.730
the fact they wouldn't give
the customer the source code,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.680
so it wasn't modifiable.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.500
He loved the free
software part of it,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.180
which was you give
them the source code,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.990
and they can do whatever
they want with it.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.429
He felt that was kind
of better for the world,

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:26.470
better for his customers.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.886
But he hated the fact that you
couldn't make a buck in it,

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.870
because anybody could put
together Linux compilations.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.190
And at that point,
the way you made

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.080
a business, in 1995, when
he was making this decision,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.980
was to sell shrink wrapped
discs for $15 by mail order.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.280
So what do you do--
free or proprietary?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.340
That was the choice he faced.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.560
Everybody else chose
free or proprietary.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.570
He said, I don't like that
and came to the conclusion

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.960
that out of the proprietary
model, what he loved

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.090
was service contracts.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.490
You could make a lot of money on
servicing the corporations that

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.870
used your software with
updates and version control

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.760
and all of that.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.740
And what he liked about
free was giving them

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.780
the source code,
that the clients,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.854
the customers could do
with it what they wished.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:25.020
He didn't actually like
selling shrink wrapped discs

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.950
at $15, mail order.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.680
And so as he thought
about it, he realized,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.070
actually, there could
be a way of getting

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.370
the thing I care most
about, about free,

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.067
and the thing I care most
about from proprietary,

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.650
which was his innovation, which
is just say, here's the deal--

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.649
I'm going to make this
the first software that's

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:46.834
downloadable, free
off the internet.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.250
We will get dominant
market share.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.280
We will be the
only Linux company

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.320
that big corporations
will trust,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.180
and we'll create a big
service business doing that.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.760
That would be the classic
kind of integrative thinking

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.240
kind of choice that I talked
about in the 2007 book.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.130
SPEAKER 1: So you've
expounded the Theory

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.680
of Integrative Thinking
in the "Opposable Mind."

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.640
What new value does "Creating
Great Choices" bring?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.500
ROGER L. MARTIN: It
explains more how.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.470
So what we got--

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.480
I mean, the 2007 one ended
up being a nice bestseller,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.070
and that was all
great, and everybody

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.800
said, wow that's, great, that
gives me sort of hope that I

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.580
can do something better.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.400
But people struggled with--

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.990
well, exactly, Roger,
how do you do that?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:38.740
And we spent 10 years, after
figuring out what they did,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.950
experimenting with how you could
teach somebody how to do it.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.630
How exactly did
they do it, and how

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.450
could somebody, who might not
naturally be great at this

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.550
or have experience
in this, could do it.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.170
So the "Creating Great Choices"
is the distillation of 10

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.510
years' worth of
experience in the how.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.630
So it's more like
a manual that says,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.130
if you want to do
this thing, if you

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.460
buy the premise of
the "Opposable Mind,"

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.694
and you want to do this
thing, here's how you do it.

00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:07.360
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.620
It's very, much a how to
think methodology of thinking.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.720
Why do you think
that's necessary?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.450
ROGER L. MARTIN:
Well, you know, I

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.610
probably got smacked on
the head enough times

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.470
by my most beloved
academic mentor.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.069
His name is Chris Argyris.

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:24.610
He passed away a
couple of years ago,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.760
after a long,
almost 90-year life.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.660
What he would say to me, when
I worked with him, was Roger,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.940
action upon which
you cannot take--

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.240
knowledge upon which you cannot
take action is barely worth

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.740
having at all.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.730
And what he said, his criticism
of much managerial advice,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.110
is the moral equivalent to grow
taller, be smarter, whatever.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.930
And everybody is like, I'm
as tall as I can be, I've

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.700
been trying as hard as I can.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.580
You know-- think harder-- well,
I'm thinking as hard as I can--

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.210
all of that is not helpful.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.050
So I have sort of
a high bar myself

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.310
for unless somebody can walk
away and do the thing I've

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.160
told them to do, I might
as well not have told them

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.981
in the first place.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:07.980
It's just an irritation.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.950
They'll get their hopes
up and be unable to do it.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.410
And so that was the inspiration.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.630
When people said,
I love this, Roger,

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.100
I love the examples you
give, and I love that goal.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.460
How do I do it?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.559
SPEAKER 1: So if we look
at companies, today,

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.975
the way they make
decisions, there

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:30.220
are certain best practices.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.240
What, in your
opinion, is lacking?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.840
ROGER L. MARTIN:
Yeah, I think most

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.040
of the best practices
in decision-making

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.150
are closer to worst practices
than best practices,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.440
to be honest.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.560
I mean, they are--

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.030
I think, people, in making
decisions, converge too quickly

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.260
on a solution that seems
fine, rather than choosing

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.900
a stepping back and
saying, I'm going

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.780
to strive for something better.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.320
I think a lot of
decision-making is--

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.740
dare I say, here, in
Googleplex, too analytical.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:17.170
Great decisions are
creative by their nature.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.712
And so I often
see people saying,

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.420
well, we've got a
decision to make, let's

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.790
crunch all the data in
order to make that decision.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.290
And what's the problem
with crunching data?

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.390
From what era is
100% of all data?

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.319
From what era?

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.110
AUDIENCE: The past.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.620
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yeah, the past.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.240
So can you crunch data
to figure out something

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.710
that has never happened before?

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.936
Can you?

00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:50.570
You know, like, no.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.440
In fact, if you crunch
data from the past,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.810
you will convince yourself
the future will be

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.060
an extrapolation of the past.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.060
And I'm not, like, the clever
guy who thought this up, right?

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.100
Aristotle is the man, in
the 4th century B.C., who

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.270
explained this to the world.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.220
And the world has largely
ignored Aristotle.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.070
So he explained that there
are two parts of the world.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.670
In one part of the world, things
cannot be other than they are,

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.680
is what he said.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.570
So if I fall off this chair.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.720
I won't fall up, I'll fall down.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.445
And even if I do that 1
million times, I'll fall down.

00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:32.820
That's the part of the world
where things cannot be other

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.524
than they are.

00:12:34.524 --> 00:12:36.190
And he said, in that
part of the world--

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.740
he invented the
scientific method.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.990
It was formalized 2,000
years later in the Scientific

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.600
Revolution by Descartes and
Bacon and Newton and Galileo,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.710
but he laid out-- here's how
you use science to demonstrate.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.740
He said the unqualified purpose
of science is to demonstrate

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.780
that things cannot be
other than they are.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.100
So he laid that out.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.000
And he said, if you're dealing
with the part of the world

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.240
where things cannot be
other than they are,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.900
be scientific and analyze
the hell out of it.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.552
That's rigor.

00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:08.010
But he said, there's another
part of the world where things

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.290
can be other than they are,
like, consumers have never

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.430
ever used one of the devices
that's in everybody's hands,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.120
as of 1998, right?

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.160
And now, they can't
live without them.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.100
Well, that's the part of the
world where things can be other

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.270
than they are.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.400
And you know, what the
world's first scientists

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.399
and the most important
scientists in the history

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.140
of the planet said?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.115
In that part of the
world, do not use science.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.272
Do not.

00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:41.730
He said, in that
part of the world,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.467
rigor means imagining
possibilities and choosing

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:47.550
the one for which the most
compelling argument can

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.150
be made.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.470
The world listened to
Aristotle about science

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.260
and then ignored his warning
about the limitations

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.970
of science.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.860
So the biggest complaint--

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.140
I mean, there are exceptions--

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.440
Google, Apple,
Facebook, Amazon--

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.220
but the biggest complaint of
Fortune 500 CEOs, now, is--

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.900
I can't find enough organic
growth, that's my big problem,

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.370
and I'm more worried about
two kids in a garage who

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.610
I don't even know exist yet
than I am but my biggest

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.730
competitor across the street.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.430
That, in my view,
is not uncorrelated

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.520
with, over the last
50 years, management

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.980
becoming science and
analysis obsessed.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.350
Because if you're
science obsessed,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.470
and you're crunching data about
the past, it will tell you

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.290
a new thing can't
happen and won't happen.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.100
The data shows that it won't.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.680
Then two kids in a garage
go and make it happen,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.810
or two kids in a PhD program
at Stanford make it happen.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.417
And then all the
companies that were

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:02.500
sure it couldn't happen,
because science told them

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.086
it couldn't, are wondering, what
the hell just happened, here?

00:15:07.086 --> 00:15:09.460
Right, like all advertisers
other than Google or Facebook

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.940
are wondering, like, you
know, what happened here?

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.940
Their analysis showed
that what's happening here

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.640
could not happen.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.330
So that's a bit of
a rant, but that's

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.290
my number one problem with
management's decision-making

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.290
in the modern world--
it undervalues

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.750
imagination and then wonders
why it doesn't come up

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.157
with new ideas?

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:34.740
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I just want to
pursue that tangent, actually.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.656
ROGER L. MARTIN: Sure.

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:38.250
SPEAKER 1: It sounds like you
have a very polymathic way

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.580
of thinking about business.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.980
Where does that stem from?

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.480
ROGER L. MARTIN: I
mean, I've always

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.360
been accused of being a sort
of business philosopher.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.870
So maybe it's just,
I guess I've always

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:54.060
wanted to understand
why business works

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.060
and how to understand
aspects about business

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:04.210
that aren't readily understood
or are confusing to people.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.340
So for instance, this one came
out of me trying to answer

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.730
the question of why all
these CEOs who I work with--

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.400
because I worked with a whole
bunch of big company CEOs--

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.270
saying Roger, we're
spending more on innovation

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.550
and getting less, I can't figure
this out, what's happening?

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.200
And then these
people who don't have

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.170
anywhere close to the
resources we have are producing

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.020
more innovation than we are.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:37.590
So I try to figure out
mysteries and give people

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.030
better ways of thinking about
the mysteries of business life.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:47.700
And it turns out, I think, that
to figure those things out,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.140
you typically have to step
outside the strictures

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.790
and frameworks that
you've been taught.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.970
So if I tried to solve the
problems of the business people

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.801
who I deal with by applying what
I learned at business school--

00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:06.300
and I went to a
perfectly good one--

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.815
I mean, they're all, lots
of them are good ones,

00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:10.440
but I went to Harvard
Business School--

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.930
and if I just applied what I
learned at Harvard Business

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.305
School to solve
these problems, I

00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:17.640
couldn't solve them, lots
of them, most of them.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.740
It's because what
it seems to require

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.839
is stepping outside
the strictures,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.839
because often the
strictures in question

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.280
created the problem
in the first place.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.415
So I guess, I mean--

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:29.290
it's a good question.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.260
Nobody's asked me that before.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.230
But that would be my
best guess at an answer.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.850
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank you.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.370
So when you were developing
the methodology for the book,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.050
did you come across
any surprises?

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.390
Or were there any
sort of aha moments?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.440
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yes.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.810
The biggest surprise, the
knock me over with a feather

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:52.710
surprise, was that
what I figured out

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.080
by studying all of
these integrative

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.010
solutions is that
none of them came

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.330
from the most commonly
used approach to creating

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.720
innovation.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.070
What kind of piece of
paper do you start out with

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.300
to get a real innovation?

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.820
What kind?

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.350
A blank one, right?

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.870
Get out a blank sheet of
paper, throw out everything

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.300
that you know, and
that'll give you the best

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.680
chance of an innovation.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.560
It's a cool theory.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.018
Like, it makes a whole lot of
sense-- you're unconstrained,

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.940
da da da, all that stuff.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.950
It turns out that in no case
of any highly successful leader

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.940
who came up with an integrative
decision that I studied--

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.700
doesn't mean they don't exist,
but I couldn't find one--

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.890
actually came about their
innovative breakthrough

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.420
idea from a blank
sheet of paper.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.980
They came to it by
mining opposing models.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.990
So Bob Young would say, I needed
to have a true understanding

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.510
of the free software
model, as it existed

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.600
in 1995, and a
real understanding

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.020
of the proprietary model
and why it was successful,

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.400
to come up with a solution.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.746
And that solution-- as
I say, my definition

00:19:09.746 --> 00:19:11.120
of integrative
thinking is-- when

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.990
faced with opposing
models, you come up

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.060
with a creative
resolution of the tension

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.580
in the form of a model that
contains elements of each,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.852
but is superior to both.

00:19:20.852 --> 00:19:23.060
And so that-- you could
knock me over with a feather.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.420
Because up till the time when
that became evident to me,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.620
you know, I just
said, hm, interesting,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.050
I was in the camp of--

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.170
to free yourself up
and be more innovative,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.100
you take a blank sheet of paper.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.750
Now, instead, what I say is
you have to fall in love,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.015
absolutely fall in love with
the two models, sequentially.

00:19:46.015 --> 00:19:48.140
Fall in love with the first
one, and the cool thing

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.990
about the first
falling in love is--

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.780
what happens when you fall
in love with somebody?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.130
You accentuate all
their good things

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.980
and focus entirely
on their good things

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.620
and act as if nothing
else in the world exists.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.550
Do we all recognize this?

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.730
We've all fallen in love.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.790
OK, so it's cool.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.370
And so I say, do that,
because what matters is mining

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.434
each model for the good things.

00:20:17.434 --> 00:20:18.600
Forget about the bad things.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.512
Who cares about that?

00:20:19.512 --> 00:20:20.970
You don't want any
of them, anyway,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.490
so don't even think about them.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.060
Find good things, and
then forget about it.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.270
And fall in love, again,
with the other model

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.330
and figure out what are
the good things, there.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.510
And then figure out a clever
way to put them together.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.990
And in doing this,
what we learned,

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.470
just through trial and error,
is to push the models farther

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.500
apart to the absolute extremes.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.050
You know, so if you're going
to say, oh, we have a problem--

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.890
leadership development
in our company,

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.040
should we centralize
it all, right here,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.690
or decentralize it
around the world?

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.520
People would be
inclined to say, well

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.860
a more centralized or a
less centralized model,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.100
let's look at those two.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.980
No, no, no.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.280
Model one-- every
last single thing

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.980
and decision is made centrally.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.940
There is no central training
function, it doesn't exist,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.220
it is completely dispersed.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.230
If you do that, you
have a better chance,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.950
as it turns out, of coming up
with an integrative solution

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.020
than more sensible,
kind of sensible models,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.555
somewhere in between.

00:21:26.555 --> 00:21:28.680
And the reason is there's
not as many raw materials

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.917
in those
compromisey-type models.

00:21:30.917 --> 00:21:33.250
Because the enemy of integrative
thinking is compromise,

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.620
hate it, ugh, worst thing.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.440
Nobody's happy, everybody
is sort of, like,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.504
medium sad, right?

00:21:39.504 --> 00:21:41.670
Nobody's, like, super mad,
and nobody's super happy.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.450
I hate that.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.160
I want deliriousness.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.240
And then it turns out.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.500
So that was another thing
that was a surprising find.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.540
The other thing is
kids can do this.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:22:00.330
We had a great
Rotman grad who was

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.500
the sort of Academic Vice
Principal of a girls'

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.930
school, a girls' high school.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.740
And she said, you
know, we want to try

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.230
this integrative thinking
thing with our grade 10 girls.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.320
It was an IB school,
international baccalaureate

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:15.820
school.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.020
So in grade 11 and 12, you
do the two years of the IB.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.890
And so in grade 10, she said,
it would be a good thing

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.390
to do for grade 10 girls,
in the spring of grade 10

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.250
to be ready for grades 11 or 12.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.210
I said, OK.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.216
You know, I'm game
for anything--

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:34.215
taught them integrative
thinking, co-curricular.

00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:36.900
It was outside school
for non-credit.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.150
22 girls, they were
all keen on it.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.980
Gave them a project similar to
the project we gave the MBAs,

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.220
and their answers
were every bit as good

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.870
as the MBA answers, which that's
sort of-- whoa, wait a minute.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.400
So MBAs have at
least six more years

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.732
of formal education--
grade 11, grade 12,

00:22:58.732 --> 00:23:00.440
four years of undergrad,
and some of them

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.640
already have Master's or
PhDs before showing up,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.080
but a minimum of six.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.130
And they have 4 and 1/2
years of work experience.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.310
So 10 and 1/2 years,
a decade of life

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.190
experience, and
they're no better.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.180
So we must we must damage them
in ways we don't understand,

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.480
so that they have to recover
to get back to the same level.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.770
But that got me--

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.810
which I think is
absolutely the case--

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.300
and so we now have
a huge program

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.060
that's the apple of my eye.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.637
I think it's the most
important thing we do for K-12,

00:23:30.637 --> 00:23:32.970
and we teach integrative
thinking now to five-year-olds.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.780
We teach the content of that
book to kindergarten kids,

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.526
and they are great.

00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:41.017
So that was fun.

00:23:41.017 --> 00:23:41.850
Who'd have thunk it?

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.960
But they're great.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.530
They're as good as
graduate students.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.564
SPEAKER 1: So yeah,
it seems like when

00:23:49.564 --> 00:23:50.980
we seem to think
that there's only

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.080
two options, that's
something that's almost

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.705
conditioned rather than--

00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:56.530
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yes,
we're conditioned

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.410
to say a tough guy
or a tough gal,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.920
when faced with a big
choice like that knuckles

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.210
down and makes it.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.040
The kids haven't been
trained that yet.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.880
They sort of say, I don't like
that one or that one much.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.540
You know, and if
we say, well, here

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.665
would be a methodology for
getting to a better one.

00:24:12.665 --> 00:24:15.665
They're like, give it to
me, let's go, let's do it.

00:24:15.665 --> 00:24:20.260
Whereas MBAs, to a much
greater extent, are like--

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.710
in theory, that might
be nice, but it's

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.210
about making trade-offs.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.040
That's the job, tough job.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.765
The buck stops here.

00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:32.350
The interesting thing is all
these super highly successful

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:39.220
leaders basically
said a trade-off

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.080
is my signal to not choose.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.250
And Alfred Sloan, the legendary
guy who built General Motors

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.805
in the '20s, '30s, '40s--

00:24:48.805 --> 00:24:50.430
by far the biggest
company in the world

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.180
and the most successful
automotive company

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.780
in the world--

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.990
he has a great quote, where
he is quoted as saying--

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.930
And this is by Peter
Drucker, who studied him--

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.780
after a meeting, was,
"gentlemen"-- because they

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.040
were all gentlemen then--

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.110
"gentlemen, I see that
we've come to agreement

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.840
on this important
decision, I suggest

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.570
that we terminate the meeting
now and come back only

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:15.350
when we've had time to develop
some constructive debate."

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.970
So it made Alfred
Sloan, Jr., very worried

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.730
and nervous when all
of his executives

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.440
quickly came to a
solution, because he said,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.770
we probably haven't come
up with the best one yet.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:37.220
And that is easier for kids
to absorb than for adults

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.147
to absorb.

00:25:38.147 --> 00:25:39.980
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, so the
message is consensus

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.960
is actually a bad thing.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.490
And you make an
interesting point

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.640
in the book, where you say
that a different idea, even

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.305
if it's wrong, still has value.

00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:49.180
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.680
SPEAKER 1: Could you, maybe,
talk a little bit about that?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.880
ROGER L. MARTIN:
Yeah, I mean, what

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.520
I try to do now,
in my life, is even

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.270
when I think I've
got the right answer,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.380
I say, I've got to try and
come up with a different one,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.640
even if it's bad--

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.830
even if it turns out
to be a bad idea--

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.020
to see if there's
something I'm missing.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.810
If there's a component that I
could add to my model that is

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.590
kind of inconsistent
with my model-- like,

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.150
I wouldn't think
of it on my own--

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.635
but if I had this other
model, I might think about it.

00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:21.260
One of the examples
I use in the book--

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.134
it's the Toronto
International Film Festival,

00:26:23.134 --> 00:26:25.260
which is now the
most important--

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.010
largest dollar volume, more
deals done film festival

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.430
than any in the world.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.390
Piers Handling, the
Director of it loved,

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.181
loved the fact that it was a
very community-oriented film

00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:36.680
festival.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.810
Anybody in Toronto can
go and see the movies

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.070
during the film festival.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.860
Just all the movie
theaters open themselves up

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.730
to show these shows.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.110
You can buy tickets.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.490
It's very inclusive.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:50.770
There's no jury that decides
which is the best film.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.546
He loved, loved all of that.

00:26:53.546 --> 00:26:54.920
But the only thing
he didn't like

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.990
is that they almost
went broke every year.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.810
It was hard to be
sustainable with this model.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.560
And so he looked
at Cannes, which

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.260
is the absolute
extreme other model--

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.600
totally exclusive,
you can't go to Cannes

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.640
unless you are invited,
and it's because you're

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.260
a star, a director, a
producer, or the like.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.600
They show 15 or 20
movies, and there's

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.730
a jury that decides which is
the best film, which Piers says,

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.380
I hate that, it's so elitist,
it stands for exactly everything

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.210
that I stand against, et cetera.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.585
But he would be
the first to say,

00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:37.340
it's only when I studied
Cannes that I figured out

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.870
the secret to making TIFF--

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.300
which, when he took over was
the third best film festival

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.530
in Canada.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.100
Montreal was better, and
Banff was better-- out

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.140
in the mountains, so it is
an irrelevant, little film

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.240
festival.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.470
He said the one thing I love
is the sponsorship revenue

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.660
that they get from
the global buzz that

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.320
comes from having a
prize and having-- who's

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.090
going to win the Palme d'Or?

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.990
That brings everybody,
all the stars, there,

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.910
which brings the media, there.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.034
And they get all this buzz.

00:28:06.034 --> 00:28:08.420
And then everybody,
Evian or Crystal,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.180
wants to have a bottle
of their product in front

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.950
of every starlet when
they're interviewed,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.560
and it goes global.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.740
So he couldn't, he
would never have

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.190
been able to figure
out a clever solution.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:27.050
A clever solution,
for him, was what's

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.440
interesting about the Toronto
International Film Festival

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.040
to the industry?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.640
People have to
buy their tickets,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.480
and it's Toronto, which is,
whether you know it or not,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.840
is the most ethnically,
racially diverse city

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.360
on the face of the planet
of any consequential size.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.220
50% of people in the
greater Toronto area

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.230
have a foreign passport.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:54.730
America, the highest city in all
of America is New York at 20%.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.870
So it's sort of 2 and 1/2
times more diverse than that.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.230
So what is cool about the
Toronto International Film

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.340
Festival audience?

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.080
What is it?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.240
Leading global
indicator-- because people

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.640
have to buy their
tickets, and they're only

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.920
going to buy tickets
to movies that they're

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.530
interested in seeing, and
they are like a little bit

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:20.940
of an amalgam of the world.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.830
And so what's the
integrative solution?

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.480
People's Choice Award--
how's about this,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.020
we give everybody a
ballot who buys a ticket

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:36.470
and goes to a movie, and they
will decide, not some jury

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.800
of elites, what's the best film.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.770
And then that film is
probably going to do well.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:51.770
And so over the last 10 years,
the average global box office

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:57.250
of the Palme d'Or winner
in Cannes is $16 million.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.760
The average global box office
of a People's Choice Award

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.160
winner at TIFF is $200 million.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:10.680
And in those last 10
years, the TIFF films

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.970
have had 69 Oscar nominations,
winning 23 of them--

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.760
Cannes, 11 nominations,
winning 1, total,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.530
Oscar in the last decade.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.650
So what he came up
with was something

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.720
that made it so that Toronto
is the buzz-producing place,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.400
and all the sponsors
want to be there.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.430
And so it's awash
in money and success

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.450
by being even more-- see,
it's not a compromise,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.900
it's not a compromise-- he
made it even more inclusive.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.600
Not only do you get to go to
any movie you want or whatever,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:48.240
you, with your vote, helped to
be the global arbiter of taste.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.210
And whoever wins, now, the
TIFF award in September

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:57.900
is considered the Oscar
front-runner in the spring.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.250
But he couldn't have
come to that had he not

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.880
looked at the extreme model that
he did not want any part of--

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.411
not quite any part of, he
wanted one little part of--

00:31:10.411 --> 00:31:11.910
but he didn't know
what little part,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:17.430
until he fell in love with that
and said, how does that work?

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.580
So I'd say that to any
anybody here in the room.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.240
If there's that model that you
just, at a visceral level, say,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.240
I hate that model--

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.990
that's the opposite
of what I believe in--

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.830
take 15 minutes, 20
minutes, a half an hour,

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.070
to say, how does it
work, how does it

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.480
produce the outcome
it does, what

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.770
are the little causal
relationships that

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.570
produce that outcome,
is there anything

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.950
I can steal from that model?

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.050
So I may still hate the model--

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.020
Piers still really doesn't
like Cannes at all--

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.830
but boy, is he grateful to
Cannes for having given him

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.100
an insight that enabled him
to turn TIFF from nothing

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.482
to incredibly important.

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.690
SPEAKER 1: So I'd like to
go back to the methodology.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.080
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yes.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.830
SPEAKER 1: Could you
walk us through that?

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.790
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yeah,
so the methodology

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:11.180
is to first take
the opposing models

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.390
and push them to
extreme, then it's

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.770
to analyze how
those models work.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.005
And again, this is from
the mouths of babes,

00:32:22.005 --> 00:32:28.090
but the way we do it is
lay out how it works.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.090
So the film festival, how
does the film festival

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.480
work for the various actors,
the community, the industry,

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.010
the festival itself--

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.400
and figure out how
it works, what ways

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.140
does it produce the
benefits that it does?

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.640
And out of the
mouths of babes, one

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.320
of the kids we
were working with,

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.570
said, well this isn't
a pro-con chart,

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.760
this is pro-pro chart, huh?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.200
And so now, it's forever
the pro-pro chart.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.690
And then ask the
question-- and we lay out

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.520
three integrative
methodologies to find

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.870
an integrative solution.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.366
One we call that the
hidden gem, right,

00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:05.490
which is the Bob Young one.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.780
I just want one
thing out of this one

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.030
and one thing out of this one.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.410
I'll throw away everything
else, and that's

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:14.080
what will get me a solution.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.130
What we call double down,
which is what Piers did.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.970
How can you take one model
and push down harder on it

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.280
to get that one benefit you
want from the other model?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.270
So you keep that whole
model, but take it

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.290
to more of an extreme.

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.470
So he made it more
inclusive in a way

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.455
that got him the
benefit of the other.

00:33:33.455 --> 00:33:35.080
And then the third
is something we call

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.460
a decomposition, which is--

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.490
if you want to use A.G.
Lafley, kind of creating with

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.490
colleagues connect
and develop at P&amp;G--

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:49.080
you say, he was faced with
the do we either spend less

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.690
on innovation-- because we're
not profitable enough spending

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.170
like we are an innovation?

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.745
But then that will make
us less innovative.

00:33:55.745 --> 00:33:58.470
Do we spend more on innovation
and just say, it will come,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.930
it will be fine.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.890
That's an either/or.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.560
And he says, it feels
like an either/or,

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.690
when you think that
it's about innovation.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.750
And he decomposed it
and said, no, no, it's

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.290
about invention and
commercialization.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.830
And invention turns out to
have very little scale benefit.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.250
Being bigger doesn't make
you more inventive per dollar

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.270
spent.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.250
In fact, there is
more and more data

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.210
to suggest that it makes you
less, so something for Google

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.840
to think about.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.010
But commercialization is
heavily scale sensitive.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.920
If you're Proctor
and Gamble, you

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.320
can get 100% retail
distribution of something

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.920
almost immediately.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.580
And you know how to brand
it, and you can market it.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.489
And you get the best advertising
deals in the industry,

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.480
because you spend $10
billion in advertising.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.389
So what he said
is, if I decompose

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.820
the model into two pieces--

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.420
not innovation, but invention
and commercialization--

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.095
I can apply one model to
invention and one model

00:34:59.095 --> 00:34:59.970
to commercialization.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.230
And the invention model is--

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.604
I'm going to
connect and develop.

00:35:02.604 --> 00:35:06.450
I'm going to tap into the
whole world of little inventors

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.240
and be the best place for
them to sell their invention

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.387
or license their invention.

00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:11.970
That will double the
pipeline so we'll

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.470
have twice as much stuff going
through our commercialization

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:20.485
pipeline, and we'll dramatically
improve our innovation.

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.110
So that's the third,
the decomposition.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.290
So we say try each
of these vectors.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.810
Try and find a hidden gem.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.400
Try and find a double down.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.127
Try and find a way to
do a decomposition.

00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:33.210
And then the fourth step--

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.001
that's the third step--
and the fourth step

00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:36.420
is to prototype your idea.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.970
So we really believe
in sort of the design

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.040
and thinking-oriented
rapid prototyping,

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.830
because you're going to
be trying something new.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.380
And the tricky thing
about new things,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.540
when you have to use
imagination and all you

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.000
have is a compelling argument
is they can be wrong.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.354
And so it's better
to prototype them,

00:35:55.354 --> 00:35:57.020
and also, that way,
you can improve them

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.895
and make them better.

00:35:57.895 --> 00:36:00.780
So those would be
the four steps.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.960
Take the models to the
extreme, figure out--

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.100
do the pro-pro charts to figure
out how each of them work--

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.600
explore the three
pathways to integration,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.870
prototype your best
solution, and go.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.710
And my experience
is you can always

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.825
come up with a better
answer than either/or

00:36:19.825 --> 00:36:24.460
or just a plain vanilla,
ugh-I hate it, compromise.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.470
SPEAKER 1: So you
consult many Fortune

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.900
100 companies and probably
many other companies?

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.080
ROGER L. MARTIN: I do.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.080
SPEAKER 1: How is this
methodology received

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.132
when you approach them with it?

00:36:34.132 --> 00:36:36.340
ROGER L. MARTIN: You know,
it's received pretty well.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.430
I mean, several of
my big clients--

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.050
like Dow Jones 30 size clients--
are training people up on this

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:48.280
and saying, this is how we've
got to come up with and get

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.990
better answers.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.550
And to a certain
extent, this is how

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.270
we've got to deal with bigness.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.340
I mean, there is a challenge
to being big and still

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.037
being creative.

00:36:59.037 --> 00:37:00.370
And you guys would know it here.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:07.880
I mean, you know,
you have to, I think,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.390
go to more extreme
lengths to continue

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.102
a culture of creativity
as you get bigger.

00:37:13.102 --> 00:37:14.560
So a lot of these
big companies are

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.810
trying to figure out--
how can we make people,

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.710
on a daily basis, be
more, kind of, innovative,

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.499
more creative in their work, and
not just hive it off and say,

00:37:24.499 --> 00:37:26.290
you guys are going to
just run the machine,

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.665
and these few
people, over there,

00:37:27.665 --> 00:37:31.840
are going to be creative-- let's
have everybody be creative.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.350
And you're in sales, right?

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.420
No?

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.580
Sales is a daily,
integrative challenge, right?

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.640
You would like to sell them
the most standardized thing

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.550
for the highest margin, and they
want the most customized thing

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.990
for the lowest margin, right?

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.830
It's pretty much like, I
want it to be perfect for me,

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.410
and I don't want to
pay much for it, right?

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.260
So you've got an innovative
challenge every day.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:01.289
And you know, mediocre
salesmen, I would think,

00:38:01.289 --> 00:38:02.830
either are insistent--
you know, it's

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.246
going to be my way
or the highway.

00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:09.550
And so a bunch of customers say,
you know, I'll pick highway.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.110
And then you sell to some.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.350
Or you compromise, you
get somewhere on the line

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.970
in between those
two things you do.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.300
And the great salespeople
are the ones who say,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.870
here's a way to
get what you need

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:24.100
and to get what we need in
a creative, different way.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.660
So I'd rather have--

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:32.600
if I am a CEO, I'd rather have
my sales force be creative

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.809
and bring creativity to their
job every day than to say,

00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:38.600
they will be bog
standard, and they'll just

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.390
follow some formula, while I
have this small other group

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.400
over there doing
all the innovation.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.370
I'd rather have everybody
be innovating every day,

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:52.850
and this is a methodology for
everybody innovating every day.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:58.530
SPEAKER 1: So it seems to me
that this exercise is rather

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:04.100
a rigorous activity, a
sort of mental exertion.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.470
So how frequently do you use it?

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.470
How frequently
ought we to use it?

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.690
And is it something
that sort of becomes

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.310
more second nature over time?

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.560
ROGER L. MARTIN: It does it
does become second nature.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.650
There's no question it
does, but what I say is,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:25.340
is if you don't have
a hard choice, don't.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.870
Use as the-- it's like nature--

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.170
when you feel some pain,
nature's telling you,

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.930
stop, right, don't keep doing
that, so do something else--

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.710
like, take your finger
off the hot stove.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.210
I would say the same thing here.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.970
When you feel the pain of--

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.790
agh, agh, I don't
know which to do,

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.040
because I don't like
either, I would love to see,

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.290
in everybody's head, a
little red flag go up,

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:59.570
and you say, ah, this is
a time to stop and think

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.480
a little bit differently, not
think exactly the way I thought

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.070
that has gotten me to this
point of having that conflict.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.210
Otherwise, just don't.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.580
Just go about your daily life.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.080
But I'd love this
little red flag--

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.390
oh, that's a trade-off
that I don't like--

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.345
could I do better,
could I do a lot better,

00:40:20.345 --> 00:40:22.220
what would be the pay-off
to do a lot better?

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.280
And then take the
inspiration to do it.

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:30.150
SPEAKER 1: And what about
situations where you have to,

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.280
under pressure, very
quickly make a great choice.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.415
Can you apply any of the
theories in this book

00:40:35.415 --> 00:40:36.249
to those situations?

00:40:36.249 --> 00:40:37.623
ROGER L. MARTIN:
Yeah I think so.

00:40:37.623 --> 00:40:39.450
And we have a great
case in the first book,

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:44.730
where it's a multi-billionaire
who had between close of market

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.770
on day x-- it was
like a Tuesday--

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.769
and open of marketing
on Wednesday

00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:53.310
to make a decision that would
have either made him, probably,

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.820
a pauper, or it turned out
to make him a billionaire.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.150
So I don't know, that
sounds like a decent amount

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:04.530
of pressure, right, in
not much time, right?

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.760
It's between 5
o'clock and 9 o'clock,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.160
and he's got to make it.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.310
And I think the reason
he's a billionaire

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.430
is he didn't compromise or
didn't choose either/or.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.990
He came up with a different
answer than anything that

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.810
had sort of presented him, or
sort of, people had said gee,

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.221
Michael, you've got to
decide, kind of, now, now,

00:41:26.221 --> 00:41:27.220
before the market opens.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.010
We have to have a
decision, for sure,

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.310
or we'd be, kind of,
completely too late.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:39.960
So I never believe in thinking
that you should use time

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.809
as an excuse.

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:43.350
I think you should
just be realistic.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.010
Michael needed to have
a decision by 9:00

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.290
AM on Wednesday morning.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.094
And he used--

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:53.010
I don't think he slept
much that night, right?

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.040
So he said, well, these
are 12 important hours,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.690
or less, I better
use them well--

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.720
16 hours, I guess.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.100
I better use them
well, and he used them.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:12.810
So people, I think, in the
world in the business world

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.910
let themselves off the
hook way too many times--

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.157
oh, management would never allow
that, my boss would be so mad,

00:42:20.157 --> 00:42:21.990
you know, I don't have
enough time, we don't

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.150
have the resources, blah blah.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.950
It's just like one list of--

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.310
long, long list of accepted
managerial excuses.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.560
I just don't accept
any of them--

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.170
never have, and
probably, never will.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.870
And I haven't in my own life--

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.640
I eat the dog food.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:45.150
My career is a series of
making integrative choices

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.240
rather than accepting the
choices that I'm presented.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.490
SPEAKER 1: You've had a
really interesting career that

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:55.800
spanned several industries
and areas, I guess--

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.970
private sector,
academia, now consulting.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.100
I wanted to zero
in on the moments

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.716
when you decided
to switch tracks.

00:43:03.716 --> 00:43:04.590
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yes.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.131
SPEAKER 1: Was that something
that came to you instinctively,

00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:10.329
or was it more of
a rational choice?

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:12.870
ROGER L. MARTIN: Oh, it depends
what you mean by rationality,

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:13.370
I guess.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.950
But the way I made
my big switch,

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:24.850
which was a decision to switch
countries and take a 94% pay

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:29.880
cut, was when the President
of the University of Toronto--

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.970
who was on the board of a
company I was consulting to--

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:37.230
decided that I would make a
good Dean of his business school

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.120
and proceeded-- he's a very
persuasive guy, Rob Pritchard.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.810
And he persuaded me.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:49.240
Now, he wasn't dealing with a
completely blank slate on that.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.950
I'd always felt that if
you do well in business,

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.390
you should turn your mind to
public service at some point--

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.840
public service writ large,
not elected politician.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.084
I mean, public service and
the University of Toronto,

00:44:04.084 --> 00:44:06.375
like all Canadian universities,
is a public university.

00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:09.410
It's like Berkeley.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:13.570
And so I thought of
that as public service.

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.150
I had been living in the United
States for quite a long time.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.710
I'm a Canadian,
as you can tell--

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.520
out, about, all my weird words.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.240
And so it was going to be
public service back in my home

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.587
country, because I
believed that Canada needed

00:44:26.587 --> 00:44:27.670
one great business school.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:31.350
It had zero great global
business schools at the time.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:35.207
I felt it needed
one, and I guess,

00:44:35.207 --> 00:44:37.290
I managed to convince
myself, or Rob convinced me,

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.160
that maybe we could do that.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.440
And sure enough, we did.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.370
And you know, when I finished
that, 15 years later, I

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:48.840
realized I missed--

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.002
I did some consulting along
the way, but not much--

00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:52.710
that I missed it.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.530
I love advising
CEOs on strategy.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.160
And so I just said,
I'm done with that.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.960
I'm going to go
down to Halftime.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.910
I'm going to run a research
center, the Martin Prosperity

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.880
Institute, that you
talked about before,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.380
where I am trying to work on
this tiny little problem of how

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.780
to fix the future of
democratic capitalism, which

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.320
is kind of fun, and
then consulting more.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.600
And so there is what I'm
interested in and worried

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.560
about-- the future of
democratic capitalism.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.680
I don't like the
way it's headed.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.630
And so let's see
if we can fix that.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:27.040
And doing a thing I love,
which is helping CEOs

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.660
have better strategies.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.560
I've always believed
that us crazy

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.140
folks who built Monitor
Company believed

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.330
that, if you make
better strategy choices,

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.734
you use the world's
raw materials, labor,

00:45:39.734 --> 00:45:42.150
and capital better, and you
make the world a better place.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.970
And I still I
still believe that.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.210
If you make bad strategy
choices, you just

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.990
waste raw materials, you waste
labor, and you waste capital.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:51.800
And that's bad.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.950
That's not good for the world.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.460
So I'm sort of
pursuing two loves,

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.520
now, which are sort of
public policy about something

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.420
I worry about, and
engaging in activities

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.407
that I find rewarding, and I
think, useful for the world.

00:46:06.407 --> 00:46:07.740
SPEAKER 1: OK, so last question.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.460
And then we're going to
open it up to the audience.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.376
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yeah.

00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.320
SPEAKER 1: What's
your daily News diet?

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.930
And I'm curious if you
allocate any time for people

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:24.370
like Aristotle or
Descartes in your habits?

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:28.300
ROGER L. MARTIN: I think
I have very bad habits.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:32.710
I don't read much at all, and I
don't spend much time listening

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.160
to the news.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.480
So because I think--

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:47.360
so what I do is I immerse
myself in a world I care about--

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.680
the world of business--

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.490
I try and solve problems
for people in business.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.220
And that gives me all
sorts of raw materials

00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:01.100
to write stuff that I think
is generalizably useful.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.980
People say, how do you
write so much, Roger?

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.340
You know, even
though you're a Dean,

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.500
you wrote all these books,
you've written 11 books,

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.510
you've written 25
HBR articles, you've

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.090
written hundreds and
hundreds of other articles.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.380
Where do you get
your research ideas?

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.400
And for starters, I don't think
of myself as doing research.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.960
I think of myself as doing.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.780
I like to do stuff.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.140
I fix stuff, and then I
try to figure out what I've

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.020
learned from fixing that stuff.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.580
And then when I
come up with come up

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.540
with a problem in my
mind, then, and only then,

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:37.130
do I read stuff that I've
been told by somebody,

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.750
or I've come across, that
I think might be useful.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:42.860
So I'm, like, reading
voraciously everything

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.010
in complexity theory,
right now, because I

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.760
think we have a problem in the
economy of thinking that we're

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.330
going to produce kind
of normal outcomes,

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.460
and everything is going Pareto.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.220
What's changed the economy
to make things go Pareto?

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.290
So I've got to read all
the complexity theory

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.450
stuff about that.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.310
But I don't read
complexity theory

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.950
and say, how could I apply
that complexity theory?

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:10.970
I say, has anybody
thought about it,

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:18.210
from a different field, stuff
that might apply to this field,

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:18.900
right here.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.312
And then I dive.

00:48:20.312 --> 00:48:21.270
And then I'm voracious.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:25.410
Then I have the excuse to
read, and I don't mind reading.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.690
For some reason, I
don't love reading.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:28.860
I love writing.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.970
I just love, love writing.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:35.040
And so that gets me
inspired to read.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.580
But I think that's a very--

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:41.870
it seems bad behavior to
me that I don't read more.

00:48:44.532 --> 00:48:45.240
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.859
Well, I think we'll take
some audience questions.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:49.900
I'll repeat the question.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.817
ROGER L. MARTIN: Yeah.

00:48:50.817 --> 00:48:52.358
SPEAKER 1: Do you
think machines will

00:48:52.358 --> 00:48:54.520
be able to think
integratively in the future,

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.641
and are they already doing it?

00:48:56.641 --> 00:48:58.390
ROGER L. MARTIN: I
doubt they're doing it,

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.070
and it's part because humans
haven't kind of organized

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.750
their thinking enough on this.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.450
So I mean, the way
I think about it--

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.290
and I wrote a book in 2009 on
this, if you're interested,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.950
called "The Design of Business."

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.120
It's kind of-- all
knowledge on the planet

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.240
goes through three major stages.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.980
Everything we know now about
the world was once a mystery.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.920
Why do things fall
when we let go of them?

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.880
At one point, it was--

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.760
because of a love for Mother
Earth or animal spirits

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.480
or whatever.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.980
It was a mystery, right?

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.150
And then some of the things
we think about enough that we

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.190
reduce it to a heuristic.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.389
So an apple falls on
the head of a smart guy,

00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:43.180
and he says, ah, there's
a universal force,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.080
I'm going to call gravity,
that pushes everything down.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.380
Then if we study it hard
enough, long enough,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.170
some of those things get
reduced to an algorithm.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.860
If you drop an item anywhere
in the world but America,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.500
it accelerates at 9.8
meters per second squared--

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.000
because America is
exceptional, it's

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.530
32 feet per second
squared, here.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:05.170
And so it's an algorithm.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.677
And once you've got something
to an algorithm, you can,

00:50:07.677 --> 00:50:09.760
in the modern era-- this
is what's different about

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.290
the modern era than
any era before--

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:14.620
once you've got something in
an algorithm, you can code it,

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.800
and you know, shove it
through a digital computer,

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:23.620
and do it perfectly
fast, et cetera.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:28.970
So for me, the enabler
for machines to do things

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.090
is pushing things--

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.930
I call that the
knowledge funnel--

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.550
down the knowledge funnel.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:37.740
And I think integrative thinking
is a heuristic, at this point.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.320
It needs to be made more
algorithmic for machines

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.640
to be able to do it.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.200
And how far that can go?

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.590
I mean, there are
some things that

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:51.250
have allowed themselves
to be reduced to code

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.590
more quickly than other things.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:57.400
We haven't figured
out a bunch of things.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.760
So it's sort of dependent
would be my view.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.540
I somehow think that
the notion that machines

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:17.430
can get ahead of human beings on
the distillation of knowledge,

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:22.030
I'm probably from Missouri on.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.420
But there would be other
people who would disagree

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.370
and say, oh yes, they will.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:32.890
But I'll believe
it when I see it.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.630
SPEAKER 1: How do
you deal with what

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:38.050
seems to be a mutually exclusive
choice where integration

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:39.515
is more difficult?

00:51:39.515 --> 00:51:41.640
ROGER L. MARTIN: That's
what this technique is for.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.610
It's for what appears
incommensurable choices.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:53.980
So I'm not a believer
that the choices

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.610
we feel are mutually
exclusive are as mutually

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.620
exclusive as we think they are.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.810
They're mutually
exclusive only as long

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:04.240
as we think of
them the way we do.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.260
And one way that causes things
to be mutually exclusive,

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.680
in our mind, is abstraction.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.830
We abstract up to
labels that cause

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:17.860
us to believe something-- two
things are mutually exclusive.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.000
Free or proprietary, because
how can you be free proprietary?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.800
It's like, you can't.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.900
Bigger smaller, how can
you be bigger and smaller

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.980
at the same time?

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.060
You can't.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.030
But it turns out that
those labels often

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:34.990
are abstractions that aren't
helpful to our goal, which

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.540
is to get a better
answer than those two.

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:43.470
So what I tell people is
don't live in the abstraction.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:47.760
The integrative answers
lie below the abstractions

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.944
in the mechanisms by which
you get to the abstraction.

00:52:52.944 --> 00:52:55.610
SPEAKER 1: Are there areas where
this type of thinking will fall

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:56.660
short?

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.701
ROGER L. MARTIN: I mean,
I haven't seen them yet,

00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:00.350
but there may be ones.

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:09.680
I mean, I guess in the course
of human endeavors, I think,

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.860
like, we've manufactured
the world that we live in.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:18.410
It's not as unchanging
as people think it is.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:22.850
And most times when we seem
to have an either/or choice,

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:26.390
it's a function of
believing that it

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:31.640
is and a function of living
in a world of abstraction.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.510
So I haven't seen a domain
where I can say, oh yeah,

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:37.430
in that domain, you
just can't, it's

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:40.820
just there's no there, there.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.940
I mean, there are some domains
that are tougher, right?

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.790
You know, wars are
fought on the basis

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.935
of absolute religious beliefs.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.180
And people could
say, well, you know,

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.370
those are either/ors there.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:01.490
But they're just
either/ors only as long

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.580
as we produce the either/or.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.920
And we produce the
either/or by abstracting up

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.450
to things that appear to be
so contradictory nothing could

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:12.800
ever be done.

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:21.440
I just haven't seen ones
where, if the people involved

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.390
value a better answer--

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.760
not a compromise, a just
plain better answer--

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:34.700
TIFF is more inclusive than
when Piers Handling started,

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:39.170
and more important
and richer and has

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:40.420
bigger buzz than Cannes.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.350
You'd think that's impossible.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.050
How can that be?

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.350
Because Cannes is exclusive.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:54.430
It's a nasty, elitist,
exclusive thing.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:58.045
Well, get below the label.

00:54:58.045 --> 00:54:58.920
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.970
Well, thank you, Roger.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.040
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:01.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:01.940
ROGER L. MARTIN: You're welcome.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:02.840
It was a pleasure.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.340
Thank you.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.590
[APPLAUSE]
