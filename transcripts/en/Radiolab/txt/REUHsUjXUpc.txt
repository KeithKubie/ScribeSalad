Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from

Speaker 2:          00:04          W N y. S. T. E.

Speaker 1:          00:12          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. So Robert, one of my favorite sounds of all time is the sound of hearing people think, you know, have a hearing, a mind kind of formulate a thought that wasn't there until it clicks in. Yeah. That's just an MP, a beautiful sound, especially when the mind that you're listening to is a person who has shaped you, has shaped the show. Sure. So, uh, today a little bit of a departure, um, a couple of months ago I got connected to a guy named bill Hayes as a mutual friend, sort of put us in touch. He wrote a really good book actually about anatomy. Really good. I gave it to my son. Really? Yeah. He is a writer and a photographer

Speaker 2:          00:54          and I was the partner of the late Oliver Sacks. And together we made tapes or recordings of conversations in the last year

Speaker 1:          01:03          of his life. Now, all of our Sachs, one of the great, great writers of science, masterful, masterful writer, you know, we here at radio lab have grown up with him and his style of, of combining sort of clinical scientific observation with deep humanity and poetry. I feel like we're always trying to walk in his footsteps in some way. Can we do what we do? And certainly we know we've had him on the show many, many, many times. So his voice will be familiar to a lot of you. But what you hear on these tapes is an altogether different portrait. And why, why did you start these recordings?

Speaker 2:          01:41          Well, Oliver got his diagnosis of a terminal cancer in mid January, 2015

Speaker 1:          01:49          he had had cancer about nine years earlier, dealt with it, but it was back.

Speaker 2:          01:54          It's spreading through his body. The prognosis was six to 18 months and it was shattering

Speaker 1:          02:01          shortly after bill says they were sitting at the kitchen table talking like

Speaker 2:          02:05          I, uh, I, I knew that he had things on his mind that he wanted to write. And I said, well, what do you, what do you thinking about writing? This was about four days after he got his diagnosis and he paused and then he looked at me and he said, uh, something like a month ago I felt that I was in good health, even robust health at 81. I still swim a mile a day, but my luck has run out. And uh, I said stop right there. And I grabbed a pad and a pen and I said, start over. And I began writing as fast as I could as he dictated virtually the entire essay. Wow. Just sort of spilled out like that. Yup. And uh, so we had the idea of getting a little audio recorder, a digital recorder so that it could be on hand at any time, whether to record what he wanted to write or reminisce or to collect stories after his, I put the recorder in a drawer and um, didn't pull it out again until over a year and a half after his death. I didn't even listen to it, any of it to write my own memoir. I had been kind of very nervous about listening to them cause I thought it'd be very sad and just so that it would just make me depressed and sad. But I took it, I took the recorder out of the drawer where it had sat for 18 months and I pushed play. And of course it didn't work because the batteries were dead because I had to scramble to find batteries. And when I did and then pushed play.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Okay. This is a recorded conversation between o w s and Billy Hayes. Um, on February six, the hairs on my arms went up.

Speaker 2:          03:51          It was as if he was alive. This was the first recording you made with them? It was a during dinner. We're eating at the time and he began telling me about his dream,

Speaker 3:          04:00          um, dreams. I ain't been having a look of strangely Arthur titled Reading [inaudible] I have to make, yeah, getting lost. Um, and getting found full of supplies. There's the maybe go through a door, which I think will be a door to another one, but there's a, don't want to have a mountain landscape. Um, um, sometimes frightening with Enes or, or habitat edge long, very narrow ledgers, but then finally come into some gracious heavenly mounting meadow and then waking dreams about doing this and approaching him. And um, it's a journey from where to where,

Speaker 2:          04:56          this was February 6th, 2015 so about three weeks after Oliver got his diagnosis of a terminal cancer and his immediate impulse was to write

Speaker 3:          05:09          and yet [inaudible] finance has been forced into my mind framing the evidence past two weeks,

Speaker 2:          05:24          Oliver was quite deaf, even louder than he realized he would whisper words to himself as he wrote them down on the pad and he wrote with a fountain pen.

Speaker 3:          05:35          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:42          For Oliver, writing was a form of thinking and the primary activity.

Speaker 3:          05:46          Yeah. For a human being, I know my normal health stay to health and energy at least such health and energy as a fits as a fit and active 81 year old ruled to enjoy in this despite having, I know the previous month and liver full melanoma test to see this thing is all out. This is from there out. What I'm going to do is just leave that all there so you can look at it again. You asked her, no, no, nothing was with a strong intent. I'm a creature. Multiple drafts as you know, specific symptoms, feeling meaning screws with the screws with them and which may be hungry. Severe tolerably, serious, severe susa creations. Fictions patients, patients. We're known for death. We known for death magnifying glass. Yeah. I haven't had, Oliver was the kind of guy who would take dictionaries to bed to read with a magnifying glass. Can you bring my chain mistakes? Real look up a word for me. I need a magnifying glass and I have one here. I also feel the missing magnifying glass. There it is. Can you see if there's a word visit piece of all VSI

Speaker 4:          08:18          yes, there is change to a better frame of mind to be wise.

Speaker 3:          08:24          To be wise. Um, can you pull out the big Dick screened CFU. Com find any. So impulse in particular. I want to know whether overturned to health. Okay. Here's a man with a huge vocabulary and love of writing, but still every day you'd be struck by a word that he wanted to look up.

Speaker 4:          08:44          Well, it immediately says repentance for misconduct or to do say repentance for misconduct, recognition of errors, committed return to a better mind or opinion. What's the origin of the word? To recover one senses come to oneself again. Hope to learn some skills. I think Russell credit the word I want.

Speaker 5:          09:14          Can I take [inaudible]? Mistasis is coming back. It's coming back. [inaudible] trans through crest. Christine say thank you very much. Ranted for contingently. You can expect it had happened for health. Who [inaudible] through some harm please. Okay. [inaudible] [inaudible] yes.

Speaker 6:          10:16          A general feeling of disorder. It is, especially when things are going wrong internally when homeostasis is not being maintained. When the autonomic balance starts listing heavily to one side or the other, that is core consciousness. The feeling of how one is takes on an intrusive, unpleasant quality, and now one will say, I feel ill. Something is amiss at such times one. Indeed everything comes and goes and if one could take a scan or inner photograph of the body at such times, one would see vascular beds opening and closing Paris dialysis. Accelerating or stopping is the rest squirming or tightening in spasms, secretion. Suddenly increasing or decreasing is if the nervous system itself, we're in a state of indecision instability, fluctuation and oscillation are of the essence in the unsettled state. This feeling of disorder, we lose the normal feeling of the procedure. They're relatively benign, would lead to the death of a huge mass of melanoma cells. These in dying would give off a variety of unpleasant and pain producing substances. Soon after waking from the embolization, I was to be a sale by feelings of excruciating tiredness and proxy Isms of sleep so abrupt they could pull axe me in the middle of a sentence or a mouthful.

Speaker 5:          11:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          11:35          delirium would seize me within seconds. Even in the middle of handwriting, I felt extremely weak and inert. On Day 10 I turned a corner. I felt awful as usual in the morning, but a different person in the afternoon. This was delightful and wholly unexpected. I suddenly found myself full of physical and creative energy and euphoria, almost akin to Hypomania. Exuberant thoughts rushed through my mind. How much of this was a reestablishment of balance in the body? How much an autonomic rebound after a profound autonomic depression, how much other physiological factors and how much the sheer joy of writing, I do not know, but my transformed state and feeling where I suspect very close to it. Nietzsche experienced after a period of illness and expressed so lyrically in the gay science

Speaker 5:          12:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          12:33          gratitude pours forth continually as if the unexpected had just happened. The gratitude of a convalescent for convalescence was unexpected. The rejoicing of strength that is returning of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day after tomorrow of a sudden sense and anticipation of a future of impending adventures of seas that are open again,

Speaker 3:          13:01          where's the ways the microphone on this bloody thing? Well, okay, you all recording this right? The, the time is nine 20. Um, in New York it would be five hours difference with Greenwich Mean Time and it is Monday the ninth. And that's the say the 20th day after my embolization. And just 48 hours till the next one. End of recording pause.

Speaker 2:          13:31          On March 11th, Oliver had the second embolization surgery, which would cut off blood supply to the tumors growing in his liver. With the idea of that it would give Oliver more time, more energy. We'd been together six years. I knew him well and yet, uh, I'd never seen him with such focus.

Speaker 5:          14:10          [inaudible] all right. All right. Question.

Speaker 3:          14:17          Just constantly writing. Yeah. I don't know what to call this piece. They can title it [inaudible] half on your own. Did glorious forest. Well, I like the future. I still never know. Sorry. I oh, that's excellent. Yeah, that's it. Um, and I think I need to put in, otherwise I'm does to indicate why they should have and I say to Billy, who is a good deal younger, who's younger than who is a good deal younger than I am. Originally I put who was two thirds my age, um, how I have to be precise. I like that. Okay. It's really precise. Okay. Chris. Exactly. Two thirds my age. Okay, so that's that piece for the New York Earth. Yes. Okay. Have some insurer and I'll hear students. Okay, sure. I like the idea of saying [inaudible] is exactly two thirds of my age. It's not, it's not a fraction that you expect to see three quarters. Yes, yes, but not two thirds. I like the idea of putting a tiny arithmetical conundrum.

Speaker 7:          15:34          Ninth Avenue, Reverie published March 20th, 2015

Speaker 5:          15:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          15:39          driving down ninth avenue, choking on diesel fumes from a truck just ahead of us. I say to my friend Billy, he's exactly two thirds my age. I wonder whether you will see the end of internal combustion engines, the end of oil, a cleaner world. The thought zooms me away from ninth avenue to a forest world in particular to the one described in that glorious forest. So Ghillean Prance his book about his 39 visits to the Amazon in the past 50 years. He sees what we are doing to the Amazon and its many peoples. He speaks for conservation, sanity reason before we destroy it all.

Speaker 5:          16:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          16:17          I went to that glorious forest in 1996, 11 days of botany study and hiking, seeing hundreds of different species of trees in a single acre. I'd planned before I became ill to go to Madagascar to see its forests and its unique font and other wildlife, especially the lemurs. I love Lemurs. One has to see them, study them to grasp the origin of our primate nature. But most of the forests on Madagascar have already been obliterated and not a naturally lemurs are dying. Honking horns bring me back to ninth avenue. I seem to have spent hours lost in reverie thinking about the Amazonian and Madagascan forests, lemurs the time machine. But we have scarcely moved, are still behind the stinking lung destroying truck. Not In my life. Billy answers.

Speaker 3:          17:16          Um, I, yes, I'm a, yeah, I, I'd been reading a lot of it allowed to Billy. Um, this is according where Oliver is talking on the phone to Lawrence Weschler aren Weschler but anyhow, he, um, I was due to have a, um, a cat scan follow up on Thursday. I was terrified to this. In fact, what it did show was that 80% of the metastasis in the liver, um, had been destroyed by the embolization. With luck. I should have two or three good months after this. Um, well I just hope that I come see friends and white and maybe travel a little at yeah. And I think next month if I'm up to it, I'm gonna go to London to say hello and possibly farewell to um, friends and family and um, I can't think ahead beyond that.

Speaker 3:          18:26          Six, seven is still one short. I don't want to assume, um, semantics, semantics and then treatments inseparability into its relation. Who I want to hear. I want to hear over the years I filled upwards of a thousand notebooks that contents of a various, but three of them have had a special function to record abnormalities of perception during times of sensory impairments or deprivation. The column notebook is a very modest affair. It is quite small. It slips easily into a pocket crucial because I need to have it with me at all times increasing deafness. I'm more prone to miss hearing what people say, but miss hearings deceive on entirely. You accept what you hear. You accept what you see. Every miss hearing is a novel surprise and concoction and never gets used to them. The hundredth is as fresh as absurd and as thought provoking as the first Ms. Herring became miss hearing. Take the car for a spin became take the car for a swim. I've noted that your hummus can [inaudible] on carbs. Taylor poems, sick time published. It was heard as a big time cuttlefish. Did you say a poetry bag and you said no. I said a cool, sweet.

Speaker 3:          20:32          I love the idea of a poetry that yes, I'm inclined almost to put them all in. I think they should all be. We'll meet. We'll make the point that sound Trump central thing,

Speaker 8:          20:50          one surroundings, one's wishes and expectations. Conscious and unconscious can certainly be coded terminance and mishearing, but the real Mr flies at lower levels in those parts of the brain involved in phonological analysis and decoding, doing what they can with distorted or deficient signals from our ears. These parts of the brain managed to construct real words or phrases, even if they are absurd. And yet there's often a sort of style or wit a dash and these instantaneous inventions, they reflect to some extent one's own interests and experiences and I rather enjoy them only in the realm of mishearing. At least my miss hearings can a biography of cancer become a biography of Kantor. One of my favorite mathematicians, Taro cards can turn into Taro pods, a grocery bag into a poetry bag, all or numbness into oral numbness. And a mere mention of Christmas Eve, a command to kiss my feet.

Speaker 9:          26:35          Oliver had enjoyed a couple of really good months of feeling well and fit and uh, getting lots of writing done. You

Speaker 2:          26:44          had completed not only a general feeling of disorder, the short piece, ms hearings, his autobiography on the move was published. He worked on a piece on the evolution of the eye and he'd completed a major case history on the performer, Spalding gray. We'd made this wonderful trip to London for 10 days after we returned from the trip. He knew that he would have to get another cat scan to see how things were going. And I, I would say that we kind of had a feeling, an optimistic feeling. He seemed to be doing well. So he went into that hoping for the best, but it was exactly the opposite. The cancer had spread beyond the liver to other organs. Um, that it, uh, was looking very bad indeed. Oliver more than anyone I think knew that time was running out.

Speaker 5:          27:51          [inaudible] um, um, I wonder if I could ask you to look up something on the little box. Sure.

It was really the only solution and, uh, it was quite uncomfortable and it had to be drained daily. Um, and it also unfortunately ended his swimming. He was a great swimmer and he loved to swim, but he didn't complain. Swimming had come to an end, so he put his head down basically and began working on this essay. Sabbath
