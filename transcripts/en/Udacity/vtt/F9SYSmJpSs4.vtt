to, to deal with, then there are then there are circular shifts for

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.300
it, for them, one for each of the words in the title.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.430
And we've indicated them here by underlining the word that we're shifting.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.720

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.870

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.310
And if we wanted to look up using any of those words we

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.230
could because now we've indexed on it.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.850
And when we alphabetize it, we have the one starting with gone and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.010
then the the and the wind and with.
