00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Woaaaaaaahh, whooo

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.340
Wow

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.239
Hey whats up guys! it is good to see you again in today's video. We're getting crazy with chemical experiments, now for this video

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.780
I was scrolling through the comments and I found this request from Spoon Kapeezi

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.300
Who says if you mix brake fluid and chlorine the mixture will self ignite. This is an experiment

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.460
You may be familiar with by now, but I think the real request is to push the experiment to the boundaries and explain

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.900
What's actually taking place, now to get the chemicals we need for our experiment today

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.389
I made two quick pit stops the first one was to a pool supply store to pick some of this fast

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.210
dissolving shock treatment for swimming pools and the second stop was to the auto parts store to pick up some dot 3 brake fluid

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580
I'm Reading the warning label and funny enough

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.040
It doesn't say anywhere on here that you can't mix with pool chlorine, does that mean we can?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.660
Well Let me show you what happens if you do, you might have noticed on the bag of pool shock chlorine it contains 73 percent calcium Hypochlorite

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.460
so really high concentration of available chlorine the brake fluid is a mixture of ethylene Glycols

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.029
And when you mix these two chemicals together a very interesting reaction occurs

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.889
now if we snip the end off of our pool chlorine and pour out the contents you can see it's really just a

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.460
Granulated white powder and if you're standing too close, it'll start to smell like a swimming pool

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.500
And you might even feel it starting to sting your nostrils

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.180
So here's the setup guys

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
I just fill up this glass about half an inch full at the bottom with Pool shock chlorine

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.540
And I've got our dot 3 brake fluid we're ready to pour in we're going to carefully add our brake fluid in equal proportions so that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.319
It comes just the top the chlorine then we're going to give it a little shake set it down on the top of this brick

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.559
And start a timer and then get very very far away for about 2 minutes

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.169
Now once these two chemicals mixed together. It doesn't really look like anything is happening. It's just sitting there. There's no smoke

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.860
There's no steam

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.889
It just sits there doing nothing and we're over a minute in twenty seconds now and nothing is really changed, but watch this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.310
Bangerang baby, did you see that?

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.850
It'sat there for about one minute and 35 seconds, and it looked like it was doing absolutely nothing is was completely calm

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.640
No smoke and then just out of nowhere

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.360
boom the whole thing combusts a flame shoots up about four feet in the air and we get all this ash that bubbles up and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.800
Spews over the Edge that was an epic reaction, so let's do one more of those and then talk about what's happening

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.409
Nothing like the itchy sensation of chlorine in the nostrils in the morning. It's what I do for you guys

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.470
If you looked down at this, it looks like nothing is happening whatsoever. It's just sitting there. You don't see any smoke

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.100
No, Heat if I feel the glass I don't even feel it warming up

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.800
Ocassionally a little bubble, but I think that's just cuz of the oil sinking now, but we do want to get very far away

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.700
We want to back up and just watch it patiently because the reaction is taking place watch this

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.640
So we just passed a minute now since we added the brake fluid and absolutely nothing's happening. It's just sitting there

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.540
it's just sitting there silently like a crocodile waiting for the kill

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.090
but Something's going to happen just wait for it.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940
It's a minute and 30 seconds

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.460
Man that stuff shot right at the top

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.049
I think that wasn't even bigger flaming that time that one shot up about five feet high and it was right at the 1 minute

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.499
35 second mark which is very consistent to the first test that we did

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.429
So now that we verified that this reaction works. It works very consistently

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.750
I reached out to my friend nurdrage for an explanation of what's taking place, and he gave me some really good insight

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.479
I think we should talk about now on the warning label here

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.110
It says that our brake fluid is a mixture of glycol ethers basically long

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.600
Hydrocarbons very similar to oil the difference being that brake fluid has oxygen inserted every two carbons now

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.359
Technically this fluid is flammable, but it's very very hard to ignite

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.790
And that's why it's generally considered safe for use with your brakes

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.179
Now the actual reaction taking place when the brake fluid makes contact with the pool chlorine is a free radical break down at the Polyethylene

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.400
Glycol it basically breaks the Glycol down into lighter components like aldehydes now this takes time

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.000
Which is why the reaction doesn't begin right away?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.570
But as the simpler aldehydes build up they start reacting with the oxygen in the pool chlorine to form water and carbon dioxide

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.139
Is basically a simple combustion reaction the reaction is exothermic and produces a tremendous amount of heat to the point where it actually?

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.169
Vaporizes the aldehydes and burst into flame. Yes

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.040
It actually gets so hot that the brake fluid

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.729
Vapors self ignite if you were to put this reaction inside of a sealed container the container would explode now

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.969
Let's talk for just a second about the white vapors coming off of this reaction

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.010
I've heard concerns from some people wondering that toxic chlorine gas now chlorine is very discernible

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.109
It's very toxic it starts stinging your nose and your lungs

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.649
Immediately with very low concentration and during all these experiments and reactions that I've tried the smell of chlorine is Negligible

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.120
I actually get a stronger smell of chlorine when I'm just pouring the powder into the glass itself the white fumes

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.269
we're seeing are actually broken down and vaporized brake fluid those are the flammable vapors that burst into fire as soon as the temperature -

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.990
Todd now let's set up two more experiments just to see how this reacts in different scenarios

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.769
one out in the open air and the other in the confined space of a soda bottle

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.650
Okay, so that was a little bit surprising

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.410
I thought out in the open air would actually take longer to react but actually went off in 54 seconds. That's really interesting

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.249
Nice chemical residue now my friend Marcus brought up a good point

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.679
Don't stir the stuff up with your fingers guys because any chemical residues can ignite and burn your skin, okay?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.660
So we've seen this reaction in a glass we've seen it in the open air our last experiment is in a plastic soda bottle I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.149
Just think I'm just going to give this one a little bit too much

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.230
Much too much

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.339
Just for the record that is way too much this should be fun

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720
fourth and final

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.060
Here we go

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.340
This one might happen a little fast

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.459
Maybe not there's one minute oh

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440
wow, oh

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.049
my goodness, holy heck

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.389
Okay, so what was really interesting about that. It was still only about a minute and 30 seconds the same was our other reaction

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.579
but the difference is the flame shot out like

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.810
Rocket fuel the color of the flame itself was like a deep red or Magenta and it shot up

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:51.769
Ridiculously high I mean it it almost looked like a rocket engine turned upside down not quite as much power of course but very very

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.349
Satisfying and it was like shooting hot chlorine tablets into the air and they were raining down the back of my shirt

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.919
Which is absolutely nuts. I'm actually quite surprised that took that long for the reaction to start because in a confined container

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.258
I would have expected the heat to build a little bit more quickly

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.158
But that was very consistent with the other reactions that we've experimented with today

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.020
The thing is when it goes off in the bottle

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.940
It's just a lot more violent imagine if that were capped off who have bottle bar on our hands

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.970
What's really amazing to me is how deceiving this reaction is like it

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.399
Just sits there nothing's happening at all and then out of nowhere

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:29.299
Bam this huge fireball super violent reaction is you don't want to be standing anywhere near that's amazing

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.849
You only get like a split-second with white vapor coming out of the bottle and then boom the whole thing ignites the bottle completely

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.659
illuminates

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:39.049
and then you see this fire stack just shooting out of the top and

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.348
that right there is where it gets extremely violent the flame shoots out of

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.218
Frame and starts spewing chemical into the air raining down ashes everywhere

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:52.729
Man it goes from the stream of fire to like a blowtorch excellent seriously

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.929
That's a lot of fire the other thing that you notice is the plastic bottle shrinks like the heat of the reaction

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.219
shrinks the plastic and then catches in a fire where just burns away to nothing so

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.389
Very intense experiment to say the least not an experiment need to try at home

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:10.098
It's one of those things where the manufacturer says use the product only as intended for these kinds of reasons

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:13.099
So kind of fun experiments here guys let's talk about what just happened

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:18.859
We started off our experiment today with pool shot chlorine and dot 3 brake fluid those specific chemicals when mixed together

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:24.978
Start an exothermic reaction that disassociates the polyethylene glycol into lighter and much more flammable

00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:28.098
Aldehyde when this exothermic reaction accelerates enough

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:34.158
It'll eventually hit the point where the brake flew will vaporize and those flammable vapors will self ignite, and we tried three different scenarios

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.119
we stuck this combination in a glass out in the open air and in a soda bottle and

00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:42.619
Surprisingly we found that the reaction in the open air went off quicker than the ones in the confined spaces

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.839
Which is exactly opposite of what I would have expected

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.630
So there we have a guides based on our experiments today

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.959
We now have a deepened

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:55.099
Understanding as to why mixing different chemicals together can lead to disastrous results and are often not recommended to be tried at home

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.870
