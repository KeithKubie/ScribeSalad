00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.580
PETE WATTS: Well, the number
666 is pretty famous, or I

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.480
suppose you could
say infamous.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.270
666 is called the number
of the beast.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.740
And the reason that the number
666 has become infamous is not

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650
just because it's some
kind of nice number.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.590
It has got a lot of interesting
mathematical

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.200
properties.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.150
JAMES GRIME: Perhaps
disappointingly,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.610
mathematically 666--

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.690
not that special.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.280
PETE WATTS: But it's famous
because of its use in the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.790
Bible, where it is the
number of the beast.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.340
Let me read the relevant
passage.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.680
JAMES GRIME: The one thing that
I do know where it turns

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.500
up is in the game of roulette.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
So roulette--

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.140
here's a roulette table.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.000
This is the Monte Carlo
roulette table.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750
PETE WATTS: "Let him who has
understanding reckon the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.260
number of the beast, for
it is a human number.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.760
Its number is 666."

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.730
JAMES GRIME: There's an American
roulette table as

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.780
well, which is slightly
different.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.890
The American table has a 0 and
a 00, whereas the Monte Carlo

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.300
roulette table just
has the one 0.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.060
PETE WATTS: The New Testament--
the Bible wasn't

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.920
written in English.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.430
This is just a translation.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.170
So in the original Greek
manuscripts, the number is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.670
actually written as
three letters.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.040
The Greeks didn't have symbols
for writing numbers.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.690
They use letters instead.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.210
It's the same as if in English,
we had to use the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.700
letter A for one, the letter
B for two, and so on.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.890
Greek is like this.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.870
It uses letters to represent
numbers.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.150
Hebrew is like this.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.810
Letters are used to
represent numbers.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170
And those are the two main
languages of the Bible.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.820
JAMES GRIME: So all roulette
tables, though, use the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.180
numbers 1 to 36.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.070
So here, the Monte Carlo
roulette table has 37 slots--

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.800
0, 1, 2, 3, up to 36.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.860
PETE WATTS: So alpha, the first
letter of the Greek

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.670
alphabet represents
the number one.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.520
Beta, the second letter,
represents number two.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.890
Gamma, the third letter,
represents number three.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.190
Now, if we carried on like this,
we wouldn't be able to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.130
form big numbers very easily.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.320
So then, as we go on, the
letter iota comes

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.100
to represent 10.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.520
Kappa is 20.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.210
And then we've got to
now go to our 100's.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.920
So rho, which is the equivalent
of our letter R,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.430
represents 100.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.650
Sigma, the next letter--

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.040
just like we go R, S, rho,
sigma in Greek--

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.830
200.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.200
Now what this means is that
every word also has a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.530
numerical value.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.460
JAMES GRIME: The Monte Carlo
table was by a man called

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.780
Francois Blanc.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.600
In fact, the first version of
roulette was invented by a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.060
mathematician called Blaise
Pascal, a really early version

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.330
of the idea.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.400
He's a brilliant French
mathematician--

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.650
really interesting life.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.450
But the version I want to talk
about is the Monte Carlo

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.200
roulette table.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.460
So Francois Blanc
invented this.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.990
And they say that he made a deal
with the devil for the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.280
secrets of roulette, because
the numbers of a roulette

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.130
table add up to 666.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.510
PETE WATTS: So for example,
my name is Pete.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.590
Pi--

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.050
famous mathematical symbol which
is the first letter of

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.370
my name, which would be 80,
so pi, P for Pete, 80.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.990
Epsilon and E, that
would be 5.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.810
Tau, a T, that would be 300.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.040
And finally, another E, 5.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.530
So the number of
my name is 390.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.650
JAMES GRIME: It is just
a coincidence.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.210
It's a nice little funny story
told by gamblers who have

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.980
perhaps suffered at the hands
of the roulette table.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.670
666 then, if it is the sum of
consecutive numbers, 1 to 36,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.010
that means it's also known
as a triangle number.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.990
That's what a triangle
number is.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.850
Let's have a look at those.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.480
PETE WATTS: OK.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.120
So in the Bible, the famous
number 666 comes in

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.330
Revelation, chapter 13.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.400
"This calls for wisdom.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.710
Let him who has understanding
reckon the number of the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.500
beast, for it is
a human number.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.380
Its number is 666."

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.970
Now, in English, this word
"reckon" actually comes from a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.410
Greek word which means
calculate.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.090
So it's almost like the text is
saying, I'm going to give

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.890
you a riddle.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.520
You need to calculate the
number of the beast.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.490
This number, 666, actually
relates to a name.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.600
Now, in Greek, this is called
isopsephy, the idea that a

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.170
name can be a number as well,
or a number can be a name.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.480
And in Hebrew thought, the same
idea is called gematria,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.740
which actually relates to our
English word "geometry." It

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.660
has the same Greek origin.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.130
Many people have seen the Book
of Revelation as directed

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.090
against the Roman Empire.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.880
So when it comes to calculating
the number of the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.120
beast, this evil figure within
the book, many of them presume

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.110
that this figure must be
something to do with the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.020
Empire, and in particular, its
particularly evil leader Nero.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.910
So the way that this is
calculated from the number 666

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.960
is to take the letters
of Nero Caesar.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.660
But a slight complication is
that the letters are actually

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.270
written in Hebrew
and not Greek.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.190
The reason for that is it's
often in Jewish thought, in

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.340
Hebrew thought, that the idea of
making letters and numbers,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.970
or making names from numbers,
had some significance.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:36.070
One way to write Nero Caesar
in Hebrew is like this.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.510
Now, just like in Greek,
each letter

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.730
corresponded to a number.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.590
The same is true in Hebrew.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.720
So the first letter of the
Hebrew alphabet is alef.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.300
So this corresponds
to number one.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.820
Bet corresponds to number two.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.650
And then we move into
our 10's as well.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.440
So yod corresponds
to number 10.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.820
Resh corresponds to 200.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.450
So we have a very
similar system.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.090
Both the Greeks and Hebrew
language used letters to

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.490
represent numbers.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.810
So this says Nero Caesar
in Hebrew.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.900
The nu, the N, is number 50.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.680
The R, the resh, is 200.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.450
Vav is 6.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.220
Nu is 50.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.270
Qoph is 100.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.210
Samekh is 60.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.520
And then resh is 200.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.070
Now, if you add up all of
these, we come to 666.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.550
So Nero Caesar, the name
Nero Caesar, has a

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.030
numerical value of 666.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.730
Why is it spelt slightly
funnily?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.940
We've got here N, R, the
equivalent of a N. So we've

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.640
got Neron Caesar.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.030
The reason for that is that the
Greek way of writing Nero

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.970
Caesar was Neron Caesar.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.800
I think this is the most
obvious explanation.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.170
Partly because there are other
examples at the time in other

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.190
Hebrew and Greek text of
this kind of riddle.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.160
The idea of a number
representing a name is

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.360
convincing because this Neron
Caesar, this particular

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.650
spelling, is in common use.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.300
And also, John as an author uses
very Hebraic concepts.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.620
He draws on a lot
of Hebrew ideas.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.100
Some people argue that Greek
is his second language.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.520
He thinks in Hebrew, but
he writes in Greek.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.720
So he's imbued with
Hebrew ideas.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.290
PETE WATTS: But also, it adds
to kind of the complexity of

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.310
it in terms of it being
a riddle, a secret.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.230
So no one wants to write
a book under imperial

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.060
persecution saying the root of
all evil is Nero Caesar.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.420
You're not going to
spell that out.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.160
So this is kind of a way that
the number system of the time

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.860
uses a code to kind of protect
the author, protect the

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.380
recipients from an out
and out criticism.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.225
JAMES GRIME: A triangle number,
then, can be written

00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:03.590
like a triangle.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.638
Here, I'm going to take some
dots and write them--

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:09.920
squeak--

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.260
in a triangle.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.600
And you see, each row is
a different number.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.740
So now I've got one,
two, three, four.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.540
So the first triangle number--

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.450
it's just 1, on its own.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.980
The second triangle number is
the first two rows there, so 1

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.130
plus 2, which is 3.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.720
The third triangle number
is this triangle--

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.300
one, two, three--

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.720
which is 6.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.100
The fourth triangle number is
that, and so on, and so on.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.679
And the 36th triangle number--

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.000
so the very last row would
have 36 dots on it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.710
It would be the 36th
triangle number.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.930
That is 666.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.010
PETE WATTS: 666 has been used
to indicate virtually

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.273
anything, where anyone who's
been evil and evil, rude, or

00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:58.300
so on, has been found to add
up somehow to the number of

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.370
666, using all sorts of bizarre
counting systems.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.830
What generally happens is that
people take the English

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.180
alphabet, A to Z, and use the
numbers 1 to 26 to try and

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.220
come up with some code.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.160
But you can see that that's
actually nothing like the

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.410
genuine way that Hebrew and
Greek use their numbers.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.930
Because there, in Hebrew and
Greek, we get units, tens, and

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.050
hundreds whereas these codes
that tend to be made up these

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.570
days use just the number 1 to
26, A to Z. And then they

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.140
involve all sorts of bizarre
things like adding people's

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.810
middle names and so on to come
up with present-day figures.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.490
JAMES GRIME: Of course,
we know about the

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.100
associations with 666.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.920
But mathematically speaking,
it's not a particularly

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.210
interesting, exciting number
for its own sake.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.900
It's more of a cultural,
important number.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.400
PETE WATTS: What's very
interesting about this 666 is

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.320
that some manuscript, some other
early manuscripts from

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.690
the third century and so on,
actually have the number 616.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.130
So the number of the beast
in these texts is 616.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.580
Now, what's interesting is
that if you take off this

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.900
final N in Hebrew and
have just Nero

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:17.080
Caesar, that equals 616.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.530
So in other words, people are
saying, I already know that

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.670
the answer is Nero Caesar, but
I'm not sure about how you

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.400
worked it out.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.960
I'm going to correct
it, if you like.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.980
I think the number
ought to be 616.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.690
So in a way, that confirms that
they were thinking of

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.730
Nero Caesar, even from the
second, third century and so

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.780
on, really early on.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.930
So that's a nice bit of evidence
that confirms that,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.210
certainly among the early
Christians, the answer to this

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.850
riddle was Nero Caesar.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.100
