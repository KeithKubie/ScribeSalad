00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.650
[SOUND OF DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.930
Hello, and welcome to the new flat. 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.090
So, moving in here, I am having to buy all new
furniture, 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.290
which has been really fun, actually, 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.590
but I am also finding that my priorities are maybe 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.890
a little skewed in terms of what I want to buy when. 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.980
For example, right now I can't stop thinking
about buying 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
the Philips Hue Light Bulbs, you know,
the really expensive ones 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.500
that connect to the Wi-Fi and you can pick any
color from your phone.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.960
I still haven't got a dining table yet. 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.550
I haven't got anywhere to eat, and I'm thinking
about that. 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.060
I even went through the effort of counting
all of the light bulbs and 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.940
figuring out how much it would cost me

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600
to trick out this entire flat with Wi-Fi lights.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.430
Â£2,100. I'm not gonna do it. I need to buy
somewhere to eat first.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.950
First? I'm not going to do it at all.
Don't do it, Charlie. Don't do it. 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.060
And just so we're completely clear, no, it's not
product placement. 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.360
Obviously it's not. If it was, I'd have the light bulbs,
wouldn't I. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.170
I do really want the design of this place to be
as nice as I can get it, though. 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.470
Like the amount of effort I put into figuring out like

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.890
where the mugs were going to go in relation to
the kettle and the tea bags and the fridge

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.730
to make it so that when you make tea, it involves
as little movement as possible.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.480
It's just kind of obsessive, in a worrying way, really. 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.260
Also, speaking of tea...ahh! 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.900
See, that's what product placement looks like. 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.640
QualiTea mugs I'll put a link in the description
if you'd like one. 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.610
And again on design obsessiveness,
I made the inside of this white 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.980
even though I'll be making less money off
of these because of that. 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.720
Because I know that when you make tea, 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.910
it's easier to tell the strength of tea when the
inside is white. 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.960
So, I'm really hoping my love for tea shines
through in these things.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.360
I've also revamped the design of the QualiTea
T-shirts so that they match the mugs now, 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.980
so you can get one of those too, and that's the
end of my sales pitch. 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.870
Thanks for putting up with it. 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.760
So my list of new furniture that I have managed 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.260
to acquire so far are my sofa, by bed,
and my mattress 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.300
all of which have presented their own
various problems. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.680
With both the sofa and the bed, I did decide
to assemble them by myself 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.140
even though they both clearly said in the
instructions they took

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.830
two or three people to make, but I've always seen that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.270
as less of a requirement and more of a challenge. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.110
And with the mattress, the poor delivery man
had to do 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.240
quite a lot of bending and squeezing to pack
that thing into the lift and get it up here

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.010
that by the time he finally did drop the thing off
in the bedroom, 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.250
he looked at me just like completely exhausted,
and he said, 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.120
"Whenever you get lucky on this thing,
please think of me." 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.200
And the worst part is that I did once,
and it was just briefly, but all the same. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.380
Thanks for the mattress, though. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.480
Generally, though, my experience of living here
so far has been absolutely lovely.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.830
My favorite thing being that for some reason
in this apartment complex, 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.710
there are a lot of cats just sort of roaming free. 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.100
There was genuinely this one time when I was
on my way out, 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
and a little cat followed me into the lift on the
my down. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.010
And to start with, I was kind of worried.
I was like, 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.840
"Is this okay? Am allowed to be taking this cat
down with me?" 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.490
But then I looked at the little guy, and he was like
so chill about the whole thing.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.650
We got to the ground floor, the doors opened,
he just sauntered out, and I thought two things 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.730
Firstly: that cat has probably ridden that lift more
times than I have. 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.250
He's more comfortable doing it than me. 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
And secondly: I just rid in a lift with a cat.
How cool is that? 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.200
Dude, I've got like three other things to talk about, 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200
but I feel like I'm already going to cut a lot
of stuff out of this, 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.850
so I guess I'll see you next time. 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.310
I've had a busy week. That's nice.
Anyway, goodbye. 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.660
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.370
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.380
Thank you very much for watching. 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.470
Here's my previous video just in case you missed it. 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.630
I mean, yes, at its core, the video is just a list of
five films that I watched, 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.800
but there is a bit more to it than that, I promise. 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.570
I tried to do a list with a bit more depth. 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.270
I'm really not selling this thing. That's fine. 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.020
It means you'll go in with low expectations,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.820
and then it will be really great or you won't
click on it all, which is also fine. 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.330
I can live with that. At least I tried. 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.570
Okay, bye! 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.455
