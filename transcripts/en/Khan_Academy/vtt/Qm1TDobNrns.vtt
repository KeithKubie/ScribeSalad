00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're going to think

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.600
about what the derivative
with respect to x

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.767
of the natural log of x's.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.716
And I'm gonna go straight
to the punch line.

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:13.179
It is equal to one over x.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.375
In a future video, I'm
actually going to prove this.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:16.783
It's a little bit involved.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.367
But in this one, we're
just going to appreciate

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:21.092
that this seems like it is actually true.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:22.975
So right here is the graph

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:26.142
of y is equal to the natural log of x.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.958
And just to feel good about the statement,

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.341
let's try to approximate

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.808
what the slope of the tangent
line is at different points.

00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:38.116
So let's say right over here,

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.075
when x is equal to one,

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.800
what does the slope of the
tangent line look like?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.200
Well, it looks like here,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.183
the slope looks like it is equal,

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:48.692
pretty close to being equal to one,

00:00:48.692 --> 00:00:50.292
which is consistent with the statement.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.933
If x is equal to one, one
over one is still one,

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.875
and that seems like what
we see right over there.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:58.783
What about when x is equal to two?

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.900
Well, this point right over
here is the natural log of two,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.271
but more interestingly,
what's the slope here?

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.667
Well, it looks like,

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.475
let's see, if I try to
draw a tangent line,

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.608
the slop of the tangent line
looks pretty close to 1/2.

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:15.200
Well, once again, that is one over x.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.667
One over two is 1/2.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:17.800
Let's keep doing this.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.817
If I go right over here,
when x is equal to four,

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:24.949
this point is four comma
natural log of four,

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:27.425
but the slope of the tangent line here

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.392
looks pretty close to 1/4

00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:33.976
and if you accept this, it is exactly 1/4,

00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:36.292
and you could even go
to values less than one.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.754
Right over here, when x is equal to 1/2,

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:42.208
one over 1/2, the slope should be two.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:43.449
And it does indeed, let me do this

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:45.034
in a slightly different color,

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:49.201
it does indeed look like
the slope is two over there.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.250
So once again, you take the derivative

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.184
with respect to x of the natural
log of x, it is one over x.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.200
And hopefully, you get a sense

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.992
that that is actually true here.

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:02.504
In a future video,
we'll actually prove it.
