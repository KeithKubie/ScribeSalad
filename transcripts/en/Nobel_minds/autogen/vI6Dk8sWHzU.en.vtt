00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509
and and I I don't think they were doing
 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.439
and and I I don't think they were doing
it to cheat people but they had the view

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449
it to cheat people but they had the view
 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.360
it to cheat people but they had the view
that headquarters didn't know what they

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370
that headquarters didn't know what they
 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.339
that headquarters didn't know what they
were doing and so you know they had to

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349
were doing and so you know they had to
 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.070
were doing and so you know they had to
somehow adjust you know not send the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080
somehow adjust you know not send the
 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.899
somehow adjust you know not send the
numbers that were true but send some

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909
numbers that were true but send some
 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.939
numbers that were true but send some
other number so that that would kind of

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949
other number so that that would kind of
 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.550
other number so that that would kind of
correct what the headquarters thought

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560
correct what the headquarters thought
 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.950
correct what the headquarters thought
about so I could see that there were you

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960
about so I could see that there were you
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.260
about so I could see that there were you
know the two sides of the problem was to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270
know the two sides of the problem was to
 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.990
know the two sides of the problem was to
neither side somehow had the full

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000
neither side somehow had the full
 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.360
neither side somehow had the full
information and and this was a

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
information and and this was a
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.529
information and and this was a
complicated problem completely swamp in

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539
complicated problem completely swamp in
 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.749
complicated problem completely swamp in
the problem of actually calculating this

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759
the problem of actually calculating this
 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.450
the problem of actually calculating this
gigantic you know model which itself was

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
gigantic you know model which itself was
 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.240
gigantic you know model which itself was
of course complicated so I suggested

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250
of course complicated so I suggested
 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.540
of course complicated so I suggested
that let's scan it and subsequently

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550
that let's scan it and subsequently
 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.510
that let's scan it and subsequently
heard they they thought for a moment to

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520
heard they they thought for a moment to
 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.619
heard they they thought for a moment to
fire me but the CFO saved me and said

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629
fire me but the CFO saved me and said
 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.719
fire me but the CFO saved me and said
let's put him to work on something else

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729
let's put him to work on something else
 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.350
let's put him to work on something else
and something else was very small models

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360
and something else was very small models
 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.439
and something else was very small models
incentive models and you know various

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449
incentive models and you know various
 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.409
incentive models and you know various
you know versions of how do we

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419
you know versions of how do we
 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.149
you know versions of how do we
incentivize these people in the right

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159
incentivize these people in the right
 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.629

so on and and then I got the lucky draw

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729
so on and and then I got the lucky draw
 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.300
so on and and then I got the lucky draw
which was I was awarded a scholarship to

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310
which was I was awarded a scholarship to
 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.129

and the lucky draw really wasn't just

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
and the lucky draw really wasn't just
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.050
and the lucky draw really wasn't just
Stanford it was that that I realized

first I thought it was gibberish
 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.820

Republicans you know maybe this but I'm
going to start with a simple paper

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.430
going to start with a simple paper
 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.360
going to start with a simple paper
performance story you know the way we

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.370
performance story you know the way we
 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.520
performance story you know the way we
studied it in the early days and by the

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.530
studied it in the early days and by the
 

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.370
studied it in the early days and by the
way Wilson wrote a very early paper on

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.380
way Wilson wrote a very early paper on
 

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.250

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.120
it in 69 and Steve Rose another friend
in 6a 73 and so on so there was a

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.130
in 6a 73 and so on so there was a
 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.110
in 6a 73 and so on so there was a
literature that I began with and I will

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120
literature that I began with and I will
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.300
literature that I began with and I will
start from that literature and then show

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.310
start from that literature and then show
 

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:23.490
start from that literature and then show
you how I developed it together with Coe

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.500
you how I developed it together with Coe
 

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.670
you how I developed it together with Coe
orders how I developed in it further

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680
orders how I developed in it further
 

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.340

into the view that I was just suggesting
 

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.710
into the view that I was just suggesting

that that this problem is much more than
 

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.250
that that this problem is much more than
about pay for performance so I call it

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:38.260
about pay for performance so I call it

I decided to take it away because I'm

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:47.860
I decided to take it away because I'm
 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.100
I decided to take it away because I'm
trying to explain it it's a it's a

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.110
trying to explain it it's a it's a
 

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.800
trying to explain it it's a it's a

of a c2 a complicated situation where

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.470
of a c2 a complicated situation where
 

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.009
of a c2 a complicated situation where
there's just one principle a boss say an

there's just one principle a boss say an

there's just one principle a boss say an
employee is the agent the employer is

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:03.850
employee is the agent the employer is
 

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.180
employee is the agent the employer is
the boss it could be a client who is the

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.190
the boss it could be a client who is the
 

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.199
the boss it could be a client who is the
is the boss in the case of hiring a

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:13.209
is the boss in the case of hiring a
 

00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:16.230
is the boss in the case of hiring a
lawyer who is the agent it could be the

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240
lawyer who is the agent it could be the
 

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.019
lawyer who is the agent it could be the
board which is the boss and the CEO who

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:19.029
board which is the boss and the CEO who
 

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:23.730
board which is the boss and the CEO who
is the agent and so on this is a model

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:23.740
is the agent and so on this is a model
 

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.949
is the agent and so on this is a model
that kind of just studies the question

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959
that kind of just studies the question
 

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:28.259
that kind of just studies the question
of what kind of incentive pay would be

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:28.269
of what kind of incentive pay would be
 

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:31.499
of what kind of incentive pay would be
suitable in a very generic context and

00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:31.509
suitable in a very generic context and
 

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:34.379
suitable in a very generic context and
there are two difficulties that makes

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:34.389
there are two difficulties that makes
 

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:38.040
there are two difficulties that makes
the model so the is the interest of the

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.050
the model so the is the interest of the
 

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.730
the model so the is the interest of the
model and that is preferences are not

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:41.740
model and that is preferences are not
 

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.900
model and that is preferences are not
aligned and performance are imperfectly

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:45.910
aligned and performance are imperfectly
 

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.340
aligned and performance are imperfectly
measured and these two things make the

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.350
measured and these two things make the
 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.610
measured and these two things make the
problem a complication and I come to

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.620
problem a complication and I come to
 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.150
problem a complication and I come to
that just in a second but then secondly

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160

days that the incentive is as I said

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.370
days that the incentive is as I said
 

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.670
days that the incentive is as I said
just the contract the paste may be based

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680
just the contract the paste may be based
 

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.949
just the contract the paste may be based
on measured performance which as I said

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:07.959
on measured performance which as I said
 

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:12.030

just a moment ago was imperfect so

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040
just a moment ago was imperfect so

just a moment ago was imperfect so
that's the setup and it's good usually

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:14.709
that's the setup and it's good usually
 

00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:16.319
that's the setup and it's good usually
we usually start by saying what is the

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:16.329
we usually start by saying what is the
 

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.110
we usually start by saying what is the
first best meaning what if they didn't

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120
first best meaning what if they didn't
 

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.819
first best meaning what if they didn't
have these problems what would be the

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:20.829
have these problems what would be the
 

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.340
have these problems what would be the
solution and actually too much already

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.350
solution and actually too much already
 

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.439
solution and actually too much already
mention it but the first best cases are

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:25.449
mention it but the first best cases are
 

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:28.079
mention it but the first best cases are
- actually there are three but I want to

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:28.089
- actually there are three but I want to
 

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:31.110
- actually there are three but I want to
just mention two agents choice is

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120
just mention two agents choice is
 

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.179
just mention two agents choice is
verifiable so we can actually observe

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:33.189
verifiable so we can actually observe
 

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:34.769
verifiable so we can actually observe
what you are doing what the employee is

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:34.779
what you are doing what the employee is
 

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.780
what you are doing what the employee is
doing in that case the contract is just

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:36.790
doing in that case the contract is just
 

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.660
doing in that case the contract is just
written so that it says do this or then

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:39.670
written so that it says do this or then
 

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.970
written so that it says do this or then
you don't get any pay or do you get to

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980
you don't get any pay or do you get to
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.590
you don't get any pay or do you get to
punishment or something like that so

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600
punishment or something like that so
 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.809
punishment or something like that so
it's a and then because the agent

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:45.819
it's a and then because the agent
 

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:49.100
it's a and then because the agent
typically is risk averse and that's a I

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
typically is risk averse and that's a I
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.170
typically is risk averse and that's a I
didn't mention the risk aversion or yeah

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.180
didn't mention the risk aversion or yeah
 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.670
didn't mention the risk aversion or yeah
it's a preference are not aligned I

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680
it's a preference are not aligned I
 

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.360
it's a preference are not aligned I
should that means

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.370
should that means
 

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.340
should that means
because the agent is risk-averse and the

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.350
because the agent is risk-averse and the
 

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.740
because the agent is risk-averse and the
principle is this neutral so the agent

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:58.750
principle is this neutral so the agent
 

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.150
principle is this neutral so the agent
doesn't like to carry risk so the ideal

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160
doesn't like to carry risk so the ideal
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.820
doesn't like to carry risk so the ideal
is to pay the agent a fixed rate if the

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:05.830
is to pay the agent a fixed rate if the
 

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.070
is to pay the agent a fixed rate if the
intern didn't have any action that would

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.080
intern didn't have any action that would
 

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.740
intern didn't have any action that would
have to be incentivized the other case

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
have to be incentivized the other case
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.510
have to be incentivized the other case
is where the agent is risk neutral in

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:12.520
is where the agent is risk neutral in
 

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.500
is where the agent is risk neutral in
which case though doesn't worry about

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:16.510
which case though doesn't worry about
 

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.750
which case though doesn't worry about
the risk and therefore could carry the

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760
the risk and therefore could carry the
 

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.600
the risk and therefore could carry the
whole the whole risk for himself this is

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:21.610
whole the whole risk for himself this is
 

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.570
whole the whole risk for himself this is
the case we call a rental agreement or

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.580
the case we call a rental agreement or
 

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.390
the case we call a rental agreement or

me say my contribution to this this part
 

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.829
me say my contribution to this this part
was to try to understand how this model

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
was to try to understand how this model
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:17.040
was to try to understand how this model
was thinking this is a very big part of

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.050
was thinking this is a very big part of
 

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.850
was thinking this is a very big part of
the way I look at this theory it's a

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:20.860
the way I look at this theory it's a
 

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.820
the way I look at this theory it's a
it's an experiment it's crucial to try

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:23.830
it's an experiment it's crucial to try
 

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.130
it's an experiment it's crucial to try
to understand what how the model thinks

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.140
to understand what how the model thinks
 

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.940
to understand what how the model thinks
and then if we can't do that then that's

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:29.950
and then if we can't do that then that's
 

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.640
and then if we can't do that then that's
not a model that I typically like to

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:32.650
not a model that I typically like to
 

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.690
not a model that I typically like to
work on so and I emphasize the fact that

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:36.700
work on so and I emphasize the fact that
 

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.480
work on so and I emphasize the fact that
sometimes you think you understand it

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.490
sometimes you think you understand it
 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.620
sometimes you think you understand it
but you actually don't

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:40.630
but you actually don't
 

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.350
but you actually don't
so this informativeness principle may

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360
so this informativeness principle may
 

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.140
so this informativeness principle may
sound very simple so it says that I

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.150
sound very simple so it says that I
 

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.090
sound very simple so it says that I
asked the question or actually it was

asking what should the incentives can
 

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.510
asking what should the incentives can
look like one preceding question is what

both papers were published together in

the same volume but what is not so
trivial about this is that a lot of

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240
trivial about this is that a lot of

people actually thought at the time this
 

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.210
people actually thought at the time this
is not the case so the goal in view was

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:30.220

about what you are doing then it's
 

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:38.579
about what you are doing then it's
worthless so this is of in that sense a

another way of looking at it is to look

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480
another way of looking at it is to look
 

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.530
another way of looking at it is to look
at an old accounting principle so if you

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:49.540
at an old accounting principle so if you
 

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.420
at an old accounting principle so if you
read accounting books in the times they

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:51.430
read accounting books in the times they
 

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.040
read accounting books in the times they
would say pain should only depend on

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.050
would say pain should only depend on
 

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.150
would say pain should only depend on
variables that the agent can control

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160
variables that the agent can control
 

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.960
variables that the agent can control
sounds like a very sensible principle -

00:13:59.960 --> 00:13:59.970
sounds like a very sensible principle -
 

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.160
sounds like a very sensible principle -
but if you look at the relative

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.170
but if you look at the relative
 

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.629
but if you look at the relative
performance to take one of the

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639
performance to take one of the
 

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.189
performance to take one of the
applications of the informativeness

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199
applications of the informativeness
 

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:08.009
applications of the informativeness
principle you will see that relative

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:08.019
principle you will see that relative
 

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:09.780
principle you will see that relative
performance means that if you do

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:09.790
performance means that if you do
 

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.480
performance means that if you do
something and I'm paying you for it

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.490
something and I'm paying you for it
 

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.639
something and I'm paying you for it
I may want to see somebody else who

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:14.649
I may want to see somebody else who
 

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:16.530
I may want to see somebody else who
doing something similar to you and

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:16.540
doing something similar to you and
 

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.160
doing something similar to you and
taking seeing how well is that person

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.170
taking seeing how well is that person
 

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.800
taking seeing how well is that person
doing and then based on that decide

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:22.810
doing and then based on that decide
 

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.889
doing and then based on that decide
whether to pay you a lot or little or or

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:25.899
whether to pay you a lot or little or or
 

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.110
whether to pay you a lot or little or or
adjust the payment by sort of the

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120
adjust the payment by sort of the
 

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.960
adjust the payment by sort of the
circumstances and the point is that

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:29.970
circumstances and the point is that
 

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.810
circumstances and the point is that
because the agent is not the sole

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:36.820
because the agent is not the sole
 

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.569
because the agent is not the sole
producer of the performance measure this

00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:39.579
producer of the performance measure this
 

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.939
producer of the performance measure this
lock is a bad luck or good luck that

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:41.949
lock is a bad luck or good luck that
 

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:44.060
lock is a bad luck or good luck that
also affects the performance measure

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.070
also affects the performance measure
 

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.759
also affects the performance measure
then filtering out something about that

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:47.769
then filtering out something about that
 

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:50.519
then filtering out something about that
noise that shouldn't be there to get a

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:50.529
noise that shouldn't be there to get a
 

00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:52.559

better and more perfect performance

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:52.569
better and more perfect performance
 

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:54.689
better and more perfect performance
measure that's where the relative

00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:54.699
measure that's where the relative
 

00:14:54.699 --> 00:14:57.870
measure that's where the relative
performance is very very valuable so

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880
performance is very very valuable so
 

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.240
performance is very very valuable so
actually taking something the agent

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.250
actually taking something the agent
 

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.579
actually taking something the agent
cannot control helps me take out

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:02.589
cannot control helps me take out
 

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:04.500
cannot control helps me take out
something that the agent can't control

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.510
something that the agent can't control
 

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.689
something that the agent can't control
in the original measure that's the logic

00:15:06.689 --> 00:15:06.699
in the original measure that's the logic
 

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:09.300
in the original measure that's the logic
of why it is actually good and thereby

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.310
of why it is actually good and thereby
 

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.829
of why it is actually good and thereby
reducing the risk and when so the

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839
reducing the risk and when so the
 

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.600
reducing the risk and when so the
controllability principle got to be

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.610
controllability principle got to be
 

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.819
controllability principle got to be
adjusted accountants change their the

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:17.829
adjusted accountants change their the
 

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:19.920
adjusted accountants change their the
way they define controllability the

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:19.930
way they define controllability the
 

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.870
way they define controllability the
measure becomes more control

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880
measure becomes more control
 

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.820

I think the informativeness principle

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560
I think the informativeness principle
 

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.730
I think the informativeness principle
would be talked about as much I'm not

and we this was you talked about ten

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.220

so and we sort of figured out it was a
 

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.440

I think actually we spent three hours

I think actually we spent three hours
 

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.150
I think actually we spent three hours
but yeah so a very simple answer the

doing theory we do theory to listen to

doing theory we do theory to listen to

doing theory we do theory to listen to
what the model says and then we go and

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860
what the model says and then we go and
 

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.980
what the model says and then we go and
find out by saying it and in this case

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:48.990
find out by saying it and in this case
 

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.680
find out by saying it and in this case
it led to the insight that we were

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:51.690
it led to the insight that we were
 

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.650
it led to the insight that we were
looking at the wrong kinds of models so

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:54.660
looking at the wrong kinds of models so
 

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.950
looking at the wrong kinds of models so
the models we want to ask in this case

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960
the models we want to ask in this case
 

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.140
the models we want to ask in this case

or against the molle scheme but I don't
 

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.460
or against the molle scheme but I don't
want to speak about the linear model

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.470
want to speak about the linear model
 

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.850
want to speak about the linear model
except to say that the thing that the

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860
except to say that the thing that the
 

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.600
except to say that the thing that the
thing that caught the eye of Paul and me

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:26.610
thing that caught the eye of Paul and me
 

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.230
thing that caught the eye of Paul and me
was the fact that that the first of all

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240
was the fact that that the first of all
 

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.800
was the fact that that the first of all
the linear model worked logically you

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:33.810
the linear model worked logically you
 

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.350
the linear model worked logically you
know it you ask you two questions you

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360
know it you ask you two questions you
 

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.050
know it you ask you two questions you
know what about if there's less risk

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:39.060
know what about if there's less risk
 

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.150
know what about if there's less risk
well then you can pay the agent or

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.160
well then you can pay the agent or
 

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.920
well then you can pay the agent or
steeper incentive because the agent is

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:42.930
steeper incentive because the agent is
 

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.470
steeper incentive because the agent is
risk aversion what if the the agent is

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480
risk aversion what if the the agent is
 

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.100
risk aversion what if the the agent is
less risk-averse then you also pay a

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.110
less risk-averse then you also pay a
 

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.840
less risk-averse then you also pay a
steeper incentive that is a higher

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:50.850
steeper incentive that is a higher
 

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.720
steeper incentive that is a higher
Commission what if the value of the

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:53.730
Commission what if the value of the
 

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.940
Commission what if the value of the
agents effort is high all these are

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:55.950
agents effort is high all these are
 

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.010
agents effort is high all these are
right answers let me just explain if you

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020
right answers let me just explain if you
 

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.490
right answers let me just explain if you
had asked these questions for the first

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:00.500
had asked these questions for the first
 

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.940
had asked these questions for the first
first or the the first model I was

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:04.950
first or the the first model I was
 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.160
first or the the first model I was
talking about you would get no one solo

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.170
talking about you would get no one solo
 

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.770
talking about you would get no one solo
you could get completely crazy answers

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780
you could get completely crazy answers
 

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.000
you could get completely crazy answers
so the thing that is however hidden in

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.010
so the thing that is however hidden in
 

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.700
so the thing that is however hidden in
this answer and and and that shows that

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:16.710
this answer and and and that shows that
 

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.010
this answer and and and that shows that
when you look at this model in detail is

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020
when you look at this model in detail is
 

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.950
when you look at this model in detail is
that that there was a little detail in

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960
that that there was a little detail in
 

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.900
that that there was a little detail in
the story that we had ignored sort of

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:23.910
the story that we had ignored sort of
 

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.960
the story that we had ignored sort of
for ten years at least in in in this

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:26.970
for ten years at least in in in this
 

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.320
for ten years at least in in in this
which is that it also depended how much

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.330
which is that it also depended how much
 

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.680
which is that it also depended how much
bang for the buck you get if you raise

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:33.690
bang for the buck you get if you raise
 

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.260
bang for the buck you get if you raise
the incentive and this comes from the

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:36.270
the incentive and this comes from the
 

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.270
the incentive and this comes from the
agents cost function and it became

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280
agents cost function and it became
 

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.000
agents cost function and it became
important because it meant that actually

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.010
important because it meant that actually
 

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.040
important because it meant that actually
you have another instrument than paying

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.050
you have another instrument than paying
 

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.140
you have another instrument than paying
the agent you can also perhaps change

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.150
the agent you can also perhaps change
 

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.720
the agent you can also perhaps change
the cost function of the agent so we got

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:47.730
the cost function of the agent so we got
 

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.480
the cost function of the agent so we got
into the idea of multitasking the idea

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.490
into the idea of multitasking the idea
 

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.330
into the idea of multitasking the idea
of multiple instruments and so let me

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340
of multiple instruments and so let me
 

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.530
of multiple instruments and so let me
give just a short review of the

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:57.540
give just a short review of the
 

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.960
give just a short review of the
multitasking or some examples when you

00:23:59.960 --> 00:23:59.970
multitasking or some examples when you
 

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.510
multitasking or some examples when you
have many tasks and in the game sort of

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520
have many tasks and in the game sort of
 

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.060

us changed completely it was not about

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.070
us changed completely it was not about
 

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.060

level effort it's about do do people

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.070
level effort it's about do do people
 

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.050

allocate their effort correctly and it's

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.060
allocate their effort correctly and it's
 

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.760
allocate their effort correctly and it's
actually challenging because there are

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:13.770
actually challenging because there are
 

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.320
actually challenging because there are
some tasks that are very easy to

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:15.330
some tasks that are very easy to
 

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.239
some tasks that are very easy to
and there are some types of harder

00:24:17.239 --> 00:24:17.249
and there are some types of harder
 

00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:19.999
and there are some types of harder
missile and you can you have to sort of

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:20.009
missile and you can you have to sort of
 

00:24:20.009 --> 00:24:24.019
missile and you can you have to sort of
consider the fact that even though you

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:24.029
consider the fact that even though you
 

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:27.409
consider the fact that even though you
can easily observe one if you race a

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419
can easily observe one if you race a
 

00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:29.749
can easily observe one if you race a
take the quantity versus quality but

00:24:29.749 --> 00:24:29.759
take the quantity versus quality but
 

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:31.220
take the quantity versus quality but
quantity usual is easy to measure

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.230
quantity usual is easy to measure
 

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.080
quantity usual is easy to measure
quality is hard to measure if you raise

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.090
quality is hard to measure if you raise
 

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.639
quality is hard to measure if you raise
the the incentive on call on quantity

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:36.649
the the incentive on call on quantity
 

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:39.590
the the incentive on call on quantity
then that makes it harder to incentivize

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600
then that makes it harder to incentivize
 

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.450
then that makes it harder to incentivize
quality and in fact in the first

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460
quality and in fact in the first
 

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.729
quality and in fact in the first
instance agent will allocate away effort

00:24:43.729 --> 00:24:43.739
instance agent will allocate away effort
 

00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:47.389
instance agent will allocate away effort
from quality into quantity and we will

00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399
from quality into quantity and we will
 

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:49.430
from quality into quantity and we will
see many examples like at the same

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440
see many examples like at the same
 

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.700

decisions if we push the short term you

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:54.269
decisions if we push the short term you
 

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:55.879
decisions if we push the short term you
will have a problem with the long term

00:24:55.879 --> 00:24:55.889
will have a problem with the long term
 

00:24:55.889 --> 00:25:02.109
will have a problem with the long term
and so on and and so let me jump to the

00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:02.119
and so on and and so let me jump to the
