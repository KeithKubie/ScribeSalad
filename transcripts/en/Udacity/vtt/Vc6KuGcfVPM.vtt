00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.890
In the previous project, you learned
how to construct models of data, and

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.350
then use those models to generate
predictions about the future.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.030
In this unit, we're going to cover
one of the methods for doing that,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.790
called supervised learning.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.805
Supervised learning is a type of machine
learning where we feed our system what

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.385
we call labeled examples.

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:20.185
Labeled examples means we give the
system some information that it uses to

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.245
understand the data
that we're giving it.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.115
So for example if we were building our
system to recognize my face, we would

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.185
give it some pictures of my face and
some pictures of other people's faces.

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.455
And we would actually tell the system
these pictures are of David and

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:34.190
these pictures are of somebody else.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.510
And it would use that information to
develop its understanding over time.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.790
In other domains,
we would see things like in health care,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.330
we would give it some
examples of patients.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.580
And we would tell it whether or

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.380
not those patients ended
up with a certain disease.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.910
Or in education, we would give
it examples of students and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.040
tell it whether or not each of those
students actually ended up graduating.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.280
So the system is using some information
that we give it about the success or

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080
failure of those different examples to
construct its understanding about what

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.460
leads to that success or failure.
