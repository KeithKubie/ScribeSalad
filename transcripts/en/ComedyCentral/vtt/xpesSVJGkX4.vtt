00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.003
- UH... OH, YES.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:03.971
GREAT.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.105
OH, GOT IT.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.141

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:10.677
HELLO.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.279
IS SOMEONE THERE?

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.348
LISTEN, I'M ARMED AND I'VE GOT
AIDS, SO IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.449
- WHAT?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.618
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL

HEY, LISTEN,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.822
THEY'RE MAKING ME BREAK OUT.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.557
I CAN'T REALLY SEE ANYTHING.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.525
I GOT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.026
- SEE, I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM MONTEZ.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.829
SAYS THAT JILLIAN IS GOING
AROUND FIRING PEOPLE.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.564
- WELL, YEAH. SHE IS.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.798
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.334
RUDY SAYS, "WHEN YOU LEAVE
THE THIRD STRING KICKER

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.671
IN THE QUARTERBACK'S POSITION,
SOMEONE'S GONNA GET SACKED."

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.439
- OKAY. JUST SHUT UP
AND FOLLOW ME.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:40.941
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.776
- OKAY. WOULD YOU TAKE
MY HAND ACTUALLY?

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.911
- HEY, ALICE, HOLD UP.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:44.878
- WHAT?

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.046
- ONE THING RIGHT QUICK.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.080
- WHAT'S UP?

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.750
- ADAM, GET DOWN FROM THERE
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.752
- I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.053
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.256
WHICH IS ABOUT TO END
BECAUSE YOU FIRED ME, ALICE.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.861
SO HEAR ME, WORLD, 'CAUSE
THESE ARE MY LAST WORDS.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.631
IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING FROM ADAM
"THE TOP GUN" DEMAMP'S LIFE,

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.133
TAKE THIS.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.236
TAKE IT SLEAZY.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.404
AND I'M OUT.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.839
WRITE THAT DOWN.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.407
"TAKE IT SLEAZY AND I'M OUT"
ARE MY LAST WORDS.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.508
AND I'M KILLING MYSELF.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.910
- WHAT THE HELL DOES
ANY OF THAT EVEN MEAN?

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.145
- TAKE IT SLEAZY!

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.146
- [thuds]

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.815
- OH, NO!

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.085
OH, ADAM! OH, NO!

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.155
WHY WOULD HE--
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.756
YOU SHOULD'VE PUT ME IN CHARGE.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.961
- HEY. IT'S A DUMMY,
YOU BLIND IDIOT.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.963
- WAIT, WHAT?

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.432
both: WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HERE
WAS NOT REAL.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:43.103
THIS WAS A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT
STRANGE TURNS LIFE CAN TAKE

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.272
WHEN THE POWERS THAT BE MAKE
DUMB DECISIONS...

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.240
- ...STUPID

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.141
DECISIONS.
DUMB DECISION?

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.443
- STUPID DECISIONS.
- STUPID DECISIONS.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:54.548
both: SO PUT YOUR FEARS ASIDE,
FOR ADAM IS ALIVE.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.018
- HEY.
