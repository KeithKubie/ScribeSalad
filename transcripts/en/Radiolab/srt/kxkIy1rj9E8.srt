You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,503
from

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,580
W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P.
R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi,

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,340
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab,
the podcast. Yes. Nick,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,510
you were a little off our game right
now because we are not in our normal

6
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,880
studio. We're actually in
Detroit right now. We're on tour.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,400
We're in the first leg of our
tour. It's super fun going well,

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,080
but we do have an interesting
podcast for you who you do indeed,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,470
but it might be more efficient
if we go back to New York. We're,

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,500
Soren wheeler is standing by because he
and I had a conversation with someone.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,830
We can just, yes. Yeah. Do you want to,
do you want to carry it forward? Sure.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,460
Do it.

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,460
So today we have a story of an obsession
that deep swallowed reporter Dan Ingber

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,500
and disappeared pretty much whole of
all the things to catch your attention.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,450
How did this happen to pop into your head?

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,740
It happened to pop into my head because
I was talking to a friend of mine who's

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,280
an elementary school teacher and
we were discussing quicksand as,

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,450
as one does. Oh Gosh, it's elementary
school teacher and I, and she just said,

19
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,420
you know, the kids in my class
just don't even, they don't,

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,990
they've never heard of quicksand. Like
second graders, third grade. Like what?

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,580
Nine year old, 10 year old. Fourth
grade is prime time for quicksand.

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,380
Right when I was nine, quicksand
was a major part of my life. Yeah.

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,980
We live, you know, poor water in the
corner of the sandbox and say, oh,

24
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:29,210
it's quicksand, but you're your teacher
friends. Students didn't, right.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,970
But so I went to, to
her, I visited her class.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,440
I might discover that she was wrong.
Almost all of them had heard of quicksand,

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,480
but she was right in so far as quicksand
was not important to them. In fact,

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,640
they thought it wasn't scary
at all. And I was like, well,

29
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,830
what are you afraid of?
And they said, you know,

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,460
zombies, the alien in Pacific Rim Ghost,

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,180
when I was actually lost a writing
being attacked by a dinosaur,

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,740
that would be totally more scary.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,080
So we actually went and talked to some
third graders and while some of them

34
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,380
said,

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,630
well, I guess it's Sorta scary, but

36
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,450
most of them weren't scared of it at all.

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,030
I don't think so. I usually
don't think about it.

38
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,060
They thought it was something that
maybe their parents had been afraid of.

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,370
They told me that when he was little,
his friends always said like, look out.

40
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,510
That could be quicksand.

41
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,570
Friends ever say that to you? Yeah,

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,050
they would say people used to be scared
of that, but it's not scary anymore.

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,550
So that got me to thinking what happened?

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,130
Why is quicksand not scary the way it
used to be? And with that simple question,

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,450
Dan got sucked into a world
he never even knew existed.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,310
So the next step was going to the Internet
and within a minute I discovered the

47
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:45,640
quicksand fetish. Community
it quick fetish. Yeah,

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,890
like fetish fetish. Like
sex fetish. Yes. Oh,

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,210
so then so in the quick, among
the quicksand fetishists,

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,130
there are so called sinkers.

51
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,670
These are people who seek out quicksand
in nature and want to jump in with

52
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,400
another person and kiss or are by
themselves with no clothes on or,

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,740
or is the sex part some of them
by themselves with no clothes on,

54
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,770
some smaller group with another person.

55
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,160
That's if they can convince
their partner to come with them.

56
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,180
But they always have a rope with
them, I hope. Oh yeah. Oh, if you go,

57
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,850
if you go onto the sinkers message boards,

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,610
there's a Google map which has sinking
spots all over the world and each one is

59
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:31,530
rated for, you know, thickness,
depth, privacy available,

60
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,600
parking nearby. I mean, it's a really,

61
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:37,340
it's been very thought through and,

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,200
and wonderfully collaborative community.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,200
So there's sinkers in one hand
and then there are the watchers.

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,380
They just want to see people where
animals sinking into quicksand.

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,300
So they'll watch movies and just find
the quicksand sequence in the movie.

66
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,180
And here's where Dan sunk even d
because he discovered that one of these

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,283
watchers,

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,850
this guy crypto had in the course of his
fetishistic quicksand watching Colada

69
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,340
dis, you know, this list of,

70
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,380
of well over a thousand quicksand
scenes in film and television,

71
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,750
this part of the country.

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,540
There were scenes going all the way
back to the birth of filmmaking. I mean,

73
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,510
this is the greatest impetus for
scientific research to take off your shoe.

74
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,260
And if you have to like a
fetishistic interest in the data.

75
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,500
And Dan thought maybe this data can give
us a clue about how the way we think

76
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,460
about quicksand has changed.

77
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,490
So I went through and I pulled out every
feature film from the list and then

78
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,190
with information from the MPA,

79
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:52,610
I figured out how many movies
were being released every decade.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,460
And then I sort of computed a,

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,240
like what percent of movies had quicksand?

82
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,710
And every decade going back to, uh,

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,840
the first quicksand movie they
have is from 19 Tino nine.

84
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,850
It's a silent film where a woman gets
rescued from quicksand by some hooded

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,910
monks. I'm unable to find this
movie, but I'd love to see it.

86
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,390
I don't know what it's
about. Um, but anyways,

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,060
I s I started looking at the number of
movies by decade and the beginning of the

88
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,800
century, it's like one
in a thousand movies.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,640
By the 30s it's up to one in 500 and then
in the forties one and 200 and then in

90
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,791
the 1960s all of a sudden it just shoots
up like one in 35 like almost 3% of

91
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,180
Hollywood movies have quicksand.

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,010
The 1960s are just clearly
a moment for quicksand

93
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,750
and Dan says it wasn't
just the number of films,

94
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,020
the quicksand scenes that showed up
in the 60s were serious dramatic seas.

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,850
For example, Lawrence of Arabia
where Peter Ode tool is, you know,

96
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,100
pushing through the dust storm to try
to save his companions is being sucked

97
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:06,934
under.

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,630
That movie won seven Oscars and then

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,280
women in the dunes came out this like art,

100
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,900
see Japanese existentialist meditation.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
And for about the next 10 years,

102
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:32,781
Dan says you had all these serious films
that featured quicksand and then it

103
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,740
fell off dramatically in the 1970s.

104
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:41,741
It's already fallen to something like
one out of 75 and then by the 1980s,

105
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:47,480
it's like one out of 130. And then
in the 90s, quicksand is mostly gone.

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,753
Huh.

107
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,090
And I think also in the 80s that
had migrated into help television,

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,770
I'm stuck in quicksand. Boy.
Yeah, you have a one bad day.

109
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,820
Larry and Belky and perfect strangers
are falling into quicken sand.

110
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,320
There's quick sand in my
little [inaudible] pony.

111
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,520
It's quicksand in Rainbow
Pride. I mean, it's Zany.

112
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,980
Quicksand basically dances.

113
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,100
Quicksand had become a joke. And so,

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,420
and that's the end, I think when,
when quicksands in, you know,

115
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,580
Saturday cartoons, I think,

116
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,370
I do think that adventure
gags probably have, um,

117
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,280
a lifespan. So just for a gut check,

118
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,040
Dan and I decided maybe we should run
this past somebody who knows the business.

119
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,070
I'm Carlton cuse and I'm a television
writer and producer and Carlton was

120
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:48,010
actually the showrunner
for the TV show lost.

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,210
And that's a show that by rights
should have tons of quicksand. I mean,

122
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,700
absolutely, they should be in
quicksand all the time. They're on,

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,940
they're stranded on a tropical
island. It's an adventure show.

124
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,930
But according to Carlton, whenever one
of the writers would say, you know, okay,

125
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:06,520
so Kate goes running down a path and
then all of a sudden she falls into a pit

126
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:10,600
of quicksand. The rest of
them would be like, um,

127
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,910
um, uh, I don't know if we
can really pull that off.

128
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:23,600
So what is that like? What is it?
It would make that not, I, you know,

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,610
I just think a lot of people would
sort of be rolling their eyes and not,

130
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,370
and not buying it.
That's, I know it sounds,

131
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,880
it sounds kind of crazy because you know
who you are making sort of a crazy show

132
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:38,800
with smoke monsters and polar bears and
time travel. And for someone to say,

133
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,880
no, no, no, but we don't believe
quicksand. I know. It's, um,

134
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,370
but ultimately you just
sort of trust your gut.

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,400
And just right now we're
quicksand is just not sort of,

136
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,610
I think the right metaphor for how
we're all feeling. But in the 60s,

137
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:58,940
it because someone speculated as to
the reason why the 60s. Oh, I've,

138
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,490
I've speculated, uh, at
great wave. I mean, it's,

139
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,360
it's a fascinating moment
because it's not just in movies.

140
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,820
I believe that this nation
should commit itself.

141
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,680
So we're planning the moon
mission in the early sixties,

142
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,860
a man on the moon and returning
him safely to the earth.

143
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,790
And this Cornell astronomer
named Thomas Gold has what if,

144
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,670
when the Apollo lander descends
to the surface of the Moon,

145
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:25,090
it just sinks into a lunar
quicksand. I remember this.

146
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,450
I remember Tom Gold saying that too. Yeah.

147
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,230
So right at this golden
moment of quicksand,

148
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,400
people are discussing real life
quicksand on the frontier of that.

149
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,020
Yeah. Now is the time.

150
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,290
And then 1963 Martin Luther
King now is the time.

151
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,991
Makes us,

152
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:46,991
I have a dream speech foundation from
the quip sense of racial and Tufts does.

153
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,711
He says,

154
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:52,790
now is the time to lift our nation from
the quicksands of racial injustice.

155
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,930
And then I came here to speak to you
about Vietnam. There was Vietnam.

156
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,890
I do not have to tell you that our people
are profoundly concerned about that

157
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:10,340
struggle, that we now think of
Vietnam as having been a quagmire.

158
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,310
That's the [inaudible]
rhetoric that's used now.

159
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:17,140
But the debate in the 60s between Daniel
Ellsberg and Arthur Schlesinger, uh,

160
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,370
they use quicksand and quagmire
interchangeably. They just,

161
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,530
the Ellsberg will switch
off and one essay,

162
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,060
we'll call it a quick
sand and then a quagmire.

163
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,290
But the first use of that idea was to
describe it as a quick sand. And then it,

164
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
it kind of migrates from being a quick
sand to a quagmire over the course of the

165
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,120
late sixties and early seventies.
And now, I mean, more evidence.

166
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,170
Now we call it a quagmire.

167
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,650
We forgot that Vietnam was a
quicksand before it was a quagmire.

168
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,510
So I'm all of these levels,
quicksand is just, you know,

169
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,240
as part of these key
moments of this 1960s. Wow.

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,200
So the question that
you know, that was just,

171
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,530
I was obsessed with for a long time was
why did America fall into quicksand in

172
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,340
the 1960s I mean,

173
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:04,210
did it come out of the movies and suddenly
everyone's talking about it or was

174
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,290
everyone talking about it?

175
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,350
And so maybe everybody saw Lawrence of
Arabia and they all went back to their

176
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,184
jobs, right?

177
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,280
Then we're on rocket ship jobs and
somewhere on wharfie where are your jobs?

178
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,910
And they all just carried Peter
O'Toole in their heads as possible.

179
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,360
I suppose that's possible. Who knows? I,

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,100
my sense is that it,

181
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,660
it's had to do with just sort of a
generalized anxiety about going someplace

182
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,270
radically new anxiety about, you know,

183
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:33,400
the Hubris of traveling to the moon,

184
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,770
anxiety about social upheaval,

185
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,890
anxiety about the foreign entanglement
of Vietnam and the state of geopolitics.

186
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,290
[inaudible]

187
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,520
well, why, why would that,

188
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,170
those anxieties manifest themselves
in terms of like quicksand.

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,300
Why is he gets this idea that
you're, can I get sucked in?

190
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,410
You're going to go too far.

191
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,610
You're going to get stuck in whatever
new world you've, you've ventured into.

192
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,620
And right now there isn't that anxiety
and exploration anymore. I mean,

193
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,480
quicksand in,

194
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,140
in Shakespeare's time was always off the
coasts of new continents that had to do

195
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:14,590
with the age of exploration
and then it became, you know,

196
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,830
desert quicksand and jungle
quicksand during colonial era.

197
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,730
And I just think the world is,
and then it became the moon. Yeah.

198
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,930
And then it became the moon.

199
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,480
And look at all the real estate
this beyond the don't come on.

200
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,950
I mean you got like our solar system,
you could have the quick sand of Jupiter.

201
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,640
Yes, absolutely. I think if we're going
to land humans on some black holes,

202
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,120
isn't black on black holes? A
kind of quick sand? Yeah. This,

203
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,890
this is my guarantee. If, if we're
about to land humans on some planet,

204
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,270
you know, beyond the moon,

205
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,080
these thoughts of quicksand
would re-emerge oh yeah,

206
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,760
this is Carlton cuse again.

207
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,050
And now we're going to see this
whole new chapter of Star Wars.

208
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,300
And clearly we just so
happens that the director,

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,930
JJ Abrams is working on a
whole new star wars movie. Yes.

210
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,370
And I think in the context
of some strange new world,

211
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,730
I think the audience would
totally buy quicksand there. Yeah,

212
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,830
that's what I'm, that's
what I'm hoping for. Yeah.

213
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,100
So I'll shoot JJ and email and just say
quicksand and just leave it at that.

214
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,840
See what happens.

215
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,130
[inaudible]

216
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,400
I have another leading indicator
of quicksand interest for you.

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,260
I have no idea what you're about
to say. None. So when I was a kid,

218
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,030
I played quicksand in the sandbox,

219
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,410
but sandboxes disappeared in the
1990s in New York City at least,

220
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,690
I don't know what the story
was in the rest of the country,

221
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,620
but this paper came out in the New
England Journal of Medicine and a warrant

222
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:49,190
that there might be some [inaudible]
derivative in sandbox sand.

223
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,340
And the number of sandboxes in New York
City went from something like 900 to 30

224
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:58,610
or 40 by the mid nineties and those
kids that you talked to in that class,

225
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:03,150
they had not likely sat in a sandbox
pouring water in the corner and worrying

226
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,630
it. But sandboxes are back the
new imaginative play movement and,

227
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,260
and playground redesign.

228
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,800
So it's just going to have all lots of
sand and lots of water and we want the

229
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:17,510
kids mixing the water in the sand.
So who knows? Maybe this is the,

230
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,020
this is the front edge of, uh,

231
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,000
of quicksand coming back because kids
are playing with water and sand and

232
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,830
sandboxes in New York City.

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,430
Oh, that's by the way,
on a more serious note,

234
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,260
I have actually one more leading
indicator of the return of quicksand.

235
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,800
I just saw it in the New York Times
actually on the front page in what

236
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:51,000
connection involving Syria, Syria were
there. They were referring to Syria.

237
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,831
A quicksand. Yeah.

238
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:55,040
And I think they've actually is come
up a little bit in terms of Afghanistan

239
00:14:55,041 --> 00:15:00,020
too, but um, it kind of seems to be
back in [inaudible] yeah. In that,

240
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,550
in the political, soon
to, thank you. Sorry.

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,870
Thanks Aaron. Yeah, no problem. And, um,
I should say thanks to Dan [inaudible],

242
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,130
he's a writer and a calmness at slate
magazine where you can find his article

243
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:13,964
about quicksand.

244
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,860
