00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.991
This year, I’m gonna be healthier, save
money, sleep earlier, read a book every week,

00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:14.409
spend more time with people I care about,
and find the love of my life.

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:20.279
What could possibly go wrong?

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.339
Hey there all you ambitious kids, Catie here
for DNews.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.339
Every year, it’s the same.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.140
The clock strikes 12, and bam!

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.460
You’re a new person!

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.019
All those things that make you feel bad about
yourself are going out the door!

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.660
Well, for a couple weeks or so.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.040
In fact, according to a study in the Journal
of Clinical Psychology, out of the 45% of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.140
Americans who usually make New Years resolutions,
only 8% of them will succeed.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.280
Wow, that is disheartening.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.170
The reason we have such a hard time keeping
these resolutions is because of 3 main reasons.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.730
There are often too many, they are too vague,
and they are often way too difficult.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360
It can be fun and easy to make a huge bucket
list of all the things you want to change

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.230
about yourself to set out to become the perfect
you within the next year.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.610
But the problem is that we have so many competing
priorities all those other things fall by

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.680
the wayside.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.810
Having such a huge daunting list can make
it so much easier to abandon all of them.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.120
So, how do we keep them?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.770
I wanna be a part of that 8%.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.860
Well, first of all, keep it simple.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.610
Rather than listing out 80 different things
you want to achieve within the next year try

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.680
sticking to one to three goals that are really
important to you.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.910
A study done by Stanford University showed
that people that try to memorize more information

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.360
have less willpower.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.800
Next, keep it specific.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.770
It’s alright to have an overall goal of
“be healthier,” but that’s really vague.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.010
So in order to reach that long term goal,
set one small goal at a time.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.880
So maybe start with the goal “remove soda
from my diet.”

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.780
Once you’ve successfully reached that goal,
you can cross that off your short list, and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.630
add a new one like, “go for a run with Jenn
on tuesdays.”

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.720
You get the idea.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.560
Speaking of Jenn, an imaginary friend I just
made up, employing the buddy system is pretty

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560
helpful.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.080
And not just in the traditional sense of having
a friend to go to the gym with on specific

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.450
days, although that is very helpful.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.500
Sharing your goals with your friends and family
can be so important.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.920
Studies show that a lack of social support
can increase anxiety, cortisol and heart rate

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.530
and all of these factors can affect your ability
to stick to your goals.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.530
You don’t have to go it alone.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.180
Share your goals with your friends, and if
they try to shame you then maybe it’s time

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.799
to add “get new friends” to your list.

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.349
Not to mention, in this era of social media
it can be really easy to find social support!

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.529
Go figure.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.139
Post your goals on a blog, or facebook.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.989
You could even make a weekly post to show
your progress.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.290
An audience can be a good motivator.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.239
But don’t do anything that makes you feel
uncomfortable and remember that sometimes

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.019
with the good support, there can be some pretty
nasty people that feel uncomfy that you’re

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.239
doing something to better yourself, and wanna
make you feel bad so they can feel better.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.239
Shake it off, boo.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.370
They’re just mad at themselves.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.370
Now here’s the big one: don’t be afraid
to slip up.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.829
It’s gonna happen.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.569
Humans are imperfect creatures and no matter
how scientific you are about your goals there

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.830
will undoubtedly be a time when you mess up.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.769
But that is okay!

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.279
Using shame and guilt to motivate yourself
will only backfire anyway!

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.370
People who tend to feel badly about themselves
have less self-efficacy, which in turn makes

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.470
you feel more ashamed and it’s just a vicious
cycle.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.950
It’s easier said than done, but practice
self-forgiveness.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.719
If you tend to be one of those self-punishing
people, maybe you should have one long-term

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.859
goal of learning self-love.

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.499
It’s a tough one.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.609
And when you have that delicious piece of
chocolate chocolate cake, enjoy it.

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.260
Don’t punish yourself.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.590
Remember that when you hit that first bump
in the road, it does NOT mean you failed at

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.819
your resolutions and you may as well just
eat another piece of cake, and that ice cream,

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.439
and that donut and those feelings because
you’re just a worthless piece of failure.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.809
Tomorrow is a new day, and gaw damn, that
cake was good.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.340
And p.s. here’s just a little extra tip
from me to you-- you don’t need a new year

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.980
in order to make a new resolution.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.129
