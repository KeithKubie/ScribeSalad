00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.507
- The philosophy in our collection

00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:05.349
has always been that the
specimens are here to be used.

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.682
So every animal will
eventually find a purpose here.

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:13.677
I'm Alan Resetar, McCarter
Collections Manager

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:15.328
in the Amphibian and Reptile Collection

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:17.208
at Field Museum.

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.943
We are gonna be unboxing
the Komodo dragons today.

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:23.965
The Komodo dragon is the
world's largest lizard.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:25.678
It's not the world's longest lizard,

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:28.178
but the Komodo is the largest.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.223
Our Komodo dragons are kept

00:00:31.223 --> 00:00:35.623
in this specially custom-made,
stainless steel tank,

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.304
which is over 100 gallons.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.859
And a Komodo dragon about
this size would weigh about

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.740
oh, maybe about 125 pounds.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.472
His organs were removed when
he was necropsied at the zoo,

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:54.001
so he's a little bit lighter,
but he's still pretty heavy.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.706
Almost all of our 300,000 specimens

00:00:56.706 --> 00:01:00.093
in the collection are in 70% ethanol.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.792
So essentially, what
we do is buy Everclear.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.293
The same product you can
buy at the liquor store.

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:09.311
We purchase it in 55-gallon drums.

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:12.813
And being a museum, we can
apply for a special permit

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:15.053
so we don't have to pay
the liquor tax on it.

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:17.813
So that saves us a little money.

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:21.352
The specimens are here
for scientific research.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:22.843
So they're here to be shared

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:26.612
with students and researchers
from all over the world.

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:29.602
They don't come out as often as I'd like.

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:32.312
They were here probably about 18 years

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:33.864
before somebody conducted

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:36.093
the first research project on them.

00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:38.532
But the animals are here forever.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:43.053
I mean, our goal is to keep
them for hundreds of years.

00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:46.403
Even though a specimen may
sit here a couple decades,

00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:50.791
all of a sudden there might be
a research interest in them.

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.449
You know, we can move this,

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:57.067
we just make sure that
nobody's in a empty aisle.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:00.408
I almost crushed a guy
from Argentina one time.

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:05.408
(laughs)
