00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.210
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.836
And today we are going to
look at a harder situation.

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:37.930
At oscillations waves in
the electromagnetic field.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.200
Why I say it's harder,
for many reasons.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.150
First of all, so
far we've always

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.000
considered situations which we
could either visualize or had

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.100
some sensual way of
getting a feel for what

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.790
the physical situation is.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.069
When it comes to the
electromagnetic field,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.570
as you well know, we can't
see it, sense it, at all.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.520
And the only way to
describe it is, in fact,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.230
in terms of mathematics.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.470
So there isn't, first,
a word-- a description

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.395
by analogy with
what we see around.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.840
Secondly, it's more complicated.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.090
These are oscillations
in three dimensions.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.570
And, as you well know, there
both electric and magnetic

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.630
fields.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.140
Overall, it is just much
more difficult situation.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.760
So first of all, I start by
a mathematical description

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.190
of this system.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.760
Because, as I say,
there is no other way

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.770
we know of discussing it.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.710
And the mathematical description
of the electromagnetic field,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.130
as you all know, are the
so-called Maxwell's equations.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.750
I've written here the four
Maxwell's equations for vacuum.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.230
So this is what the
electric and magnetic fields

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.240
have to satisfy.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.250
And I'm just reminding
you that the definition

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.440
of what electric
and magnetic field--

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.510
the operational definition
comes from the Lorentz force.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.700
Basically, this is just
quickly to remind you,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.980
if I have a charge in vacuum
and if it experiences a force,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.110
I know there is an
electric field there.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.620
On the other hand,
if it experiences

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.640
a force when it's
moving, then I know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.650
that there is a magnetic field.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.990
So this tells us that here,
although we can't see it,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.140
there is an
electromagnetic field.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.980
If one looks at these equations
and plays around with them,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.500
one find that the
electromagnetic field actually

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.530
satisfy wave equations.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.840
This is the wave equation for
the-- three-dimensional wave

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.140
equation for the electric field.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.590
And this is for the magnetic
field, where c is the phase

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.630
velocity as always, and in
the case of electromagnetism

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.220
c is given by that.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.140
That's the speed of
light, or the speed

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.110
of electromagnetic waves.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.500
Now, so what this tells
us, is that in vacuum, you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.170
can have excitations,
oscillations

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.000
of the electromagnetic
and magnetic fields,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.920
which propagate.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.020
And we have all of
the wave phenomena

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.950
we've learned for other systems.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.780
The thing to keep in
mind is that whatever

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.960
the solution of the system
is, whatever is propagating,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.950
it must satisfy all
of these equations.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.329
Not every situation
has to satisfy this.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.760
This is a subset of the
infinite possibilities that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.970
are allowed by
Maxwell's equations.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.300
OK.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.260
So now, instead
of doing solutions

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.870
to some specific situations with
a specific boundary condition,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.660
et cetera, since it's
already much more difficult,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.850
all I will do
today is see how we

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.280
can identify solutions
of these equations.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.720
What kind of waves
they correspond to.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.330
Or vice versa, if
you want to describe

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.310
in terms of mathematics
some particular wave,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.070
how do we do that?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.820
That is the kind of problems
I will be discussing today.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.920
So, let me come to
the first problem.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.800
And probably using the
word problem is a misnomer.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.380
The description.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.700
I'll consider first
progressive wave

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.165
solutions of these equations.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:47.060
Suppose we know that there
is an electric field, which

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.410
is a propagating electric
field, sinusoidal.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.760
All right?

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.820
I assure you, this does not
contradict Maxwell's equations.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.440
You can try it.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.750
All right?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.195
It's not complete, as
you'll see in a moment.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.360
The question here is, if
you have an electric field

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.460
like that, can we
describe as well as

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.860
possible in words, what kind
of a wave this corresponds to?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.920
And secondly,
answer the question

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.980
if this is a real
electromagnetic wave

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.320
in the vacuum, what must be the
corresponding magnetic field?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.610
By itself, this
equation does not

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.580
satisfy all the
Maxwell's equations.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.930
You need a corresponding
magnetic field.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.810
So, let's look at that.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.820
First of all, we know
that any function, which

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:03.080
is a function of x plus
or minus vt describes

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.300
a progressive wave.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.880
It satisfies the
classical wave equation,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.090
you can try it and see.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.040
If these two terms--
the x and the t terms--

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.220
are of opposite sign, then this
describes a progressive wave,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.030
which goes in the
plus-x direction.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.580
If they are the
same sign, then it

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.720
goes in the opposite direction.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.100
And again I say, plot
any function like this,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.270
and see what happens
as you change t.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.660
The shape of the
function will not change.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.180
But it will move either to
the left or to the right

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.300
as you change the time.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.610
So we immediately
see, since this

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.800
is a cosine of this, which is
of this form, if I divide by a,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.240
this is x minus b over a.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.120
And I could take
the a outside that.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.180
So this is a progressive wave.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.650
These two have opposite signs.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.310
It's a function of x and t.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.190
So this is a progressive wave,
which is moving or progressing

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.710
in the x direction.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.250
They're opposite signs, so
in the plus-x direction.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.610
So immediately I know that
this is a progressive wave.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.320
It is a sinusoidal one.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.690
Well, this is a cosine
function, right?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.970
It's a sinusoidal wave.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:43.510
Now we know if I divide by
a, I get minus-B over a t.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.670
So it becomes of this form.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:53.090
So the phase velocity of
this wave will be B over a.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.102
And this we call
normally, by the letter c,

00:08:57.102 --> 00:09:00.170
that's the phase velocity
of electromagnetic waves

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.840
in vacuum.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.540
Or commonly known
as speed of light.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.340
That identifies it so far,
as best as we can in words.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.930
This is, as I say, a progressive
sinusoidal electric field

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.410
moving in the plus-x direction.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.990
What are the a's and b's?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:40.450
By how much must you change
x so that the wave gets

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.130
the same amplitude
as where you started?

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.510
And the answer of that
is that, of course,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.280
a must be 2 pi over lambda.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.060
because then if x
changes by lambda,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.740
your cosine changes by 2 pi.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.290
So a in that equation
must be 2 pi over lambda.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.840
That quantity is normally
given the symbol k,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.810
it's called the wave number.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:19.720
Similarly, if I look
at the time turn,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.860
b must be equal to 2 pi
divided by the period.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.680
Because if t changes
by the period,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.280
then that cosine-- the
angle of that cosine,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.720
the phase of that
function-- changes by 2 pi.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.350
And you're back
where you started.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.410
So b must be 2 pi over t.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.980
So this tells you for
that particular wave

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.210
what the a must
be, what the b is.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.980
2 pi over t is, of course,
the same as 2 pi times

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.250
the frequency, which
we normally call

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.400
the angular frequency, omega.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.000
So a is k, and b is omega.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.950
Next.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:16.310
I said that any
solution that is real

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.640
of the electromagnetic
field must

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.220
satisfy Maxwell's equations.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.000
So the same must
be true of this.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.810
If this is the wave of the
electron, electric field,

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:42.140
there must be associated with it
a magnetic field such that all

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.450
of Maxwell's equations
are satisfied.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.460
In particular, if we take
this one-- Faraday's law--

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.850
we know that the rate of
change of the magnetic field

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.940
must be equal to minus the
curl of the electric field.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.580
This you can look up in
books of mathematics.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.940
If you look at all the
components, the way I always

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.570
remember it, it
is the determinant

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.760
where here you have the
unit x direction yz.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.570
This is dx, dy, dz.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.634
And here is the x component of
electric field, y component,

00:12:21.634 --> 00:12:22.300
and z component.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.600
For our particular
electric field,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.120
I only have the z component.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.030
And it's only a function of x.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.090
So most of the terms
of this expansion

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:47.360
are 0, except the one-- the
rate of change of with x of Ez.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.230
And that will be
in the y direction.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:57.260
So this db dt must be equal
to that if that is a solution

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.450
the Maxwell's equations.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:07.940
If I take the x
derivative of E up there.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.050
I end up-- and you
could almost do it

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.100
in your head-- db dt
is minus this quantity.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.250
But if this is the
rate of change of t,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.890
I can integrate this.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:28.360
And if I integrated it, B
must be equal to-- the a

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.320
comes from here, a
minus a, a over-- sorry.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.820
The b comes from
here, I misspoke.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.430
That comes out, and
the integral of sine

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.050
gives you cosine, so
that must be satisfied.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.000
But since we integrated
B, there will

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.820
be a constant of integration.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.190
So if I add to this
any constant B,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.800
this will still
satisfy this equation.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.240
All of this is telling
me is that if I

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.660
have that electric field--
propagating electric field--

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.750
I must simultaneously have this
propagating magnetic field.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.895
And on top of that, I can have
any constant magnetic field.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.410
It means that is a more
general situation where

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.960
this electric field and
these magnetic fields

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.020
can exist with any constant
B. I'll just call it 0.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.400
It's not an interesting
part of this,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.350
it's not a propagating field.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.480
And so we end up that if
you have that electric field

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.460
propagating, and in with
this magnetic field,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.270
then that system satisfies
all Maxwell's equations.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.310
Both the E and B will
satisfy these wave equations.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.080
Try it for yourself,
and you'll see.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.153
So the answer to
this is, what this

00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:13.000
is, this is a polarized--
plane-polarized electromagnetic

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.430
wave, where we identified the
wavelength, the frequency,

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.680
it's propagating
in the x direction.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:27.220
And the electric field is
polarized in the z direction.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.640
One of the things we will learn
from this so we don't have

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.360
to repeat over and over again
when we're looking at different

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.950
formulae, which describe ways to
help us to identify , them is--

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.390
notice that what we have
found was that the electric

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.640
and the magnetic fields are
perpendicular to each other.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.620
The electric field
in the z direction,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.840
the magnetic in the y direction.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.730
But the sinusoidal part and the
phase velocity and everything

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.100
else-- wavelength, frequency--
are exactly the same and phase.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.560
This is completely in general.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.940
If you have a progressive
electromagnetic wave in vacuum,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.050
you find that the
only way it can

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.050
exist if you have
simultaneously an electric

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.620
and a magnetic
field propagating.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.390
They are always at right
angles to each other.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.960
This is the electric field,
this will be the magnetic field.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.380
If it's propagating
in that direction.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.860
It's always from e to b
in a clockwise rotation,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:42.140
if they're propagating
in that direction.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.840
So I drew a general sketch here.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.300
This is true for any
progressive wave,

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.890
electromagnetic
progressive wave.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.310
And you have the electric field,
magnetic field perpendicular

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.770
to it, and the two
propagate in that direction,

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.830
given by this vector equation.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.000
Furthermore, if they satisfy
Maxwell's equation the ratio

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.740
of E to B, the
magnitude, is equal to c.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.400
This is completely general.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.069
It is worth
remembering when we're

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.829
analyzing different situations.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.950
So that I went
slowly through this,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.780
but that is one
example where we see

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.770
this mathematical description
of something which

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.730
we can recognize
what it is, and which

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:38.090
is a solution to Maxwell's
equations in vacuum.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.210
What actually happens in
the physical situation

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.250
depends, as always, on all
the boundary conditions,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.900
the initial
conditions, et cetera.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.960
This doesn't address
all those questions.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:56.800
All this says is this is one of
the infinite possible solutions

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.820
of Maxwell's equation.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.940
In other words, for
electromagnetic fields

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:10.450
corresponding to the plane wave
propagating in one direction.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.845
Let's take a harder example.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.140
The question is the following.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.370
Can we now do the opposite?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.270
Not someone tells
us the equation.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:29.510
Can we actually describe
in mathematical forms

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.510
a electromagnetic
wave whose properties

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.150
we know what we
want and would like

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.730
to write it mathematically.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.370
And I took a
slightly harder one,

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:45.350
so I said we would
like to describe both

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.630
the electric and
the magnetic fields,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.890
which describes a monochromatic
electromagnetic wave--

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:00.290
monochromatic means a single
frequency, single wavelength--

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:05.610
with wavelength lambda,
which propagates now

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.350
not along the x or y or z
axes that makes life easy.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.900
Let's say it goes at some angle.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:18.930
It goes at 45 degrees to
the x-axis and y-axis.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.750
And the z is out of the board.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.570
So the wave-- we
want the wave, which

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:35.910
is propagating like this, where
the wave front is-- let me come

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.590
to it in a second--
where the vector

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.750
perpendicular to the wave
front is at 45 degrees

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.696
to both the x-axis and y-axis.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.430
We want it
plane-polarized, meaning

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:58.730
that the electric vector
is always in a plane

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.560
and it's linearly
polarized so it's

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.415
in the same direction
in the x-y plane.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.860
So how can we translate
that into mathematics?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.990
Well, we'll use some
of the knowledge

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.750
we've just gained before.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.130
First of all, we know
from what I discussed

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.130
about the electric and
magnetic field being

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.190
perpendicular to each
other and perpendicular

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:35.140
to the direction of propagation
that if the propagation is

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:42.390
in this direction, then we
know that the plane in which

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.670
the electric and magnetic
fields find themselves

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.455
are perpendicular to that.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.280
Since this is
propagating like this,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:21:02.100
the distance between the planes
of equal phase will be lambda.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.500
That's the meaning
of the wavelength.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.920
Once you've gone the
distance of 1 lambda,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.750
the magnitude and
direction is back

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.290
to what it was before for
both the electric and magnetic

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.300
fields.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.240
So that's what it
will look like.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.090
So the electric vector
will be in this plane,

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.970
but we are told
furthermore it's in the xy,

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.730
so it will be in this direction.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.050
If it's like this,
and in this plane,

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.000
so this must be the direction
of the electric vector.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.150
So let's give it a
magnitude E-zero.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.090
And what is this unit vector?

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.550
Well, clearly that is
in the x direction.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:56.500
It has a component like
this, and in the y direction,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.430
it has a component like that.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.340
The magnitude of
the components is

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.380
the same, because
of the 45 degrees.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.010
But for the x, it'll be
negative, and for the y,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.310
positive.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.740
So the unit vector
in the direction

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.430
of the electric vector
will be minus x-hat

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.200
over root-2 plus
y-hat over root-2.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.540
This is a unit vector, you
can check for yourself.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.890
If you take square this, square
that, take the square root,

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.920
you get 1.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.240
So this is a unit vector in this
direction where we wanted it.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.720
So if I write this
as the amplitude

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.600
and the direction of
the electric field,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.940
I do have a field which is
linearly polarized always

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.030
in the same direction.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.840
We'll put a sine
or cosine there,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.386
because we're talking about a
monochromatic electromagnetic

00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:54.760
wave with the wavelengths, so
it's a sinusoidal function.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.270
Where I put the sine or
cosine or any other phase

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.345
just determines
where time equals 0.

00:23:04.345 --> 00:23:05.095
So let's put sine.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.920
It's going to be propagating
in this direction, plus k,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.370
so these two will
have opposite sign.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.760
This will be the frequency--
angular frequency--

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.730
of oscillations of this.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:31.670
And here we must
describe a plane.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:37.200
Because along this plane,
the phase has to be the same.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.720
That's what we
mean by wavefront.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.720
Vectorially, how do
we describe a plane?

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.260
Well, we will have the plane
which is perpendicular to k

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.800
if we take k dot
product of the vector r.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.070
r is the vector.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.790
Here is the vector
r, from the origin

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.300
to a point on the plane
which I want to describe.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.630
So this is k dot r.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:17.640
So this now, we'll have k,
which is the wave number,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.430
and this whole thing
is called the k vector,

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.300
will have a magnitude
which is 2 pi over lambda.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.300
Same as in the other problem.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:36.300
But now it's pointing in
this direction, which again,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.730
by analogy, how we calculated
that is the unit vector

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.460
x over root-2 plus unit
vector y over root-2.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.480
So this is k.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.910
r is nothing I want to
describe this point.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.560
I have x in the x direction,
y in the y direction,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.210
z in the z direction.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.000
So that describes any
point on that plane.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.830
If I take the dot
product between them,

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:09.160
I will get then a wave which
is moving the the k direction.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:16.100
And this describes the
position on the wavefront.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.180
So putting it all together,
this electric field

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:26.560
at every point of x, y,
and t will have a magnitude

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.130
is E-zero times this
direction, the direction

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.360
of polarization of the
electric field, times sine.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:49.820
This is now telling me it's
propagating in this direction.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.630
And with angular
frequency omega.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:26:02.130
So that describes the
electric part of this wave.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.730
How about the magnetic one?

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.710
Well, we could do
the same as before.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.420
The magnetic part is
determined by this,

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.480
because all Maxwell's
equations have to be satisfied,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.420
including Faraday's law.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.570
But I told you, so it saves me
doing it over and over again,

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.510
we've learned once and for
all, for a progressive wave

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.130
the e and b are
perpendicular to each other,

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.970
and the ratio between them is c.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.860
So since I know what E is, the
magnitude of the magnetic field

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.880
is E-zero over c.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.320
It'll be at right
angles to this direction

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.470
and to the propagation,
and therefore it

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.830
will be out of the board.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:57.580
So that from E-cross-B, the
vectors are in the k direction.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.280
So the b will be out
of the board, which

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.740
is easier this time.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.880
That's in the z direction.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:11.080
And it will be, as I said,
exactly in phase in time

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.390
and space with the
electric field.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.510
The two are coupled together.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.000
So that now describes
it entirely.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.720
So this is, in fact, the
answer to our question.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.600
It describes an electric
or magnetic field

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.510
which is monochromatic.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.520
It's an electromagnetic wave.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.850
It has wavelength lambda.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.490
It propagates at 45
degrees to x and y axes,

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.010
and is plane-polarized.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:45.080
e is always in the same
direction and in the xy plane.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.400
So this is the answer.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.430
See, notice.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.840
In the past when we
were doing problems,

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.620
we focus more on
things like what

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.230
is the wave equation
for this string?

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:01.140
Or for a pipe with a gas in it?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.590
Or a transmission
line, et cetera.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:12.460
Here, even guessing what
solutions we're interested in,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.240
what kind of solution,
it's already hard or even

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.540
to describe the wave
we're interested in.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.550
So this, for the
other situations,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.030
this would have
taken a few minutes.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.730
Here it needs a fair
amount of analysis.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.090
And it takes much longer.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.800
Let me take one more case.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.290
The last case I'm going to
exhibit is the following.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:58.160
Again the issue will be,
there's this particular wave

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.380
we want to produce.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.500
We know what we
want, and we want

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.000
to know how to describe
it mathematically.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.470
So once again, we want
to find a solution

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.150
of our Maxwell's
equations, which

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.640
have the following property
that correspond to a circularly

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.260
polarized electromagnetic
wave which

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.560
is propagating in y direction.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.940
And it just says "any." so
any, any circularly polarized

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.345
electromagnetic wave which
is propagating in the minus y

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:35.845
direction.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.260
First of all, what we mean
by circularly polarized wave?

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.790
A circularly polarized
wave is that, if I

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:56.940
took a snapshot, if I could,
at a given instant of time,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:02.910
one would find that the electric
vector along the propagation

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:11.890
direction is rotating
like this on the spiral.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:17.290
If that wave is
moving towards you,

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:24.360
what you would see in any plane,
a rotating electric field.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.445
And associated with a magnetic
field at right angles to it.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.030
It doesn't tell
us whether we want

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.440
a left-handed or a
right-handed rotated field.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.280
So just arbitrarily take one.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.520
And by the way, if ever
you're interested in the left-

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.190
and right-handed and
figuring out which is which?

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.310
It's a mess.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.290
Different communities use
different definitions,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.230
what they mean by
right- and left-handed.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:56.360
So I won't try to confuse
you more than that.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.640
So here we want any
wave, which corresponds

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.920
to circular polarization,
and is moving in the minus y

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.310
direction.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:10.380
So if it's moving in plus
or minus y direction,

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.630
we know that the electric
field will be in the xz plane

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.120
at every instant of time.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.110
If it's circularly
polarized, we know

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:25.720
that the magnitude of the
electric field at all locations

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.630
of x, y, and z at all
times will be the same.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.520
It does not change.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.320
It's a constant.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.040
Now so how do we
create such a thing?

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.900
Well, if we stop and
think for a second,

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.820
if we superimpose two
solutions-- suppose

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.750
we have one solution, which is a
plane-polarized electromagnetic

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:55.820
wave going towards
you, and I superimpose

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:03.190
on that another one which is
out of phase with it and at 90

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:09.040
degrees, then at every
location in space,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.040
I'll have two components.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.950
If I make those components
change, but in such a way

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.230
that the vector
addition of the two

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.270
gives me a unit vector,
a constant vector,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.750
I will have achieved
what I wanted to do.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:35.110
So here is a equation which
satisfies everything I've said.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.460
Let's consider an
electromagnetic wave

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:45.755
which is the same in all
x and all z positions.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.640
The only variable is
in the y direction.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.140
If I write that as
the superposition

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.520
of an electric field which
is in the x direction,

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:09.880
and propagating as a sine--
it's a sinusoidal wave--

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:17.760
and I add to it a cosine,
which is at right angles.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.940
Furthermore I'll use
the other information.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.540
It's going in the
minus y direction.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.860
So I'll make these two
opposite sign-- sorry,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.500
I make them the same sign,
it is in minus-y direction.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.640
If it was in the plus-y, they
would have opposite signs.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.590
If it's minus-y, this
would have to be the same.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.690
So this is a
sinusoidal wave moving

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.960
in the minus-y direction.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.390
It'll have the wave number
k, this is 2 pi over lambda.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:51.310
And this is 2 pi, the frequency
or 2 pi over the period.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:58.650
Omega over k has to be c, the
speed of electromagnetic waves.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.470
If I add to this, the
resultant electric vector

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.230
everywhere in space
has a magnitude E-zero.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.690
I can check it.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.139
The magnitude of E
is the square root

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.550
of the x component
of this squared

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.719
plus the z component
of this squared.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:21.770
So it's E-zero, the
x component squared--

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.449
the sine squared of this.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.550
The z component is the cosine,
so the squared is that.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:32.760
For all values of x,
y, and z at all times,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.889
if I add these and take
the square root, I get 1.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.580
And so this is E-zero.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.909
So this propagating wave
does satisfy my requirement

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.230
that everywhere is
magnitude E-zero.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.110
It is a propagating wave.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.070
Each one of these
are propagating

00:34:52.070 --> 00:35:02.310
with the speed of light
in the direction of y.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:08.360
I'm sorry, forgive me, can't
copy from one line to the next.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.210
This is plus, this is plus.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.830
All right.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.800
It's moving in the
minus-y direction.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.420
The way I had it, it was
going in the plus-y direction.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.230
I corrected it.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.670
This is in the
minus-y direction.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.410
All right?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.310
And this is what was required.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.070
OK.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:31.960
So this mathematical description
of the electric vector,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.180
how it's propagating.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.280
And now we want to know what
the magnetic one is doing.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.900
Well, again, we could
go back and make sure

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.250
that Maxwell's equations
are completely satisfied.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.880
And you'll find that here,
in order for Faraday's law

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.500
to hold, I have to have also
a changing magnetic field.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.830
But instead of doing
that, I'll make

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.960
use of what we learned
by the previous examples.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.860
We know that this
is a superposition

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.370
of two progressive waves.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.650
Each one of these is a
solution of Maxwell's wave.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.140
I don't need both of them.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.620
I only needed both to get a
circularly polarized wave.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.360
Each one of these has to
satisfy Maxwell's equation.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.350
So associated with each
of these components,

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:32.420
I must have a magnetic field
which satisfies the requirement

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.570
that there is an electric
vector and magnetic vector

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.620
at right angle to each
other moving together

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.550
in the direction of propagation
in phase and in time.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.440
So for each one of
these, I will find

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.740
the corresponding
magnetic field,

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.460
the magnitude will
be E-zero over c,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.050
because we know that the
ratio of the electric field

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.990
to the magnetic field is
always equal to c in vacuum.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.100
It's at right angles.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.380
This was in the x direction,
this is in the z direction.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.330
And in this case,
then add this one.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.040
Here, this was plus-z
and this is minus-x.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.590
And you can draw
yourself a little picture

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.870
to make sure you get
everything right.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.990
Let me just talk
about, say, this one.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.930
The second component.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.460
What I have in the
[INAUDIBLE], this

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.860
is moving there in minus-y.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.370
This component is
in the z direction,

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.010
so it's over here,
coming out of the board.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.830
If it's in this direction,
moving down here,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.280
then the b must be
in that direction.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.530
So it must be in
this direction, which

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.670
is minus-x, which is correct.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:49.190
So this is how I get this right.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:54.440
If I add these, I get
the total magnetic field.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:02.000
This, now, describes
one possible wave

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.830
which satisfies
this requirement.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.910
It's a circularly polarized
electromagnetic wave

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.840
propagating in the
minus-y direction.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.360
OK, so let me stop at these
examples of progressive waves,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.275
and I'll move over
to standing waves.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.750
So let's continue in
a second, thank you.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.860
So I've now erased
the board, and I

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.810
can continue talking
about wave solutions

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.300
to Maxwell's equations.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.940
But let's recap for a second.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.630
What we find is the following,
that basically in vacuum

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:53.210
at every location in space it's
as if there was an oscillator.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.000
It can be displaced
from equilibrium.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.750
It can be made to oscillate.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.480
Displacement from
equilibrium means

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.730
there is an electric
field there,

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.590
or there is a
magnetic field there.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.940
These can oscillate.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.090
They don't have to oscillate.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:20.800
So for example, you could
have a static field,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.150
just an electric field constant
in time everywhere in space.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:30.660
That means every location space
is displaced from equilibrium.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.570
There could be a constant
magnetic field instead,

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.845
or both constant.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.230
Imagine how complicated this is.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:45.670
At every location the
direction of this displacement

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.210
from equilibrium for the
electric and magnetic fields,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.910
they are vectors.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.550
There are possibility of
the electric field facing

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.270
a different directions
of the magnetic field.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.740
What we find is that
whatever that combination is

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.490
in space and time,
that combination

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.060
has to satisfy
Maxwell's equations.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.940
That completely describes
what happens in vacuum

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.830
at every point in
space and time.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:21.540
Now there are in
particular combinations

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.720
of these displacements of
oscillations in space and time,

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.350
which satisfy the wave equation
for the electric and magnetic

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:31.850
fields.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:40.580
It's a tiny subset of
total, but there are such.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:46.980
And we are considering now
for that tiny subset what kind

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.850
of solutions exist,
how to describe them.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.440
And even there, we're
limiting ourselves

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.700
to a tiny subset
of a tiny subset.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:03.270
So far, I took the subset
where this displacement

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:08.540
from equilibrium of the
electric and magnetic fields

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.160
is a progressive wave.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.140
And what we found,
in order to make sure

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:21.130
that the Maxwell's
equations are satisfied,

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.760
you can't have any
old electric field

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.480
wave, or any old
magnetic field wave.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.040
There's an interplay.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.960
There is, in reality, just
one electromagnetic field,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.750
and that propagates.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:41.950
We'll now go and look for other
solutions of these equations.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:50.980
And very interesting
solutions are standing waves.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.840
So let me take a concrete
example and discuss it.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.020
So here is, you could
call it a problem.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:07.130
Suppose that I have everywhere
in space an electric field

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.200
which consists of
a standing wave.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.140
You can recognize this
when we were talking

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:19.020
about standing waves on
strings, for example.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.660
Where you have the electric
field always pointing

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.730
in the x direction.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.420
It's oscillating at
every point in space

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.840
with the same frequency
and phase, cosine omega t.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.570
It's oscillating with
that angular frequency.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:43.130
And spatially, it not change
in the x and y direction,

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.940
but it does in the z direction.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.490
And that is a cosine like this.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:54.190
So this is a standing
wave of electric field.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.840
This by itself
cannot be a solution.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.230
Is not a situation you
can have in vacuum.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:10.000
It violates, by itself,
Maxwell's equation.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.330
If you look at them, you
find that in order for this

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.250
to satisfy Maxwell's
equation, the

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.260
must be associated with
it a magnetic field that

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.980
looks like that.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.280
And so the question,
the first thing is,

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.610
show that if you have this, you
must also have this present.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.700
The second part is
some more discussion

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.790
about when you have
these two present, when

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.270
you have a standing
wave in vacuum

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.080
of electromagnetic
waves, for example,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.770
then what is the energy density?

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.030
You know, in an electric
field or a magnetic field,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.190
if you have in
space, if you take

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:03.250
any value inside the volume,
there will be energy.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:09.830
And the energy per unit
volume per cubic meter

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.270
is the energy density.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.180
So we're going to calculate
how much energy density there

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.980
is in this standing wave.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.700
And another quantity, which
is for practical reasons

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.150
very important, is when you have
an electric and magnetic fields

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:33.920
present, actually energy
flows through that system.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.490
And the amount of
energy per unit area

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:43.320
that flows-- per unit
area perpendicular

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.690
to the direction of flow-- is
called the Poynting vector.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:48.510
And by the way, the
Poynting has nothing

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.150
to do with a vector that points,
it's to do with a gentleman

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.430
by the name of Poynting,
after which this was called.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.440
So the second part
of the problem

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:07.070
is, once we found a standing
wave that satisfies everything

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.150
possible [INAUDIBLE] in vacuum,
for this particular case

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.410
what is the energy density, the
magnetic and electric fields,

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.380
and what's the Poynting vector?

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.895
OK, so how do we do this?

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.260
We know what the
electric field is doing,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.370
it's the standing wave.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:32.890
We know that it must satisfy
all Maxwell's equations,

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.320
in particular Faraday's law.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:45.330
As before, we can calculate
the curl of the electric field.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:51.710
Now here, the electric field
is only in the x direction.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:54.920
And it's a function of z.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.520
And so the curl of this, to
be only just one component

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.100
of that, and that is
given by this quantity.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.600
So this is minus
the curl of this E.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.510
And we know by
Faraday's law that this

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:15.200
must equal to the rate of
change of the magnetic field

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.110
at that place of x, y, and z.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.250
Now I can integrate
this equation,

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:28.250
and find what B is at every
point in space and every time.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.760
And that's easy enough.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.390
We just have to integrate that,
which gives you the sine here,

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.280
and the omega comes
down, and you get this.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.910
Whenever you integrate,
there is a constant.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:46.160
All it's telling us is that I
can satisfy Maxwell's equations

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.390
not only with an
oscillating electric field

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.760
present with an
oscillating magnetic field,

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.950
but I can always add a
constant magnetic field

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:56.910
throughout space.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.440
I could have also added a
constant electric field.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.200
So there's an infinite number
of solutions I can superimpose.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.840
I'm not interested in them.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:11.260
I am interested in the standing
wave, the time-dependent part.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.390
So might as well make that 0.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.050
And so we are essentially home.

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:24.880
We have found that the magnetic
field is also a standing wave.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.300
And this, by the way,
we look at the problem,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.360
is what we were asked to prove.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.240
So we have proven
the first part,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:38.050
that if this is the
description of the standing

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.910
wave of the electric field,
then there must be corresponding

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.570
a standing wave magnetic field.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:51.910
So the two-- but notice,
unlike in the case

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:57.280
of progressive waves, where in
the progressive waves, wherever

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.740
you had an electric
field, the magnetic field

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.200
was at right angle to it and
in magnitude proportional

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.950
to the electric field and
in phase with it, et cetera.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.970
Here, they're not.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.970
Here, the electric field,
when this is cosine omega t,

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.510
this is sine omega t.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.590
When this is cosine
kz, this is sine kz.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.700
These two are out of
phase with each other,

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.680
both in time and in space.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.280
I've tried to sketch it
here, it's not very good

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.780
sketch, but anyway.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:35.010
Suppose at some instant of
time, if I look at these,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.720
at some instant of time,
the electric vector--

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.510
the magnitude of it-- is
represented by this curve.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.950
And it is in the x direction.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:53.110
So the electric vector is
this, like this, and like that.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:58.300
If this is the maximum, it is,
the magnetic field at that time

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.880
will be 0, if I look
at these equations.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.340
So there'll be no
magnetic field.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.390
Over this distance
in space, there

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.990
will be the electric
field up here, down here,

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:12.160
and no magnetic field.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.260
Later on, half a
period later, what

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:24.415
you find is that when this
comes to 0-- it's a quarter

00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:31.030
period-- when this comes to
0, the electric field is 0,

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.110
there will be a magnetic
field at its maximum.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.760
But it will not be this shape.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.110
It will be, first of all,
pointing in the y direction.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.450
This is in the x, it
will be the y direction.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.180
It's maximum will
be in the middle,

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.380
well here it was always 0.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.200
And these two oscillate.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.570
It's a standing wave.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:58.910
The B does this, and the E does
this, all in the same place.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:03.140
But both in space and time,
the two are out of phase

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.140
with each other.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.430
Completely different solution.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:11.720
And both progressive waves
satisfy Maxwell's equations,

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.880
and the standard waves.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.880
So it's important to realize
there is this difference,

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.180
often it's easy to
get confused about it.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.610
In a progressive wave, the
electric and magnetic fields

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:27.140
are right angle.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.180
And as if they were
locked together,

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.140
and they move forward like this.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.590
On the other hand, in
a standing situation,

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.030
they're still at right
angle to the other.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:43.090
But when one is a maximum,
the other's a minimum.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:47.160
When this one is--
They're out of phase

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:52.220
with each other in
both space and time.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.470
So that's the first part.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.950
And the next part we were asked,
now for this standing wave,

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.910
imagine this could be
inside your microwave oven.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:05.450
Inside the microwave oven,
there is a standing wave.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.360
Unless they specially make it so
it moves a little bit in space

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.340
so you cook your
meat everywhere.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.680
But then the cheapo
microwave oven,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.840
you have a stationary
standing wave.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.740
And suppose this is it.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.320
At every place in space,
there is an energy density

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.280
which actually fluctuates,
goes up and down in time

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.640
and is different
in every location.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.340
Let's calculate that.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.550
Well, as Professor
Walter Lewin showed,

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.260
the energy density
in an electric field,

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.640
whether it's changing
with time or not,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.990
if I've got in space
somewhere an electric field e,

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:49.840
at that location, I
have an energy density.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.030
The amount is 1 over
epsilon-zero times

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.470
the magnitude of the
electric field squared.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.200
That is the energy density
of an electric field.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.510
It is not a vector.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.780
This is E-squared, the
square of the magnitude

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.890
of the electric field
energy is a scalar quantity.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:12.340
So not surprising, this is not a
vector, it's a scalar quantity.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:17.570
I can now immediately
go over to what we know.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:20.820
We know the electric field,
we know the magnetic field.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:27.880
So I can replace E-squared by
what it is at every location.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.820
At every position
z and every x, y.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.070
At all times.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:35.440
And this is the energy density.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:42.590
You can see it does oscillate,
but there's always [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.070
How about the magnetic field?

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:50.300
The magnetic field
also has energy.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.700
If I take it anywhere,
suppose you have a bar magnet,

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.110
one of these pocket
magnets, you hold it,

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.450
and there's a magnetic
field all around the magnet.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:04.490
Take any cubic
meter of the volume,

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.860
you'll find this
amount of energy.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:10.590
It's 1 over 2 Mu 0 times the
magnitude of the magnetic field

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:11.410
squared.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:16.550
Again, I know what B is
in for my standing, wave

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:20.490
so I can calculate it,
and I get this answer.

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:25.800
So these are the two
energy densities.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:33.160
Now what one finds, if one
does-- if you plot this,

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:38.740
or thinks about it-- that
in this standing wave,

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:45.023
you find that that energy
moves backwards and forwards.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:57.110
At any location in
space, I can calculate

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:02.550
how much energy is
moving per second

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:07.390
per square meter-- per
unit area-- perpendicular

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:11.360
to the direction of
motion of that energy.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.895
And that is what is called
the Poynting vector.

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:19.180
If you think, for
example, suppose

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.680
you take an electromagnetic
wave like light shining

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.890
that the wall.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:26.640
It'll warm up to
the wall, I mean

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.860
there's heat being transmitted,
there's energy comes over.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:35.180
At any instant of time, how
much energy per unit area

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.780
is hitting the wall?

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:42.180
It will be equal to the Poynting
vector at that instant of time.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:46.950
And the Poynting vector
s is E-cross-B over Mu 0.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:58.430
By the way, this applies to any
electric and magnetic fields,

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:01.840
not necessarily for
progressive waves or standing

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.390
waves, et cetera.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.360
It's something we
want to think about

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.950
and this is very surprising.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:13.390
Even if you have static electric
and magnetic fields which

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:17.070
are not parallel to each
other, so that this is not 0,

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:19.050
there is a flow of energy.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.140
It's something we
want to think about.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:27.460
But in our case, E and B are
perpendicular to each other.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.910
The electric field
everywhere was

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:39.930
in the x direction, the
magnetic in the y direction.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:46.010
And so they are right angles, so
it's just the x component of E

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:48.200
and the y component
of B. Well, they're

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.990
the only components
that are there.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:51.640
So it's 1 over Mu 0.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.260
E x times B y in
the z direction,

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.220
so this if E and B are
perpendicular to each other,

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.360
z is perpendicular
to both of those,

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.120
which is in the z direction.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:08.910
If I calculate this for
this, I get this equation.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.550
And I can rewrite it.

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.510
And I find that the
energy is some constant,

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:20.220
goes in the z direction, and
this looks like sine 2 omega t

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.800
times sine 2 kz.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.030
Going back to our
diagram, what this

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:34.010
looks like is that-- if you
remember that E oscillates,

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:38.740
it's a maximum
here, maximum here,

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.890
and it oscillates up and
down, up and down, like this.

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:50.360
B is a maximum in the middle,
and that's going like this.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:54.970
The product of the
two, it'll be 0 here,

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.240
because B is always 0 here.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.530
It'll be here because
E is always 0.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.720
And you cross B there for 0.

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.610
So here, here, and
here is going to be 0.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:07.180
And if you look
at that function,

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.260
its actually a function
which has twice the frequency

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.410
of the electric
field oscillations

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:15.390
or the magnetic
field oscillations,

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:21.200
and also half the wavelength.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.015
And you will find that the
maximum is somewhere here.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:41.030
So if you look at where the
maximum transfer of energy is,

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:45.380
it's at the quarter
and 3/4 location.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.110
And so it's consistent
with this picture.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:52.990
Energy is doing this
in that situation.

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:56.490
And so that answers
what they were ask.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.300
This is the Poynting
vector as a function

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:06.460
of-- for all positions in
space as a function of time.

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.820
This is the energy, the
electric and magnetic field,

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:14.890
and we found the magnetic
field corresponding

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.050
to the electric field.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:21.840
So this is another example
of a possible solution

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.700
to Maxwell's equations,
this time corresponding

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.410
to standing waves.

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:32.280
As I mentioned before,
I'm repeating myself ,

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.200
there are infinite
possibilities of solutions

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.090
of Maxwell's equations.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:43.120
So to cover them
all makes no sense.

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:48.050
What is important, that one
gets a good understanding

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.410
of the interesting situations.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:57.390
Interesting situations are
some static solutions to, say,

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.430
magnetic fields if you
need special magnets.

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.820
Or if you have a
progressive wave,

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.510
like light, or standing
waves, like in the microwave,

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:09.760
for example.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:14.280
And so I've taken
two cases here.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.780
First progressive wave solution.

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.970
And then standing wave solution.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:23.080
And from this, we will later
go on to some other problems.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.630
Thank you.
