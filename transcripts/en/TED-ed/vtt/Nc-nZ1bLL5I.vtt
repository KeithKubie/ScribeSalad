00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:07.747
So, ten years from now,

00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:09.926
I think it's going to be very important

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.047
for people to really have

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.709
an intimate sense and knowledge of technology

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:19.152
and where technology is going

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.487
because it drives every profession today,

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.725
and not just using a computer,

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.605
but really understanding at the core

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.426
what makes it work.

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:30.746
But beyond that, I also think

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.414
that it's going to be really important

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:34.751
for people to have sort of a global mindset

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.661
because we're now in a world

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.157
where our economy is a global economy.

00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:40.683
We're all interconnected,

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.387
and, you know, you're going to be working with people

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:45.340
from all walks of life,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.369
from all over the world.

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.911
And I think it's very helpful to understand other cultures,

00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:52.189
and if possible, other languages.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:53.218
I think it would be a centerpiece

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.445
of whatever it is that you're doing.
