00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.660
So we saw that horizontal lines
always have a slope of zero.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.800
Let's talk about the horizontal line's
crazy cousin, the vertical line, and

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.140
as always, let's choose two points.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.200
We can choose this one,
which is 2,3, and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.070
this one, which is 2,-3.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.180
And I know the rule for
calculating slope is to find the rise,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.390
the vertical change, and
divide it by the run.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.330
So can you do that for me?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.230
Can you enter the rise here and the run
there for these two particular points?
