[music playing]

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.530
NARRATOR: 1964 was a seminal
year for change in America.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.270
A new generation was
questioning authority

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.170
and shaking up the status quo.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.270
1964 was also a pivotal
year in the auto industry,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.030
especially as the
spirit of non-conformity

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.070
inspired a brash
engineer at Pontiac.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.100
TAMARA WARREN: John DeLorean
is one of those iconic names

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
in the auto industry.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.130
He'll always be known
for the DeLorean DMC,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.270
but his legacy
goes farther back.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.600
ANNOUNCER: General Manager
Mr. John Z. DeLorean.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.570
[applause]

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.070
NARRATOR: In 1964,
John DeLorean,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.330
along with fellow Pontiac
speed junkie Jim Wangers,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.630
embraced the rebellious
spirit of the day.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
They hatched a plan
to make a powerful car

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.100
out of their mid-sized Tempest.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.270
John DeLorean had
this great idea.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.570
Because he couldn't put the
big engine in a small car,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.400
he made the big engine an
option, like a box you could

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.070
check, a trim package;
like AC or a radio,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.130
or something like that.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.200
Oh, no big deal.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.570
It just has this
rules-flouting big V8 in it.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330
NARRATOR: DeLorean and Wangers
even gave this new option

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.470
package a bold name.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.470
Let me introduce
you to another brand

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.670
new series, the GTO.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.370
STEVE LINDEN: GTO
is a great name.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.030
It means Gran Turismo
Omologato, which

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.870
means it's a grand touring
car, but they had homologation

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.830
rules, which was really just
a fancy way of saying you had

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.900
to produce a certain number
and sell it to the public

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.530
if you wanted to race it.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.230
Ferrari had a beautiful
car called a GTO,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.700
and I think they
probably just piggybacked

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.400
off that name a little bit.
[music playing]

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.200
(SINGING) Pontiac,
it's a breakaway car--

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.170
breakaway car.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.330
[inaudible]

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.230
GREG WALLACE: It's one of
those cars, when you get it out

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.630
on the floor and
you walk around it,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.430
it's a home run
from every angle.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.330
From the simulated hood scoops,
and then that great engine

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.100
with the chrome valve covers
and the three carburetors on it.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.170
Interior bucket seats were
a big deal at the time,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.430
and a four-speed shifter.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.030
I mean, there's-- nothing
says muscle car like that.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.500
NARRATOR: In addition, marketing
genius Jim Wangers came up

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.630
with a brilliant ad campaign.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.500
NARRATOR 2: A guy goes out
and gets a genuine tiger--

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.870
a Pontiac GTO, that is--

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.130
and guess who
suddenly loves cats?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.770
The advertising campaigns
of the day with the tiger--

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.470
the hood would open up, and a
tiger would jump out of the--

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.200
I mean, this was all marketing
things that were eye-catching,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.330
you know?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.270
And once people really
see that as a premium

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.630
performance vehicle, it
sold itself after that.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.030
NARRATOR 2: The
tiger scores again.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.400
NARRATOR: Priced at only
$2,800, about $22,00 today,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.970
the GTO was a smash hit.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.100
It sold more than 32,000 units
in its first year, the highest

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.530
for any first-year Pontiac.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.600
Thanks DeLorean and
his trouble-makers,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.170
Detroit finally saw the demand
for smaller, stylish cars

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.670
with big, powerful engines.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.270
The automakers were now
poised to revolutionize

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.100
the car industry by taking the
hot rod culture mainstream.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.030
These mass-produced
rides would soon

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.930
become known as muscle cars.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.670
DENNIS MCCARTHY:
Within General Motors,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.500
everybody was trying to
then jump on that bandwagon,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.330
because the car was
just a huge hit.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.330
The car was everywhere.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.600
It was like rock and roll.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.470
You got to remember, all
these divisional managers

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.170
were competing
internally with Pontiac.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.200
And that internal
competition is what created

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.870
that muscle car revolution.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.770
NARRATOR: GM's individual
brands were off to the races

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.030
to make their own
muscle cars and cash in.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.000
Buick had the Skylark.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.100
Chevy debuted the
Chevelle SS and the Nova.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.070
The success of these
new muscle cars

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.230
was undeniable, thanks to
the DeLorean and Wangers

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
sidestepping the rules.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.830
They had revolutionized
the auto industry.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.070
The muscle car had its
roots in these outlaw hot rods

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.430
and all this back channel
stuff, but now you

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.600
can go to your dealer,
and you could get the car.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.730
They commercialized a rebellion.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.100
NARRATOR: With an
idea so popular,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.170
GM wouldn't be the only muscle
purveyor in town for long.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.570
The auto industry is
great at imitating success.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.430
And so once GM did it, then
everybody else said, oh, maybe

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.130
we need to do that as well.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.030
JEFF THISTED: If they're doing
it, then it's safe for us.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.730
We're not the guys
hanging out there alone.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.430
At least they're doing
it first, and it's

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.600
all about making money.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.100
So you put the big engine
into the little car,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.100
it's a winning combination.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.470
