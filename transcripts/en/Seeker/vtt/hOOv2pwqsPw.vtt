This may look kinda rude, but it’s actually
kinda good for you!

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.870
Hello all!

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.540
Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.370
You know how gum commercials always boast
that their product can give you a fresher,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.370
cleaner mouth?

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, it that’s not entirely a lie.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.150
New research published online at PLoS ONE
says that chewing gum is actually as good

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.460
for your oral hygiene as flossing.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200
When we eat, little bits of food get stuck
between our teeth or behind those permanent

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.119
retainers a lot of people have these days.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.359
If that food gets to hang out long enough,
it will become a breeding ground for bacteria.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.570
That bacteria can lead to cavities and infections,
and really, isn’t an infection in the main

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.010
hole in your face that’s pretty close to
your brain about the last thing you want?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.940
Oral hygiene is important!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.350
Not just brushing your teeth but flossing,
too.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.640
Flossing is a great way to get those gross
lingering bits of food out from tight spaces,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.429
decreasing the overall amount of bacteria
in your mouth, but apparently so is chewing

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.429
gum.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.429
Sort of.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.050
The researchers who ran the study enlisted
five biomedical engineering students as gum

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.050
chewers.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.110
They had the students chew gum for various
lengths of time ranging from 30 seconds to

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.150
ten minutes.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.640
When the time was up, the students spit the
gum into a cup of sterile water.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.030
From there, it was analyzed.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.710
From analyzing the chewed gum, the researchers
calculated that a single standard piece of

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.540
gum can trap up to 100-million bacteria, which
is roughly ten percent of the microbes typically

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.969
found in saliva.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.439
And that’s about the same amount of bacteria
typically removed from flossing.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.880
But before you take this as license to chew
all day long, there are a few caveats.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.229
Chewing isn’t exactly the same as flossing
since flossing targets different areas of

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.229
the mouth.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.759
And after just 30 seconds, a piece of gum
starts losing its stickiness meaning it traps

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.050
less bacteria.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.130
And not all gum is create equal when it comes
to dental health.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.750
Sugary gum basically feeds the bacteria in
your mouth while gum with artificial sweeteners

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.460
actually have some antimicrobial properties.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.580
So if these findings pan out into a line of
dental health gums, would you chew?
