00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.799
We've all come in contact
with corporations.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.633
You might work for a corporation.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.201
You might buy something
from a corporation.

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:11.900
You might, I don't know, you might own

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.247
shares in a corporation.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.271
So we kind of have a
sense of what they are,

00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.569
but I want to make that sense
a little bit more precise

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:20.249
in this video and also
give an understanding of

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.402
why corporations even exist.

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.603
And so a corporation, and
you might already kind of

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:28.396
have a feeling for this,
it's a legal entity.

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:34.902
It's a legal entity that can
kind of act ... that can act,

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:38.503
that can act like a
person ... like a person,

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:41.162
I put the act in quotes
because obviously there's

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:44.080
some things that a person can
do that a corporation can't.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.734
A person can smile.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:49.069
I guess one can debate
whether a corporation can.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.070
When I say act, I mean legally.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.720
So a corporation can sue
another corporation or person.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.350
A corporation can be sued

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.566
by another corporation or a person.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.568
A corporation can own things,
just like a person owns things.

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:05.485
A corporation can owe other
people or corporations

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:07.787
things, so that's what I mean by "act".

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:11.653
A corporation can't jump like a
person or laugh like a person.

00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:13.157
Well, that ... maybe that'll be a

00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:15.671
a philosophical discussion
for another video.

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:17.671
But what I want to focus
on, other than just what a

00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.004
corporation is, is why they exist.

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.402
So what's the "why" of a corporation?

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:25.536
And in my mind, there's two big reasons

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:27.822
and the first reason and
this is the real biggest one

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:29.752
is limited liability.

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:31.119
Sounds like a very fancy word,

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.162
but we'll see it with an example,

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:36.819
it's not too ... it's not too fancy.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.604
So there is limited liability
and there's also kind of

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:41.670
transferrable share ownership.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.197
Share ownership.

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:46.070
But what I want to do in
this, which is you know

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.105
essentially more than one
person can own the corporation,

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:50.336
they can transfer the
shares between people,

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:51.270
they can trade them.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.935
But what I want to focus
on is the limited liability

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:55.778
because even if there's only one person

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.485
who owns the corporation,
if they own the whole thing.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.668
It still makes sense for them to create it

00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:02.901
because of limited liability.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.902
And to understand this, let
me give you a little example.

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:09.485
Let's say that ... Let's, let's
say that there's some guy.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.369
Let's say he's Bill.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:16.401
Let's say it's Bill's ,,,
Bill's assets right over here

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:19.149
and let's say that he has a house.

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:24.819
Let's say that he has a
house that is worth $500,000.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.003
Let's say he has a car,
maybe he has a very nice car.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.757
Let's say he has a car
that is worth 100 ...

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:33.021
No, that's too much for a car.

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:35.117
That's very ... Well,
cars can cost that much

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:39.201
but let's be ... that's ...
$50,000 is still a nice car.

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.078
Let's say that he has some investments,

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:44.068
some investment properties
or maybe some stocks

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:49.069
that are worth another
... another $500,000

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.269
and let's say that he's
interested, you know,

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.484
he looks around his town, he
sees that there's a lot of

00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:55.152
people who could use a ride.

00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:56.271
So to make some extra money,

00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.670
he wants to start a cab
or car service business.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.770
So he goes out there and he doesn't think

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.003
about starting a corporation
and he just goes out there

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:09.903
and he buys a car, let me
call a cab, plus licenses.

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:12.335
A cab plus licenses.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.272
And these things are
actually much more expensive

00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:16.054
than what you would imagine.

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:18.936
You could ... could talk to a,
the next time you're in a cab,

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:21.069
it costs much more than
the cost of the car,

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.003
which would probably
be $20,000 or $30,000.

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.818
It comes up close to six figures,

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:28.305
but let's say that it costs him $80,000.

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:31.384
And let's say that he spends $1,000,

00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:33.038
at least for this first year.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.669
Let's say he spends $1,000 on insurance,

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.292
on liability insurance. He realizes,

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:39.827
"Hey look, maybe you know,

00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:41.823
"maybe something bad happens."

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:43.819
"This is a cab I could run into somebody"

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.669
"and I get sued. So, I want
to get liability insurance."

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.470
So this is liability insurance,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.538
in case anything like that happens

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:54.401
and let's say that it is a ...
Let's say that it is a $100,000

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.396
policy. He says, "You
know, how can I ...",

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.344
you know, he ... he's maybe
a little bit optimistic

00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:00.721
and he thinks that no one can sue him

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.485
for more than $100,000.

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:09.801
So it's a $100,000 ...
It is a $100,000 policy.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:12.804
Now, he goes out there. He
starts driving that cab around,

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:14.234
picking up people, dropping them off

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:18.669
and by accident one day, he
rolls over someone's foot

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.534
and that person whose foot he just crushed

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:25.669
happened to be a ... you know,
a world-class soccer player.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.735
So he ruined this person's career.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:32.735
He ruined the career. So right
here, here's the soccer ...

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.870
the soccer player right over here,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.069
whose career is ruined or
if you're watching this

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.745
outside of the United
States, a futbol player.

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.735
But anyway, you have this soccer player.

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:47.388
His crushed ... His foot is crushed.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:51.994
And so he sues Bill
because Bill owns the cab.

00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:54.901
And the court ... so he
sues. Let me write it.

00:04:54.901 --> 00:05:02.069
He sues Bill ... sues Bill for $1,000,000.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.260
$1,000,000 because it ruined his career.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.153
In fact, that's probably ...
probably deservers more than that

00:05:08.153 --> 00:05:10.336
if he was a world-class player.

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:12.670
And the court, you know, rightfully says,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.003
"Look, you crushed this guy's player."

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:16.069
"You ... you ... you were
kind of ... this guy's foot,"

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.005
"you were kind of negligent."

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.604
"You got a little bit
too close to the curb."

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:19.735
"His foot was crushed."

00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:22.669
So it rules in the soccer player's favor.

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.484
And so essentially, now Bill's on the line

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:27.152
for the entire $1,000,000.

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:29.603
So Bill is going to
have to sell his house.

00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:31.004
He's going to have to see his car.

00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:32.319
Well, he wouldn't have
to sell his car because

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.335
he has investments, sell his investments

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:37.938
and give his house or the
proceeds from his house

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.819
and investment to the soccer player.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.734
And so now all Bill is left
with is a car and a cab

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:48.535
and not much else, so what
did this ... this cab business

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:50.402
didn't work out too well for Bill.

00:05:50.402 --> 00:05:51.869
It's a small part of his portfolio.

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.003
He didn't even have a chance
to make much money from it

00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:56.234
and it really just wiped him clean.

00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.734
Now, what Bill should have
done is create a separate

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:03.668
corporation, is create
a separate corporation

00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:13.569
called ... called Bill's ... Bill's
Car Service ... Car Service, Inc.

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.495
and transferred enough
money so that the cab,

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:18.784
the licenseses and the
insurance could be owned

00:06:18.784 --> 00:06:21.388
by this legal entity, by this corporation.

00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:26.670
So here you would have the
cabs ... cab + the license.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.930
So he would have transferred $80,000

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.332
to the corporation and the
corporation would have bought it

00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:32.537
in the corporation's name.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:33.736
Remember, it can act like a person.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:35.486
It can buy things in its name.

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:39.734
The owner of this cab is
Bill's Car Service not Bill.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:44.065
It could also get the insurance,
the $100,000 of insurance,

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:46.483
maybe this is what people
think is a reasonable amount

00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.603
for anyone who is running a cab business.

00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:50.070
You have to have at least $100,000.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.505
The reality is probably it's
a much larger number than that

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.069
and he spends $1,000 to have that policy

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.569
and remember, this is $100,000
of liability insurance.

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.069
Now, let's play out the same situation.

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.402
The cab still rolls over
the soccer player's foot.

00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:05.004
The soccer player's foot gets crushed,

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:08.870
can't play soccer anymore,
sues whoever owned that cab

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.401
for a $1,000,000.

00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.669
But now the owner of that
cab is no longer Bill.

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.802
It's Bill Car Service.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:19.686
So he sues this, sues Bill's Car Service

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:20.937
and let me make it clear.

00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:23.934
In this reality, Bill's assets
wouldn't include the cab,

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:26.004
the licenses and the insurance anymore.

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:32.936
It would now include, 100%
ownership ... ownership

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:38.009
of car service, of Bill's Car Service.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.819
So the asset is now the shares,
the 100% ownership in this

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.694
but this is a separate legal entity.

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:46.270
So now the soccer player sues

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.234
the cab service for $1,000,000.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.669
The court rightfully says,

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.670
"Hey, yeah you owe this dude $1,000,000."

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.423
"You ruined his career.",

00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:55.204
but unfortunate for the player and I guess

00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:57.401
fortunate for Bill, I don't
want to take sides here.

00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:59.027
This is just how reality is set up

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:01.422
and this is what limited liability is,

00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:05.603
is that now all the car service
can produce is ... Well,

00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:07.936
they could sell ... They
could sell maybe these assets

00:08:07.936 --> 00:08:11.671
for $80,000 and they'll get
$100,000 ... They'll get

00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:14.068
$100,000 from the insurance,

00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:16.153
so all this corporation
will be able to do is

00:08:16.153 --> 00:08:21.670
give the guy $180,000
and then the cooperation

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.038
is just going to go bankrupt.

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.930
So it's going to declare
corporate bankruptcy.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.370
It's going to go bankrupt.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.092
So this thing that Bill
owed, this car service

00:08:32.092 --> 00:08:34.272
which maybe originally he could
write on his books as being

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:38.700
worth $81,000, had insurance
policy and all this other stuff.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.988
It's now worth 0.

00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:43.021
The corporation's worth 0,

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:46.555
but the soccer player can't
go after anything else.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:47.730
We'll talk about in the future,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.530
of reasons why they can.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.188
If he didn't have enough insurance

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:52.771
or if he didn't ... if he was running this

00:08:52.771 --> 00:08:54.197
like his own personal business.

00:08:54.197 --> 00:08:56.864
If this car service didn't
have its own bank account

00:08:56.864 --> 00:08:58.995
or if it didn't ... if
it was undercapitalized,

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:00.972
if it didn't have enough money in it,

00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:04.518
then maybe the court would
let the soccer player or

00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:07.020
kind of "pierce the
corporate veil" they say,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.397
which is a very fancy
way of still going after

00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:11.129
the owners of the corporation.

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:14.272
But as long as this corporation
was reasonably capitalized,

00:09:14.272 --> 00:09:15.938
and I'm just made up these numbers here,

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:20.354
the soccer player will only be
able to go after this corporation.

00:09:20.354 --> 00:09:24.798
So what you see here is that
Bill's liability was limited.

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.688
This was limited liability.

00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:27.938
The most he could lose

00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:30.463
as long as he ran the car service properly

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:32.798
and had enough insurance
and had enough money in the

00:09:32.798 --> 00:09:34.795
actual organization.

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:37.063
As long as he ran it in the right way,

00:09:37.063 --> 00:09:41.211
the most he could lose is the
value of the organization.

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:43.893
If this organization,
you know, hits somebody

00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:45.728
or rolled over their foot,

00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:48.198
and ... but he ran the
organization properly,

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:50.864
they can;t go over the rest of his assets.

00:09:50.864 --> 00:09:52.789
So this is the number one reason

00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:56.804
why people have corporations,
for the limited liability.
