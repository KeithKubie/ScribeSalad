00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.340
Primary elections are how political parties
in the United States pick their strongest

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.010
candidate to run for president.
The parties do this by holding mini-elections

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.530
in each of the states and the candidates with
the most votes from these elections becomes

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.270
the parties’ official nominees; these nominees
then face each other in the national election

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.000
for president.
But this isn’t the whole story. There are

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.220
five things that make it a bit more complicated
than that…

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.160
Complication #1: Primaries vs Caucuses
In every state, the local party leaders decide

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.140
how to run their elections. The two most common
choices are primaries and caucuses.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.510
Primaries are just like standard elections.
Go to the polls whenever you can, stand in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.570
a long line, hide in a booth, then tick a
box or press a button and your vote is cast

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.210
in complete anonymity.
A Caucus, however, is a public vote.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.630
People gather in groups wherever space is
available then literally take sides in the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.200
room with everyone else who likes the same
candidate.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.570
The groups debate each other and, if people
change their minds, they need to physically

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.620
switch sides.
At the end of the debates party representatives

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
count the number of people in each group.
If you leave too early, you don’t count.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.460
This description of primaries and caucuses
is really all you need to know but the specifics

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.179
can vary wildly.
That’s because there are fifty states all

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.889
of which hold at least two primaries and caucuses
for the big parties, and possibly more for

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:12.189
the small parties.
Covering all the local variants would take

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.909
a tediously long time which your short attention
span for boring political videos wouldn’t

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.630
tolerate – And you need to stay focused
because there are four more things to cover.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.029
Complication #2: Who can vote?
In the National Presidential election all

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:27.350
American citizens over the age of 18 can vote,
with two exceptions, you can’t live here

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.729
or here.
But primaries are in-state elections with

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.689
lots of different rules.
Most states and parties will only let you

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.569
vote in the primary if you are an official
member of the party. This is called a closed

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.939
primary because the voting is closed to non-party
members.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.490
But some citizens are independents – and
are not registered with any party. If you’re

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.069
an independent and live in a state with closed-party
elections, tough luck. No voting for you.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.130
Some states, however, have ‘semi-closed’
primaries. Where independents can pick one,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.189
and only one, primary to vote in. Parties
allow this because the presidential election

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.249
is often determined by independents so knowing
which candidates they like is useful.

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.340
Finally a few states and parties really play
it fast and lose with open primaries. Here

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.939
any citizen, no matter which party they’re
registered with, can pick a primary to vote

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.060
in.
But it’s not just the states that have primaries,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.820
they’re also held in the District of Columbia
and the oft-forgotten territories – holding

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.610
primaries here is a bit odd though considering
that territorial residents can’t vote in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.670
the actual presidential election.
Lastly are the Americans living abroad who,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.060
depending on the party, vote in a bloc as
though they all lived together in one a big,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.170
extra state.
When all these elections take place depends

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.720
on…
Complication #3 Who Votes When?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.220
Primaries aren’t conducted all at once but
are spread out over a year. This leads to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360
fights between the states about who gets to
be at the head of the line and who is stuck

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.580
at the back. Inevitably, last minute leap-frogging
of dates happens – even though the parties

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.440
often take away votes from these uncivil states.
When it comes to being #1, nobody beats New

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.990
Hampshire who wrote it into state law that
their primary will always be at least a week

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.110
ahead of everyone else’s.
Which isn’t a problem until some other state

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.440
gets the bright idea to do the same and then
we have an infinite loop in our system and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.000
have to force-quit the law.
But wait, you say, doesn’t Iowa already

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.880
go first? Yes, but New Hampshire lets them
get away with it for two reasons:

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.580
1) Iowa’s election is a caucus and so New
Hampshire is still technically the first primary.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.670
and
2) New Hampshire thinks that Iowa is stupid

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.350
and doesn’t matter.
Other states try to boost their influence

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.580
not by cutting in line but by forming an alliance
and holding their primaries at the same time.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.140
The biggest alliance of the election cycle
is called Super Tuesday where – depending

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.620
on how many states can agree with each other
– around half of them might participate,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.410
giving out a whole pile of votes.
Which brings us to:

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.590
Complication #4: Votes That Aren’t Votes.
So this whole time you’re were probably

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.690
thinking that citizens give votes straight
to the candidates, but no.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.030
Instead, the votes are given to a bunch of
guys, called delegates, who in turn will give

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.090
them to candidates as requested to. Maybe.
Depending on the state, delegates might be

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.680
required to vote as the citizens did, or they
might be completely free to ignore the citizens

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.380
and vote for whomever they want.
Who are these people? The delegates are local

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.900
party VIPs, such as state reps and officials.
The more citizens who live in a state, the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.069
more delegates that state gets.
Later in the year, when all the states have

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.530
finished their primaries, the delegates travel
to a huge gathering for their party called

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.560
the National Convention.
It’s here that the official vote to select

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.330
the party’s nominee for president happens.
But it’s not just these delegates who do

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.150
the voting.
Complication #5 Super Delegates

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.410
Super delegates are the top members of the
party such as congressmen and former presidents.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.029
They go to the National Convention, not to
represent the people, but to represent the

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.329
current party establishment and can vote for
whomever they want.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.710
Depending on the party, the super delegates
might be up to 20% of the voters at the National

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.330
Convention.
Usually by the time the national convention

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.919
happens all the candidates save one have dropped
out of the race so the convention is just

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.020
a rubber stamp and a big party. But if the
fight between candidates is still ongoing,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.270
the delegates and super delegates are the
ones with the final decision.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270
In summary:
Over the course of a year the states, plus,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.180
DC plus the territories, and the Americans
Abroad hold their primaries, or caucuses.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.139
When finished the delegates representing the
citizens who voted in those elections travel

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.499
to the national convention. Most of the delegates
are forced to vote as the citizens of their

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.949
state wanted them to, but some of them are
free to vote as they like.

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.770
At the national convention the delegates meet
up with the super delegates who represent

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.629
the best interests of the party and together
they make the final decision on who will be

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.729
the nominee for president.
Tired? Don’t be, because now the race for

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.729
the presidency begins.
Of course, you can skip all that and jump

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240
straight into the election as an independent,
the only downside to this strategy is near-certain

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.560
defeat.
