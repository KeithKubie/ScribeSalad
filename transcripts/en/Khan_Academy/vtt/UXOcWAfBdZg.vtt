00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.937
- Let's talk a little bit about groups

00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:05.654
of the periodic table.

00:00:05.654 --> 00:00:08.402
Now, a very simple way
to think about groups

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:12.142
is that they just are the
columns of the periodic table,

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:14.743
and the standard convention
is to number them.

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:16.983
This is the first column,
so that's group one,

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.400
second column,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.018
third group, fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh,

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:25.640
eighth, group nine, group 10,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.629
11, 12, 13, 14

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.750
15, 16, 17, and 18.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.329
As some of ya'll might be thinking,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.488
what about these F block
elements over here?

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:39.276
If we were to properly
do the periodic table

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.750
we would shift all of these

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.828
that everything from
the D block and P block

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:44.396
all are right words

00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:48.169
and make room for these F block elements,

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:50.561
but the convention is is
that we don't number them.

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:51.705
But what's interesting?

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.136
Why do we go to the trouble about

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.156
calling one of these columns,

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:58.035
about calling these columns a group?

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.845
This is what's interesting
about the periodic table

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.004
is that all of the elements in a column,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.535
for the most part, and
there's tons of exceptions,

00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:08.158
but for the most part the
elements in the column

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:11.119
have very, very, very similar properties.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.021
That's because the elements in a column,

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:17.354
or the elements in a group
tend to have the same number of

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.861
electrons in their outermost shell.

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.543
They tend to have the same
number of valence electrons.

00:01:22.543 --> 00:01:24.981
And valence electrons are
electrons in the outermost shell

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:26.462
they tend to coincide, although

00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:28.249
there's a slightly different variation.

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.091
The valence electrons, these are

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.529
the electrons that are going to react,

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.627
which tend to be the
outermost shell electrons,

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:38.020
but there are exceptions to that.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.518
There's actually a lot
of interesting exceptions

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:43.486
that happen in the transition
metals in the D block.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:44.823
But we're not gonna go into those details.

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:46.446
Let's just think a little about

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:48.918
some of the groups that
you will hear about

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:51.937
and why they react in very similar ways.

00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:54.092
If we go with group one, group one ...

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:56.974
And hydrogen is a little
bit of a strange character

00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:58.340
because hydrogen isn't trying

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.919
to get to eight valence electrons.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.445
Hydrogen in that first shell
just wants to get to two

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:05.162
valence electrons like helium has.

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:07.305
Hydrogen is kind of ...

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:10.321
It doesn't share as much in common

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:12.237
with everything else in
group one as you might expect

00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:14.883
for, say, all of the things in group two.

00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:17.264
Group one, if you put hydrogen aside,

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:21.833
these are referred to
as the alkali metals.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:24.770
And hydrogen is not
considered an alkali metal.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.415
These right over here are the alkali.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.000
Alkali metals.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.529
Now why do all of these
have very similar reactions?

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.490
Why do they have very similar properties?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.574
Well, to think about that

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.901
you just have to think about
their electron configurations.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.577
For example, the electron
configuration for lithium

00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:46.644
is going to be the same

00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:51.132
as the electron configuration of helium,

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:52.873
of helium.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.036
Then you're going to go
to your second shell,

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.903
2s1.

00:02:57.903 --> 00:02:59.761
It has one valence electron.

00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:03.600
It has one electron in
its outermost shell.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.258
What about sodium?

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:09.056
Well, sodium is going to have the same

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:13.289
electron configuration as neon.

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.284
Then it's going to go 3s1.

00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:19.006
Once again, it has one valence electron,

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.333
one electron in its outermost shell.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.700
All of these elements in
orange right over here,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.395
they have one valence electron

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.832
and they're trying to
get to the octet rule,

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:31.013
this kind of stable nirvana for atoms.

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:33.161
You could imagine is that
they're very reactive

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.154
and when they react they tend to lose

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:37.146
this electron in their outermost shell.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:38.412
That is the case.

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.617
These alkali metals are
very, very reactive.

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.221
Actually they have very
similar properties.

00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:45.218
They're shiny and soft.

00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:48.711
Because they're so reactive
it's hard to find them

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.400
where they haven't
reacted with other things.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.977
Let's keep looking at the other groups.

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:57.259
If we move one over to the right

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.300
this group two right over here,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.999
these are called the
alkaline earth metals.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.634
Alkaline,

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:09.513
alkaline earth metals.

00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:11.625
Once again, they have very similar ...

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:13.785
They have very similar properties

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:16.269
and that's because they
have two valence electrons,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.450
two electrons in their outermost shell.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.725
Also for them, not as quite as reactive

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.525
as the alkaline metals.

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:27.123
Let me write this out,
alkaline earth metals.

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:29.364
But for them it's easier
to lose two electrons

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:31.930
than to try to gain six to get to eight.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.402
And so these tend to also
be reasonably reactive

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:38.821
and they react by losing
those two outer electrons.

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:40.620
Now something interesting happens

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.838
as you go to the D block.

00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:46.158
We studied this when we looked
at electron configurations,

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.340
but if you look at the
electron configuration

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.336
for say scandium right over here,

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.090
the electron, let me do it in magenta,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.468
the electron configuration for scandium,

00:04:57.468 --> 00:05:00.413
so scandium,

00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:02.410
scandium's electron configuration

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.012
is going to be the same as argon.

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:08.043
It's going to be argon.

00:05:08.043 --> 00:05:09.044
Then you're going to fill it in

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:11.663
we're in the one, two,
three, fourth period.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:15.412
It's going to be 4s2.

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:17.049
Then we start filling the D block.

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:18.570
These are the D block elements here.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.079
You have to remember, the D block

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.936
you backfill.

00:05:21.936 --> 00:05:23.635
In the D block, this is going to

00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:26.951
be now 3s1.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.292
How many electrons does it
have in its outermost shell?

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:35.681
Once again its outermost
shell is its fourth shell,

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.760
is its fourth shell.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.755
These are, you could argue,
higher energy electrons

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:40.895
that fills this ...

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:42.057
These are filled before that,

00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:43.477
and there are exceptions to this

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.576
especially that we see
a lot in the D block.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:49.443
This is what's, I guess you
could say to some degree,

00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:52.689
is defining its reactivity.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.742
Although in the transition
metals, the D block elements,

00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:57.379
I'm sorry, I made a little mistake there.

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.532
This is 4s2 3d1.

00:06:01.532 --> 00:06:02.803
Let me emphasize that.

00:06:02.803 --> 00:06:04.753
We're backfilling the D block.

00:06:04.753 --> 00:06:08.491
But these, their outermost
electrons are in ...

00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:10.825
They still have two of
those outermost electrons.

00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:12.613
There, once again, are

00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:16.142
exceptions in these
transition metals right here

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.430
that for the most part

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.835
are going in backfilling that D block.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.139
Once you've kind of
backfilled those D blocks

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.509
then you come over here

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.715
and you start filling the P block.

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:32.757
For example, if you look at

00:06:32.757 --> 00:06:35.004
the electron configuration for,

00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:36.862
let's say carbon,

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:40.983
carbon is going to have the
same electron configuration

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:44.385
as helium, as helium.

00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:47.507
Then you're going to
fill your S block, 2s2,

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.479
and then 2p one two.

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.662
So 2p2.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.821
How many valence electrons does it have?

00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:56.737
Well, in its second shell,
its outermost shell,

00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:58.281
it has two plus two.

00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.045
It has four valence electrons.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:03.307
That's going to be true for
the things in this group.

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:06.479
And because of that, carbon has similar

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.988
bonding behavior to silicone,

00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:11.380
to the other things in its group.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.562
We could keep going on,

00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:17.427
for example, oxygen and sulfur.

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:20.945
These would both want
to take two electrons

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:23.487
from someone else because they
have six valence electrons

00:07:23.487 --> 00:07:24.477
and they want to get to eight.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.690
They have similar bonding behavior.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.559
You go to this yellow
group right over here.

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:30.719
These are the halogens.

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:32.321
There's special name for them.

00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:34.898
These are the halogens.

00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:36.880
These are highly reactive
because they have seven

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.070
valence electrons.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.478
They would love nothing more than to get

00:07:39.478 --> 00:07:41.267
one more valence electron.

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:42.298
They love to react.

00:07:42.298 --> 00:07:44.098
In fact, they especially love to react

00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:46.895
with the alkali metals over here.

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:51.112
Then finally you get to
kind of your atomic nirvana

00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:54.208
in the noble gases here.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:57.250
The noble gases, that's the
other name for the group,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.522
18 elements, noble gases.

00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:03.475
They all have the very similar property

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:04.641
of not being reactive.

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:05.774
Why don't they react?

00:08:05.774 --> 00:08:08.722
Because they have eight valence electrons.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:10.479
They have filled their outermost shell.

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:11.543
They don't find the need.

00:08:11.543 --> 00:08:12.040
They're noble.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.615
They're kind of above the fray.

00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:18.319
They don't find the need to
have to react with anyone else.
