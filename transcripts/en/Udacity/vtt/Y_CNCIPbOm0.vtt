First I'm going to make a 2-element queue,.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to set temporary variable r1 to be the return value 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of enqueuing an element and set r2 to be the returned value of enqueuing

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
another element, r3--a third element, r4 to be the value returned by dequeuing an element, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
r5 to be the returned value of dequeuing another element, and finally r6

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to be the returned value of dequeuing yet another element.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now the question that I'm asking is what are the values of these 6 variables.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Choice A is going to be 6, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Choice as B is going to be True, True, True, 6, 7, None.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Choice C is going to be True, True, False, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Choice D is going to be True, True, False, 6, 7, None.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Go ahead and write your answer here.
