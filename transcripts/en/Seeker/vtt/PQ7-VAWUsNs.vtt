00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.800
OK THAT’S ALL I GOT.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.800
Oh that’s.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.800
Yeah, that’s not even close.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.250
Oh dammit...

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.740
Hey animals, you’ve found DNews, I’m Trace.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.360
This video was everywhere recently showing
a dragonfish opening its jaws by 120 degrees

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.430
-- meaning they can, horrifyingly, swallow
their prey whole!

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.810
The gorgeous video is from a new study in
PLoS One looking at evolution of the heads

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.240
of this family of deep-sea fish.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.740
The dragonfish has sharp teeth, not for chewing,
but for holding.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.840
The idea is to get the food into the stomach
whole…

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840
Yikes.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.260
There’s not a lot of food where it lives,
so this is a huge advantage.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.240
But, the ability to swallow food whole isn’t
unique to these fish.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.780
In terms of jaw opening, the burmese python
puts the dragonfish to shame -- with jaws

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.090
opening to 150 degrees -- 180 is a straight
line.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.660
The goal here is to, of course, swallow food
whole -- which just sounds… uncomfortable.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.620
Why would an animal evolve to not chew?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.720
Swallowing food whole evolved because, to
be honest… chewing is hard work; it takes

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.720
energy!

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.580
Most mammals chew -- though not all, dolphins
swallow their food whole.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.260
Reptiles on the other hand, seem to like only
taking one bite.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.460
This is because chewing expends energy.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.860
A 2013 study in PLoS One postulates that a
major advantage for swallowing food whole

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.020
is [quote] “No time needed for processing.”

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.930
Animals that swallow food whole get the energy
from their food ASAP with minimal energy tax.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.080
The Plos One researchers think not chewing
is what helped some dinosaurs grow so large!

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.340
In a study done with a python, 37 percent
of all the energy in the food was spent just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.600
digesting it in the first place!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.369
So, many animals swallow their food whole,
simply to get the energy as quickly as possible.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.150
Circumventing this energy tax helped us evolve
too!

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.540
Ancient humans had large faces with bigger
chew muscles.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.420
A 2016 Nature study found as we evolved tools,
we began slicing or grinding our food before

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.300
eating and that decreased chewing by 13 percent
-- more energy for doing other things (like

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.300
thinking)!

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.259
So, the dragonfish doesn’t chew likely because
it’s quicker to let the teeth grab, and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.950
the fish swallow to get things started.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.299
It costs less energy.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.880
But, we had trouble finding a lot of information
on exactly how the dragonfish’s digestion

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.880
works.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.299
Luckily, we have some analogs, on land, the
snake, for example!

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.169
Snakes swallow food whole, and have special
enzymes in their saliva to start the digestive

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:32.189
process as they “walk” their jaws over
the food to pull it into their stomach.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.989
Snake venom contains cytotoxins -- which are
also for digestion.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.439
They starts the process from the inside.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.459
On top of that, once in the stomach the snake
has to digest everything (pretty much).

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.180
They have specialized cells shaped like golf
tees that help break down the hard bits, even

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.480
bones and eggshells -- depending on the species
of snake.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.769
Because a giant bulge in the middle of one’s
body is evolutionarily disadvantageous, digestion

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.959
happens quickly; estimates range from a couple
days to several weeks.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.439
So, back to the dragonfish: it has this crazy
jaw in part because it needs to swallow food

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.239
before the food can escape, plus it doesn’t
need to chew… because that costs energy.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.879
If the prey is large, the dragonfish can expand
its stomach not unlike a snake!

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.059
But commonly, they’ll eat smaller things
like shrimp, plankton, other fish… or get

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.040
aggressive and snag the occasional cephalopod.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.629
Hopefully, someday, we’ll know more about
this intriguing species but for now, at least,

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.379
we have this crazy jaw to look at.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.989
Evolution is an incredible thing, creating
a whole tapestry of different forms of life,

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.379
but this one animal or plant… or… or animal.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.379
Which is it?

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.379
It might be both…

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.319
Watch this video to see how something could
be both plant and animal.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.059
What’s the most food you’ve eaten in one
bite.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:50.099
I actually can eat a hot dog with condiments
and bun at once, but the chewing is ain’t

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.099
pretty...

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.840
