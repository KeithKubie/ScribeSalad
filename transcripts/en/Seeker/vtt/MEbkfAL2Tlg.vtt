00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey guys, Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.600
Doesn’t seem like all of those cool things
we dreamed about happening in the future are

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200
finally becoming a reality?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.440
Like flying cars.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.740
Going to Mars.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.440
Or cloning!

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.020
Next thing you know they’re gonna say that
floating cities are no longer a dream.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.160
It says that right now, doesn’t it.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.300
Yea, I thought so.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.920
Are floating cities the new future of civilization?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.810
Will we be living in aquatic societies in
the coming decades?

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.580
Well if you’re living off the coast of French
Polynesia, maybe?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.070
The government of the collection of islands
in the South Pacific has agreed to develop

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.740
an experimental floating city with a group
called the Seasteading Institute by 2020.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.020
The island will include residences, hotels,
restaurants, all the stuff you’d see in

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.040
a normal city, just out in the ocean.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040
In addition, the Seasteading Institute wants the city to function as a hub for scientific research.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
Sounds super-futuristic and cool, right?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.980
But is this as close to reality as these headlines
make it seem?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
Well let’s look at the floating aspect of the
city first.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.600
Technically the idea is similar to, but
not exactly an artificial island, which have

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.840
been around for a long time.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.600
I mean people were building them 1,500 years ago in Micronesia and we still make them to this day.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.060
Artificial islands are built on landfill,
they don’t float or move, and their construction

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.040
and can be environmentally disruptive.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.520
What the Seasteading institute is proposing is much more advanced.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.360
Their website states that they’ve settled
on a sustainable, modular design with interlocking

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.340
platforms that will actually float on the
water, which does sound pretty awesome.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.759
And sure, floating villages are a thing that
already exist, too, but there isn’t a huge

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.799
city of this kind of scale floating around
right now.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.289
Which also means, there’s also no promise
that it will work.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.279
This is just a proposed design, we’ve never
done it before.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:37.999
It’s kind of like the hyperloop.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.630
It sounds super exciting, but what we’re
really talking about is a train, magnets and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.229
pneumatic tubes, three old technologies that
may or may not work when we put them together.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.780
And even if it DOES work, it might not ever
be put to use.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.889
Sorry Elon.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.920
So, for the moment, the floating city idea
may still be just science fiction.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600
But what about the scientific research hub
part, that sounds great, right?

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.849
Well due to the nature of living at sea, the project has begun focusing on studying sustainable

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.580
technologies like desalination, renewable
sources of energy, and how to grow food when

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.330
you’re stuck in the middle of the ocean.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.670
Basically the island would be one big lab
for all of that.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.320
And there are scientists who are really excited
about this kind of an opportunity.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.140
But there are some skeptics of the project’s true intent, and that’s because the Seasteading Institute

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.500
was originally more about creating an independent nation than studying sustainable science.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.800
The idea came from venture capitalists from Silicon Valley while at Burning Man.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.740
And only good ideas come from Burning Man, right?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.820
While the focus seems to have shifted towards
science, there’s still a political aspect

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.830
to this project.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.610
Blue Frontiers, which is part of the Seasteading
Institute, wants a 0% tax rate from French

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.540
Polynesia on the island as well as regulatory
exceptions.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.080
And in an interview with ABC News Australia,
Seasteading spokesman Joe Quirk talked about

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.130
floating islands creating new governments
and societies as if they were tech-startups.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.560
And while French Polynesia does have a real
concern for rising sea levels for which a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.190
floating city sounds like a solution, they’re
also mostly focused on economics.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.360
The country has an 18% unemployment rate and
could really use the industry.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.200
But whether the island is truly a haven for
science or just a playground for rich idealists,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.500
the project is moving forward with its $60
million dollar price tag.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.800
Funding will partially come from virtual currency
because, well, Burning Man, guys.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.530
Of course it’s going to be funded with virtual currency.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.820
But what do you think?

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.280
Are floating cities the wave of the future?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.930
Or are they just something a bunch of rich
guys thought would be cool while dancing around

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.930
in the desert?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.180
Personally, I won’t be working on my
sea legs anytime soon.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.140
So jeez Matt, there are no floating cities
yet we get it, but what about stretchy batteries?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.340
Ok, that’s a weird request.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.480
But you know what here’s a video just about
that.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.460
Because I care.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.640
