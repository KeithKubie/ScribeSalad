the movie kept me on my toes because you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850

way but eventually subverts that and not

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
way but eventually subverts that and not
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060

just because it's a con man movie and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
just because it's a con man movie and
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.140

happening back and forth but it's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
happening back and forth but it's
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.170
happening back and forth but it's
because of the way the film is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
because of the way the film is
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090
