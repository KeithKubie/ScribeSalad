00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
SPEAKER 1: Welcome to the
2018 Android Developer Summit.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
This is an event for
developers by developers.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.380
SPEAKER 2: With over 2 billion
devices, 3/4 of a trillion apps

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.290
downloaded every year,
Android's developer community

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.610
is growing hugely.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.810
We saw it more than double
just in the past few years.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.520
SPEAKER 3: So the Android App
Bundle makes it much simpler.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.220
With no additional
developer work needed,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.420
the App Bundle now makes
apps an average of 8% smaller

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.234
to download for m+ devices.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:46.650
SPEAKER 4: So a
few months ago, we

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.200
announced Jetpack, the next
generation of Android tools

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.680
and APIs to accelerate Android
application development.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.960
Today, out of the top
1,000 applications

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720
in active development
on Play Store,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.430
798 are already using Jetpack.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.760
They are already being used
in over 38,000 applications

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.540
worldwide.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.780
SPEAKER 5: The new beta
for Android Studio 3.3

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.970
was just released moments ago--

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
reducing the number of crashes,
hangs, and memory leaks;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.730
fixing user-impacting bugs; and
investing our infrastructure

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.570
and tools.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.450
We're bringing the full power
of Android Studio to Chrome OS

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.130
early next year.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.010
SPEAKER 6: We simply cannot do
this without you, so thank you.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.160
