00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.420
There’s no easy way to say this so I’m
just going to come right out and say it: Gentlemen,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.640
it would appear our sperm counts are dropping…
a lot.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.769
That’s according to a new meta analysis
of studies that have looked at sperm counts

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.870
from men in western countries going all the
way back to 1973.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.520
The study found that the average total sperm
count has dropped by over 59%, while the average

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.350
concentration of sperm has dropped over 52
percent.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.140
I know that might be hard to hear, and denial
is a natural response.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.540
Even the lead researcher said it was hard
to believe.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.360
But unfortunately it looks like the study
is pretty solid.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.020
There have been meta analyses of sperm count
studies in the past, but critics have never

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.690
been satisfied with them.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.760
One such meta analysis from 1992 --known as
the Carlsen study-- looked at 61 studies and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.940
also found sperm counts were dropping.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.090
But critics say the Carlsen study is flawed
because one of the studies it used contributed

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.440
30% of the participants, disproportionately
skewing the results.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.780
Even with this significant flaw, the authors
of the latest meta analyses describe the Carlsen

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.670
study as a “seminal paper” on sperm count,
which is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.790
a scientist make and I wish I thought of it.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.310
Anyway, with their latest paper, these smart-alecs
sought to correct the Carlsen study’s misfires.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.070
They drew their data from 185 studies, the
largest of which contributes only 5% of the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.070
participants.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.710
The study used data from almost 43,000 men
who were well distributed across nearly 40

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.460
years and 50 countries.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.240
The studies were chosen because the men in
them were not having their sperm counted because

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.420
of infertility issues, and the analysis accounted
for tons of factors like age and how long

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.710
the men had gone since they last uh… “gave
a sample,” so to speak.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.400
Even with this ultra-conservative approach,
the results look bad.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.140
In 1973 the average sperm concentration was
99 million per milliliter.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.830
As of 2011 it had dropped to 47 million per
millilitre.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.409
That’s not too far from the point when odds
of conception start to take a hit, the 40

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.530
million mark.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.570
And there’s more bad news: the rate of decline
doesn’t seem to be showing any signs of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.570
slowing.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.049
Now the question I’m sure you’re asking
is, “Why?

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.410
What’s causing such a remarkable drop off?”

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.600
That’s a question a study like this can’t
answer.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.079
The authors speculated it may be due to increased
exposure to certain chemicals like pesticides,

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.329
lead, or fire retardants, both before birth
and as an adult.

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.540
Sperm count can be affected by stress, obesity,
and smoking too.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.689
It’s even known to fluctuate based on season
and climate, leading one scientist unconnected

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.969
to the study to speculate that global temperature
increases could be a contributor.

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.120
As if there weren’t enough reasons to worry
about climate change, apparently it might

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120
be cooking our huevos too.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.469
The new study isn’t perfect of course, and
skeptics have noted that the original studies

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.440
that it drew from didn’t account for the
men’s health and lifestyles, both factors

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.159
that can impact sperm count, so there could
be some variability there.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.329
And sperm count methodology has not been standardized
across countries.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.690
Still, other scientists have said that for
a definitive answer on declining sperm count,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.689
this is as close as we’re going to come.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.560
To repeat though, this is just really strong
evidence that there is a decline, and a pretty

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.029
alarming one at that.

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.169
But the cause or causes are still very much
unknown.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.849
For the continued propagation of the human
race, more research and sperm is needed.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.030
Sperm isn’t just useful for baby making,
it may have medical uses too, like delivering

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.169
cancer drugs.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.620
Check out Trace’s video here for the craziest
thing I’ve ever heard.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.840
Alright guys, are you worried about this news
or are you confident in your frosted mini
