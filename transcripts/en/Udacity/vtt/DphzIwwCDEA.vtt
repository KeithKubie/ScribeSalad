00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.320
All right, so we used a workflow, to, you know, automate these manual tasks,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.490
tell people what's going on automatically. What's

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.580
next? What, what should we build next?

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.800
&gt;&gt; So, in our flow, we have handled, sort of, the maintenance side of things.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:15.861
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:18.480
&gt;&gt; But, what about the scheduling stuff? I mean,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.850
we kind of built that out, but then, let it be.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so scheduling, I imagine would look something like, I dunno,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710
whoever's doing the scheduling for the band says, hey, I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.660
really like this band, let's schedule. Book him on the stage.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.400
&gt;&gt; And then the stage manager probably gets

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.910
all upset because they're like hey, you didn't

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.670
tell me. Or, you know, the concert, the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.810
festival promoter's like, woah, woah, woah, what's going on?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.260
&gt;&gt; You three's already playing at that time. You can't have that time.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I can't do that. Okay, so we need some way to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.695
get these people talking to each other.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.688
Making sure that nobody's doing anything crazy.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:46.353
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:46.918
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:49.570
&gt;&gt; So I imagine that would be the stage manager handling all that.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.630
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.100
similar to how we could assign tasks and things like that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.960
to a maintenance worker, we can do that to a stage manager.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.970
&gt;&gt; Sounds reasonable.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.670
&gt;&gt; And we could do that, like what we're talking about

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.260
right now. You know, approving these, book bands at certain set times.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.651
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:07.260
&gt;&gt; Using something really similar to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.920
a workflow roll, called an approval process.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.804
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is the

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:10.064
[SOUND]

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.300
something you see with the stamp of approval before it can move on.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.740
&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, it's just like a workflow

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.580
in the sense that you have automated actions, but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.960
it involves that stamp of approval and that personal

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.520
interaction in order for it to complete the cycle.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.950
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.179
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.530
&gt;&gt; Okay.
