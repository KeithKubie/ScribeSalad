00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.130
Let's start off with our little Commodore one one six here which as the story goes from bill Hurd

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.199
Who is one of the chief designers of the machine? He was given a Timex machine out of a

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.399
Commodore filing cabinet and that basically said look, this is our competition

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.549
We won't have a nice cheap business machine preferably for around $50 and they had a chipset ready

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.510
which was the Ted chipset or the text editing display and

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.129
him and his team went off and basically designed the machine we've got in front of us it I

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.480
May often think in a lot of ways

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.689
this is a perfect little retro computer because the games load in no time at all because they're tiny because by the time it's

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.270
Loaded its basic. It's only got twelve point seven out of

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.000
Sixteen K. Anyway, yeah, and if you use this high-res mode, it has 4k

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.889
so no one does but it's more colorful than Commodore 64's capable of more colors and what came first then this other 64

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.350
Yeah, there's 64 was first so off the back of that. They were thinking right. We've sold some good computers here

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.769
Let's do something even better ago. Well, it wasn't even better know they wanted cheaper. So the Commodore 64 was

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.249
Relatively expensive for the mid-range budget computer and they were really keen to get one on the market

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.320
That would compete with the likes of time X and T r99 and all the other cheap companies of the day

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.309
But as it turned out the machine was left with absolutely nowhere to go because Texas Instruments exited the market so did Timex

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.509
So it's a mixture of bad business decisions and bad timing. Really? What year are we here?

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.720
81 82 I believe and it took an awfully long time for anything to happen because I think there are a fair few of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.989
Internal squabbles going on at Commodore at the time. So the Commodore 64

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.429
Would have been still the flagship of Commodores range and then these were supposed to be much much cheaper machines

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.450
There were no frills

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.469
They certainly weren't designed for gaming. So they had no sprite capability the sound chip was

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.129
rudimentary I would suggest that they had one big chip that did the sound and most of the other functions and

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.070
Yeah, they were they were not

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.789
Really meant for entertainment

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.830
but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.919
Of course the world of computing in the early 80s, that's kind of what people expected if you actually look inside it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.020
it's a very very nicely engineered machine, but very quickly the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.709
powers that be at Commodore put their thinking heads together and they came up with three more machines so they came out with the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.740
C to 3 to the C to 64 which still gives the series its name and they v36 fault

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.990
Which was to be like the top end machine

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.629
so you had the 1 1 6 2 the bottom 2 3 2 2 6 4 and 3 3 6 4 and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.890
The 1 1 6

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.809
Not much happened with that for quite a little while. They were concentrating on the 2 3 -

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.779
So they're all the same chipset. It just depends how much memory that all features they had

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.749
So the 2 3 2 had?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.730
32k of memory and it was in exactly the same case as our plus 4 then there was the C to 64 which has obviously

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.230
64k of RAM and then the top-end one was the 336 for which for some reason that I can't fathom

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.760
Had speech synthesis built-in. So the team that designed the Speak &amp; Spell

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.519
They actually put a lady's voice into the v36 for

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.889
Very very quickly. They ditched the 2 3 2 and

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.809
The Commodore 1 1 6 I think they produced about 50,000 of them all but if you ended up in Germany

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.100
We got boxed one over here. It looks like someone took a knife to it at some point and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.730
Tried to stab the bolts to death. So yeah, that's all in German

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.089
when you think of say the Commodore 64, it's got this very slab like

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.910
Appearance this one not so much

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.209
what was the designer in-house the case was designed in Japan as I think most of the machine was and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.520
it's a

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.529
Cultural thing I guess. So it just it does look very great as I say

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.679
This is one thing that drew me to the series in the first place

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.209
I I did really like the look of the machine and that made me more curious about it and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.518
It was one of the first retro computers

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.969
I got hold of so this is I mean, we're here at the Center for computing history

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.580
But this is your machine, right? This is my machine

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.409
So you brought that especially influence I have yet. So I have to Commodore one-one sixes

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.499
I have got one in my case over there, which is a very low serial number. So that's number

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.050
What is it one five one two, so this is the one I tend to take them all care of

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.560
so that's looked how to

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.089
Keep the dust and the light off of it and then a little while ago

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.970
I got hold of this one because I've never seen one in a box

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.010
with my own eyes

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.010
So to get hold the chance of to get hold of one in a box and was that from a popular auction website?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.850
It was indeed. Yes

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.559
Yes from a very Commodore oriented to sellers shall we say so it was fully restored as well?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.310
Which was another big plus what needs to be done to a machine right like that

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.939
Well, the Commodore one one six has this very oh

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.309
It's a chiclet keyboard. So like the spectrum but the keys are even smaller and they do tend to roll about on your finger

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.190
What tends to go wrong with the keyboard is the connector?

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.710
will start to fray and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.850
it's almost impossible to replace other things that you would need to be very careful of with the whole series is

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.059
the Ted chip or the eight three six zero and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.260
the processors

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.230
Which is a seven 501 or eight 501 depending what machine you've got they get very very hot

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.610
So my advice is if you ever fancy getting hold of one of these machines

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.199
Don't even turn it on to try it put the heatsinks on before you even

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.679
Fire it up because those chips get amazingly hot as a little retro machine. I do quite like the series because

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.540
You know, you just want a quick fix of gaming they're only short little

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.400
Arcade games usually and they load in a couple of minutes even off of a cassette

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
So I do quite like it for that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.730
Other things we should point out about the machine is of course

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.429
It does not have the usual Atari like connectors for joysticks. I've read on the Internet

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.520
Oh

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.270
That's to keep it incompatible with the Commodore 64 when other machines

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.980
it wasn't is purely because this was the one and only vision for the series and

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.440
The big nine pin Atari connector simply just did not fit in the case

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.769
So they had to come up with these little din plugs and that of course carried onto the cassette

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.500
Player here. The only one that is the same as the Commodore 64 is

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.149
The serial for printers and disk drives things

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.560
It does have which other machines of its ilk could do not have we have actually got a reset button

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.068
It's almost console like in it's shaping actually with venting on the back as I said before it needs the venting

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:11.688
Certainly, they knew they had a problem with heeds because underneath the keyboard here. We've got a great big metal plate and

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.399
That metal plate has got two prongs one goes down onto the processor

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.239
One goes down onto the ted chip to actually keep it a little bit cool

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.329
Something they didn't carry on in entirely

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.009
Into the rest of the series that eventually did arrive

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:34.639
When this machine was being kind of creative and designed and thought-out got jack'd remote the reigns at Commodore

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.829
But he was soon to leave. So did that have an impact on this had an enormous impact on this series?

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:42.889
It was a victim of timing as well in that

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.529
He was very very scared of

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:53.269
the Japanese flooding the market with cheap computer imports and he was also really worried about the budget computers of

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:55.710
sinclair and

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.710
texas instruments and

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:01.098
So that's why he wanted commodore to have their own cheap

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.789
Computer to compete with them but very shortly after this was completed this version

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.579
The Texas Instruments left the market. So did Timex and the reported?

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.729
Influx of machines from Japan simply didn't happen

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.120
so it was a victim of timing with that and then

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.240
Jack Tramiel was having

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.490
problems with the board at Commodore

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.979
There's various stories around the internet of what those problems were and

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.310
the last act

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.760
that he ever did for Commodore was at the CES where he is photographed holding the v3 64 and the

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.769
264 where they were launched at that show what happened next was a

00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:49.609
mixture of marketing people getting involved and

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:56.729
Some rather strange design choices that made it very very hard for these for the machines that followed

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.190
to survive in the marketplace

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:05.669
and this was kind of a footnote to that, you know, oh and there might be a prototype of things like the spectrum whatever think

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.950
vaguely interested

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.550
You know, absolutely

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.579
Amazing if in a moment, I could jump up and hit my head on a block and something appears out of it

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:19.079
I do think there might be a Japanese company reaching for the phone at some point
