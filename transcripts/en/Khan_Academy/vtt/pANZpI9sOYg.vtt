00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.990
Solve this system.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.650
And here we have three
equations with three unknowns.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.970
And just so you have a
way to visualize this,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.630
each of these equations
would actually

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.039
be a plane in three dimensions.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.830
And so you're actually
trying to figure out

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.716
where three planes in
three dimensions intersect.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.090
I won't go into
the details here.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.790
I'll focus more
on the mechanics.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.440
But you can imagine if I were
to draw three-dimensional space

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.630
over here.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.727
Now, all of a sudden, it
will an x, y, and z-axes.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.060
So you can imagine that maybe
this first plane-- and I'm

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.140
not drawing it the way
it might actually look--

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320
might look something like that.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.960
I'm just drawing
part of the plane.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.540
And maybe this plane over here,
it intersects right over there,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.370
and it comes popping
out like this.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.299
And then it goes
behind it like that,

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:46.590
keeps going in every direction.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.060
I'm just drawing
part of the plane.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.860
And maybe this plane
over here, maybe it

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.940
does something like this.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.510
Maybe it intersects
over here and over here,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.480
and so it pops out like that.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.560
And then it goes below it like
that, and it goes like that.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.860
I'm just doing this for
visualization purposes.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.270
And so the intersection
of this plane, the x, y,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.790
and z-coordinates that
would satisfy all three

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.010
of these constraints
the way I drew them,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.490
would be right over here.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.960
So that's what
we're looking for.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.730
And a lot of times, three
equations with three

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.290
unknown systems, they
will be inconsistent.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.560
You won't have a solution here
because it's very possible

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.137
to have three planes that all
don't intersect in one place.

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:28.970
A very simple example
of that is, well, one,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.970
they could all be
parallel to each other.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.884
Or they could
intersect each other,

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.300
but maybe they intersect each
other in kind of a triangle.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.670
So maybe one plane
looks like that.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.480
Then another plane maybe pops
out like that, goes underneath.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.420
And then maybe the
third plane cuts in.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.495
It does something like this,
where it goes into that plane

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.220
and keeps going out
like that, but it

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.610
intersects this plane over here.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.580
So you see, this kind
of forms a triangle,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.480
and they don't all
intersect in one point.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.430
So in this situation, you would
have an inconsistent system.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.013
So with that out of
the way, let's try

00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:06.300
to actually solve this system.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.770
And the trick here is
to try to eliminate

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.820
one variable at a time
from all of the equations,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.610
making sure that you have the
information from all three

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.577
equations here.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.410
So what we're going to
do is we could maybe,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.940
it looks like the
easiest to eliminate--

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.773
since we have a positive
y and a negative y,

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:24.900
and then another positive y--
it seems like we can eliminate

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.590
the y's.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.380
We can add these two
equations and come up

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.990
with another equation that will
only be in terms of x and z.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.830
And then we could use these
two equations to come up

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.550
with another equation that'll
only be in terms of x and z.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.410
But it'll have all of the x
and z constraint information

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.530
embedded in it because we're
using all three equations.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.870
So let's do that.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.600
So first, let's add these two
equations right over here.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.370
So we have x plus y minus
3z is equal to negative 10,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250
and x minus y plus
2z is equal to 3.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.990
So over here, if we
want to eliminate y

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.150
we can literally just
add these two equations.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.600
So on the left-hand side, x
plus x is 2x, y plus negative y

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.760
cancels out.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.780
And then negative
3z plus 2z, that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.200
gives us just a negative z.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.110
And then we have negative 10
plus 3, which is negative 7.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.950
So using these two
equations, we got

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.220
2x minus z is equal
to negative 7,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.360
just adding these two equations.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.115
Now let's do these
two equations.

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.490
And we can we
reuse this equation

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.370
as long as we're using
new information here.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.870
Now we're using the
extra constraint

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.520
of this bottom equation.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.090
So we have x minus y
plus 2z is equal to 3,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.780
and we have 2x plus y minus
z is equal to negative 6.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.450
And if we want to
eliminate the y's, we

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.280
can just add these
two equations.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.480
So x plus 2x is 3x.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.830
Negative y plus y cancels out.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.370
2z minus z, well,
that is just z.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.370
And that is going to be
equal to 3 plus negative 6

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.040
is negative 3.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.830
So if I add these
two equations, I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.110
get 3x plus z is
equal to negative 3.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.880
Now I have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.690
This is a little bit more
traditional of a problem.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.040
So let me write them over here.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.900
So we have 2x minus z
is equal to negative 7,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.930
and then we have 3x plus
z is equal to negative 3.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.900
And the way this
problem is set up,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.780
it gets pretty
simple pretty fast,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.490
because if we just add these two
equations, the z's cancel out.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.440
Otherwise, if it didn't
happen so naturally,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.660
we would have to multiply
one of these equations

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.080
or maybe both of them
by some scaling factor.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.100
But we can just add
these two equations up.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.240
On the left-hand
side, 2x plus 3x

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.070
is 5x, negative z plus z
cancels out, negative 7

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.580
plus negative 3, that
is equal to negative 10.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.720
Divide both sides of
this equation by 5,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.680
and we get x is
equal to negative 2.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.049
Now, we can substitute back
to find the other variables.

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:14.840
We could substitute
back into this equation

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.180
to figure out what
z must be equal to.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.810
So we have 2 times x, 2
times negative 2 minus z

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.930
is equal to negative
7, or negative 4 minus

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.220
z is equal to negative 7.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.570
We can add 4 to both
sides of this equation,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.310
and then we get negative
z is equal to negative 7

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.350
plus 4 is negative 3.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.800
Multiply or divide both
sides by negative 1,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.059
and you get z is equal to 3.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:46.600
And now we can go
and substitute back

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.700
into one of these
original equations.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.060
So we have x-- we know x
is negative 2-- so we have

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.320
negative 2 plus y
minus 3 times z.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.680
Well, we know z is
3-- minus 3 times

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.220
3 should be equal
to negative 10.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.200
And now we just solve for y.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.460
So we get negative
2 plus y minus 9

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.490
is equal to negative 10.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.820
And so negative 2 minus
9, that's negative 11.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.820
So we have y minus 11
is equal to negative 10.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.130
So we can add 11 to both
sides of this equation,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:31.370
and we get y is equal to
negative 10 plus 11 is 1.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.070
So we're done.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.380
We got x is equal to
negative 2, z is equal to 3,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.510
and y is equal to 1.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.420
Now we can actually
go back and check it,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.230
verify that this x, y,
and z works for all three

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.940
constraints, that this
three-dimensional coordinate

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.530
lies on all three planes.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.420
So let's try it out.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.490
We got x is negative
2, z is 3, y is 1.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.190
So if we substitute it-- let
me do it into each of them.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.730
So in this first equation,
that means we have negative 2

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.300
plus 1.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.700
Remember, y was equal to 1.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.720
Let me write it over
here. y is equal to 1,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.120
x is equal to negative
2, z is equal to 3.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.835
That was the result we got.

00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:11.160
Yep, that's the result we got.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.750
So when we test it in this
first one, you have negative 2

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.450
plus 1 minus 3
times 3, so minus 9.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.170
This should be equal to
negative 10, and it is.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.800
Negative 2 plus 1 is negative
1 minus 9 is negative 10.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.310
So it works for the first one.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.690
Let's try it for the second
equation right over here.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:37.960
So we have negative 2 minus
y, so minus 1 plus 2 times z.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.970
So z is 3, so 2 times 3.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.230
So plus 6 needs
to be equal to 3.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.890
So this is negative 3 plus 6,
which is indeed equal to 3.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.000
So it satisfies the
second equation.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.030
And then we have the
last one right over here.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.530
We have 2 times x, so
2 times negative 2,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.050
which is negative 4.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:07.450
Negative 4 plus y, so
plus 1 minus z, so minus 3

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.840
needs to be equal to negative 6.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.230
Negative 4 plus 1 is negative 3,
and then you subtract 3 again.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.010
It equals negative 6.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.610
So it satisfies all
three equations,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.840
so we can feel pretty
good about our answer.
