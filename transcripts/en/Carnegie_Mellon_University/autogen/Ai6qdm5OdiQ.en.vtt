you got to figure out in something

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:09.940
you got to figure out in something
 

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.550

that's very broad where you want to play

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560
that's very broad where you want to play
 

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.060
that's very broad where you want to play
and then you have to build as much value

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.070
and then you have to build as much value
 

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.170
and then you have to build as much value
as you possibly can and that has so many

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.180
as you possibly can and that has so many
 

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.000

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:33.100
born ah I think it's part of both so let
me just talk about the education system

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.110
me just talk about the education system
 

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.049
me just talk about the education system
in the country first so I think

00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:35.059
in the country first so I think
 

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.239
in the country first so I think
Jerry said it and nobody could have said

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:37.249
Jerry said it and nobody could have said
 

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:38.889
Jerry said it and nobody could have said
it better that nobody does it better

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:38.899
it better that nobody does it better
 

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:41.409
it better that nobody does it better
than Carnegie Mellon when it comes to

00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:41.419
than Carnegie Mellon when it comes to
 

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:45.099
than Carnegie Mellon when it comes to
really developing an engineer or a

in this country the populations about

00:15:59.169 --> 00:15:59.179
in this country the populations about
 

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:01.329
in this country the populations about
350 million I wish there were more

Mellon so let's talk about teaching

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:08.899
Mellon so let's talk about teaching
 

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.639
Mellon so let's talk about teaching
innovation I think we don't try to teach

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:12.649
innovation I think we don't try to teach
 

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:15.609
innovation I think we don't try to teach
innovation per se as a topical area but

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:15.619
innovation per se as a topical area but
 

00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:20.279

in the context of not one course or two

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:30.559
in the context of not one course or two
 

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.919
in the context of not one course or two
courses or three courses but it is what

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:32.929
courses or three courses but it is what
 

00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:34.599
courses or three courses but it is what
we call innovation across the curriculum

00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:34.609
we call innovation across the curriculum
 

00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:37.749

so so let's go back to race question

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820
so so let's go back to race question
 

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.120
so so let's go back to race question
right so I think one of the things that

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.130
right so I think one of the things that
 

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.190
right so I think one of the things that
we do really really well with our

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200
we do really really well with our
 

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.070
we do really really well with our
students is we don't just experiment

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080
students is we don't just experiment
 

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.230
students is we don't just experiment
with things in the lab we like to take

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240
with things in the lab we like to take
 

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.970
with things in the lab we like to take
things out in the real world break

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980
things out in the real world break
 

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.240
things out in the real world break
things learn from breaking things get up

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.250
things learn from breaking things get up
 

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.560

does i mean i think if you believe in it
 

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:51.970
does i mean i think if you believe in it
and if you believe that if you build it

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:51.980
and if you believe that if you build it
 

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.639

you would bite yourself then it becomes

and we're the only wants to have it and
it couldn't have been done if we just

it couldn't have been done if we just
 

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:09.759
it couldn't have been done if we just
sat in the lab so going back to the

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:09.769
sat in the lab so going back to the
 

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.310
sat in the lab so going back to the
research point i think we like to think

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320
research point i think we like to think
 

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.859
research point i think we like to think
big we like to go out and try things in

that then allows the research to be

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400
that then allows the research to be
 

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.770
that then allows the research to be
funded which creates then the

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:13.780

can't solve and so you talked a little

00:35:23.849 --> 00:35:23.859
can't solve and so you talked a little
 

00:35:23.859 --> 00:35:25.290
can't solve and so you talked a little
bit about that with clean energy and

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:25.300
bit about that with clean energy and
 

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.260

some of these initiatives you know some

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:32.830
some of these initiatives you know some
 

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.250
some of these initiatives you know some
is the early stage rd like you're saying

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:35.260
is the early stage rd like you're saying
 

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.800

from the federal government that capital

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640
from the federal government that capital
 

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.120
from the federal government that capital
is not being provided by private sector

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.130
is not being provided by private sector
 

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.580
is not being provided by private sector
because those type of initiatives just

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:52.590
because those type of initiatives just
 

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.980
because those type of initiatives just
are larger than what private capital can

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:54.990
are larger than what private capital can
 

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.750
are larger than what private capital can
provide and so I think it's critical to

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760
provide and so I think it's critical to
 

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.330
provide and so I think it's critical to

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:43.910
already right so if you look at the
government policy now they're going away

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920
government policy now they're going away
 

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.830

they may determine winners and losers
through that that but that's that's not

through that that but that's that's not
their primary primary innovation I think

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000
their primary primary innovation I think

or involvement is is the economics but
 

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.130
or involvement is is the economics but
they are involved in every aspect it

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140
they are involved in every aspect it
 

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.170
they are involved in every aspect it
this is not a new thing it's been a

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180
this is not a new thing it's been a
 

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.730
this is not a new thing it's been a
hundred years that they've been involved

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740
hundred years that they've been involved
 

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.130
hundred years that they've been involved
in energy and they need to be they need

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140
in energy and they need to be they need
 

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.990
in energy and they need to be they need
to be yeah every aspect of it yeah i

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000
to be yeah every aspect of it yeah i
 

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.340
to be yeah every aspect of it yeah i
agree i think the other way to think

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:31.350
agree i think the other way to think
 

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.690
agree i think the other way to think
about it is what would happen if they

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700
about it is what would happen if they
 

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.790
about it is what would happen if they
weren't and i think if they weren't a

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800
weren't and i think if they weren't a
 

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.010
weren't and i think if they weren't a
lot of these promising technologies

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020
lot of these promising technologies
 

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.780
lot of these promising technologies
would not survive and so it's very

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:38.790
would not survive and so it's very
 

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.200
would not survive and so it's very
there's a gap right now in late-stage

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.210
there's a gap right now in late-stage
 

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.990
there's a gap right now in late-stage
funding for a lot of these very

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000
funding for a lot of these very
 

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.750
funding for a lot of these very
interesting cleantech technologies and

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760
interesting cleantech technologies and
 

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.390
interesting cleantech technologies and
if there was nothing there that a lot of

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400
if there was nothing there that a lot of
 

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.100
if there was nothing there that a lot of
that industry would go away because

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:52.110
that industry would go away because
 

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.530
that industry would go away because
there's just there's no money and so i

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540
there's just there's no money and so i
 

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.600
there's just there's no money and so i
think right now although they do by

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:56.610
think right now although they do by
 

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.570
think right now although they do by
definition pick winners and losers it

00:51:59.570 --> 00:51:59.580
definition pick winners and losers it
 

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.310
definition pick winners and losers it
does allow for some of this innovation

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:01.320
does allow for some of this innovation
 

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.320
does allow for some of this innovation
to flourish that has raised significant

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:03.330
to flourish that has raised significant
 

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:05.990
to flourish that has raised significant
capital today so i think it's

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000
capital today so i think it's
 

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.900
capital today so i think it's
interesting because you know even though

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:08.910
interesting because you know even though
 

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:12.050
interesting because you know even though

of federal involvement in markets but

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:14.910
of federal involvement in markets but
 

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.480
of federal involvement in markets but
you know when you look at it there are

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:17.490
you know when you look at it there are
 

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.330
you know when you look at it there are
certain investments and you know early

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:20.340
certain investments and you know early
 

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.190
certain investments and you know early
stage research you know that the

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200
stage research you know that the
 

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.660
stage research you know that the
government federal government has been

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:23.670
government federal government has been
 

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.510
government federal government has been
in for years where the ROI is just not

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520
in for years where the ROI is just not
 

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.460
in for years where the ROI is just not
there for financial investors and you

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:28.470
there for financial investors and you
 

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.190
there for financial investors and you
need some other entity to fill that gap

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200
need some other entity to fill that gap
 

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.240
need some other entity to fill that gap
and so I think the clean tech market

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.250
and so I think the clean tech market
 

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.830
and so I think the clean tech market
right now is one example of that but

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:36.840
right now is one example of that but
 

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.240
right now is one example of that but
there are a number of others yeah okay

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:41.250
there are a number of others yeah okay
 

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:43.760
there are a number of others yeah okay
