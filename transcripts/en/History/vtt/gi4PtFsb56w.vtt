00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.919
DANNY KOKER: You know, when

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.671
it was a really nice car, man.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.133
As far as I was concerned, this
was a great car to start with.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.427
It was little bit plain,
a little bit boring.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.303
But it's just the
right vehicle for us

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.931
to put our Count's
Kustoms vibe all over it.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.434
And we toughened up this
ride from top to bottom now,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.060
and she's ready for shipping.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.062
But before she goes, I want
a little stamp of approval

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.522
from a buddy of mine, Keith.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.107
He's over at Swing Shift Auto.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.277
His shop does beautiful
work, so I trust his opinion.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.528
Plus, the fact I'm
looking forward

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.029
to showing the
surprise to Kevin,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.615
that the car is all done,
and it's actually sold.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.491
RYAN: Oh, that's Kevin.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.492
DANNY KOKER: Kevin Mack.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:35.744
Rollin' up in the Cadillac.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:36.536
The Mack-a-lack.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.370
The Mack-a-lack.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.329
[laughter]

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.497
KEVIN: What up?

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.457
RYAN: Hey, the man.
- Oh my god.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.458
Look at this thing.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.168
[instrumental music playing]

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:47.380
DANNY KOKER: Dude, I wanted
you to see. '67 Camaro, clean.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.675
To toughen up the '67
Camaro, we went old school

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.010
with a touch of modern.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.678
For that mean look,
we added a rear deck

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:57.182
spoiler, a chin spoiler,
and a cowl inducted hood.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.142
We upgraded that
small black Chevy

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.895
with some brand new headers,
a four-barrel carburetor

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.231
on top of an aluminum intake
manifold, a new distributor,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.900
and aluminum radiator.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.819
Underneath, we added power
steering and a power disc brake

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.363
conversion, so this baby can
turn like she's on rails,

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:14.032
and stop on a dime.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.826
To top it all off, Ryan kept
that beautiful factory blue,

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.370
but added some subtle
graphics all over

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.831
to make this thing look
just a little wider

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.458
and just a little meaner.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.501
Yeah, I got a client.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.127
He's back east.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.003
He needed a vehicle.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.172
He needed it right now.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.715
KEITH: You've been
hiding this one from me.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.802
For a second there, I thought
he's going to keep it.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.636
RYAN: Bro.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.970
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.888
DANNY KOKER: Let me
tell you something.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.640
I would.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.308
This is a car I would have in
my stable because it's very me.

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.476
I'm an old school guy.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.894
This car has that
old school vibe.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.979
But since it's
already been paid for

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.441
and belongs to somebody else,
I don't have much of a choice--

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.818
And you actually
made a profit on that.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:50.944
I'm very, very
happy about that.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:51.820
KEITH: I am happy.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.404
DANNY KOKER: '67 Camaro.

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:55.532
This particular one just
takes me back to high school.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:56.783
KEITH: Yeah, real
classic look to it,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.117
but the color is stunning.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.662
KEVIN: That is the
stock Marina Blue Poly.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:02.413
KEITH: No way.

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.624
DANNY KOKER: I'm hooked on that
Cooper tires, 15 inch, 295 50s.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.418
They do a modern
set-up now, you know,

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.045
so it's still-- it updates--

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:09.921
You don't have to feel like
it's ridin' on the rails.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.964
- --the car.
- Yeah.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.131
DANNY KOKER: And they're great.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.299
KEVIN: Hey, could
I open the hood?

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.634
DANNY KOKER:
Absolutely, brother.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.135
Let's check it out.
Let's check it out.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.637
When we first got her,
she was a bone stock 327.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.055
I mean, talking, bone stock.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.974
Got the ceramic
coated headers on it.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.226
It's got Flowmaster
exhaust on it.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.477
We updated the brakes.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.770
Got the big disk
brakes on the front--

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.397
I saw those.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.273
DANNY KOKER: --so you get
your big booster and stuff,

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.440
and everything on it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.358
It goes great and
it stops great.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.776
It's traditional.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:32.610
KEVIN: [inaudible] and
it looks [inaudible]..

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.319
Wow.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.529
It closes nice.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.697
Just the stock interior?
This looks--

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.656
DANNY KOKER: Yeah.
KEVIN: --great.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.907
It's a power steering car.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.741
So this is for me, right?

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.909
[laughter]

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.952
That's why-- you
brought me over

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:41.911
here to give this to me, right?

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.663
[laughter]
- Yeah, man.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.206
Yeah, man.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.082
KEVIN: Dude, I love the
striping that you guys did.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.041
It was real--

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.418
DANNY KOKER: That's Ryan.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.836
It was a neutral but
beautiful color blue.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.713
I didn't want to take
anything away from it.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.882
Just let the color be the color.
KEVIN: Right.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.759
Anyone who sees this thing is
just gonna absolutely love it.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.303
DANNY KOKER: Bro, you
wanna hear this thing?

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.470
Let's do it.
[laughter]

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.806
What'd you put,
cherry bombs on it?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:02.932
- Flowmaster.
- Oh.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.642
OK.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:07.562
With the Ceramacoded headers
and the Flowmaster exhaust,

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.522
it just sounds proper.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.857
[engine revving]

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.735
DANNY KOKER: That's high school.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.903
KEITH: Right.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.404
That's got the
high school ride.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.489
I would say there's no
way in hell that's a 327.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.033
No.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.200
Actually, one of my
favorite small-blocks is 327.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.660
- They're bulletproof.
- Right.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.078
They're bulletproof.
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.496
They're super
snappy like that.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.748
I dig it, man.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.958
I personally am totally
digging the car.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.045
But Keith, if you were
the guy waiting for this,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.796
and this got off the
truck, how would you feel?

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.965
Oh, I'd be super pleased.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.717
I'd be happy to have it.
- Dig it.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.718
I feel great about it.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.761
Thanks for checking it out.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.929
Kev.
KEVIN: Absolutely.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.055
And this is a
great deal, Ryan.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.806
Phenomenal.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.142
All the boys at the shop came
out swinging on this ride, man.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.853
Man, this car was nice
when we found her.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.189
Plus, we had a built
in customer, so, bam!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.982
We just got down to the fun.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.318
We did all kinds of cool
things to this Camaro to make

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.528
her old-school-muscle-car cool.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.531
And I gotta tell you, man,
our customer back east,

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.991
he's lucky already
paid for this thing.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.618
'Cause if he was standing
here, I'd probably

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.995
give him his money back and
try and keep this Camaro,

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.081
'cause this baby is sweet.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.624
It's so traditional.
I love it.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.625
That's my style.
