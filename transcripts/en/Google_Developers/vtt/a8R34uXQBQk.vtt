BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.360
Well hello everyone
on the Hangout.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.580
And welcome to the first in our
week long series from the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.730
Creative Sandbox Gallery.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.360
My name is Brian.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.270
I'm here at Google.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.000
And sitting next
to me is Pete.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.630
PETE LEPAGE: Hey.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.490
I'm Pete LePage.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.290
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.580
And I help developers
make cool web stuff.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.330
BRIAN MOROZ: So that's
what we're going

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.060
to talk about today.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.480
And today we're going to
be talking about mobile

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.090
specifically.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.890
And this whole week we're
going to be highlighting

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.250
agencies that have done
spectacular creative work

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.680
using some of Google's
products or APIs.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.530
This afternoon we have Beattie
McGuinnes Bungay on the line.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.960
And they are all in London.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.290
So it's very dark out by them.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.360
And we appreciate them
coming on board

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.390
this late in the afternoon.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.790
Thanks, guys.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.290
If you guys could give a quick
round of who you are and what

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.500
you do at the agency,
then we'll segue

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.750
into what you've done.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.730
And we'll take a look at
some of your work.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.600
ARTHUR: Hello.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.240
I'm Arthur.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.780
And I was the creative
tech on the project.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.480
MAX: And I'm Max.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.290
I was the account director
at BMB on Grolsch.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.720
MEL: My name is Mel.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.620
And I am the producer
on Grolsch.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.910
CALUM: And my house is Calum.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.340
I was the interactive designer
on the project.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.605
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:27.870
Cool.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.550
PETE LEPAGE: So there we are.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.310
And before we segue in, we're
going to talk to these guys

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.840
about what they did, how they
did it, who they worked with,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.260
what were the horrible
nightmares they dealt with it,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.490
what were the wonderful
rainbows that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.300
appeared on the horizon.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.010
Let's actually take a look
at a reel of the work.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.980
And we'll jump in after that.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.870
BRIAN MOROZ: Awesome.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.400
MALE SPEAKER: Grolsch is a big
bold beer, looking to deliver

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.650
a rich brand experience.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.862
[?

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.280
MALE SPEAKER: Yant Van Dig.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.880
This legendary policeman has
never spoken a word.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.685
Local gangs have dubbed
him [? Deres ?]

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:03.180
[? dika ?]

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.790
[? daz, ?]

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.040
the quiet badger.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.396
Sing, little canary, sing.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.370
MALE SPEAKER:
[? Ke kuriwi wos ?].

00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:19.682
MALE SPEAKER: Character speaks
louder than words.

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:21.520
Big, bold Grosch.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320
MALE SPEAKER: Our TV campaign
was just the beginning.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.300
We invite our intrigued audience
to meet Yant, our big

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.550
bold character, online.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.530
MALE SPEAKER: So you've found
Yant, the Netherlands most

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.780
notorious police officer.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.020
The man who never speaks,
he is everything.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.760
Text him your name.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.870
And if it sounds familiar,
he'll buy you a beer.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.040
MALE SPEAKER: Yant receives
everyone's text live in the

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.940
video, replying in real time.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.050
Mobile technology allows us to
bring our online Yant to life.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.930
And every user has a
unique experience.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.875
Over 2000 uses a day are
texting to see if

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.270
Yant's heard of them.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.540
If Yant has heard of them, they
receive a voucher for a

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.970
free four pack of Grolsch.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.520
And to make it even easier,
we'll give directions to the

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.340
closest place to redeem
the voucher.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.640
Win or lose, people are sharing
their experience and

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.110
bringing a whole new audience
to Grolsch.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.370
Try it for yourself
at Grolsch.co.uk.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.270
also

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.386
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:06:56.386 --> 00:06:59.050
Well I thought that was a pretty
cool highlight covering

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.940
a lot of neat stuff.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.270
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.000
Very, very cool.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.690
Looks like it was a very fun
client for you guys.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.530
I hope so.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.760
And that was a really, really
great use a lot of different

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.330
technologies.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.080
So maybe we can kick off and
just go around the table.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.890
And I'm going to ask
the first question.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.530
And this is something that we
think about a lot here is what

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.760
led to the idea generation
process.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.870
Were you guys thinking about
Maps technology in the

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.140
technology you wanted to harness
and then build a

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.570
campaign around that?

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.830
Or did you have a campaign
idea and then go seeking

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.890
technology that would
fit in there?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.850
What was the process
for all of you?

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.280
MAX: Well I think for us very
much actually the campaign

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.100
came first.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.100
And the technology kind
of fitted into that.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.430
So Grolsch came to us with a
brief that they wanted to

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.400
really relaunch after being
quite quiet for a period.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.830
So we kind of came up with
a campaign about big bold

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.400
Grolsch, which is because it has
a sort of slightly bigger

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.700
flavor than other beers.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.440
So we wanted to really
highlight

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.440
this and hero it actually.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.410
It's got this big flavor.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.800
But it never needs to really
speak about it.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.245
So we came up the campaign of
silent legends, who are

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.500
characters with kind
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.030
without having to
ever say a word.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.540
So with the creative team, we
came up with sort of TV

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.910
campaign which went
out in the UK.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.750
And then from that, we wanted
to then give an experience

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.480
that actually got the brand
into people's hands.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.065
So how could we take these big
silent characters and big,

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:24.047
bold Grolsch, and actually give
people experience that

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:26.320
then ended up with them getting
them a beer, which was

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.830
then when we brought
the [INAUDIBLE] in.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.169
ARTHUR: I think we worked with
Kate [? Baiten ?] and Joe

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:33.460
[? Brews ?].

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.490
And they were the creators
on this.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.789
And they had a really sort of
strong [? leaf ?] of what they

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.650
wanted to achieve.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.609
But we worked with them right
from the beginning all the way

00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:42.030
through to the end.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.159
And I think that's what
really helped us.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.080
They then led the
creative group--

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.080
decided where they wanted
to go, how they

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.410
wanted it to work.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.700
But since the beginning, they
kind of got is involved in how

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.430
that would filter down from what
Max is saying, which is

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.160
brand [? to  have an ?]
experience, which was quite a

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.080
tall order at the time.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.960
It felt like quite
a lot to achieve.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.470
But looking back on it,
it worked quite

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.870
nicely, that the TV--

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.950
that led on to the
interactive.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.700
The interactive then
led to Mobile.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.455
And Mobile led to the kind of
brand to hand experience.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.910
BRIAN MOROZ: Very nice, so
very holistic actually.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.090
So this wasn't something where
it was you guys are just

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.830
working on this kind of walled
off digital piece.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.130
This sounds like this really
came across all the different

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.960
media types, and that
that was part of the

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.790
idea from the start.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.030
Is that accurate?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.450
MAX: Definitely.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.280
And I think it was massively
important, that actually the

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.420
digital part of it and the kind
of experience that people

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.530
had wasn't just an add on that
came after a few TV ads.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.660
We always wanted a kind
of experience.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.960
And we wanted a reall
interesting digital bit.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.920
And it was absolutely part of
the brief from the beginning.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.630
But we kind of needed to come
up with a campaign, and come

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.690
up with what was
[? going to fit it ?]

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.590
and then tailor a digital
experience to that.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.900
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.800
So that was baked in
from the beginning,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.520
which we love to hear.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.430
And I know that sometimes that's
a challenge, depending

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.920
on the client, depending on
the agency, et cetera.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.950
So it's cool to hear that you
guys actually had that from

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.300
the get go.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.170
So actually following up on that
note, given that it was

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.660
across so many media, and it
was a fairly rich, fairly

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.480
complex campaign, who worked
on the project?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.430
How did you guys form the
team within the agency?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.360
How did you decide who was going
to work out what piece?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.850
How did that all
come together?

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.320
MAX: Well, we had an account
team who work on

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.210
Grolsch all the time.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.370
So it was myself, as the account
director, business

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.515
director, and the planner,
[? Jaime ?]

00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:39.320
[? Imman ?]--

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.145
we took the brief.

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:43.680
And we've kind of worked
on what Grolsch could

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.670
[? be with ?] case
and [? Jaime ?].

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.150
So it was that core team that
started off the whole

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.760
campaign, started off thinking
about kind of

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.820
where we take Grolsch.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.620
But we knew very quickly that
we wanted Arthur as creative

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.140
technologist, Calum and Mel to
be part of the campaign.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.295
So even as we were kind of
looking at the TV scripts,

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:04.590
even as we were coming up with
these characters, we kept them

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.540
very much involved in it.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.490
And we kept them very
much in the loop.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.260
And we were like look, if
there's anything that you

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.420
think's interesting around
this, if there are any

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.400
interesting technical
innovations, or anything that

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.915
you think can kind of help with
this brand experience, we

00:11:16.915 --> 00:11:17.850
want to know early.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.030
Because I think the earlier
you get it in to

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.970
a client, the better.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.990
And I think through
a [? process ?]

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.170
[INAUDIBLE] it was a problem
that actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.180
stayed.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.260
And it was probably about a year
and a half in the making

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.000
all in all from kind of getting
the brief to actually

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.190
getting it out.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.620
And I think that the important
thing was that core team stuck

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.730
together throughout.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.130
And actually we worked very
closely with the client, who's

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.560
was very good actually, and
very good and kind of

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.750
understanding that it's not
always going to be very

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.460
straightforward.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.725
And if you're trying to do
something interested, if

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:52.180
you're trying to do something
innovative, there's not always

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.760
going to be an example of it to
sort of say, oh, well it'll

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.685
be like this.

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:58.520
So actually it really helped
to have the client come in

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.910
early, get to know that
team, and get a lot of

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.230
trust in that team.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.860
And it meant that actually
moving forward as we came

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.890
across different hurtles or
different things that we

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.070
needed to do, we had the
client on board very

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.450
much from the start.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.630
So that team evolved
and got bigger.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.945
PETE LEPAGE: So I was going to
ask, were you guys, as you

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.150
were working through some of
these-- were you building

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.780
prototypes for things that you
were like, hey we don't even

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.740
know if this is going to work,
or we haven't seen this done

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.840
before-- did you build a
prototype to go, OK, here's

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.420
what we think it's going
to look like?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.000
So that you'd have something
to show the client and say

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.980
hey, this is a prototype.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.940
What do you think of this?

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.040
Or where more going for hey,
here are some wire frames, and

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.170
this is what we think
it'll look like?

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:40.660
ARTHUR: No.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.210
So I mean I think credit to
Mel for holding it all

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.950
together, we didn't
do a prototype.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.270
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.880
ARTHUR: And one thing
that we do almost

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.840
always now is a prototype.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.650
I mean we're working on a
project at the moment where it

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.260
literally looks like it's held
together [INAUDIBLE] this.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.250
It's kind of a bit of API
here and then another

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.585
bit of API over here.

00:12:58.585 --> 00:13:01.110
And it's Times New Roman.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.730
And it all looks a bit sloppy.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.460
But one think I think we've
probably learnt from the

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.800
experience is no matter how
rough and ready that process,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.720
it's so important to
get that together.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.110
But we didn't on this one.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.400
We didn't have a prototype.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.255
We had a rough idea of where
we were going with it.

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:19.100
We had--

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.645
I think it was five different
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:20.645 --> 00:13:22.620
[? buttons ?] in total
including us.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.122
And we were also rebuilding
the responsive website for

00:13:26.122 --> 00:13:28.230
Grolsch at the same time.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.740
So it was lots and lots of
holding bits and bobs that

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.410
from a good scope of work we
knew we were going to slot

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.170
into place.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.690
The prototype would be one thing
that we've learnt we

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.240
could make things easier for
us I think going forward.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.010
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.490
MEL: Yeah.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.230
I think the way we worked
in the end-- we kind of

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.140
practically identified
the clear roles and

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.680
responsibilities of all the
different partners involved.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.050
Because as Arthur said
there were so many.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.470
In terms of the prototype
though, we did get to a stage

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.940
where it wasn't probably til
about three weeks before

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.140
launch that we actually had a
fully working model that we

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.610
could start to [INAUDIBLE]
and pull apart.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.420
PETE LEPAGE: That's brave.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.160
BRIAN MOROZ: That's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.990
MAX: We had quite a
trusting client.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.560
And then having been involved
and knowing the team.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.080
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.280
MAX: And we had a campaign
that we knew was a really

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.130
interesting one.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.210
And we just needed to
bring that to life.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.310
So I think bringing the client
in early and then getting

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.020
trust of the team actually
really helped with this.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.380
Because then we knew in the
end we'd be fine if

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:29.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.640
deliver it.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.720
But it's just at all the stages
along the way, there's

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.090
not always something to see.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.330
ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.670
We knew technically that
it was going to work.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.040
We saw pre-written how we
wanted the API to work.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.720
We've got the production part
in the right places.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.706
We've done many practice
[INAUDIBLE] certain areas we

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:44.585
wanted to do.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:47.760
The thing we didn't do is
a master prototype for

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.030
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.610
It was so difficult with all
the kind of [? bridge ?] in

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.270
front of them and
[? think board. ?]

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.650
And then [? Mobius SI ?], which
brought them very much

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.650
the kind of API that's
we've built.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.070
Now the API was the bit that
we took a lot of scratching

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.360
our heads and getting
that right.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.180
Then that was the bit that
we needed to make

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.290
sure was rock solid.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.770
Because we just didn't want
any element of the--

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.410
if the trip didn't work, it
would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.600
BRIAN MOROZ: Right.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.490
But it sounds like you guys were
actually quite confident

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.140
of the technology side.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.350
And it sounds like you
also had the team

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.490
formed pretty early.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.350
So it sounds like you guys had
the team ready to go working

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.930
with the client for a
long period of time.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.640
And you guys felt confident
internally that

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.490
we've got this covered.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.375
Except we want to test
a couple of things.

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:31.020
But you pretty much knew
what you were doing.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.350
You didn't have to
build prototypes.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.150
You didn't have to do
a lot of test runs.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.020
Is that accurate?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.830
MEL: Yeah.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.470
I think that's fairly
accurate.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.890
We were confident in the scale
of work that we'd written.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.330
And it was something that
continually evolved.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.270
So we even used kind of the
basic [? group ?] to approach

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.720
the production partners.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.490
And when they came back to us
with questions, that's then

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.773
more information that--

00:15:54.773 --> 00:15:57.702
it helped evolve our scope, and
eventually kind of evolved

00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:00.620
into the function spec.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.010
Because it became so detailed.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.800
And that's kind of the main
thing that held our project

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.280
together was this one document
that listed exactly how

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:08.650
[? you think ?]

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.180
[? they will ?] work.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.470
MAX: I've got to say I found it
quite hard working with so

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.390
many production partners.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.280
Because actually there's so many
different people you're

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.850
relying on to deliver
the more people you

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.200
involve in the team.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.290
So whereas we had a core team.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.430
And it was all sort
of fantastic.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.580
It was always quite hard
when we'd bring

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.110
other people into that.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.720
But as Mel said, it's all
about having roles and

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.090
responsibilities defined up
front, and then trusting your

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.136
partners to deliver.

00:16:38.136 --> 00:16:38.880
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.030
Beautiful.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.440
So that's who worked on the
project, and how you formed

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.080
the team, which sounded
fairly organic.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.100
It sounds like you guys all knew
exactly where you needed

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.010
to be and what you
needed to do.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.430
What did the creative
process look like?

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.590
As you guys were developing
this, who was taking leads at

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.730
different times?

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.450
Where did the idea come from?

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.830
Who said I can make
this happen?

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.090
Were there particular hang
ups or really tough areas

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.359
involving the technology
or even the ideas?

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.500
Where there huge
breakthroughs?

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.890
Just how did that look from that
year and a half long--

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.220
which is a long process?

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.354
So how did the creative ideas
come to bear fruit?

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.983
MAX: Well just talking about the
very start of the process

00:17:19.983 --> 00:17:21.480
before we get into
the technology--

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.520
I think it took quite a while
to get to Grolsch and to get

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.242
to this campaign of the
silent legends.

00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:32.690
So I think that it's something
that once we'd actually come

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.040
up with it, it was a
very simple idea.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.310
It was actually a very easy one
to then see how you could

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.350
build a campaign through it.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.770
So everything kind of feeds
back into that.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.680
But I think that it took quite a
long time to actually get to

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.340
that as a platform
for Grolsch.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.855
And I think that especially in
marketing beer, there's a lot

00:17:50.855 --> 00:17:52.420
of very good work out there.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.330
I think that you've got to do
something very good to make

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.170
yourself stand out.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.950
And you've got to really do
something very different.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.770
So I think it took a while to
kind of actually define what

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.740
the platform should be
and then where we

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.720
should go from there.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.960
But that was Kate and Joe in the
creative team, and Jaime

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.900
[? McClannah ?] who were the
main leads on that and who

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.626
steered the client through a lot
of different routes, a lot

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:17.940
of different potential ways we
could have taken it, and then

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.000
come up with a very simple
platform that we could then

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
build from.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.180
In terms of the technology,
I guess, Arthur, you could

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.575
probably shed some
light on that.

00:18:27.575 --> 00:18:28.400
ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.230
I remember the process
quite clearly.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.570
It went the right
way, I suppose.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.410
Jaime [? Imman ?], who did the
planning, came up with the

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.986
approach that he wanted to go
with as far as the brand to

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:39.410
hand experience.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.180
Kate and Joe very much looked
after the creative--

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.270
completely made these
characters, envisioned them.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.421
And it's very easy in hindsight
to kind of look back

00:18:46.421 --> 00:18:48.870
and go oh, that's what Yent's
going to look like.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.880
Or that's what Herm is
going to look like.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.350
And I still remember getting the
brief, which was we've got

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.120
to take a silent character and
make him give beer to the

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.160
people that's right, and taking
it all right from that

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.870
experience from the TV ad all
the way through to somebody

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.530
actually getting the beer.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.990
I think the creative process,
when we first looked at it,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.280
was quite a tricky brief.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.715
I think it's Tess [INAUDIBLE]
that really, really kind of

00:19:14.715 --> 00:19:16.755
took it on board with their
[INAUDIBLE] and made it

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:20.290
exactly what we wanted bits to
do and how it would all work.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.746
And that overarching creative
experience that took you all

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:28.770
the way through from one element
right to the end, even

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.540
down to figuring out the copy
and the text and which phone

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.230
[? you're going to ?]

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.740
use, et cetera, et cetera, what
was really, really the

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.540
key to getting the whole
experience right.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.276
CALUM: I think from
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:40.276 --> 00:19:44.315
point of view, there was
a couple of things.

00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:47.210
The hangups, someone had said,
mainly or predominantly were

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.110
the fact that this had to
be a really famous video

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.840
experience.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.740
And I think clients more and
more are pushing for the

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:54.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.170
[? world ?] of HTML5 and what
can be achieved with that.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.760
I think there was a conscious
decision very early on,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.050
working with our production
partner, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.106
Digital, to go with a
Flash-based execution.

00:20:06.106 --> 00:20:08.280
And I think that was a really
important move in the end.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.175
Because it actually created
a really beautiful video

00:20:11.175 --> 00:20:13.040
experience.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.150
A breakthrough at the same
time was the actual

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.810
interaction once you get the
mobile voucher on your phone.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.436
I think for a while we were
toying with the idea of--

00:20:25.436 --> 00:20:28.162
another production partner had
let us know about having bar

00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:32.050
codes on your mobile and the
ability to redeem vouchers.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.295
And it's quite a complex voucher
[INAUDIBLE] image

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:34.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.620
[? with Michael ?] and I can.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.625
But what I thought was really
interesting was to kind of

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:42.780
create a level of intuitive
design on top of that that

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.930
allows you to actually find the
most local shops based on

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.442
your location.

00:20:49.442 --> 00:20:53.660
And I think that was a really
nice finishing point to what

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.220
was already a really
nice experience.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.050
ARTHUR: We've done this stuff
five to ten years ago of

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.830
getting it all the way from TV
to somebody else [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.540
try to redeem it using Maps,
which is probably the funniest

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.930
bit of the project to go sit
the whole way through.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.130
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.710
I think that's one of this first
big mobile things that

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.520
we've really seen that people
have really been able to play

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.530
with, is taking mobile web apps
and mobile websites and

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.300
really making them much more
interactive because of the

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.560
geolocation stuff--

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.220
being able to say, hey,
your user's here.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.730
What can we tell about that?

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.090
Or what can we do with that
piece of information?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.460
Whereas you guys have gone
and said, OK, great.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.060
Let's find the nearest store.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.880
Or let's find the nearest
location where

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.430
they can go do whatever.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.710
I think we're going to start
to see a lot more of that

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.370
stuff coming up in the future
as we get access to more and

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.460
more device APIs.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.170
Some of the cool ones that I
think we'll start to see in

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.090
the relative near future people
taking advantage are

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.930
device orientation and
device motion.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.090
So if you pretend this is my
cell phone, I can pick it up.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.460
And I can move it like this.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.260
And because of the accelerometer
and other

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.320
hardware in the machine, I can
make the website or the app

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.730
respond to those experiences.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.380
So as we get more and more
access to hardware and the

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.980
stuff like that, I think we're
going to see more and more

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.145
interesting and exciting
apps and experiences.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.201
MEL: I think another challenge
was this particular campaign.

00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:38.200
Because the character of Yant
is quite a simple sort of

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.460
storybook character, whereas
with technology, the back end

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.125
to it's quite [? companate ?].

00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:46.950
So we didn't want to
over-complicate that character

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.030
even say his mobile phone that
you see your text appear on--

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.160
it's still a very basic
mobile phone.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.750
But we had the balance of making
sure it was a kind of

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.680
mobile phone that the character
would have.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.630
But at the same time it was a
big enough screen so that you

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.850
could read their text on it.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.290
ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.180
That was one thing that Kate
and Joe and myself worked

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.780
really hard on was making sure
that we got the experience

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.850
feel intuitive with your not
having a QR code or doing

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.610
something that [INAUDIBLE] the
overall creative experience.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.740
It needed to be something that
tied in with the overall

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.650
concepts of these
silent legends.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.040
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.300
Yeah.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.620
And I think that's also
important that we're using the

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.610
same concepts that our
users are used to.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.140
We want to start getting them
to use new and newer things

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.820
all the time.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.220
But we don't want to go hey,
here's this brand new thing

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.160
that nobody's ever used before,
nobody's ever touched.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.980
And we're going to ask
you go try it.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.870
Because everybody's going
to be like huh.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.130
I don't know how to use this.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.410
So going go in with the SMS to
send something-- everybody

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.485
knows how to send an SMS.

00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:47.440
It's super easy.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.240
But then getting a link back--
everybody again knows how to

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.390
click on that link.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.420
And it really does get
that, oh, yeah.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.220
This is easy.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.280
I know how to use this.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.690
There's no learning curve.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.050
I can go play with
this right away.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.690
There's no of that drop off that
you get sometimes when

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.990
people are like oh.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.030
This was too hard.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.710
CALUM: And just to talk on
that point as well--

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.150
I think it's really important
to know which devices you're

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.210
designing for too.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.150
So I think from the get go, we
were straight away thinking

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:20.940
about the iOS Android and the
smartphone market and what

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.600
people are used to from an
interaction point of view as

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.620
well, and how maps are
usually displayed.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.040
And like you said, not straying
too far away from

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.870
that and actually building
upon it instead.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.680
PETE LEPAGE: How did you guys
decide what devices you were

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.730
going to support?

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.470
Was that decided
by the client?

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.240
Or was that coming from
what you guys said?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.750
ARTHUR: It was [INAUDIBLE], our
mobile production partner.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.240
We sort of scanned the market.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.970
We knew the audience
[? relatively ?]

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.130
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.720
used.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.880
And from there, we worked with
the client and with the

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.620
production partners, and what we
thought was right, the most

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.680
[? system ?] support.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.800
And I'm sure you guys know it's
not always the easiest

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.500
journey, trying to make a
responsive website or a truly

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.300
mobile website on these all
different elements.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.450
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.710
to [INAUDIBLE] and
get them right.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.530
MAX: And I think that also came
slightly from earlier on

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.140
in the process.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.100
Because we knew that our
audience is very much indexed

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.865
on mobile and smartphone.

00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:20.760
So actually any sort of
experience that utilizes this

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.290
technology is going to do very
well with that audience.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.040
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.210
And it sounds like you guys were
very confident in your

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:32.170
use of the technology, which
leaves me to ask have you done

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.010
work in the mobile, the geomaps
kind of area before?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.130
Was this your first time out?

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.780
Be just felt like you
really had it down?

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.260
Why did you feel so confident
when you were building this

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.060
out that you were like, no.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.180
We can definitely do all this.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.000
We know for a fact it's
going to run smoothly.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.510
ARTHUR: I think that the mobile
geolocation HTML5

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.110
device [? on your ?] stuff
[INAUDIBLE] we

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.450
felt relatively confident.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.120
Working with Cal, we'd done
quite a lot of responsive

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.430
designs before and though
very much from

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.830
mobile upwards really.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.360
It's stuff that we've done on
our own site and also for

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.420
another couple of clients
that we've worked with.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.657
The bit that was the biggest
kind of leap of faith was the

00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:16.710
API we built for the texting
setup and how that would work.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:20.050
We weren't too worried about
the technology that you're

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.776
talking about, about the
APIs with the Maps.

00:26:23.776 --> 00:26:27.130
It was more getting our head
around this custom bit of

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.970
technology that we'd made and
exactly how that would work.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.640
You guys make it pretty easy
to make the Maps stuff

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.920
compatible and work
quite well.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.470
So we weren't too worried about

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.360
that part of the project.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.180
BRIAN MOROZ: And while we're on
that note-- because we want

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.146
this to be an open
forum, where we

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:44.710
can all be very honest.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.340
What would you have
loved to have seen

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.100
from our side of things?

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.790
If we could have made the Maps
API or anything that you

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.550
worked with on our side,
better, what

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.610
would be that request?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.670
Just so that we have a sense
and we can relay that.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.710
CALUM: I guess from an
interaction design point of

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.975
view and from the actual
voucher, I don't think it's

00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:05.470
necessarily something that we
wanted from you guys, but a

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.040
better reliance on native.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.970
So when you're your iOS device,
when you click on--

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.315
it was Google Maps--

00:27:14.315 --> 00:27:16.440
that would jump out to
your native app.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.220
BRIAN MOROZ: Right,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.050
CALUM: I think the Get Direction
is something that

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.120
would be really nice to explore
as a web app more.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.640
I think in this particular
instance, it seemed more

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.210
sensible to actually jump
to an [INAUDIBLE] native

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.900
Direction app instead.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.900
I know that's something that
is in the pipeline.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.060
It's probably due now.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.810
BRIAN MOROZ: That's great.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:37.800
And any follow up?

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.500
PETE LEPAGE: No.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.340
I think getting those
interactions between native

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.060
and mobile and mobile
web are some fairly

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.390
big and complex pieces.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.860
And it's certainly something
that from my view, being able

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.080
to use those directions within
a mobile app or mobile

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.590
website, I hope to see
that come soon.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.930
Because I think there are some
really interesting spaces

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.860
where you can play with that.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.820
BRIAN MOROZ: Definitely.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.350
PETE LEPAGE: I did want to throw
out here as well for

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.970
people who are watching, if you
want to ask questions of

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.620
these guys, you want to ask
questions of us, we just put a

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.360
link up on the screen
so that you can

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.830
go post your questions.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.330
And towards the last 10 minutes
or so of our session

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.750
today, we'll take those
questions and make sure that

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.880
these questions get answered by
some of the folks from BMB.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.690
BRIAN MOROZ: Absolutely.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.920
So one other question
for you guys.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.970
Given that you did something
that was very cool, very

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.570
innovative, went across lots
of different media types,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.200
involved lots of different
people at your agency, I

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.860
imagine you guys learned a lot
of lessons that maybe aren't

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.150
obvious when you start
to jump in.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.960
So my question to you then is
what do you recommend to

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.710
others who are trying to
innovate in a space like this,

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.590
where they're using Mobile.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.180
They're using Maps.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.780
They're trying to connect lots
of different media, lots of

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.200
different ad formats together.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.350
What are the things that if you
had an intern and they had

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.590
three questions or they wanted
three pieces of advice, what

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.950
would you recommend if someone
is trying to do something--

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.180
obviously not exactly like
this-- but in this same kind

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:12.105
of realm you guys learned that
maybe others don't know?

00:29:12.105 --> 00:29:14.950
MEL: I think [INAUDIBLE]
point of [? view ?]

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.600
and the idea that there were
so many different parties

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.930
involved, it's just a good idea
to identify who the core

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.100
team members are from those
different parties, and working

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.620
out ways of having clear lines
of communication so that

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.960
everyone's got the
same information.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.340
Just something we use quite
a lot with Google Docs.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.595
Because everyone could access
the same information.

00:29:34.595 --> 00:29:37.090
We could do a task list to
assign responsibilities and

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.166
keep everyone up to date with
what was going on on that

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:41.660
particular document.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.740
BRIAN MOROZ: So that's just
internally on this team.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:48.280
Because it is a pretty
complicated cross expertise

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.380
team that you guys
are working with.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.450
So just keeping those lines of
communication open so everyone

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.130
knows what everyone
else is doing.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:53.500
MEL: Yep.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.490
BRIAN MOROZ: Great
piece of advice.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.360
CALUM: I think from a design
point of view, it would be

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.245
just to keep looking at things
all around you, like from the

00:30:03.245 --> 00:30:05.870
latest app to a cool website.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.740
I think it's so important to
just keep up to date with

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.110
what's going on in any
way that you can.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.330
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.980
I think to me that is one of
those things that as a web

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.870
developer, web designer,
or even a

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.870
technologist in general--

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.570
staying up to date with the
latest stuff is so important,

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.560
looking at some of the cool demo
sites, keeping an eye on

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.280
websites like HTML5 Rocks and
other sites where all those

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.000
new things start to bubble up
and you can see what people

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.430
are doing with them is
really such a great

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.040
way to remain connected.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.860
It gives you that idea of hey,
what's going on in this space?

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.740
I just was recently working
on a Chrome experiment.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.670
And if you go to
Chromeexperiments.com, it's

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:48.920
another great place.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.480
You can also go to
M.chromeexperiments.com for

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.930
the mobile site to see mobile
Chrome experiments.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.740
And a lot of these really show
off things that people either

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.710
haven't done before or a very
small new feature that's just

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.950
in its infancy, and really how
powerful or how cool it is.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.070
With the Cirque du Soleil Chrome
experiment, we used the

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.210
Get User Media API to grab the
user's face and watch how

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.880
their head moved throughout
the experience.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.940
Works great on a laptop
or desktop.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.720
But that didn't work
on the mobile site.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.100
So for mobile, we used device
orientation and device motion.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.310
So that is you tip the device,
you can see that going.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.010
So looking at sites like that to
see what's going on, what's

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.710
cool, is a really good way to
stay up to date, and as well

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.000
as just get some ideas
of stuff that you

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.690
can do in the future.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.340
MAX: I think something from my
perspective would probably be

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.220
not necessarily through the
technology-- but actually it's

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.900
kind of just having one very
simple idea that you can

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.050
relate everything back to.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.390
I think us doing this mobile
experience, and us trying to

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.435
get beer into people's hands,
there are a lot of points

00:32:03.435 --> 00:32:05.160
where it could have become a lot
more complicated, and we

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.000
could have chucked different
technologies in and done

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.310
different things.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.027
But actually, at the end of
the day, it needs to be a

00:32:10.027 --> 00:32:13.380
really simple user experience
and something that is very

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.650
easy to do.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.010
And I think at times you can
over complicate things.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.590
And this was a good example of
just keeping it simple, using

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.520
technology to its best ability,
and then not trying

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.660
to kind of throw other
bits into it.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.170
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:26.890
Yeah, definitely.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.460
And on that note, I assume that
helped you sell it into

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:29.880
the client.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.680
But I guess a kind of a follow
up question is did you guys

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.340
encounter any particularly tough
areas with the client?

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.310
Or were they just gung-ho
the whole way through?

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.410
How did that work out?

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.690
And if you had those experiences
where they were

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.810
like I don't know if this is
going to be right, how did you

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.350
overcome those?

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.910
MAX: Yeah.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.350
As with every project, there
are difficult moments with

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.500
different parties.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.920
And yeah, we did have difficult

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.200
times with the client.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.290
As I've said, he was
involved all along.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.310
And I think that
was brilliant.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.770
Because I think he knew what we
were trying to achieve and

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.210
building towards it together.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.960
I think, as a kind of touched
on, the most difficult bit was

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.750
not being able to give them an
update every few weeks of this

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.740
is where we are.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.140
And look.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.660
You can see how we're
progressing.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.970
It's like they've got to trust
that actually we are getting

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.620
on with things even if
they can't see it.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.390
And actually with the user at
the end, it is going to work.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:31.810
I think one of the most scary
points for me actually was

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.660
three weeks before we were
supposed to go live.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.130
And we had our first demo.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.820
And it didn't work at all.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.290
And it was an interesting
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.540
ARTHUR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.645
MAX: But I think the fact that
it had been a long process

00:33:49.645 --> 00:33:52.330
meant that we were all kind
of on the same page.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.370
And we were all just like,
OK, it's not working now.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.920
But this is all we need to
do to get it better.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.000
Give us two days.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.610
And then come back.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.600
And I think that yeah,
we managed it.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.880
And it worked out well.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.060
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.770
It sounds like.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.380
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.140
Yeah.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.190
I've got to say that I would
have been petrified three

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.290
weeks before going oh, boy.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.489
And then having the demo.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.350
So was it a simple thing
that caused that

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.500
first demo to fail?

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.110
Or was it something that you
guys had missed caused it?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.870
ARTHUR: It was the
classic gotcha.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.760
It was everything that--

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.409
you look everywhere.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.270
And you expect everything else
to be causing the problem.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.100
And it was the one small thing
that you didn't think.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.739
It was actually one
of the APIs.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.170
The API we built used
lots of other APIs.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.659
And you think that
must be robust.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.780
I know that should work.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.398
We've been pinging that.

00:34:39.398 --> 00:34:40.889
And that should be working,
no worries.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.480
And it was that element
that was broken.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.409
One of the APIs we had been
using, we just needed to look

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.590
at and fix that.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.940
Then we knew what
the problem was.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.850
We got around it.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.260
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.190
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, it sounds
like it was an exciting

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.010
moment, but one that you guys
got over fairly quickly.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:01.510
That's the best ending to those
kinds of [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.240
ARTHUR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.650
BRIAN MOROZ: So we'll go ahead
and turn in just a moment to

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.140
the questions that folks
have been sending in.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.000
But any last piece of advice,
comments, placed you'd love

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.920
people to go check out?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.190
Anything you guys would like to
say to the audience before

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.440
we jump into their questions?

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.740
ARTHUR: I think for me just
while we were waiting just a

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.270
kind of really boring element.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.680
But I'm sure there's lots
of devs watching.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.186
I think one thing that I learned
definitely was there

00:35:28.186 --> 00:35:30.660
was really [? only ?] key to
make sure everything works

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.920
well together is having
[? repo's ?]

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.140
a really good system.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.752
We use [INAUDIBLE], which allows
us to deploy to all

00:35:37.752 --> 00:35:38.200
different areas.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.935
And that should keep up to date
with the production part

00:35:40.935 --> 00:35:42.860
we're working on and seeing
what's going.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.570
And we can share [? rights ?]
and see how everything has

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.480
worked together.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.590
And it's the grind behind it.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.140
But it actually makes life
really, really easy when you

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.850
come to deploying.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.040
Everything's sorted.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.950
Especially when you've got
somebody that's a production

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.756
partner, people are in their
own little word unless

00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:00.750
somebody's
[? bringing it together. ?]

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.140
We can do preview deploys before
and checking over and

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.910
working [INAUDIBLE], so you
can get in big gotchas

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.160
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:09.880
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.370
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.850
So if we pop over
to questions--

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.330
Paul B. from London wanted to
know, if you could improve or

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.860
change anything, what
would you change if

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.110
you could do it again?

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.136
ARTHUR: For me, this fell
at the ground of a

00:36:28.136 --> 00:36:30.335
lot of bigger ideas.

00:36:30.335 --> 00:36:31.850
We had a lot of extension
thoughts we were

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.350
really keen to do.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.320
I think we achieved a
lot in this project.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.575
I think we did really,
really well.

00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:39.190
But I think if I could approach
it again, there are

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.066
lots of extensions that I
definitely would have sneaked

00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:44.340
in there to try and make things
work a little harder

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.170
and be a little bit more
groundbreaking

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.580
in a few key areas.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.865
MAX: A bit for me is actually
we'd originally thought that

00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:54.950
we were going to maybe
do this in a pub.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.530
So actually the giveaway
drove to people picking

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.950
up cans from a shop.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.960
But there was an opportunity
at one point that we might

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.220
have been able to
do it in a pub.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.355
And I think if we'd been able
to drive people to a pub to

00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:08.510
get a pint, you could then
do a lot more of

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.570
those extension ideas.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.800
Because you've got kind
of a captive audience.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.450
You know they're sitting there,
having their drink.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.460
And you can kind of play
with that a lot more.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.950
So I think that that would've
been a nice extension.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.630
PETE LEPAGE: Neat.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.770
BRIAN MOROZ: Interesting.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.140
OK.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:28.920
So next question from Bob in
London was having great ideas

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.960
in the lab is often easier
than convincing

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.370
the client to invest.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.680
How did you manage the client
throughout the conception,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.040
build, and live faces
of this project?

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.830
And I think you guys touched
on that a bit already, that

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:39.870
you have a very deep
relationship.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.100
And you brought them
in very early.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.820
Who was your touch point
at the client?

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.730
Who were you working
with most closely?

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.060
Did you have one contact that
was really your champion?

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.040
How did you guys manage that as
this kind of went live over

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.300
the course of 18 months or so?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.590
MAX: Yeah.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.190
From the client's side, we had
one touch point who was our

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.400
client throughout who was Simon
Pick, who is the brand

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.090
manager on Grolsch.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:11.450
And actually it was very much
we have him as our contact.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.990
He'd understand what we
were trying to do.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.990
And then he would then
go and sell it

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.255
throughout the business.

00:38:16.255 --> 00:38:20.530
So we'd kind of give him the
tools he needed to bring other

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.830
people in and show them
what was going on.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.050
And I think where we managed
him quite well was actually

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.455
knowing when to bring other
[? elements ?] of the business

00:38:28.455 --> 00:38:29.730
in and when not to.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.270
I think there are times where
you can actually bring people

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.776
in unnecessarily
and panic them.

00:38:35.776 --> 00:38:36.850
Because you might not
be in the position.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.950
Or you might not have everything
that you need to

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.615
convince people that you're
going in the right direction.

00:38:42.615 --> 00:38:45.080
And I think that one thing that
was really important was

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.200
actually managing the timing
of this process, when we'd

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.890
bring key stakeholders in.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.040
So I think it was working
closely with him to then work

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.480
with the rest of Molson Coors
and the rest of Grolsch.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.790
BRIAN MOROZ: So knowing when to
bring in the right people,

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:02.650
and when to, let's say, focus
on the smaller number of

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.070
people that maybe get it a
little more, and knowing when

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.385
to open that door and
close that door

00:39:07.385 --> 00:39:08.710
at appropriate times.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.240
That sounds like it was a
key skill in this case.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.520
PETE LEPAGE: Great.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.360
So can you share some of
the engagement results.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.920
Came from Romaine Pier.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.220
If I mispronounce anybody's
name, I apologize.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.250
So what were the engagement
results like?

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:27.900
Or can you share those?

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.150
MAX: Yeah.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.790
We absolutely can.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.550
It was actually very impressed
with the engagement.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.170
It was a lot more than we
had kind of hoped for.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:35.860
Well no.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.280
As much as we'd hoped for.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.750
But a lot more than we'd
expected actually.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.200
In terms of-- it's called-- the
total unique visits, we

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.470
had 139,988, which actually--

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.060
PETE LEPAGE: Not
to be specific.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.010
BRIAN MOROZ: Not that you
memorized that or anything.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.000
MAX: Over a three month period,
that was very good.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
And actually, the Grolsch
website itself went from quite

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.710
low down in the teens, in terms
of beer websites, jumped

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.990
up to number two just
from this campaign,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.030
which for us was great.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.270
BRIAN MOROZ: That's amazing.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.960
MAX: And it then got a lot data,
a lot of phone numbers.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.650
There were people signing up
to the website and a lot of

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.270
things like that.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:22.400
So the engagement around it
actually was really fantastic.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.720
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:22.800
Great.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.680
ARTHUR: I think another thing
on that, Max, was that we

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.790
managed to get really, really
good dwell time.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.280
I think the dwell time started
around four minutes and ended

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.750
up somewhere as an average
of about three.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.860
Not only was the dwell time
really high, but we managed to

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.430
accumulate a database of
hopefully really intrigued

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.660
consumers that are interested
in taking

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.810
it to the next level.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.605
And we've got a few ideas
up our sleeve of where

00:40:44.605 --> 00:40:45.855
we'll go with that.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.260
But the plan was to get a core
audience that would keep

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.570
really engaged with the brand.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.900
And hopefully their
stats show that we

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.230
managed to achieve that.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.545
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:40:57.545 --> 00:40:58.760
BRIAN MOROZ: Cool.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.540
So a question-- and it
sounds like you guys

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.380
wanted to do this.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.405
And maybe that'll be a follow
up question from Van Jones.

00:41:04.405 --> 00:41:07.010
Do you have a plan for deeper
interaction beyond the initial

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.500
chance to win beer or
to go buy the cans.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.230
And it sounds like you guys
wanted to do that.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.720
Do have plans with the client
to actually take this to a

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.320
deeper level?

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.550
Or is that something that
you guys can develop?

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.430
ARTHUR: We're in plans
at the moment.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.040
Obviously, they're
very hush hush.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.166
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:23.540
So no details.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.570
ARTHUR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.820
MAX: We've got a decent base.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.570
And as Arthur said,
we've got a lot of

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.375
engaged, intrigued people.

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:33.242
And I think that it's absolutely
[INAUDIBLE] that we

00:41:33.242 --> 00:41:37.400
want to build on and move on.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.994
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:41:39.994 --> 00:41:42.790
So from Peter Thistle
in Vancouver--

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.190
has the client shared any
analytic methodology or data

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.920
with you reporting from mobile
app how many samples?

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.150
We kind of touched on this
in the previous question.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.270
But I'm kind of curious.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.820
I'm going to take it in a little
bit in a different way.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.330
What was the mobile engagement
like, specifically for the

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.400
mobile pieces?

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.380
ARTHUR: I mean, like Max said,
Grolsch had been not

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.400
necessarily [? gomer ?], but not
as strong as it could be

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.140
for a while.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.800
There was some [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.430
about the different statistics
or devices that

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.580
we needed to approach.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.580
We didn't have a big website
that had been running on

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.703
mobile for a long time to figure
out exactly what we

00:42:24.703 --> 00:42:26.320
wanted to target.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.350
But I think we all kind of get
a pretty good idea about the

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.620
key browsers and platform
that we should target.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.280
And we backed that up with
some knowledge as well of

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.702
searching [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:37.702 --> 00:42:38.952
before we went ahead.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.115
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:42:42.115 --> 00:42:42.420
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.432
So the next question was-- and
we can pause on this one.

00:42:45.432 --> 00:42:46.870
Because it sounds like this is
what's in the works for you

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.460
guys, is not public yet.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.980
But the question was how did you
think about activating it

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.160
in bars around the world?

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.880
Since you mentioned oh, we
would've loved to have had

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.580
people in the pub.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.250
That would have been
our ideal.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.840
Can you talk about what you
would have done there?

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.580
Or is that something that's for
phase two that we'll talk

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.830
to you guys in a few
months about?

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:06.700
ARTHUR: We can talk
about it, yeah.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.960
We work with a really great
production [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.610
called Mobius.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:13.520
And they had some technology up
their sleeve with the stuff

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.350
they've done before with Blue
Moon and how basically they've

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.640
made this system that would
allow you to redeem a pint in

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.590
a bar and then track
it exactly.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.930
There are some of
the extension--

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.010
I'm sure people can imagine--

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.255
was it allowed real
time stats.

00:43:29.255 --> 00:43:33.030
And actually it allowed real
time location even more finite

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.590
than you could probably get with
a GPS device, which is

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.760
quite interesting.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.990
So some of those, of course,
came from there.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.750
And that was one of the reasons
we were so keen is

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.730
[? god, ?] we could do some
interesting stuff like that.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.250
PETE LEPAGE: So I think our next
question, we've kind of

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.360
already covered on who came
up with the idea.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.610
So we'll go to the
next question.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.140
Are there further adventures
planned for Yant, re-marketing

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.115
to people in some clever way
or anything like that?

00:44:01.115 --> 00:44:03.870
And that may have been covered
in what you just--

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.690
BRIAN MOROZ: I mean it sounds
like the answer is yes.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:09.590
But just to confirm, he will
be loose on the world for

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.590
months to come?

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:10.880
MAX: Yeah.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.810
He's a great character.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.340
So it would be a shame to not
let him loose on the world

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.420
again in some form or another.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:16.890
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.613
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:44:18.613 --> 00:44:21.170
ARTHUR: Just to sort of
interject, I think the really

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.690
fun part about it is
actually that it

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.640
started above the line.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.430
But I think we will continue
with Yant on platforms that

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.300
aren't traditional above the
line media, which is what's

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.500
quite exciting I think
about the campaign.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.830
Let's say 2013, I think we'll
continue on a certain tangent

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.650
that we see it going
at the moment.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.120
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.010
And it sounds like it's all
blending together very

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.490
seamlessly in this very kind
of elegant way across all

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.740
these media types, which
everyone says that they want

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.610
to do, of course.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.300
But it is a real struggle often
for a lot of reasons

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.750
within agencies and with clients
to actually do that.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.220
And it sounds like you guys have
really hit across that

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.440
kind of seamless connection
across from television to

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.200
digital and everywhere else.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.600
So super cool.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.450
The last question--
and it's a little

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:02.440
bit of a biting question.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.820
And we're all going to be very
open and honest here.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.860
I'm just going to ask
it straight out

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.750
from Jim in Lake Tahoe.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.110
And I'll see what you guys say,
which is, looks like your

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.060
audience was young single males,
perhaps white males.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.900
Hopefully there's more
to it than that.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.460
So I will let you
respond to Jim.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.380
What was your demo?

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.860
How do you guys want
to expand?

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.870
What are the demos that
you'd love to reach?

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.120
Because that's something
actually we haven't talked

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.020
about today.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.700
Who was the audience
specifically?

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.580
How did you determine that?

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.830
And what would be your
ideal audience?

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.730
MAX: The audience for Grolsch
is slightly older.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:43.890
It's a 25 to 40 really.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.240
And I think it's an audience
that more kind of once you've

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.910
had your wild drinking days.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.280
They're more behind you.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.110
And you prefer a quiet, more
premium pint, let's say.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.890
And so that, as I'd sort of
said, they kind of index

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.420
against mobile.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.635
And I think that they're a very
interesting audience.

00:46:04.635 --> 00:46:07.200
And they're a very kind of
untapped audience I think from

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.370
a beer perspective.

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.480
So I think they're very much the
sort of audience we'd like

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.340
to keep on going with.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.470
But I don't know.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.050
Arthur, or Mel and Cal, if
you've got any other audiences

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.810
you'd like to talk to?

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.250
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.250
Jim in Lake Tahoe, if you
have other audiences,

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.940
just let them know.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:26.880
They're happy to reach out
to broader audiences.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.340
And I lied.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.740
Actually Pete, do you want
to read [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.420
There's one more question
that just popped in.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:30.650
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.070
So we just had one more question
pop in from Liana

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.360
asking how difficult do you
think it will be to keep

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.220
selling these kinds of
ideas to your client?

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.290
CALUM: To sell this idea?

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:44.780
I think I'd be very difficult
to sell this idea again.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.760
PETE LEPAGE: Touche.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:52.630
CALUM: I think what's now been
created is this experience

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.260
that requires new technology.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.285
So it's a very simple idea.

00:46:56.285 --> 00:46:59.065
And I think that won't change
is in the simplicity of it.

00:46:59.065 --> 00:47:02.960
I think we all really
appreciate how

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.971
important that is.

00:47:04.971 --> 00:47:07.414
But as Arthur mentioned before,
I think that's a

00:47:07.414 --> 00:47:08.834
really interesting tangent
[? that will head ?] us on.

00:47:08.834 --> 00:47:10.670
And also it's a new technology
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.070
as well.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.550
MAX: I think it's
also really--

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.810
I'm sorry, Mel.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.750
MEL: I was just going to say I
think also when you've got

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.880
kind of the stats and the
figures, the results of the

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.610
campaign, it always makes it
easier then for the client to

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.560
trust you to deliver a similar
kind of campaign in another

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.600
type of new technology.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.480
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.700
I think that being able
to say, hey, look.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.510
We have 130--

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.080
I don't remember the exact
number, but that large number,

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.000
and say look, this is what we
did, it becomes easier to sell

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.890
new ideas when you can say,
here's some data on something

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.405
new we did.

00:47:47.405 --> 00:47:47.740
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.660
But it's key to be able to have
those clients that, first

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.600
of all, to be at the agency,
able to explain it in a clear

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.250
way and have those clients
that said, yes.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.750
Let's make a little
bit of a leap--

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.410
small leap.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.850
We're not going crazy.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:00.630
And see what happens.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.770
So it sounds like you guys have
a great situation both on

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.390
your side and on their side.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.965
ARTHUR: I think to Max's point
I think that Max made earlier

00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:09.910
on is if the overarching
creative is right, if it's

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.740
right for what they're trying to
achieve, if it's right for

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.000
the different mediums, then it's
not such a [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.916
sell.

00:48:16.916 --> 00:48:17.440
It's not trying to go ahead
with look, we've got this

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.155
interesting technology that's
going to change [INAUDIBLE] if

00:48:20.155 --> 00:48:23.782
the creative idea works strong
enough and hopefully with a

00:48:23.782 --> 00:48:26.320
bit of back up and prototypes
earlier on will

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.100
sort of sell itself.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.775
MAX: And the brief wasn't a
sort of complicated one.

00:48:32.775 --> 00:48:33.710
It wasn't a different one.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.910
It was get Grolsch in
the hands of people.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:39.740
And actually if you can find a
technology that makes that

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.875
happen in a better way than has
been done before, then I

00:48:42.875 --> 00:48:44.940
think absolutely, ideas
like this will

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.570
still sort of fly out.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.435
I think it's just having the
right technology for the right

00:48:49.435 --> 00:48:50.920
kind of means.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.452
BRIAN MOROZ: Absolutely.

00:48:52.452 --> 00:48:53.000
All right.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.730
Well that about wraps it for the
questions we had for you

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.600
guys and the audience questions,
which were very

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:57.890
interesting.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.700
Thanks, folks who are
watching this for

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.860
sending in those questions.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.790
Any last comments or topics
that you guys

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:05.310
want to talk about?

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:09.040
Or any last things you'd like
folks to go take a look at?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.910
Now's your chance.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.900
Give us a pitch.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.110
MAX: Go to BMB website.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.340
PETE LEPAGE: What is the
URL for the website?

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.180
MAX: BMBagency.com.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:19.310
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.560
BMBagency.com.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.190
MAX: That's the one.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.990
BRIAN MOROZ: So you can check
out more of their work.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:28.030
Thank you guys so much.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.510
I know it's like 8 o'clock
in London.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.750
So I hope you enjoy a fine
Grolsch right after

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.640
this call is done.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.516
I wish I were right now.

00:49:35.516 --> 00:49:35.920
ARTHUR: Sorry.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.580
Last thing.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:36.975
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah.

00:49:36.975 --> 00:49:39.476
ARTHUR: I just [INAUDIBLE] the
opportunity to say something.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.180
If anybody does want to get into
advertising for London,
