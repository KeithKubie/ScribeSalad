00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:07.646
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: All
right, good morning.

00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:09.059
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.850
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.140
My name is Bradley Horowitz.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.630
I am vice president of photos
and sharing here at Google.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.630
And it's my pleasure to
welcome Luvvie Ajayi with us

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.230
this morning.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.155
You all know Luvvie.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:22.655
[CHEERING]

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.730
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.960
Yeah.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.940
I'm going to do a
super-brief introduction,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.490
because I actually want
her to tell her story.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.560
You all know Luvvie.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.420
I have to confess,
a week ago I didn't.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.350
But a good mutual
friend Lisa Stone

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.530
invited me to host this talk.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.210
And so I went into a crash
course on learning about Luvvie

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.150
and why she is so prominent
in the blogging space.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.560
And so I've spent that last
week getting to know her work.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.450
And I'm super excited and, as I
shared in the invite, somewhat

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.390
nervous to be up here.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.680
Because she tells it like it is.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.070
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
And it's pretty

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.320
clear I'm part of the problem.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.950
So with that--

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.730
Luvvie, please--
let's welcome her.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.607
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:09.440
LUVVIE AJAYI: Hello!

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.800
That's hilarious.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.756
[LAUGHING]

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.290
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Well, thank you.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.150
Thank you for coming.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
I know you're bouncing
around the whole country.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.526
And we're glad you had a
chance to stop at Google.

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:21.650
LUVVIE AJAYI: Had to do it.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Have
you ever been here before?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.840
LUVVIE AJAYI: No, this is my
first time on Google's campus.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.740
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Oh, well I hope

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.110
you get a chance to meet
people and look around.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.546
LUVVIE AJAYI: I heard about
the epic slide you guys have.

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.920
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
We have slides.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.940
We have weird bikes.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.400
We have food.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.466
We'll treat you right.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.140
It's going to be fun.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.510
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.430
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.820
So I want to start-- I think
most people here know it,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.270
but for posterity and for the
videotape, tell us your story.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.240
I mean, who are you?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.835
How did you get to this chair?

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:50.960
LUVVIE AJAYI: By being a
professional troublemaker.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.829
That's how I got to this chair.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.370
I'm a writer.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.030
I'm a speaker.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.260
I'm a techie.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.410
And I have been
blogging for 13 years.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.240
I started blogging in 2003.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.474
I was in college, and I was
peer-pressured into doing it,

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.890
because my friends were like,
you should start a web blog.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.610
And I was like, OK.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.825
So I went to Xanga.com
and started a web--

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:11.700
and I started a blog.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.140
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's not
Zingo, that's Xanga, right?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.140
LUVVIE AJAYI: Xanga, OK?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.706
Remember Xanga, like next to
Friendster and everything?

00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:17.580
And I start blogging.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.829
I was talking about college
life and all my randomness

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.670
and shenanigans and who I
was beefing with that day--

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.290
nothing interesting.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400
And basically I have my
college career chronicled,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.260
which for good and all bad.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.690
I read it, and I was
like, this is awful.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.010
When I graduated from
college, I deleted that blog,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.051
and I was like, I'm going
to start something new.

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.970
And I go to Blogspot,
fire up this new blog,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150
called it Luvvi's Random Rants.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.040
And I was talking about all
things pop culture, television,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.890
anything I felt like talking
about, but not myself anymore.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.090
So that's how blogging
for me started.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.532
And it basically took
on a life of its own.

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:53.990
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
And you were born

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.624
in Africa, grew up in Chicago.

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:56.415
Tell us that story.

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:57.206
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:58.650
So I was born in Nigeria.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.127
And when I was nine, we moved--

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:01.710
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Are you got shouting

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.910
for Nigeria or Chicago?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.660
LUVVIE AJAYI: [LAUGHING]
Right, yes-- Nigeria.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.550
So we moved to Chicago
when I was nine.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.190
Nobody told me we were moving.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.820
I thought we were
going on vacation.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.470
And then I started school,
and I was like, oh, this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.390
means we're staying.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.617
Oh.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.200
And it was a big
culture shock for me,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.090
because I went from
never having to be

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.230
the new girl, like
my best friend was

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.190
the niece of the person who
owned the private school I went

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.734
to.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:33.650
I'd been going to that
school since I was two.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.270
So walking in a room and seeing
people who didn't look like me

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.640
and having to reintroduce
myself and basically

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.460
take on a new persona was
a huge shock to my system.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.560
But, yeah, I had
this accent, too.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.860
Well, no, not this
accent, actually.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.280
I had a major Nigerian accent.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.890
And I end up having
to-- I lost it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.890
consciously by
mimicking my classmates

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.024
and like trying to repeat
what they were saying

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:00.190
and how they were saying it.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.440
And then by high school
my accent was mostly gone.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Right.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.331
She thinks it's gone.

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:05.830
Anyway--

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.663
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right!

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.341
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:07.840
Right.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.650
You're right.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.520
No, I hear it.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.590
I'm super Nigerian, yeah.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.964
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So do you think

00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:15.840
that experience of sort of being
a transplant at nine years old

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.670
and being different
informs some of who you are

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.020
and your ability to
stand outside of things

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.165
and tell it like it is?

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.090
Is that part of why you're you?

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.200
LUVVIE AJAYI: Well, yeah.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.340
So the tell-it-like-it-is-ness
that is me is my Nigerian-ness

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.370
in its true essence.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.060
Like Nigerians, we're not a
great filtering people, OK?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.960
We're not the ones
who are like, oh,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.320
let me make sure I coat it
in all types of nice things.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.905
We just say what we feel.

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:48.530
Like if you come like
my family dinner,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.654
we spend the whole time
laughing at each other.

00:04:50.654 --> 00:04:52.070
Like somebody will
walk in wearing

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.330
a sweater that's not cute--

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.177
--and somebody will always be
like, why do you have that on?

00:04:58.177 --> 00:04:59.260
It's just how we function.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.360
And in my writing, my
writing is essentially

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.470
who I am in real life in print.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.340
Because I want people who know
me to read my work and be like,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.590
OK, I actually hear her voice.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.990
That's exactly her.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.100
So how I write very much
translates to who I am.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.360
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's
interesting, and in your youth

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.930
from like nine
through high school

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.400
and things like that, were
you extroverted, class clown?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.000
Like before in the
pre-blogging, pre-college years,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.580
what was that like for you?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.610
LUVVIE AJAYI: I have been
the class clown forever.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.370
This person that you see is
who I was in high school.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.810
I still have the same friends
that I did in high school.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.320
And we were just a
goofy group of people.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.610
We'll be in the hallway
just acting the fool

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.420
or playing spades
in the lunchroom

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.960
and just spend all
the time laughing.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.860
And basically my
group of friends

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.970
are a really good
reflection of who I am.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.407
Like you think I'm funny?

00:05:59.407 --> 00:06:00.990
You come to brunch
with us, and you'll

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.550
be in tears, because none of
them have behavior or sense.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.600
So it's just how I've been.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.820
And being able to have it
translate to my writing

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.907
has been great,
because literally I

00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:13.990
have these friends who
have known me for 20 years,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.198
and people are like, oh,
how did you find your voice?

00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:17.590
And I was like, do you see them?

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.720
That's me.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.500
So it's not even a matter of
me having to find my voice.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.730
It's me just growing it up.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.230
Yeah.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.290
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So you went
to University of Illinois.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.840
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.240
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And I love
how she drops like 13 years,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.510
like that's a long time in
tech and stuff like that.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.870
LUVVIE AJAYI: It is!

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.260
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Way before you
got there, the web browser was

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.990
invented there.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.840
LUVVIE AJAYI: Internet Explorer.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.190
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.510
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.240
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah, Mosaic.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.865
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's
our claim to fame.

00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:43.900
We're very proud of
that in Illinois, yeah.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.710
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: My wife
went to school there, too.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.668
LUVVIE AJAYI: Oh, yeah.

00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:49.660
It's one of the things they tell
you when you go to orientation.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.264
And they're like,
at Illinois, we

00:06:52.264 --> 00:06:54.430
invented-- I was like,
impressive, I will come here,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.930
yes.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.830
This has changed
everything for me.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.020
I must be here, yes.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.050
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And you got
into blogging while at college.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.130
And so do you think
that's how you had access?

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.930
Like how did you
come to do that?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.640
LUVVIE AJAYI: So I've
always liked computers.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.310
I took computer-type
classes in school.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.860
I was a person who actually
took an Excel class for fun.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.610
So for me, I've always kind
of seen the value of computers

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.700
and all these types of software.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.200
But I was also the person who
started infusing social media

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.060
into the work that I was doing.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.140
Like I've been an early
adopter of most platforms.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.406
And blogging was
just another thing

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:38.030
that I was kind of
an early adopter at.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.863
Because when I started
blogging, it was just

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:42.250
playing on the internet.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.570
But I was doing it because
I thought it was fun.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.300
How I've been approaching
technology since,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.840
I have to go to the
library to get my e-mail.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.394
My first e-mail account
was a Hotmail account.

00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.770
[LAUGHING] And I think it
was like vetvet@hotmail.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.480
[LAUGHING] But then we had AOL.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.137
So I've seen the evolution
of the internet grow,

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:07.220
and it's been really cool.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.817
But I've always
found it valuable.

00:08:09.817 --> 00:08:11.400
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So that first phase,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.640
you said you were sort
of blogging your college

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.710
experience, but then you
deleted the whole thing.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.599
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:18.390
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Do
you still have a copy?

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.110
LUVVIE AJAYI: I do.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.850
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.140
LUVVIE AJAYI: In
its Comic Sans font.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.264
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So do we.

00:08:21.264 --> 00:08:22.620
We've got that in Google cache.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.430
LUVVIE AJAYI: No!

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.210
[LAUGHING]

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.835
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
No, I'm just kidding.

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:27.890
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right, like, no!

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.950
No, like I had Comic
Sans font and everything.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.804
And it was like--
it was just awful.

00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:33.929
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And it's
not up online right now?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:34.760
LUVVIE AJAYI: No.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.320
I think I actually was
like, OK, legit, delete it.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.640
But before I deleted the
blog, I like copied and pasted

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.840
every single post
into a Word document.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.840
And the Word document
is giant, because it's

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.580
three years of me in college
being a fool, being like,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.660
oh, this is my roommate.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.590
I didn't really
like her that time.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.550
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
that's interesting,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.530
because you're so out there
and so vulnerable and honest

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.590
about things.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.760
Have you posted things
that you regret or go

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.200
back and delete or edit?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.720
Like what's it like
having that out there?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.100
Because these days, once
you put something out there,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.890
it's out there.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.616
LUVVIE AJAYI: It's out there.

00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:07.980
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.605
LUVVIE AJAYI: Well,
so here's the thing

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:11.584
is about blogging
for so long, the good

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.500
and the bad thing is it
chronicles your growth

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.660
as a human being and as somebody
who thinks about the world.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.106
And so things there are
things that I wrote in 2009

00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:22.230
that I would never write
today because I vehemently

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.202
disagree with myself.

00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:25.410
I'm like, no, that was wrong.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:25.820
You shouldn't.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.403
But some of those
things, I keep it up

00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:29.070
to remind myself of
where I came from

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.670
and who I was in that moment.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.410
And I like even thinking about
high school essays that I won,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.870
I won like two major essay
contests in high school

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.600
writing an essay
on whether people

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.942
should receive reparations.

00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:48.735
And my stance was no,
you didn't do that.

00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:49.860
Why do you get reparations?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.490
And I won an essay contest.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.240
And I read the essay,
and I was like, god,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.770
that's terrible-- no.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.640
But it's really
good to still have

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.142
the record of who you were.

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:01.350
Because you see how you've
grown, how you've changed,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.830
how your thought has changed.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.020
College changed
everything about politics

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.690
and how I look at
the world at large.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.450
So who I was before college is
completely different from who I

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.810
am now in terms of my beliefs.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.270
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And I
guess how much of what

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.210
you do do you do for
yourself, and how

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.339
much do you do for others?

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:21.130
It sounds like it was
a little bit of both.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.850
LUVVIE AJAYI: A
little bit of both,

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.892
but I try to do most of
it for myself. [LAUGHING]

00:10:23.892 --> 00:10:25.391
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
I think that's why

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.970
you're so appealing, actually.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.422
LUVVIE AJAYI: Well, because
my whole thing is, OK, one,

00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:30.880
I'm not writing in
an echo chamber.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.430
So the idea that I'm just
writing for myself is false.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.550
But I am a writer
because if I don't write,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.360
the words kind of stay with me.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.160
So like I'm the
person who is taking

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.470
a nap on the plane
writing blog posts, too,

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.032
at the same time, which
is completely weird.

00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:48.240
But I wake up with an entire
post in my head already,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.650
and I'm just like, ah, OK, cool.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.580
So in that way, I'm
writing for myself.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.271
But also I'm writing for people
to consume it and hopefully

00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:57.270
change hearts and minds.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.700
Because I'm also not trying to
write to preach to the choir

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.477
all the time.

00:11:01.477 --> 00:11:03.560
Because it's like at that
point, what's the point?

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.020
So it's a combination.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.430
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So you're
an early technology adopter,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.850
early-on on blogspot,
early with blogging.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.990
Are you keeping up?

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.140
Like where are you at on
vlogging, Snapchat, Instagram,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.960
Twitter?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.930
Like are there enough hours
in the day to sort of--

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.263
LUVVIE AJAYI: No, there are
not enough hours in the day.

00:11:25.263 --> 00:11:27.625
And I am officially feeling
like the oldie in tech.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:28.125
Because--

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.833
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Well, I mean 13 years--

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.694
LUVVIE AJAYI: 13 years--
come on-- veteran.

00:11:31.694 --> 00:11:37.140
[LAUGHING] But there are certain
platforms I cannot get with,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.370
even though I've tried, and
I'm a digital strategist,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.703
and I can see the value in them.

00:11:40.703 --> 00:11:44.870
But me personally, me,
myself, and I personally, I

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.470
have a trouble infusing
it into my day.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.910
Snapchat is one of them.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.190
I have tried, you guys.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.960
Snapchat-- so here's
the thing that I

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.930
have a problem with
Generation Millennia

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.350
and Generation Social Media,
which I'm a very firm part of,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.080
is we feel like everything
we do is interesting.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.810
And it's not.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.782
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:06.630
So like people all spend
all day on Snapchat

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.005
telling you exactly
what they did

00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:10.050
in every moment of their day.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.910
And I'll log into
Snapchat, and I'll just

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.200
be like, you know what?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.991
Today's the day I'm
going to give it a try.

00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.385
And I'm going to scroll through.

00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:16.760
And people are
walking to the bus

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.970
like, yes, I'm walking
to the bus stop.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.780
OK.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.442
And?

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:23.650
And then the filters are
killing me softly, you guys.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.020
Like the filters, the flower
filter, the face-- I'm just

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.770
like, why does everybody look
like a cartoon right now?

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.550
So I have a Snapshot account,
but I log into it like once

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.220
a month.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.950
And I think I've
Snapchatted twice total.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.650
And I do actually have
a Snapchattable life,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.110
because I'm in
these random rooms.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.970
I call myself Forrest Gump.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.870
I do all these
interesting things.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.078
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's you?

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:48.620
LUVVIE AJAYI: [LAUGHING]
Right, like can you believe it?

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.479
But it's like, catch me on
Instagram, catch me on Twitter.

00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:53.020
I'm on there.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.620
Catch me on Facebook.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.400
To add Snapchat to it to
catch a moment-by-moment thing

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.992
of my day is just a lot.

00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:00.950
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.030
And what about vlogging
or YouTube or--?

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.034
LUVVIE AJAYI: I have
actively rejected YouTube.

00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:07.950
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Why?

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.710
AUDIENCE: [GASPS]

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.396
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yup, I have.

00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:12.050
Yup, I said it.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.562
[LAUGHING] At Google.

00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:18.970
[LAUGHING] I've made it a
point not to be on YouTube,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.120
because I don't like the
community on YouTube.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.930
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Well, this is something

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.900
I wanted to talk about.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.000
Because social media
has tons of es.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.450
It's part of why you're
here today and part of why

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.650
we know about you.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.710
But it's also a place where
there is a lot of hate

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.130
and a lot of misinformation
and filter bubble.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.320
And I want to talk
about that experience.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.730
So we're heartbroken you've
rejected YouTube wholesale.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.700
Most of the people who aren't
here today are working on that

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.600
and fixing it as we speak.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.280
So we'd like you to give it
a try tomorrow or next week.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.530
LUVVIE AJAYI: [LAUGHING] Yeah.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.120
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: But
what is your experience,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.870
both good and bad?

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.920
Have you been trolled?

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.970
Have you been doxxed?

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.340
Have you been harmed by
social media personally?

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:07.550
And how should we as owners
of some of the services

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.410
that people use think
about what we can do?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.290
Without getting into
censorship and repressing

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.190
people's feelings, how do
we create safe environments

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.330
for people?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.620
LUVVIE AJAYI: OK, so my
decision to not do YouTube

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.147
has been, one, because
I hate editing stuff.

00:14:24.147 --> 00:14:26.230
And again, I don't want
it to just be me talking--

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.350
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Oh,
so you're lazy is the--

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.724
LUVVIE AJAYI: Lazy
is part of it.

00:14:28.724 --> 00:14:29.774
Oh, absolutely.

00:14:29.774 --> 00:14:32.190
But then the second part is I
hate the community on there,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.590
because that community
is so full of hate.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.570
Because at one point, it
was where you can actually

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.000
comment anonymously.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.400
And what that spurs
is keyboard courage,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.409
people who decide that since
they are a number in a system,

00:14:45.409 --> 00:14:47.450
they can say whatever they
want, as opposed to it

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.530
being attached to their names.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.863
So a lot of my friends are
YouTube stars and like people

00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:52.580
who built their
following on YouTube,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.110
like Franchesca Ramsey.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.660
And I used to see
the comments they

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.630
would get all day, every day,
and to avoid the comments, they

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.756
would have to sit
there moderating it,

00:15:01.756 --> 00:15:03.630
either themselves, which,
of course, triggers

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.500
all types of trauma.

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:08.350
Or they just actively
just be just be

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.080
like, I threw up a video,
I just never go back

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.420
into my comments section.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.000
And for me, the
power of the internet

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.090
is connecting with people.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.590
And I think that's
really important.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.340
So I was like, you know what?

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.310
I'm a writer.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.220
I prefer to write.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:21.950
I'll be writing.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.190
Y'all catch me there.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.860
I don't want to do videos yet.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.740
And I know YouTube started
fixing some of that.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.284
I was never really recruited
to come back into the fold.

00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:33.450
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well,
consider this an invitation.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.860
LUVVIE AJAYI: An invitation
to come back into the fold?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.780
Like I was using my Vimeo
channel, because I was like,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.363
you know what?

00:15:38.363 --> 00:15:40.030
I need to store some
video somewhere.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.330
So I just didn't feel like
YouTube was the place.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.850
Now, in terms of the
hate online and trolling,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.280
so as a black woman--
well, as a woman is one,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.710
as a black person is
another, as a black woman is

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.619
another-- the type of feedback
that we get on social media

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.410
is completely different
from everyone else.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.390
So this was tested out
by people on Twitter,

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.290
actually, where
they did like a week

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.890
where they exchanged avatars.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.400
So black women and
white men decided

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.430
to do this experiment
and exchange avatars

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.300
and see how the
difference in your avatar

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.600
affects how the
responses you get are.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.380
And the white men who
had the black women

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.460
avatars for the
week were stunned

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.570
by the type of vitriol
they got for simple stuff

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.810
that they were saying.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.300
For me as a side-eye sorceress
and a professional shader--

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.460
--I am lucky to not
receive some of the hate

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.670
that a lot of people get.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.760
Because here's the thing.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.160
I can beat you at that game.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.110
Like I've spent all
my life being shady.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.000
I can do this.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.650
But I've been fortunate--

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.390
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: The trolls are
afraid of you, is the problem.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.800
LUVVIE AJAYI: The trolls
don't come at me as much

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.130
as they come at other people.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.449
I will say that.

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:49.990
But one thing that I've loved
about my social media platforms

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.830
is people saying that
my community reflects

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.115
me, which is king compliment.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.830
No matter where I
am on the internet,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:08.829
I like to keep my spaces clear,
free of hate, and as a space

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.450
you can get in a public domain.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.010
So my audience is also very
protective of the spaces

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.180
that I've created.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.130
So if any type of
hate creeps through,

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.030
they handle it before
I even get there.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.000
Because they understand that
this is one of the few places

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.750
you can go and actually
read the comments.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.420
So how everyone else tells
you, never read the comments,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.359
you want to read the comments
on my posts on my Facebook,

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.200
on my Twitter, on
anywhere that I am.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.030
Because my audience is super
smart, super thoughtful,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:38.400
and they've managed to maintain
a space that is actually good.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.420
And it shows the best
of humanity, as opposed

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.610
to the rest of the internet,
which kind of shows awfulness.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.610
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So I
want to talk about filter

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.160
bubble, this concept.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.210
You mentioned you don't just
like to preach to the choir,

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.710
right?

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.950
That's part of what you do.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.980
But you also want to
reach people and change

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.500
people's minds.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.760
This morning my wife
showed me a site

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.840
called FriendsWhoLikeTrump.com.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.510
I don't know if
you've seen this.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.250
But it actually exposes
your Facebook friends

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.670
who have actually liked Trump.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.480
So I did a bit of
unfriending this morning.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.271
LUVVIE AJAYI: Amen.

00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:11.817
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:11.817 --> 00:18:14.400
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I'm proud to
say out of 1,000 or so friends,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.690
I had eight, and
most of whom I either

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.520
didn't know who
they were or hadn't

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.630
spoken to them in 30 years.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.820
I did grow up in
Michigan, which can have

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.860
little pockets of purple state.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:36.030
But I did ask myself, am
I perpetuating this filter

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.530
bubble?

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.250
Is my feed now going
to be filled with stuff

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.190
that I already believe?

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.840
And am I not getting exposure?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.160
Should I have had more
curiosity, like why on earth

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.920
would people I know support
a candidate who let's

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.130
just say I can't get behind?

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.045
LUVVIE AJAYI: Who
is a walking Cheeto?

00:18:55.045 --> 00:18:56.878
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
[LAUGHING] You can say it.

00:18:56.878 --> 00:18:58.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.240
LUVVIE AJAYI: The worst.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.300
OK, so here's the thing.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.480
I tell people off jump.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.610
Like my social media
platforms are not democracies.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.840
They're dictatorships.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.660
I will delete.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.300
I will block.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.510
I'll report as spam at will, OK?

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.940
And feel no guilt about it.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.120
Because here's the thing.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.130
That's not a filter I really
even want to be a part of,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.230
to be like clearing your space
of Trump supporters, that

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.950
is one of the few things
that I draw the line.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.920
It's like, oh, we can't
be friends, off jump, OK?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.920
Like there's no
conversation here.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.170
You support him?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.770
Because supporting him means
you support and tolerate

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.060
hate and misogyny and
Islamophobia and anti-Semitism

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.680
and anti-woman.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.000
And it's just anti
everything that

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.550
is not straight, white male.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.740
And it's a problem.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.090
So you deleting
those people, I don't

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.090
think it's necessarily
creating a filter bubble,

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.200
because here's the thing.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.090
What do you learn from them
besides what you already know,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.660
which is that hate does
exist in the world?

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.430
And even educated people who are
somewhat sensible and logical

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:07.080
can still tolerate awful things
in people who perpetuate that.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.370
And I don't have the
capacity to even do that.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.857
I am not a mediator.

00:20:13.857 --> 00:20:16.190
I'm not the person you walk
up to just like, oh, my god,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.170
let me see both sides.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.940
Oh, no, I'm very much
biased about everything.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.720
So yeah.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.136
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I've heard
you talk about the difference

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:26.699
between journalism and writing.

00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:27.990
You consider yourself a writer.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.130
And it sort of speaks to this
biased-and-proud attitude

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.730
you have.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.640
Can you talk a little
bit-- at Google,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.030
we have things like Google News.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.850
And even our search
results, we work

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.090
very hard to make them fair.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.910
Talk about journalism
versus writing and maybe not

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.910
only the role you
have in that spectrum,

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.260
but where should Google sit?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.030
Should we be opinionated, or--?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.140
LUVVIE AJAYI: So
I do call myself

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.470
a writer and not a journalist.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.350
Because I feel like
as a journalist,

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.660
you do have to
maintain some level

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.020
of like, what, objectivity?

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.220
And just be like, I'm not
always going to choose sides.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.769
I don't know how to do that.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.060
I'm the person who can't
write-- I can't write anything

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.450
but op-eds.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.860
But they'll be fact-based.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.720
So for me, I give myself
the responsibility

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.470
of making sure I'm
double-checking to make

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.510
sure I'm not passing
on fake news,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.780
making sure that my opinion
is based on some fact

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.850
that I heard.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.400
So that is important.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.540
As a company, I
understand if Google

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.750
wants to maintain
like neutral ground.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.010
So it shows both sides.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.650
But then as a person
of opinion and I

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.850
think as a leader in
all things, Google

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.310
might need to one
day step up and say,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.280
actually, this is the
lane that we pick.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.950
Like if somebody
goes into Google

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.947
and wants to find a way
to join a hate group,

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:56.530
I feel like it should
be a little more

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.599
difficult for them
to find it, to find

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.640
that type of information.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.269
Because essentially, you can
serve up information to them

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.810
on a platter.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.370
And be like, just because we're
being impartial, what does that

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.570
do for the world?

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.161
And how does that impact
the betterness of the world?

00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:12.660
And I think Google
is a company that

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.510
cares about that in some way.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.944
So to make it that easy I feel
like I would be a mistake.

00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:17.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yep.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.710
The people that aren't
working on YouTube

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.254
are thinking about
that right now.

00:22:21.254 --> 00:22:22.415
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:26.090
But you look at
Google, it's pretty

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.720
clear we have a very
diverse workforce,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.560
just looking out
at the audience.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.370
I'm kidding.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.709
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:39.341
LUVVIE AJAYI: He's like
[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING]

00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:41.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I wish
this was representative

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.220
of our workforce.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.960
Unfortunately,
this is a biased--

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.232
LUVVIE AJAYI: Shout-out
to Bradley for that!

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.109
[LAUGHING]

00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:50.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: But
we are working on it.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.990
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I think
we're very much in a listening

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.730
and learning mode.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:03.310
And as we try to address this,
like any advice on that front?

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.570
How do we actually
create-- the people who

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.930
are creating these products,
how can they more represent

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.685
the world and the audiences?

00:23:09.685 --> 00:23:11.560
LUVVIE AJAYI: Google
and other tech companies

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.430
have got to start trying harder,
even harder than you are now.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.890
Because here's the
thing, is I feel

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.560
like every company
needs to reflect

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.460
the world as it is for the
greater good of that company,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.290
too.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.790
Because more diverse
voices in the room,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.620
your products are going
to be even better.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.660
Because you're getting all
types of people being like,

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.710
have you thought about this?

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.740
No, that doesn't work.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.910
What about this?

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.800
And I think it's in
your best interest

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.430
to get you some more
color, get you some more

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.840
people of different backgrounds
who can be in a room

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.590
and be like, oh, OK,
this is what I think,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.830
and then not gets shut out by
their coworkers who are white.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.386
Like even recently I
was reading an article

00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:54.510
about how the women in the
White House in the Obama

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.740
administration have
formed like this Voltron

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.460
where when they're in meetings,
if one woman says an idea,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.910
another woman repeats it,
and then somebody else

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.054
repeats it who's a woman just so
the idea is not given to a man.

00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:08.470
Because we've been
in enough rooms

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.857
where we say something,
and everyone is like, eh.

00:24:10.857 --> 00:24:13.190
And then the dude says it,
and they're like, great idea.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.040
You're like, word, like I
didn't just say that four times?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.773
So in that type of a way, I
think tech companies need to,

00:24:20.773 --> 00:24:23.540
one, it's not even
necessarily them

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.190
having a conscious
bias to be like,

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.050
I'm just only going
to hire white people.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:27.800
That's not it.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.850
We tend to engage
with people who

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.900
are in close proximity
with us, people

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.300
who look like us who are
like in our immediate circle.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.880
So those are the
people we end up

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.710
telling they have
job opportunities,

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.570
and those are the people who
end up basically applying.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.470
What needs to happen is the
very pointed and focused attempt

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.340
to go outside of that proximity.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.420
Like go to places
where you haven't been.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.672
Ask people who don't look
like the executive team.

00:24:52.672 --> 00:24:55.130
And honestly, get some black
people on your executive team,

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.630
too.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.374
Y'all need that.

00:24:56.374 --> 00:24:58.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.750
But I think it's a process
that needs to start now.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.662
And people need to be very
prioritizing about it.

00:25:03.662 --> 00:25:06.120
Like it shouldn't be one of
those things that's like, if it

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.130
happens, it happens.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.070
It needs to be like a focus.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.570
Because in, what,
2030 or 2040, there's

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.090
going to be no ethnic
majority in the country.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.790
So it behooves Google
and Facebook and Twitter

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.400
and all of them,
Apple, like everybody

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.820
needs to start making
it a point to find--

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.130
And it's not a quota system.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.760
It's not you being like, well,
we need four more black people,

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.350
we need four
Latinos, four Asians.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.080
No.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.360
You want to find people
who are qualified,

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.276
and they're out there.

00:25:31.276 --> 00:25:33.710
Like people say, I can't
find black techies.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.860
I can't find Latino techies.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.460
There are Twitter
lists of people

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.410
who have 500-- that says
Black Techies at the top.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.720
So we're out here.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.590
We exist.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.140
And we--

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.270
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We do have
some competence in search.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:48.920
So we ought to be--

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.260
LUVVIE AJAYI: I think so, OK?

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.640
Like Google is like the search
king of the entire universe,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.360
not even Earth.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.430
There are probably
aliens using Google.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.895
So you have no excuse not
to be able to find and find

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.382
the people who are good.

00:26:04.382 --> 00:26:05.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.860
Cool.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:09.864
LUVVIE AJAYI: He's like--

00:26:09.864 --> 00:26:11.280
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So in the spirit

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.309
of putting us on the spot--

00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:15.100
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah!

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
--me in particular,

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.472
I want to share something
you recently wrote.

00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:20.740
"Another day, another hashtag.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.390
White people, you
gotta get to work now

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.350
about the killings of black
people by law enforcement."

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.990
You say, "White people,
I'm talking to you.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.910
This is your problem to fix.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.100
Y'all got some work to do,
because this system that

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.780
y'all keep on privileging from,
you've got to help us dismantle

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.280
it.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.130
Because those of us who are
black and brown, we have tried.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.280
You created this robot, and
it is yours to deactivate.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.380
My skin folk don't
have the passcode.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.955
This is your monster to slay."

00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:48.060
LUVVIE AJAYI: Word.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.018
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:26:49.018 --> 00:26:51.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.440
So for those of us that
agree, where do we start?

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.050
How do we become better at
helping slay the monster?

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.600
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah, you
gotta slay the dragon, man.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.830
It's a multi-step process.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:11.000
And I think it comes from--
we can change policy all day,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.580
every day.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.930
But if policies change but
the hearts of the people who

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:18.220
are in these spaces to enforce
it don't, nothing happens.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:25.070
So the real deep belief that
it is the job of white people

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.720
to fix racism because if we
could have fixed it by now,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.020
we would have done it.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.410
And we have tried.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.690
So one, listening-- I've seen
enough conversations where

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.726
people are like, here's how I
felt when this issue happened.

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:41.600
And somebody walks in
being like, well, maybe

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.950
you're just looking
at it the wrong way.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.790
I was telling you
how I felt about it,

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.740
but here you are
trying to argue me down

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.250
about my opinion
and my feelings,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.180
which feelings are valid.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.930
So one, listening.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.697
Two, when these things happen,
a lot of times people will say,

00:27:56.697 --> 00:27:58.530
I don't know what else
to say at this point.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.570
It's getting even worse.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.730
If you don't know what to
say, amplify the voices

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:07.010
of those who do, so
lending your platform

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.382
to people who are able to say,
this is how it's affected me.

00:28:10.382 --> 00:28:11.840
This is what I
think we need to do.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.769
So lending your platforms
to black and brown voices.

00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:16.810
I also think people need
to put their money where

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.600
their hearts are.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.140
People have money.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.910
Silicon Valley has money.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.780
At the minimum, donate to
anti-racist organizations

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.050
and people who are actively
doing the work to fix it,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.620
people who need the
resources and who

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.010
need to get in the room.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.140
That's important.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.200
And then, some of us have all
these platforms to speak up.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.690
Speak up.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.259
Use it.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:41.300
Because here's the thing.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.100
I don't have a job.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.620
I could say something.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.620
Nobody's going to be like,
Luvvie, you're fired.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.740
So it is in my best interest to
use my voice, because I don't

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.620
have anything to lose there.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.030
And also one thing
that we need to do,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.520
because it's like
right here, it's

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.040
the lowest common denominator,
is our friends and our family

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.540
members.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.400
When they say hateful
things about people

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.970
who are not in our group
who are marginalized,

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.020
we have to say something.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.630
And you know what
we do when we see

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.880
some stupid stuff in Facebook.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.824
We'll like scroll
past and roll our eyes

00:29:12.824 --> 00:29:15.240
and be like, oh, I hate the
fact that they just said that.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.150
But we never confront it.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.320
So that person thinks it's OK.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.620
So even across the
dinner table when

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.521
somebody is saying something
hateful, in that moment,

00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:26.520
you have to let them know
you can't tolerate it.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.650
Because if you let it happen and
you say nothing, you're saying

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.360
it is fine.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.100
It should happen just like that.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.300
[SIGHING] Huffing and puffing
is not enough-- actively

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.970
being like, hey, that's
actually not an OK statement,

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.860
here's why you're wrong.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.920
And after I wrote
that piece, I actually

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.830
got a lot of notes
in the two weeks

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.054
afterwards from people
who had been like,

00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:48.220
I've actually taken that on.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.400
One of my friends
e-mailed me and said

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.740
her husband's father always says
something racist every time.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.400
And he just scrolls past it
and shakes his head in Facebook

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.310
and he's like, oh,
that irritates me.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.110
After I wrote that
piece, his father

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.730
put some like racist
joke up, and he sends him

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.107
a three-paragraph email
about how that was not OK.

00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:09.940
And she's like, I just
want to say thank you

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.356
because he told
me to let you know

00:30:11.356 --> 00:30:14.360
that the reason he did that
was because he read your piece.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.280
And he realized that he can't
be quiet anymore about it.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.180
So even small
things-- we don't all

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.790
have to start nonprofit
organizations.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.910
We don't have to be
the ones marching.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.920
But we can do stuff
in our everyday lives

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.690
that actually can move the
needle just a little bit.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.300
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.820
That was some amazing
practical advice.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.670
I wasn't actually expecting that
much actionable stuff that I

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.320
think all of us can do in
this room and in this company

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.720
and in this world.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.400
I know for me, one
of the challenges

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.170
was sort of coming to grips
with how much I had to learn.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.500
And for me, a lot
of it was really

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.310
in taking this
unconscious bias training,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.050
where I sort of walked
in there sleepwalking,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.880
like not expecting to be rattled
or shaken by what happened.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.080
But what was really
revealed was a lot

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.680
of the societal
conditioning that

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.840
had sort of-- even
me, a good guy, who's

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.240
trying to be part
of the solution,

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.360
there's a lot of deep
work we have to do.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.306
It was very humbling
in a lot of ways.

00:31:19.306 --> 00:31:20.680
It's sort of like,
the last thing

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.990
I wanted to do once
that part of me

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.610
was out there was sort
of get up and pretend

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.560
to be part of the
solution when I understood

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.540
I was part of the problem.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.210
And I think the answer
is sort of both.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:39.640
Like when I first started
really concentrating my team

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.150
on some issues around
diversity and inclusion,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.590
I reached out to
a friend of mine

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.500
who's been doing this work
for really 30-plus years,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.095
and she was sort of like,
welcome to the conversation.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.710
There are professionals.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.020
There are people who have
spent careers and lifetimes

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.440
thinking about these problems.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.270
And I know a lot
of us are waking up

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.260
for the moment for
the first time,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.270
but it's important
to sort of plug in.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.740
And I think your suggestion
even to just give

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.690
resource, where that's money,
time, technology platforms,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.400
to those people who
are professionals

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.790
and have actually spent a
lifetime thinking about some

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.660
of these things is really
important for those of us that

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.360
are quickly catching up.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.290
LUVVIE AJAYI: I mean, I
think part of the thing

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.090
is when you start
talking about race

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.070
and you start talking about
responsibility of white people,

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.400
a lot of times
people feel accused,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.730
like they are personally the
ones who are being racist.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.960
But here's the thing that
people have to understand

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.970
is privilege, no
matter what it is

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.790
your privilege is-- like I
have a bunch of privileges.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.800
I have class privilege.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.100
I have sexual
orientation privilege.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.100
I have gender identity
privilege, religion privilege.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.090
So there's certain
things that I need

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.980
to understand that in all
these systems, because I'm

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.790
a part of it and I benefit from
it, I am a part of the problem.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.210
And it's not a Luvvie,
you did this one thing

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.610
that was wrong to this person.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.100
It's you are part of the system,
that even though you might not

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.540
have contributed personally to,
you still have to help fix it.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.500
Because you're in a position
where you can influence stuff.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.460
I can be in a room
where I am one

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.390
of the-- I am going to assume
that most people in the room

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.310
are Christians.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.160
And that gives me a safe space
to talk about my religion.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.870
But if somebody is
there who is Muslim

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.780
and they feel like
they're not safe

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.060
because they're in this space,
it's my job as somebody who

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.810
is of the majority
group to make them feel

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.800
comfortable and welcome,
like I can't just be like,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.970
well, it's not my fault
because I didn't say nothing

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.532
bad about Muslims today, so--

00:33:44.532 --> 00:33:45.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.300
That ain't got
nothing to do with me.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.020
No.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.790
So I think it's really important
to use privileges to basically

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.350
help marginalized people.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.140
And also, part of what we
start learning about privilege

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.650
and our space in the world,
the space that we take up

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:03.640
in the world, is that
we are lucky, one.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.680
We've done nothing to be in
these spaces a lot of times.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.610
Like I was born Christian.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.170
I've never been poor.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.785
So for me, it's like, OK, I
can't take credit for that.

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:15.659
I can't be like, well,
you know, I earned it.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:16.419
I didn't.

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:17.110
I didn't.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.389
It gave me a lot of
things that I worked from.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.100
But also, you have to
unlearn a lot of things.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.380
Like you realize that
we've been programmed

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.420
so well that the
process of fixing it

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.040
means you have to unlearn stuff,
as in dump that out your head,

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.429
that is not what the
world is really about.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:37.100
And that's the really hard
part of unlearning everything

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.960
you've known for how many years
you've been on this Earth.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.346
So you just kind of
got to commit to it.

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:43.429
It's not going to be easy.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.906
It's a drop-kick to your
ego when you realize

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:47.030
you're part of the problem.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.530
It is.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.260
It's like, damn, I didn't
know I was that person.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.710
You are.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.889
Now, now that you know that
you are that person, how

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.139
do you not become that person?

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.847
How do you make sure
somebody else is not

00:34:56.847 --> 00:34:58.044
hurt by your personhood?

00:34:58.044 --> 00:35:00.210
And one thing that I actually
wrote about in my book

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.260
was-- has anyone heard about
the Privilege Exercise?

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.220
Oh!

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.226
I feel like every company in
Silicon Valley-- actually,

00:35:08.226 --> 00:35:10.350
every company in general
needs to make this happen.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.490
So the Privilege
Exercise changed my life

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.764
and how I looked at the world.

00:35:13.764 --> 00:35:15.680
And I was a counseling
center paraprofessional

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.920
when I was in college, trained
to be a peer counselor.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.360
But the whole first semester
was us learning about who we are

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.710
and the space we take up.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.520
And literally, we spent
a whole six months

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.110
talking about ourselves and
who we are and unpacking it.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.690
So one thing we did was
the Privilege Exercise.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:38.130
So everyone starts
in the same line, OK?

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.480
You start in same line.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.620
And they make a statement.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.400
You either step
forward or step back.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.310
So a statement would
be something like,

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.460
step forward if you've never
had to worry about somebody

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.147
mispronouncing your name.

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:50.980
People step forward.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:55.070
Step back if you've
sometimes worried about where

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.350
your next meal is coming from.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.620
Somebody steps back.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.130
Step up if you can marry
the person you love.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.366
So it's a series of questions.

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:03.740
Sometimes it's
like 20 questions.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.860
Sometimes it's 50.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.000
At the end of the Privilege
Exercise, they say,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.200
stop and look around
the room and see

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.390
where you are in
relation to other people.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.780
So sometimes I found
myself higher to the front

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.020
than I actually
imagined I would be.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.020
And some of my classmates in
the back, and I was like, wow,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.460
you're behind me?

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.090
And it gives you the perspective
of understanding like, OK.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.690
So the Privilege
Exercise, you get

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:32.125
to actually get to
figure out, wow,

00:36:32.125 --> 00:36:33.467
I'm behind a lot of people.

00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:34.800
I never would have thought that.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.660
Or I'm actually way luckier
than I thought I was.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.505
And it teaches you about who
the people you're around are

00:36:41.505 --> 00:36:42.880
and also some of
their struggles.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.713
Because some of my
classmates who were white

00:36:44.713 --> 00:36:46.780
girls were behind me.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.480
And I was like, I wonder why.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.720
So we got to unpack it.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.680
I feel like it's really
important for companies

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.120
to do this.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.896
Because give your
employees a chance

00:36:54.896 --> 00:36:57.520
to understand where they are in
the world and what they fit in.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.250
Because sometimes in these
rooms, the people of color,

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.174
the people who are
different, LGBT people,

00:37:03.174 --> 00:37:04.590
might not feel
like they have room

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.410
to even step up and
say something to you,

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.390
because they might
gets shut down.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.280
And the people who are
saying things never

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.850
understand that they take up
a lot of room all the time

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.050
and don't give room
for other people.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.940
So it's a way to kind of
recalibrate and get folks

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:23.150
to understand that I might
need to either shut up more,

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.450
or I need to step up more, or
I need to advocate for more

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.530
people, or I need to be the
one that's like advocating

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.022
for myself more.

00:37:31.022 --> 00:37:32.480
I think it would
be good for Google

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.720
to do it for a couple of people.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.636
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:37:34.636 --> 00:37:35.970
That's a great exercise.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.587
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:39.587 --> 00:37:42.170
What I want to do-- we've got a
couple mics up here, and we do

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.420
want to make this interactive.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.830
So as you think
of your questions,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.360
while you're doing that,
I want to invite Luvvie,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.220
if you're willing
and open to it,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.250
maybe read a section
of your book,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.810
do a little reading for us.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.730
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes,
I can do a reading.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:00.370
And I'm trying to figure out,
should I do one for-- OK,

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:04.280
so my book is broken up into
four sections-- Life, Culture,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.680
Social Media, and Fame.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.670
Now, each section-- so the Life
is like full of shenanigans.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.430
The culture section, I talk
about like racism, homophobia,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.200
religion.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.070
Social Media section,
I'm talking about,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.312
I Hate Your Hashtag Abuse.

00:38:18.312 --> 00:38:20.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.210
Facebook is My Favorite Soap
Opera, Dumbed-Down News,

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.280
How to Succeed at
Business Failure,

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.360
Real Gs Move in Silence.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.836
So what section would
you like me to read from?

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:35.702
AUDIENCE: Culture.

00:38:35.702 --> 00:38:36.570
AUDIENCE: Culture.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.200
LUVVIE AJAYI: Culture.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.220
All right, let's do it.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.053
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That
was pretty unanimous.

00:38:40.053 --> 00:38:41.090
LUVVIE AJAYI: All right.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.960
So I actually just
basically give you

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.750
a rundown in the-- let's see.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.505
I think I'll do religion.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.452
Yeah.

00:38:54.452 --> 00:38:56.160
I have a chapter on
rape culture in here.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.570
I'll just be-- I went in.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.230
I'm trying to see what
I haven't touched on.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:13.950
Privilege, racism-- OK, so
I wrote a piece of my Racism

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:18.840
chapter while-- it was like
a week after the Charleston

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.900
shooting, and that
night, a church had been

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.090
set on fire in South Carolina.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.865
And I was moved to write because
I was just like so angry.

00:39:36.135 --> 00:39:38.510
"In Charleston, South Carolina,
a small bible study group

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.290
was praying to the Lord on an
otherwise uneventful Wednesday

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.830
at Emanuel AME Church,
the oldest black church

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:44.390
in the South.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.250
A white supremacist
walked in, pretending

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.680
to want to pray with them,
and then pulled a gun out

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.450
and murdered nine black
worshipers in cold blood.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.300
It was invasion of
a place of refuge,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.214
a violation of a
literal safe space,

00:39:55.214 --> 00:39:56.880
and definitive proof
that there is still

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.630
a war on black
people in America.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.220
Nowhere is safe for us.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.076
And the work that has been done
over half a century to get us

00:40:03.076 --> 00:40:04.450
closer to equality
has regressed,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.740
and it feels like we're
back to where we started.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.250
And now another one of
our churches is burning.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.280
And this was 2005.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.530
America is treating
black people like vermin,

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.640
and it's hard not to feel like
we're unwanted and unsafe.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.380
It's open season
on black people,

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.450
and that was not
some lone gunman

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.910
who walked into Emmanuel AME.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.790
He represents the
ongoing commitment

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.330
to keep us in our place,
a violent reminder

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.425
that we are not safe.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.800
We're not safe in the streets,
in our homes, at the park,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.780
or at church.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.988
And I'm fucked up about it,
because this was supposed

00:40:32.988 --> 00:40:34.430
to be history, not the present.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.263
And I feel the anger
from the top of my head

00:40:36.263 --> 00:40:37.820
as it reverberates
down to my toes.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.710
This rage makes my skin burn.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.814
I feel the fire in my bones.

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:42.980
This is racism at its worst.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.300
It's ugly, demented, and vile.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.300
It also permeates
every fiber of what

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.060
the United States is made of.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.016
And it's what's built the
foundation of this country.

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.640
It's truly exhausting,
and I'm not sure

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.910
if I'm thankful for the
undeniable proof that racism

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.690
is still around us or
wishful for the days

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.580
when we could be
tricked into thinking

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.130
things were not so bad.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.960
But racism is not just random
individuals burning churches

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.225
and black people being
gunned down the streets.

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:07.600
It is a system of
oppression that

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.230
is so deep and
omnipresent that it

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.170
seeps into every single
aspect of our lives.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.980
And it is as American as apple
pie drizzled with canned cheese

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.930
topped with French fries.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.930
The red stripes on the
flag are really the blood

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.013
of black and brown people.

00:41:20.013 --> 00:41:22.330
In many centuries after
the country's creation,

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.717
these stains still
have not faded.

00:41:24.717 --> 00:41:26.800
And let's pause here to
say that racism in America

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.870
is stupid as hell.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.430
Racism and prejudice
anywhere is dumber,

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.250
but it makes no sense,
because it's just absurd.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.170
The United States of
America is a country

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.360
founded on the labor
and literal bodies

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.210
of black and brown
people, who were minding

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.990
their own business when
white folks came forth

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.250
to kill and exploit them.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.480
This is a place that was
discovered by a dude who

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.840
didn't know how to read a map.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.000
So he just showed up on some
shore, thought he was in India,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.430
and then proceeds to
plant a flag and go ta-da!

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.040
No.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.100
What Christopher Columbus
needed was a compass and a clue

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.620
for being an
aggressively mediocre.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.920
But he has a federal
holiday in his honor.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.040
He showed up on
someone else's property

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.140
and claimed it as his because
he didn't know what it was.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.940
This country started off all
the way wrong and continued

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.020
in the same fashion."

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.180
I feel like Chris
needed Google Maps, OK?

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.825
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:23.420
Like, you in the
wrong place, sir.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.630
This is not India.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:25.510
Hot mess.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.612
And we celebrate him.

00:42:26.612 --> 00:42:27.320
We celebrate him.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.730
This is so American.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.720
"And then Chris slaughtered
Native Americans,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.430
wiping out whole tribes,
pillaging the people,

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.370
and called it Thanksgiving.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.912
And to add to the
mess, the dude bros

00:42:38.912 --> 00:42:40.661
realized they didn't
even have the ability

00:42:40.661 --> 00:42:43.310
to build dope shit on their
own, so they went to Africa

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.610
and captured black people
and then brought them here

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:49.040
to be their slaves after killing
millions on the journey here.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.320
Because if you want to
out-terrible yourself,

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.520
you stuff millions of
human beings inside ships,

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.960
refuse to feed them, let
them lie in their own filth,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.660
and then let them die in droves.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.570
So not only did you
steal someone else's home

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.028
and then kill them
when they showed

00:43:02.028 --> 00:43:04.640
you kindness, you went
elsewhere and then did some more

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.920
stealing, this time
of actual people.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.920
And you forced them to
come to your stolen house

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.380
to do your work for you.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.240
I mean, you're welcome for
this 'too long didn't read'

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.390
version of imperialism
in America,

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:18.632
but this is why I
should teach, OK?

00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:20.590
I wouldn't do any worse
than current textbooks,

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.006
like the ones in Texas that
use the word 'workers' instead

00:43:23.006 --> 00:43:27.350
of 'slaves.' In the section
about the Transatlantic Slave

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.830
Trade, they called them
'workers,' as if black people

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.670
were at a career fair in Africa
where we submitted resumes

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:36.130
and asked to be beaten and
starved and have our families

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.830
broken in exchange for a
journey across the ocean with no

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:39.330
money."

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.710
Like this is not LinkedIn.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.012
Why-- we're not "workers," OK?

00:43:44.012 --> 00:43:45.970
"So my point is that the
United States does not

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.540
have a legitimate history
of integrity and fairness.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.800
It's been run by villains that
make Disney's look like saints.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.560
Racism is not a
byproduct as much

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.980
as it's the foundational
stock in the American soup,

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.570
and this is why black
people are still

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.971
fighting to be recognized
in our full humanity.

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:03.470
The success of the country has
been based on our oppression,

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.430
so of course it is
forever fresh out of damns

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.392
to give about black lives.

00:44:07.392 --> 00:44:08.850
And we are left to
grieve for those

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.933
we've lost to the grubby
hands of white supremacy.

00:44:10.933 --> 00:44:13.500
We rage about the
perpetual cycle of mourning

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.930
we find ourselves in.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.974
And we wonder what we need to do
to be secure in our own skins."

00:44:17.974 --> 00:44:18.890
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:23.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.470
Powerful ideas, but
also powerful writing.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.690
That was really beautiful.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.390
LUVVIE AJAYI: Thank you.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.098
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK,
questions from you.

00:44:34.098 --> 00:44:35.230
We have two mics up there.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.137
Googlers aren't shy, usually.

00:44:37.137 --> 00:44:37.970
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:38.550
Don't be shy.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.383
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We
have a lot of practice.

00:44:40.383 --> 00:44:43.270
We have this event called TGIF,
which we hold on Thursday,

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.960
of course.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.700
And we have these mics up
there, and people are always

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.360
asking our founders
and leadership

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.100
pretty much anything,
telling it like it is.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.100
It is a great tradition.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.150
So questions?

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.650
So first, queen, just want
to honor you and thank you

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:06.537
for existing and being here to
share and help lift us all up.

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.870
Also want to acknowledge I
wish this room was completely

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.820
full, because you deserve
all of the 60,000 Googlers

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.820
listening to you.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.830
So there's that.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:16.780
But I actually do
have a question.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.440
My question is, as
Google works on trying

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.540
to continue to
diversify, so we actually

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.590
have people working here that
reflect the people we serve

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:30.640
around the world, how can
we also change the culture

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.396
so people are allowing
us to be ourselves?

00:45:34.396 --> 00:45:35.770
I feel like what
you said earlier

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.360
about speaking
straight, not padding

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.916
things with a lot of sugar,
it really resonated with me.

00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:43.040
I think one of the things
I find hardest to be here

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.960
is that I need to
put so much sugar

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.129
on the front and the back
end that I can't even

00:45:47.129 --> 00:45:48.170
call it a sugar sandwich.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.790
It's like a cake.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:54.670
So how can we as a
people and as allies

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:57.400
help people understand that
it's not the same lens?

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.880
You can't bring in all these
different cultures, Africans,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.580
African Americans,
Latinos, Filipinos,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.600
anyone who is not
white, and expect

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.760
us to act white in a company
that is majority white.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.430
LUVVIE AJAYI: So
communication is cultural.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.810
That's one thing that I think a
lot of people of color struggle

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.380
with in companies like this.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.660
Communication is cultural.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.100
For me, I'm a very
direct person.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.100
If I need to send you an email,
I'm going to be like, hey,

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:27.600
what's up?

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.780
So here's what I need from you.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.640
People prefer, hey, so, I
hope your day was going well.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.780
I was wondering if you could
possibly do this for me.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.640
Who has that time?

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.690
Why I gotta like layer it
with 1,500-- can I just get

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.280
to the point?

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.210
And then people
are like, well, you

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.649
were kind of short in e-mail.

00:46:45.649 --> 00:46:47.690
Because I asked you a
question as opposed to like

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.830
went through a three-paragraph
diatribe about, how you doing,

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.085
girl?

00:46:52.085 --> 00:46:52.585
Wander in.

00:46:52.585 --> 00:46:54.202
Girl, how was your weekend?

00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:55.660
Honestly, people
need to understand

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.900
that different communication
skills and different ways

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.760
people talk in email is not
an affront to you as a person.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.195
Like if I was to send you a
two-paragraph email, because I

00:47:07.195 --> 00:47:10.930
am on the go, that's not
me being short with you.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.676
That's me being on the go.

00:47:12.676 --> 00:47:14.050
And I think a lot
of black people

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.180
end up being
on-the-go types style.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.670
And their coworkers end up
being like, I felt like that

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.550
was very short of you.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.210
Honestly, there needs to be
a little bit more-- people

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.670
need to get our their feelings.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.890
That's important.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:28.760
Get out your feelings
as a coworker.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.780
Like if somebody sends you an
email, and then they're like,

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.510
I felt kind of short.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.218
You can ask them.

00:47:32.218 --> 00:47:33.680
Be like, hey, are you OK?

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.200
As opposed to like I hear a
lot of passive-aggressive stuff

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.150
happening.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.080
Get out your feelings.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.710
If I send you a two-sentence
email because I need something,

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.320
it doesn't mean I don't want
to know how well you're doing.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.819
It means in that
moment, it's quick.

00:47:46.819 --> 00:47:49.699
So I think Google might
want to do some more

00:47:49.699 --> 00:47:50.990
different communication styles.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.614
Ooh, you know one
thing that helps?

00:47:52.614 --> 00:47:54.030
OK, so there's
this website called

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:59.690
16personalities.com allows
you to do a personality test.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.280
And if you work
closely with any team,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.520
have everybody on the team
do this personality test.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.978
It will break it down and be
like, OK-- so it will tell you

00:48:06.978 --> 00:48:10.090
exactly how that person who
sits next to you communicates.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.840
They're the person
who's always on the go.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.860
They're very direct.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.970
It will even break it
down to the commander.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.220
There's the commander, the
diplomat, the mediator.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.880
That helps, too, for
you to understand

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.010
how your coworkers like
to receive information,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.400
how they pass it on, too.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.780
It is not a front to you.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.267
Learn who you're
working next to.

00:48:28.267 --> 00:48:30.475
As opposed to people having
to like temper everything

00:48:30.475 --> 00:48:31.930
and put them in sugar cakes.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.151
Who has time, you guys?

00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:34.650
Come on.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.154
Let's do more work
and send less e-mails.

00:48:37.154 --> 00:48:38.070
That's also important.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.569
Stop emailing people
for everything.

00:48:39.569 --> 00:48:40.150
Jesus.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:41.420
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I think
part of the problem,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.770
we're all commanders.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:43.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:43.927 --> 00:48:46.260
LUVVIE AJAYI: But what happens
if one commander is like,

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.790
oh, man, I just got commanded
too hard? [LAUGHING]

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.144
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
OK, another question.

00:48:53.144 --> 00:48:54.560
AUDIENCE: Sure,
so, Luvvie, again,

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.690
just to mimic Sarah,
some of her comments,

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.940
just thank you for coming
here and making time for us.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.210
LUVVIE AJAYI: My pleasure.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.501
AUDIENCE: So my name is Howard.

00:49:02.501 --> 00:49:06.079
And I'd be really
curious to hear about--

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:07.870
so there's various
domains of types of work

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:09.860
that we could be
doing to kind of fight

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.720
institutionalized racism
and kind of address

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.320
the racial climate in
general in this country.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.060
And so you can send e-mails.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.060
You can protest.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.160
You can strategize
about policy change.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.710
You can mentor.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.900
You can kind of just be even
just a shoulder for folks

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.329
to cry on and mourn.

00:49:27.329 --> 00:49:29.370
And so there's always
diversity, different things

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:30.800
that we could be doing, right?

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.530
And I think society
kind of conditions

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.184
us to maybe want to do some
things more than others.

00:49:37.184 --> 00:49:38.600
Because maybe some
of these things

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.330
might be more risky
or challenging.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.539
So for example, for
many of us, maybe,

00:49:42.539 --> 00:49:44.580
protesting and getting
pepper-sprayed in the eyes

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.770
is kind of like, ah, I
don't want to do that.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.430
But like maybe if you say like I
can volunteer at Oakland Impact

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.860
Hub, sure, I'll do that.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.470
That sounds reasonable, right?

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.910
Given the problems
that we have, given

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.860
how minimal amount of the
workers there are for us

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.130
to address the
problems, what would you

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:10.460
say is like the most important
prioritized domain of type

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.540
of work that we really
need to focus on in order

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.919
to get shit done, right?

00:50:13.919 --> 00:50:15.960
Like there's a ton of
different things we can do,

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.126
and I love the approach of
like, oh, just like weigh

00:50:18.126 --> 00:50:20.760
your talents and gifts, and
whatever you're really good at,

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.843
that's what you should do.

00:50:21.843 --> 00:50:23.440
Eh--

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.010
LUVVIE AJAYI: I think
there's no one thing to do.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.822
It needs to be a
multilayered approach.

00:50:28.822 --> 00:50:31.030
Knowing what you're good at
and where you can fit in,

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.230
though, makes a difference.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.240
So I already know
I'm not going to be

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.406
the person on the front
line getting pepper-sprayed.

00:50:35.406 --> 00:50:36.960
I'm not about that life.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.160
I give props to
the people who are.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.360
My job in this
movement, if anything,

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.470
is to tell the stories.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.870
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I'm
not good at that, either.

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:44.090
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right.

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:45.256
I'm just not built for that.

00:50:45.256 --> 00:50:46.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.610
Which means like the people who
do that are actively putting

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.170
their bodies on the line.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:55.712
And for them, we owe them to
make sure they're supported

00:50:55.712 --> 00:50:57.670
and the work that they're
doing is not in vain.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:59.060
Because if they're standing
on these front lines getting

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.809
pepper-sprayed, it
better be for a reason.

00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:02.410
And we better be
working to make sure

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.280
that doesn't keep
happening to them.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.450
So it means if your
job is to write policy,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.850
you are the policy person.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.000
Yes, make sure that people
who are in Capitol Hill

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.520
are changing laws.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.787
If your job is to tell
stories, tell these stories

00:51:15.787 --> 00:51:17.370
and make sure people
are understanding

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.220
what's happening in
these streets, what's

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.330
really happening, not what
the media is reporting.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.750
If your job is-- if you just
have so much money you don't

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.350
know what to do with
it, give it to some

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.930
of these people who can then
turn that money into something

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:29.850
concrete.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.637
So it really comes
down to, you don't

00:51:31.637 --> 00:51:33.220
have to force yourself
to do something

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.760
that's outside the realm of
your interests or your passion.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.730
What you're good at,
whatever that is,

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.890
you can find a way that
it's going to help.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:43.610
So again, find what it is,
where you fit in in that place

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.780
and do it and kick
ass in that way.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.795
So I already know I'm
not built for the life

00:51:48.795 --> 00:51:49.795
of being on front lines.

00:51:49.795 --> 00:51:52.880
I'm little, OK?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.910
No.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.610
Like I wouldn't even make it.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.880
I am not built for it.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.150
So yeah, you have to
support in wherever way you

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.412
know how, as opposed to
you being like, well,

00:52:01.412 --> 00:52:02.870
I have to be the
person protesting.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.000
No, you don't.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.850
There are amazing people, like
Black Youth Project 100, which

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.230
I have to give a shout-out to.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.980
If you want to know
some organizations who

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.444
are doing amazing work, who are
making sure the Chicago Police

00:52:13.444 --> 00:52:15.360
Department is actually
being held accountable,

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.160
there's Black Youth Project 100.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.720
There's Dream Defenders.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.894
There Assata's Daughters.

00:52:20.894 --> 00:52:22.310
So these are people
who you can be

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:26.570
giving your money to who will
show where the money's going.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.164
Yeah.

00:52:28.164 --> 00:52:29.580
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
OK, yes, please.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:29.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.140
Good morning.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.470
Thank you so much
for being here today.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.340
When I saw on the calendar
you were going to be here,

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.915
I got super excited,
because my book club

00:52:34.915 --> 00:52:37.081
has been talking about your
book for the last month.

00:52:37.081 --> 00:52:38.359
So thank you for being here.

00:52:38.359 --> 00:52:39.150
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.316
AUDIENCE: My question to
you is, how do you get over

00:52:41.316 --> 00:52:42.640
that first step of fear?

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.530
I feel like people have voices.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:46.180
They want to say something.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.734
But as you alluded
to earlier, maybe

00:52:47.734 --> 00:52:49.150
you don't want to
say at work, you

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.090
worry about losing
your job, or changing

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:53.300
in your world or your
friends becoming different.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.050
And how do you get
over that sense of fear

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.130
that you have that you feel like
you should be saying something,

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.421
you want to, but you're
worried about what you're going

00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:02.160
to let go of in the process?

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.160
LUVVIE AJAYI: Fear is one
of those things that--

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.451
fear itself will cripple you
from doing whatever it is.

00:53:06.451 --> 00:53:08.522
And then when you do
it and push past it,

00:53:08.522 --> 00:53:10.730
you understand that you were
more afraid of the thing

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.260
than how it really was.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.450
So here's the thing.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.320
There are often times
when I write a piece

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.070
that I'll be like, oh,
my, gosh, am I sure

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.889
I want to publish this?

00:53:19.889 --> 00:53:20.680
And I'll sit on it.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.930
I'll hesitate on it.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.880
But every single
time I press Publish,

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.692
the response I get
lets me know, yes,

00:53:25.692 --> 00:53:26.900
you were supposed to do that.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.941
Because here's the thing.

00:53:27.941 --> 00:53:29.820
As a person who's
thinking about that thing

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.760
that you want to talk
about that's scary,

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.190
you're probably not the only
person thinking about it.

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:36.220
You are probably amongst
people who are also

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.950
afraid to say the same thing.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.560
But sometimes all it needs is
that one person to cut through

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.656
to be like, hey, I feel
like this is wrong,

00:53:43.656 --> 00:53:45.030
or I feel like
this is-- and then

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.863
you will see the people
who are like, [SIGH]

00:53:46.863 --> 00:53:47.840
finally somebody said.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.034
OK, I can back her up now.

00:53:50.034 --> 00:53:51.950
I think it just comes
down to pushing past it.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.140
If it's important
enough for you, say it.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.590
You can put it in the
sugar cake if that

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.660
makes it fine in that
meeting, but making sure

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.970
that point is made, because
a lot of times, people

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.260
do the things that they don't
even realize are harmful.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.259
Or they don't understand
what damage it's doing.

00:54:10.259 --> 00:54:12.300
And they just need to be
called on it to be like,

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.330
oh, I didn't even know.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.262
OK, you're right.

00:54:15.262 --> 00:54:16.720
You might have to
be the scapegoat.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.460
You just be like,
I'm going to say it.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.940
I'm going to say it,
because that's how I feel.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.290
This is a valid thing to do.

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.664
And I feel like
it would actually

00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:24.075
push this conversation forward.

00:54:24.075 --> 00:54:24.950
You just gotta do it.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.770
It's not going to
be like less scary.

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:29.235
You're gonna have to be like,
oh, I'm scared shitless.

00:54:29.235 --> 00:54:30.360
But I'm gonna do it anyway.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.260
OK, guys, I don't think
this is a good idea.

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.607
And even just doing that, you
just have to power through it.

00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:37.440
AUDIENCE: I like it.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:37.949
Thank you.

00:54:37.949 --> 00:54:38.740
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.031
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK, I can
see we have more questions.

00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:43.386
I think this is the way
we're going to do this.

00:54:43.386 --> 00:54:44.760
Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.260
And I know that
there are people who

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.860
need to set up this for lunch.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.820
This is also our lunch room.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.952
So we'll take one more question.

00:54:51.952 --> 00:54:52.910
LUVVIE AJAYI: I'm here.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:54.284
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
And she's here.

00:54:54.284 --> 00:54:55.750
That's what I was
going to say, is

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.101
we're going to feed her and
show her a Google bike--

00:54:58.101 --> 00:54:58.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.690
LUVVIE AJAYI: Important things.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:00.030
Priorities.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.980
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: --giver
her a little bit of a tour.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.200
So those of you who want
to, I think it's OK with you

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.720
if we have a little
private time with you

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.660
by the side of the
stage afterwards.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.490
But we'll do one
more formal question,

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.540
and then we'll hand
this room back over.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.499
So one more question, please.

00:55:15.499 --> 00:55:16.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.373
I first wanted to say thank you.

00:55:17.373 --> 00:55:19.470
I'm not quite sure what
I'm thanking you for,

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.694
but thank you.

00:55:20.694 --> 00:55:23.110
And then I'm not sure if I
have a question or a statement,

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.700
but two quick things--
first you talked

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.210
about diversity and Google.

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.320
I received a question from
a friend of mine who said,

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.950
you work at Google.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:35.450
How did you get that job?

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:38.226
And I was just absolutely
amazed, because I said,

00:55:38.226 --> 00:55:38.725
I applied.

00:55:38.725 --> 00:55:42.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.830
And I will say that I'm a
high school dropout, never

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.850
been to college, never
taken any technical courses,

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:50.440
left high school
in the 11th grade.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.630
But I have enough confidence to
say, I'm good, I'm intelligent.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:55.840
I applied.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.200
But I think it's a
statement, is that I

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.620
think Google needs to give
people permission to apply.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.920
I think we need to do more
reaching out to people and say,

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.504
hey, I don't care
if you're this,

00:56:09.504 --> 00:56:10.670
I don't care if you're that.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:11.560
Apply.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.952
We can't just wait for
people to come to us.

00:56:14.952 --> 00:56:16.410
Because they'll
say, that's Google.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.201
They don't want me.

00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:18.890
I'm not good enough.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.820
So any advice that you have for
Google and all the people who

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.070
are working on diversity, I
think that would be great.

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.840
Because everybody goes, how
did you get a job there?

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.220
And I would love
for people that feel

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.040
that they are confident enough
to at least look, at least try,

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.020
because all you
can be told is no.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.440
And the other thing is, you
were talking about racism,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.260
and I have been just feeling
helpless and watching all

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.720
of the protests and getting
excited about the Justice

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.170
Department saying, we're going
to take this shooting of this

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.769
innocent or not-so-innocent
black person,

00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:53.810
and then it turns out that
the Justice Department

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.470
doesn't-- the case
doesn't go through.

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:57.770
They're not charged.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:00.530
And I'm a ranter, which
I might be doing now

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.490
instead of asking a question.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.720
But I have been posting
on Facebook about the fact

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.070
that people sit on the
courthouse steps and say,

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:11.210
this is not going to work.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.490
We have to do something
about it, and we see Beyonce,

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.060
and we see Snoop
Dogg, and we see

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.000
Al Sharpton, all of these
activists, and they're saying,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.360
this is not good.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.290
We have to stop this.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:21.880
But then they step
back, and they go back

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.120
to their everyday
lives, because they

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.830
have this feeling
of helplessness,

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.430
and they don't know
what to do next.

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:28.880
So a couple of weeks ago, I
gathered a bunch of friends

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.080
that I work with from
a design company,

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.520
and we did this great,
big like ideation,

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.090
brainstorm on what we could do.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:39.440
Because in my eyes, it has
to start within the police

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.250
department, right?

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.462
It can't be the lawyers.

00:57:42.462 --> 00:57:43.920
It can't be the
district attorneys.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.870
It has to be the
police department

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.950
to go past that
blue line of silence

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:53.640
and start telling the
other police officers,

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.250
I'm not going to testify on
your behalf, you were wrong,

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.458
you shouldn't have done that.

00:57:57.458 --> 00:57:59.690
And I feel like it has
to start from within.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.070
But I don't know
what to do next.

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.440
We've got a bunch of ideations.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.630
We talked about redesigning
the pullover and all

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.290
of these things,
but we're now trying

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:13.610
to figure out how to
reach other people

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:15.240
and how to use our
voices and make

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.780
this this great, big
movement that says,

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.950
it has to start from within
the police department, right?

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:26.150
I watched an episode of-- god,
I can't remember the show.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.920
Taye Diggs is in it.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.260
I can't remember the name of
it, but he shot a black guy.

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.450
They couldn't find the gun,
but his partner told him

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:39.710
the next day, I talked to the
captain, and I backed you up.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.040
And it wasn't true.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.920
And that was just an
example of what happens.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.320
Instead of them saying,
no, he was wrong

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.970
and I'm not going
to stand by him.

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:50.090
So we're trying to figure
out ways to do that.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.840
Any advice so that I can
take it to the next step

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.360
where it's not just a
meeting of people who go back

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.170
to their normal lives
and say, oh, we met,

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.670
but I don't know
what to do next.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.550
LUVVIE AJAYI: The first
question of how-- so there

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.180
is something that feels very
inaccessible about working

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.310
at Google.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:12.452
It feels like aspiration as
opposed to a reachable thing.

00:59:12.452 --> 00:59:14.910
So a lot of people don't even
know it's an option for them.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.951
Because they just think
people who work at Google

00:59:16.951 --> 00:59:18.999
happen to get like a
magic golden ticket,

00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:21.040
and they showed up, and
they're like, oh, my god,

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.831
you work at Google?

00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:25.060
It sounds like a legend,
like, oh, man, it's

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.110
like Charlie Wonka's
chocolate factory.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.310
Because I mean, this place
is a magic, like, what?

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:30.018
You have slides.

00:59:30.018 --> 00:59:31.511
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:31.511 --> 00:59:33.760
I think Google needs to do
a better job of making sure

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.360
that people understand that
they actually have a chance

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.776
to work at Google,
and they're not

00:59:37.776 --> 00:59:41.622
just like engineers
who get coding things,

00:59:41.622 --> 00:59:43.330
and they're like, oh,
you can be a coder.

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.075
You actually have people
do social things at Google.

00:59:46.075 --> 00:59:48.450
I think Google needs to actually
make it more accessible.

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:51.900
So whether you have people going
to more colleges who are like,

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.820
yo, you don't have to
be hyper-geek engineer

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.600
to work at Google.

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.280
You can actually apply for
like the events coordinator

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.360
job or the admin assistant job.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.450
Or if you are in STEM, you can
apply for a job in strategy,

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.460
in coding.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.630
So I'm not sure what
outreach you guys are doing,

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:11.880
but you might want to do that.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.090
I know y'all don't throw a
post on Indeed or LinkedIn,

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:16.350
but that might help.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.050
It actually would help if people
knew that they could get a job

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.630
at Google and it wasn't some
like pie-in-the-sky thing.

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:23.956
AUDIENCE: Permission to apply.

01:00:23.956 --> 01:00:25.830
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We
are doing a lot of that.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.022
I want to just give a
shout-out to the team.

01:00:28.022 --> 01:00:29.480
I actually met with
them yesterday.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.990
And we have a lot of
work to do, but there

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.630
are people at
Google-- part of it

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.730
is just making sure we are
where people are, right?

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:41.170
Like Mountain View is a
little bit like Disneyland

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.640
in a lot of ways.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.950
And we have a great,
big world out there,

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:47.570
and Google is fortunate
enough to have

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:49.380
offices in a lot of places.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.790
And we have to do a lot more
outreach, a lot more inviting,

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:53.900
a lot more welcoming.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.025
And I know that there are
teams of people at Google

01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:57.100
who are working on that.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.225
LUVVIE AJAYI: And I also
have to give Google props,

01:00:59.225 --> 01:01:00.810
because here's the thing.

01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:03.420
Like I know you're constantly
being told to do better,

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.730
because you should.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:09.060
But the fact that your
leadership is taking it on

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.660
as an actual thing,
not just because you

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.470
are getting your wigs
gnashed about it, matters.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.600
I think it's really
good to see people

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.340
at the top who are
saying like, OK,

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.390
help us figure out what to do.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:26.650
We realize we need to do better,
so we're going to do better.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.180
So I have to say props for
that, because the trickle effect

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.260
is real, right?

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.110
Because if leadership
didn't care,

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:33.300
nothing is going to change.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.950
So I just want to say props
to you for that, Bradley.

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:36.449
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
OK, on that note--

01:01:36.449 --> 01:01:37.937
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:37.937 --> 01:01:39.270
LUVVIE AJAYI: Did he just blush?

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:44.100
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So on behalf
of everyone here and Google,

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.210
thank you, not only for
coming and visiting us,

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:49.060
but the work you do every day
of putting yourself out there.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.180
It makes a difference,
and we're very grateful.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:51.510
Thank you.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.990
LUVVIE AJAYI: Thank
you for having me.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.531
It's so cool.

01:01:53.531 --> 01:01:56.480
[APPLAUSE]
