00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.680
We now know how to calculate the
Price to Earnings ratio.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.595
Let's see if we can use it to
make a judgment about whether

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:10.470
a company is cheap or expensive

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.970
relative to another company.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.400
So let's say I have Company
A and I have Company B.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.923
And for the sake of our
discussion, let's say they're

00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:18.790
in the same industry.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.660
And that's important because
Price to Earnings really is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.260
more of a relative valuation.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.590
You kind of want to compare
apples to apples.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.240
It's hard to compare one
Price to Earnings in

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240
one industry to another.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.690
We'll talk a lot in the future
about why that is, and we'll

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.200
get more into the nuance.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.930
But let's just say they're
in the same industry.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.700
Maybe they're software
companies.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.180
Maybe Company A, each share I
can buy it for, so the price

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.100
per share of Company A is $10.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.090
Price per share of
Company B is $20.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.880
So remember, just this
information alone does not

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.540
tell me that A is cheap
and B is expensive.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.120
We learned that in
our first video.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.080
And let's say that it's
2008 earnings.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.440
Company A made $1 per share.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.760
$1 of EPS.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
This is Earnings Per Share,
not total earnings.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.140
To figure out total earnings, we
would take this number and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.240
multiply by the number
of shares.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.460
And let's say Company
B made $5 per share.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.110
$5 EPS, Earnings Per Share.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.565
So what are their respective
Price to Earnings ratios?

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830
Company is 10.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.120
The price is $10, the earnings
is $1, so $10

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.240
divided by $1 is 10.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.950
Company B, the price is $20,
the earnings are $5. $20

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.830
divided by $5 is 4.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.670
So just when you look at it
superficially right here, when

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.500
you take Price to Earnings-- and
actually just as a little

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.760
aside, whenever someone says the
Price to Earnings ratio is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.060
10, or the Price to Earnings for
Company B is 4, the first

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.090
thing you should ask is, what
earnings are you using?

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.750
Are you using historical
earnings?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.850
Are you using the past
12 months earnings?

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.820
Are you using future earnings?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.920
In this case, we use last
year's earnings.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.660
We use 2008 earnings.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.600
And that's a key thing.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.605
And we'll talk about that if we
have time a little bit more

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.500
in this video.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.550
So based on 2008 earnings, the
price to 2008 earnings for

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.920
Company A is 10.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.180
The price to 2008 earnings
for Company B is 4.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.870
So for every dollar of earnings
per year, if you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.940
believe that the 2008 earnings
are indicative,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.550
you're paying $4 here.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.660
For every dollar of earnings
here, you're paying $10.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.505
So based on that, this
looks cheaper.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.040
Low Price to Earnings ratio
implies that it's cheaper.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.260
For the same earnings you're
paying a lower price.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.310
For every dollar of earnings,
you're paying $4.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.760
For every dollar of earnings
here, you're paying $10.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.660
So it looks like it's cheaper.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.060
And if everything was equal, if
these companies really were

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.470
equal, in terms of their capital
structure, in terms of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.530
how much debt they had, in terms
of their growth rate, in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.010
terms of their risk, in terms
of the markets they operate

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.160
in, in terms of who are their
customers, and how much of a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.770
competitive advantage they have.
If all of those things

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.120
were completely identical,
you would be correct.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.350
You would be correct that
Company B was cheaper.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.850
And notice that it's the
complete opposite of just the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.940
superficial price.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.630
The price here, Company
B was more.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.220
But when you look at the Price
to Earnings ratio, you say

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.430
Company B is cheaper.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.570
Now, immediately if you were
to see this is the real

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.880
market, where you see two
identical companies-- or you

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.150
think they're identical
companies-- and one is trading

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.230
at a lower multiple or a lower
Price to Earnings multiple

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.120
than the other, you should
be very suspicious.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.580
There's some chance that you're
the first person to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.570
notice this discrepancy, and
then in that case you should

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.550
go and buy Company B.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.260
And if you're into shorting
things, you could short

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.920
Company A, and you could
make a lot of money.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.190
But you should be
very suspicious.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.210
Is kind of like the classical
two economists walking down

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.900
the street.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.020
And they see a $20 bill.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.530
And one economist says,
hey, why don't I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.420
pick up the $20 bill.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.090
And he says, no you silly, how
can you be an economist?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.380
It clearly isn't a $20 bill,
because if it was, someone

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.149
else would have picked
it up before us.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.820
That markets don't allow just
free money to be sitting

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.400
around there.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.450
And if these companies were
truly identical, this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.140
discrepancy would
be free money.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.600
And the first person to see it
would start buying Company B,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.860
and the price would move up.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.220
And maybe people would short
Company A, and the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.160
price would move down.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.860
And that would happen
very quickly in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.900
today's public markets.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.340
And at some point, these Price
to Earnings ratios should be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.880
equal if-- and this is a big
if-- if these companies really

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.360
are equal in terms of their
earnings potential and the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.860
risks and their growth.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.090
But let me ask you a question.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.500
Let's say that we don't know
that they're truly equal.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.160
Why would someone be willing
to pay a Price to Earnings

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.990
ratio of 10 for Company A and
pass up, or maybe not want to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.240
buy, Company B, even though
they're paying only a Price to

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.390
Earnings ratio of 4.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.940
Why would they rather pay $10
for every $1 of earnings in

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.775
2008, as opposed to
$4 of every dollar

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:21.180
of earnings in 2008?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.080
We touched on it in
the last video.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.620
Maybe they think Company
A is a lot safer.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.730
It's closer to a bank account
that-- Company B, sure it made

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.540
$5 in earnings, but
that is risky.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.180
You don't know.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.950
Every year, maybe one year it
makes $5, and maybe the next

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.180
it loses $5.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.580
Well Company A is more steady,
so that's one reason.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.210
And the other reason is, this
was just 2008 earnings.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.830
But just one year of earnings
really don't capture what's

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.820
happening at a company.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.320
A company could do really good
one year, really bad the next.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.230
It might be shrinking.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.230
It might be growing.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.250
And this is the important
thing.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.380
There's always this temptation
in investing

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.870
to always look back.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.100
To see what happened to the
stock in the past. Or how much

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.670
did the company earn
in the past?

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.870
Or how much did it
grow in the past?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.090
But that's all irrelevant.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.990
That's already in the stock.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.630
That's already happened,
whatever money was there to be

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.030
made has already been made.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.070
You always have to be
looking forward.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.050
So we said this is
2008 earnings.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.690
But let's say 2009 earnings,
the picture looks

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.540
a little bit different.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.470
Let me draw this here.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:31.850
So let's say in 2009 EPS-- this
is A and this is B-- A is

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.610
expected to make $2 per share.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.750
And B is expected to
make $4 per share.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.180
So now if you took the Price
to Earnings ratio on 2009

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.810
earnings-- some of which is
behind us because I'm making

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.380
this video in August of 2009--
and so we know half the year.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.420
But the other part of this
number is kind of a

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.480
projection.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.480
Hopefully diligent and
intelligent people have come

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.600
up with this estimate.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.170
So oftentimes you'll see this
as a 2009 estimate EPS.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.550
This is people's best guess.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.880
But here, the Price to Earnings
for 2009 then

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.430
becomes-- let's see.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.515
If I'm paying $10 today for $2
of earnings in 2009, the Price

00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:27.430
to Earnings of 5
for Company A.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.260
Well, for Company B, it's
a Price to Earnings

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.210
20 divided by 4.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.010
It's also a 5.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.650
So notice.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.290
Now when you look at
2009 earnings,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.640
they look pretty similar.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.910
So although when you looked back
at 2008 earnings, Company

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.680
A looked expensive.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.400
Higher Price to Earnings
in Company B.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.060
But then when you look
at the current

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.180
earnings, they look similar.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.540
Now the question was, why would
someone want to pay more

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.040
for Company A?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.180
Why would they choose
Company A over this?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.450
This analysis I just said said,
oh, based on 2009 it

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.150
looks neutral.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.180
The Price to Earnings
ratio is the same.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.470
For every $1 in earnings,
you're paying $5.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.280
But notice a trend.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.250
In 2008, they made $1.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.620
Then they made $2 in 2009.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.640
And maybe there's some
estimates for 2010.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.500
Or maybe you can make
your own estimate.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.060
So maybe in 2010 people
are saying Company

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.110
A has a great product.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.720
It's growing.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.430
The market's growing.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.980
Maybe in 2010, Company A
is going to make $2.50.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.200
It's going to grow another
25% in 2010.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.680
Maybe its growth rate
slows a little bit.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.700
But it's going to continue
to grow.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.450
While Company B went from $5 of
earnings in 2008 to $4 in

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.640
2009, and maybe it shrinks
a little bit.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.480
Maybe it shrinks in half.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.690
Maybe it goes to $2 in 2010.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.950
So now if you do a Price to
Earnings on 2010 earnings-- so

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.160
this is 18 months out from
when this video is being

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.780
made-- all of a sudden, your
Price to Earnings relative to

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.550
2010 earnings is 4
for Company A.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.110
And it's 10 for Company B.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.500
So now we switched places.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.960
Now Company B looks more
expensive on 2010 earnings.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.340
And Company A looks
downright cheap.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.110
And this is an important
thing to realize.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.410
In a present period, you are
willing to pay a higher Price

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.380
to Earnings ratio if the
company is growing.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.760
And you're going to pay a lower
Price to Earnings ratio

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.520
if the company isn't growing.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.280
So growth is the other reason
why you're willing to pay a

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.560
higher Price to Earnings
ratio.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.870
A good exercise, let's say
you see a company.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.150
Sometimes someone might
look at a company.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.910
Company C is trading at $100.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:49.780
And let's say for 2009 people
expect it's going to make $1.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.620
So a lot of people immediately
will figure out the Price to

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.610
Earnings based on 2009
estimated earnings.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.690
Remember, it's always
important to

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.130
know what the E is.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.190
This is 2009 estimates.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.840
They'll say, this is 100 Price
to Earnings Ratio.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.980
That's crazy.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.860
I would never pay that.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.860
That's an expensive company.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.120
And maybe they'll even
short it there.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.600
Which can be a very foolhardy
thing to do

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.040
if you're not careful.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.510
But you might say, oh no,
don't short it just yet.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.040
Think about it.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.400
This company's growing so fast,
based on my projections

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.280
they've just really tapped
into this market.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.520
They have this intellectual
property, and no one can

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.520
compete with them.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.810
In 2010 I expect this company
to double every year.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.910
I expect them to grow
100% every year for

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.020
the next three years.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.040
And the other person
says, oh fine.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.350
OK.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.790
In 2010 if they're going
to double, they're

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.710
going to make $2.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:42.290
Well that's still a Price to
Earnings based on 2010 of--

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.980
100 divided by 2 is
50-- you're like,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.990
that's still expensive.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.000
That's still way more expensive
than most companies.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.940
The average Price to Earnings
ratio in the market right now

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.730
I believe is 17 or 18.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.910
Why would I pay 50 times
2010 earnings?

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.170
I'm really going forward.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.840
We all know if you've watched
the present value videos,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.900
money in the future, earnings
in the future are worth less

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.330
than earnings today.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.020
But you say, no but these guys
are growing so fast in 2011

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.050
they're going to make $4.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.975
Then all of a sudden the Price
to Earnings ratio is starting

00:11:13.975 --> 00:11:16.430
to look a little bit better.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.740
25.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.610
And then you could say, not only
that, but in 2012 I'm so

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.050
confident that these guys have
tapped into this huge market,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.840
they're going to make
$8 per share.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.240
They're going to keep doubling
all the way into 2012.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.430
And now all of a sudden, you're
trading at 12.5 times.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.880
And then if that growth were to
continue-- and this is an

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.330
important point-- the growth
has to continue.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.030
You can't just say, oh if
something's growing at 100%

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.960
for one year, I'm willing
to pay 100 times that.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960
Because if it grows 100% for one
year, then stops growing,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.190
there's no way that you would
want to pay 50 times earnings

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.340
for something that's not
growing in the future.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.230
But if it keeps growing at 100%
per year for 5 years,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.350
then it actually might
seem interesting.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.050
So in 2013 you'll
be making $16.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.240
And then we're looking at a 6
and change Price to Earnings,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.400
which is downright cheap.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.280
So the debate on whether you're
willing to pay-- When

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.160
you look at a Price to Earnings
ratio of 100, a lot

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.580
of people have a knee-jerk
reaction.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.020
They say, that is unbelievably
expensive.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.370
The market is crazy.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.250
Why on earth would
anyone pay $100?

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.350
And the reason that they're
paying $100, if they're not

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.480
speculators, and obviously most
people in the market are,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.080
is that they believe that this
company is growing very fast--

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.000
in this case 100% a year.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.630
And in order to justify this,
the company has to grow that

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.510
fast for many, many,
many years.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.920
So in this case maybe at least
five or six years.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.640
Then all of a sudden this
doesn't seem that crazy.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.210
For a company that's growing
100% a year for five or six

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.110
years, this is actually
a good deal.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.730
If it's growing 100% a year for
20 years, this is actually

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.010
a very good deal.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.060
Obviously a 6 Price to Earnings
of 20 times 2013

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.730
earnings isn't as good as a 6
Price to Earnings of 2010,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.710
because earnings in the future
aren't worth as much as

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.880
earnings today.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.730
And you can watch the
present value video.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.490
But give or take, 100% growth is
much larger than what most

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.430
discount rates would be.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.400
So this is a good way
to think about it.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.080
The reason why you are willing
to pay a higher Price to

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.900
Earnings is for growth, and even
more for growth that will

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.220
continue and that you think
has a very high

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.990
likelihood of occurring.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.740
And then the other reason
is you think

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.790
there's very low risk.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.730
And we touched on that in the
first video when we talked

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.170
about bank accounts.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.720
And why someone's willing to
pay a 50 Price to Earnings

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.560
essentially for a
bank account.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.110
And one last point-- and I'll
just touch on this at the end

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.590
of the video.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.660
It's a little bit
of technical.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.460
There's kind of a general rule
of thumb that if a company is

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.080
not doing anything, it's just
stable, safe, not moving up or

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.740
down, that a fair or a cheap
Price to Earnings is 10 times

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.730
this year or last year.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.890
10 times earnings.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.850
And you might wonder, where
does that come from?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.450
Why isn't it 9 times earnings
or 12 times earnings?

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.660
And that's actually a
very good question.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.110
There's actually no obvious
reason why it

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.200
isn't 9 or 11 or 12.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.080
It's just 10 because one, this
is a nice round number.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.450
And also, if you were to take
an earnings stream.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:17.510
So if you were to take a company
in 2009, 2010, 2011,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.560
2012, and just kept going, and
if it had an earnings stream.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.660
Let's say in every year
it's going to make $1.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.800
And if you were to discount
this back.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.100
And you should watch the present
value videos, if this

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.570
makes no sense to you.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.710
But if you were to present value
this-- let's say they

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.640
make $1 forever going into the
future-- and you were to

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.220
present value this using
a discount rate.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.350
So 2009 money, that's
worth $1.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.130
2010 money, you want
to discount it.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.240
So you want to divide it by,
let's say we use 11% as a

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.960
discount rate.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.040
And actually, roughly
10 or 11%.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.880
This is all a little
bit of hand waving.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.190
So the value of that dollar
would be 1 divided by 1.11.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.090
I've just added the 11% here.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.390
The value of that dollar would
be 1 divided by 1.11 squared.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.810
This dollar would be
1.11 to the third.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.100
If you were to add up the
present value of that income

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.490
stream, you're going to get
roughly $10 or 10 times the

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.490
earnings stream.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.360
So that's where it comes from.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.800
Instead of doing this present
value calculation for

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.190
everything, and there's so much
error involved anyway, in

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.560
terms of just estimating
earnings, people just give a

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.480
rule of thumb.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.370
But obviously if interest
rates go down, then this

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.480
number will go down, and you
might be able to justify a

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.900
higher Price to Earnings,
but I don't want to

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.850
go there just yet.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.100
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
