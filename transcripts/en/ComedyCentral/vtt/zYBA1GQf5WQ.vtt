(Amy)
A lot of people have been
telling me

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.274
I look
like Jennifer Lawrence.

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.709
I don't see that.

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.277
Well, I know I'm taller
than her.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:14.114
I'm not crazy.

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.516
Jim, what's your problem?

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.717
I just don't
understand why you guys

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:17.951
would take me here.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.119
Because you
love hot wings.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.621
What are you talking
about right now?

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.989
I do,
they're fine,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.223
it's just a guy doesn't want
to come to O'Nutters

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.591
right
after a breakup.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.059
Why?

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.261
'Cause there are a couple
of good-looking waiters here?

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.662
Hey ladies,
how we doing?

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.863
Hey.
Hey.

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.866
All right,
hey, excuse me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.801
My nuts are
down here.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:39.806
( laughing )

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.575
Hey, I'm Amber, welcome
to O'Nutters.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.843
Thanks.
Thank you.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.746
So who's
been here before?

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.047
All right, so can I
start anybody off

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.116
with a
little pinot greej?

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:50.284
I'll have one.
Yeah, me too.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.685
Can I
have a beer?

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.353
Uh, sorry, broham,
no beer,

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.589
but we do have skinny girl
white zin spritzers

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.858
and if you'd
like, I can 86 the
parasol,

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.726
throw in a lemon chunk
for you.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.161
I'll just
have a pinot.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.732
All right, three pinots
for my three pinoteers.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.235
Hey, um.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:09.703
Normally, I wouldn't risk
getting in trouble,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.072
but you guys
seem super cool.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.241
If I were you, I'd go
for the pitcher,

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.776
save you
a few bucks.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.177
Right.
Great tip, thank you.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.545
Let's do it.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.914
You got
it, no problem.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.549
I'm being serious
right now.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.585
You guys
are models, right?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.886
What?
Stop.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.187
Oh my God!

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.923
We all
work at Payless.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.625
Oh my God, that's my
favorite shoe store.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.093
Get out.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.963
But you guys should quit
and become models.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.297
I'll be right back
with those pinots, guys.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.199
Thank you.
You got it.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.901
Oh my God.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.603
That was so cool, he told us
about the pitcher deal.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.104
He did not
have to do that.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.272
I should get his number
and have him go out with us

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.274
when he gets
off work.
Oh my God.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:48.876
Wake up.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:50.110
He's just trying to get
a bigger tip.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.678
Jim, okay,

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.180
I know that you're still bummed
about Karen,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.115
but please, don't
just dump your negativity on us.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.783
At work it's one thing,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.819
you know, all the shoes are
around, the people,

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.923
but here, on our
time, please get it together.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.291
We have one hour
for lunch,

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.228
we're here
to have a great time, okay?

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:10.097
Listen, I don't mean to
eavesdrop on you, brosef,

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.832
but you don't want
to end up

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.068
like
Rupert over there.

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:16.270
( glass smashing )

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:17.771
Yeah, after his wife
left him,

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.273
he went into
a real deep depression.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.208
Got pretty bad.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.609
He forgot how
to live.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.077
So sad.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.546
Don't let that happen
to you, man, okay?

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.780
Thank you.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.081
Yeah.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.817
Hey, give
me some nuts.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:31.985
What?

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.788
Give him
some nuts, Jim.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.090
Go on, Jim.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.192
There you go.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.860
A little of this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.595
and a little of that
and you return the favor.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:42.796
Touch 'em.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:43.964
Yeah, see?

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.165
There you go, huh--
Fun?

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.800
So cute.
Yeah.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.302
It feels good, Jim--
It's fun, right?

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.137
What did
I just do?

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.271
It's good.
Go with it, Jim, don't
ruin this.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.573
You know what,
guys?

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.808
I think I have
got just the cure

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.343
for senor sad sack
over here.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.744
The check?

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.213
( whistling )

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.215
Wet nut contest!

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.184
( cheering )

00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:08.055
Go, go, go!

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.058
Woo!

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:18.131
♪

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.558
Jim, get up!

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.260
Get up!
