00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.100
 From feet and urine to servitude and other lifeless objects such as leather, 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.800
 Have people all kinds of interesting sexual desires and magic. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.600
 But is it normalized by non-living objects or non-genital body parts? 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.800
 Within the brain, which you find sexy is a combination of cognitive, emotional and physical processes. 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.100
 Of course, the private aspect of sexual behavior has made the study of magic challenging. 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.200
 To overcome this barrier, 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.200
 has used a study of online Yahoo groups to estimate the relative frequency of atypical sexual preferences. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.300
 Evaluating 5000 internet users, 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 researchers have discovered that the greatest number of flavors was not just body parts, 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 but from objects related to body parts such as shoes or earphones. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
 Popular groups include body fluids and body size 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 but the most popular group was by far the feet and the toes. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.800
 This is because there is actually a neurological basis for foot desires. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 Looking at this visual map showing which areas and proportions of the brain are dedicated to the processing of sensory functions, 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.500
 we see the feet, toes and genitals 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.600
 everyone is physically right next to each other in the brain. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.700
 One study was able to eliminate this link between 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.400
 sexual desires and brain regions with the man experiencing epileptic seizures as well as a fetish for hook pins. 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.200
 After receiving a partial temporal lobectomy, or removing part of his brain, 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.900
 stopped both his attacks and sexual fixation on hooks. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 Sexual fantasies are likely to develop during early experiences cedar, when more synapses and neurogenesis occur in your brain. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 Sexual imprinting is the process in which we and other animals 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 learn about the characteristics of desired breeders at a young age, 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.200
 often influenced by those who raised us. 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.509
 One study found that adopted girls prefer men with a significant resemblance to facial features of their adopted fathers. 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.400
 Women who report having a more supportive, emotional relationship with their fathers, 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.500
 was also more likely to choose men with similar characteristics to those who had negative relationships with their fathers. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.800
 But with sexual sorrows, this sexual imprint can also be with objects. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.020
 A study with two groups of sexually naive laboratory rats carried one group a small Velcro jacket during their first sexual experience 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.100
 while the other group, the governing body, wore nothing. 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.100
 When sexually mature, the control group showed a normal copulation behavior, regardless of whether the jacket was worn or not. 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.700
 while the jacket group was unable to achieve sexual arousal without their jackets. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
 The same study was done with other objects and found similar results. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.400
 This can explain why a person with learning fetish struggles to experience pleasure without. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 In a separate study on rats, a group of male rat infants on bedding was flavored with lemon. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080
 and letting the other group lie on unleavened bedding. 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.612
 For their first sexual experience, 

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.000
 they had the option of two sexually receptive females, 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.989
 one flavored with lemon and one without flavor. 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.500
 The control group paired with both females at a normal frequency 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 while the lemon learned group of lemon preferred fragrant females. 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.199
 But these particular desires or preferences can be blocked by a naloxone that blocks endorphins, or the feeling-good neurosender, to bind to the opioid receptors in the brain, 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.500
 thus blocking the sexual reward that the velcro jacket or the smell of lemons writes. 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.460
 Although we know a lot about rat sexual magic, there is not much research on scarce sexual preferences in humans. 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.399
 In the past, they were often listed as mental illnesses. 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:07.170
 But while your specific sexual desires and sexual magic can be unique to you and your experience, 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.800
 proving modern science to have one in the first place is a normal part of man. 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 And if it doesn't harm you or anyone else, they can exist as part of a healthy sex life. 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.200

 You can use the links in the description to get the shirt in various designs or even to get it as a cup. 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.650
 Get it before it is cedar there is a limited amount.
