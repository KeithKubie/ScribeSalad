is perfect since it enables the app to
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.140
is perfect since it enables the app to
be downloaded faster it does not need to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
be downloaded faster it does not need to
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.929
be downloaded faster it does not need to
be updated as often and it makes the app

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
be updated as often and it makes the app
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.899
be updated as often and it makes the app
have a smaller execution footprint for

little benefit as that will include 98%
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859
little benefit as that will include 98%
of the Android devices out there that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
of the Android devices out there that
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229
of the Android devices out there that
means that you can rest assured that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
means that you can rest assured that

little devices out there may not use it
 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.849
little devices out there may not use it
but most of them will and that brings us

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859
but most of them will and that brings us
 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.190
but most of them will and that brings us
over to the features of the API so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
over to the features of the API so
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199
over to the features of the API so
pretty much everything you need to do to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209
pretty much everything you need to do to
 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.059
pretty much everything you need to do to
create a great Google Drive app is

a file picker user interface and you

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359
a file picker user interface and you
 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.170
a file picker user interface and you
have transparent offline syncing so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
have transparent offline syncing so
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000
have transparent offline syncing so
let's talk about there's a transparent

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
let's talk about there's a transparent
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.729
let's talk about there's a transparent

aware an Android device is local storage

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
aware an Android device is local storage
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.740
aware an Android device is local storage
but Google Drive storage resides in the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
but Google Drive storage resides in the
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.289
but Google Drive storage resides in the
cloud now one little peculiar thing

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299
cloud now one little peculiar thing
 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.569
cloud now one little peculiar thing
about mobile devices is that you can

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579
about mobile devices is that you can
 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.479

never trust network connectivity

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
never trust network connectivity
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.899
never trust network connectivity
it changes Network all the time and it

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
it changes Network all the time and it
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.509
it changes Network all the time and it
is very often so that it has no network

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519
is very often so that it has no network
 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.990
is very often so that it has no network
access at all this makes storing things

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
access at all this makes storing things
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.750
access at all this makes storing things
in the cloud difficult but not with the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
in the cloud difficult but not with the
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.179
in the cloud difficult but not with the
Google Drive API because the Google

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189
Google Drive API because the Google
 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.520
Google Drive API because the Google
Drive Android API will make sure that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
Drive Android API will make sure that
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.699

Google Drive not be possible the API
 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.080
Google Drive not be possible the API
will temporarily store data locally and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
will temporarily store data locally and
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.349
will temporarily store data locally and
later sync that to Google Drive once

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359
later sync that to Google Drive once
 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.289

you as an Android developer this is of
 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.240
you as an Android developer this is of
course great because it takes all the

feature of the Google Drive Android API

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
feature of the Google Drive Android API
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.490
feature of the Google Drive Android API
is the user interface component and in

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
is the user interface component and in
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.289
is the user interface component and in
the first release of the API there is a

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299
the first release of the API there is a
 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.629
the first release of the API there is a
folder and file navigation and selector

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639
folder and file navigation and selector
 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.819
folder and file navigation and selector
this makes it really easy to write an

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829
this makes it really easy to write an
 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.409
this makes it really easy to write an
application where the user needs to

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419
application where the user needs to
 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.899
application where the user needs to
select folders or files the only thing

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909
select folders or files the only thing
 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.089
select folders or files the only thing
you need to do is display this file

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099
you need to do is display this file
 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.939
you need to do is display this file
picker so how do you do that well first

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949
picker so how do you do that well first
 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.429
picker so how do you do that well first
of all you create an intent which opens

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439
of all you create an intent which opens
 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.789
of all you create an intent which opens
up the file activity builder then the

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799
up the file activity builder then the
 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.009
up the file activity builder then the
actual magic happens when the intent is
