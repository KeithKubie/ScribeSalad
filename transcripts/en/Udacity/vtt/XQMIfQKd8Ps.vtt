00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.037
In the previous videos,

00:00:02.037 --> 00:00:07.460
we talked about the iso performance lines and then our c curve.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.740
We've also learned about accuracy.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.290
Now we could have a straight line or

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.460
an iso performance curve that gives the best accuracy.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.180
Let's look at the following problems.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540
We don't assign this as a quiz, but

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.090
rather as a discussion that you should participate in the forum.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.980
Let the true positive rate of a classifier be p, where p is some value.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.160
What should be the slope of the line that will give isometric accuracy?
