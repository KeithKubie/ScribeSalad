00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:03.153
- [Voiceover] So we've got
this infinite series here,

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:04.986
and let's see, it looks
like a geometric series.

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:07.323
We're gonna go from this
term to the second term,

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.406
we are multiplying by negative three,

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.453
and then to go to the next
term we're gonna multiply

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:15.781
by negative three again.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.562
So it looks like we have a
common ratio of negative three.

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.909
So we could actually rewrite this series

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.492
as being equal to negative 0.5,

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:30.070
I could say times negative
three to the zero power,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.820
negative three to the zero power,

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:37.494
plus negative zero, or maybe I can just

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:41.661
keep writing this way, minus
0.5 times negative three

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:48.256
to the first power, times
negative three to the first power,

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.089
minus 0.5,

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:51.565
minus 0.5

00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.236
times negative three to the second power,

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:58.997
negative three to the second power.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:01.302
And we're just gonna keep going like that.

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:03.087
And we could just say we're
just gonna keep having

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.385
minus 0.5 times negative three to each

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.229
or to a higher and
higher and higher powers.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.653
Or we could write this in sigma notation.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.799
This is equal to the same thing,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.748
as the sum from, let's say
n equals zero to infinity,

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:19.754
we're just gonna keep
going on and on forever.

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:22.603
And it's gonna be this
first, it's gonna be,

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.337
you can kind of think the
thing we're multiplying

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:25.768
by negative three to some power,

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.268
so it's gonna be negative 0.5,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.915
actually, I'm just gonna
do that yellow color.

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:33.248
So it's gonna be

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.443
negative 0.5 times negative three,

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:43.604
negative, I'm gonna do
that blue color, so times

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.015
negative three to the nth power.

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.085
Here this is when n is
zero, here's n is one,

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:52.367
here is n is equal to two.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.531
So we've been able to rewrite
this in different ways,

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.301
but let's actually see
if we can evaluate this.

00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.936
And so we have a common
ratio of negative three.

00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:03.277
So our r here is negative three.

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:05.435
And the first thing that
you should think about is

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:08.055
well, in order for this to converge,

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:12.012
our common ratio, the
magnitude of the common ratio,

00:02:12.012 --> 00:02:14.352
or the absolute value of the common ratio

00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:17.852
needs to be less than one for convergence.

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.289
And what is the absolute
value of negative three?

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.990
Well, the absolute value of
negative three is equal to three

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.876
which is definitely not less than one.

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:32.354
So this thing will not converge.

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:34.771
This thing will not converge.

00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:38.304
And even if you look at
this, it makes sense,

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:40.548
'cause the magnitudes
of each of these terms

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.314
are getting larger and larger and larger.

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:44.305
We're flipping between
adding and subtracting.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.521
But we're adding and
subtracting larger and larger

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.636
and larger and larger and larger values.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.821
Intuitively, when things
converge you're kind of,

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:55.960
each successive term tends
to get diminishingly small

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.481
or maybe it cancels out in some type

00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.987
of an interesting way.

00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:03.154
But because the absolute
value of the common ratio is

00:03:04.738 --> 00:03:07.815
greater than or equal to
one in this situation,

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:11.232
this is not going to converge to a value.
