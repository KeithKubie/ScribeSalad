00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.110
Hi everyone, my
name's Greg Hartrell.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm the lead product manager
for Google Play Games.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.210
Thanks for attending
this session today.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.830
When I started putting
this session together,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.190
I realized I had
the great privilege

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.560
of seeing a lot of
people make games,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.280
really fantastic
experiences, and watching

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.645
the joy it brings people.

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.970
And I went back, and I looked
at what people are doing today

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.130
in terms of playing games.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.640
And I came up with
a few portraits

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.740
of what I see happening today.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.660
The first is, by and
large, mobile games, still

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.310
very much a single player
experience-- the portrait

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.520
of kids sitting on the
couch staring into a screen.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.380
And when I see that, I think
whatever that kid's playing,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.380
they're never going to
remember that moment.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.780
And that's weird for me because
when I grew, when I was a kid,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.250
I remember playing games
with others, with family,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.760
with friends.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.930
And so that's something
that I considered bizarre.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.370
The console industry, we
created another persona.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.660
The original promise of consoles
was we take the arcades of old.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.534
We bring them into
the living room.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:24.950
People would play
together, and it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.680
was going to be
fantastic experience.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.860
But what you also
observe is still

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.800
this kind of picture of a
guy sitting in a basement

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.240
staring at a screen.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.910
And if we put a headset on this
guy, we'd call it, to be fair,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.600
we call it social.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.040
And if you were to put
a headset on and start

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.930
playing with these
types of players,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.790
your mileage will vary.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.290
If you're like my
experience, you

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.050
may run into a 13-year-old
yelling at you,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
something about your mother.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.990
And then there was
a brief area that we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530
were very excited about
with social games.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.640
And we don't see a
lot of these games

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.500
in their original incarnation.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.600
Because I guess sending
palette knives to your friends

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.970
wasn't a thing.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.280
But games decided to
move away from that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.910
and tried to pursue deeper
social interactions.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.050
And see, this is the deal.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.320
Games, they have so much more
potential than this, right?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.500
If you think about
the experiences

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.570
you had when you were younger
or the positive moments

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.840
that you've had in
playing games with others,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.100
you know that they
are capable of this.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.080
And there's evidence if you look
around in the physical world,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.621
as well as in the
video game world.

00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.640
So I started pulling up quotes.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.500
Quoting Greek philosophers
immediately gives you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.165
street cred, so I
recommend it for everybody.

00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:49.540
But if you look
at Plato, Plato's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.831
saying something profound here.

00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:52.752
He says if you
play with somebody,

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:54.210
you can learn a
lot more about them

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.310
than perhaps any
other interaction

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.176
than you can conceive of.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:00.550
If you want to
get more academic,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.040
you can quote a guy
like Johan Huizinga, who

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090
wrote a book called "Homo
Ludens," which is Latin for man

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.970
at play, kind of a seminal
book in game studies.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.220
And his premise is this.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.510
Games aren't merely a pastime.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.150
They connect us in a way
that defines our personas,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.700
defines the way our communities
form, our cultural norms,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700
and even the way that
nation states form,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.460
if you want to get
very profound about it.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.160
And we're surrounded,
too, and attracted

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.750
by games and the ability
to play games with others.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.100
And in that sense,
all play has meaning.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.540
And so what these quotes really
told me was is like, look.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.310
Games are really
just fundamentally

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.840
this thing that we do,
this fundamental behavior

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.510
of being human.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.051
We create relationships
through them.

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:47.640
We express ourselves
through them.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.937
We come together through them.

00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:51.520
And if you look
closer, there's really

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.110
good examples in
the physical world

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.550
where games teach
us and connect us

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.960
in unique and interesting ways.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.230
So I looked at
retirement communities.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.740
For the record,
retirement looks awesome.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.370
I'm reconsidering
this whole work thing

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.578
and skipping to that step.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.078
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.655
They're constantly
playing games.

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:09.730
It's card games.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.580
It's board games.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.630
It's shuffle board.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.440
It's bocce ball.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.480
You name it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.410
You can find them playing it.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.950
And you could
easily dismiss this

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.730
as they're just finding
a way to pass away time.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.760
But it's more than that.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.430
What they're doing
is is that they're

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.530
finding a way to
connect with each other.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.940
Sometimes, they don't
even know who they are.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.560
It's a way for
people who just are

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.240
complete strangers to
suddenly find a common bond,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.710
get acquainted with each other.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.385
This is a screenshot here of,
or a picture I should say,

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:45.755
of something called the Wall
Street Freeze Tag event.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:48.200
It's been like 9 or
10 years running.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.245
The people who live in
the neighborhood that

00:04:50.245 --> 00:04:52.690
is Wall Street in New
York, they get together,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.400
and they go outside, and
they have a freeze tag game.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.980
And if you've been in the
Northeastern United States,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.530
you know that in the winter
it gets kind of cold.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.130
And so here's an example of
games that bring together

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.970
groups of people to do
seemingly inane things,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.330
and somehow has the power
of drawing them together.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.610
The MIT annual mystery hunt
is a little bit legendary.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.860
It's been running since 1981.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.004
It attracts about 2,000 students
annually across 150 teams.

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:29.420
And what they do is they have
these puzzles that give them

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.880
clues that come in sequence
that allow them to discover

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.960
a coin that's hidden
around campus.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.160
And your reward for
solving all the puzzles

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.290
and finding the coin
is you get to write

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.910
the puzzles for the
next year's team.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.890
And that's it.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.470
And what I love
about this chart is

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.870
it just shows like the
intensity, the velocity of all

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.660
these people wanting to pursue
and accomplish those goals

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.216
and to try to attain something
that can be proud of.

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.260
And I have to bring
up the World Cup.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.585
If you haven't been inside of
a stadium with 100,000 people,

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.710
I promise you it's the most
exhilarating experience

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.860
you've ever had.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.940
And it's not just because
you're watching and rooting

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.380
for your team.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380
Hopefully, your team.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.880
won.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.915
If your team didn't
win, then I refer you

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:19.190
to the retirement slide, Italy.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.327
But the idea here
is that you're not

00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:22.660
just there to root for the team.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.750
You get drawn in to the
fact that there's so

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.730
many people of a
like mind, bringing

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.520
this community of people
together in a common bond.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.900
And so all of these experiences
really just boil down to this.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.960
At their best, games
bring us together.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.800
And video games, to be fair,
have been good at this.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.790
We can find moments
in video game history

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.360
where we're brought
together through

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.550
meaningful interactions.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.210
There's arcades of old.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.770
There's the modern equivalent of
barcades, where a genius said,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.735
if I combine alcohol with
arcades, I'll have a business.

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:00.610
And then there's the
living room multiplayer.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.320
We remember games like
"GoldenEye" and current games

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.910
like, let's say, "Mario Cart."

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.570
And they have the
intent and the ability

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.940
to bring people together
in a very small ways.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.830
And of course, MMORPGs, which
when you play some of these,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.010
you sometimes wonder, hey.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.301
I'm just really in a chat room.

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.160
And there's this game thing
I do on the side, sometimes.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.730
And so if we accept
the idea that games

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.610
are better when we're
playing together,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.610
the question is is can the
environment we currently have

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.530
change.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.470
Do we have the conditions
necessary to relive and create

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.260
all of those
experiences that I just

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.050
showed in the physical world?

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.050
And to me, I think
the answer is yes.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.670
Because Android and
Google Play represent

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.790
one of the greatest
opportunities for us

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.610
to reach people
through our games.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.910
So I want you to consider this.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.150
Yesterday, you
heard that there's

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.540
one billion active
Android users.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.360
That's not total.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.260
That's 30 day actives.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.140
That's a lot of people.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.810
And three in four of those
users are playing games.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.010
When you do the table
napkin math on that,

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.400
that might be the largest
group of people playing games

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.960
on any platform ever created.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.860
What we also talked about
was Google Play Games

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.820
growing at a tremendous clip.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.800
This is our game network
for Android iOS and the web.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.540
And we announced yesterday that
we added 100 million new users

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.940
in the past six months.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.060
That makes this game network
the fastest growing mobile game

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.480
network ever.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.669
With an ecosystem this
large, though, you

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:32.210
need something like
Play Games that's

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.450
going to connect
these users together.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.169
And I'll take a moment to
thank the developers that

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.809
have gotten us to this point
by integrating Play Games

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.720
and bringing people together
through the games services

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.880
that we offer.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.220
We're seeing great results
from titles implementing

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.600
achievements, leader
boards, cross screen cloud

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.035
saves, and social features,
like multiplayer and game gifts.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.410
And we'll talk about some of
the new services in a moment

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.920
and how they do play into that.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.050
So those stats are impressive.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.209
And game services
are showing promise

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:08.000
for a lot of the games
that integrate them.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.950
But what this really
means is this.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.750
You have so many
people playing games

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.950
with these devices that are
ubiquitous in your pocket,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.000
capable of playing, reaching
incredible experiences

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.140
and entertainment.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.520
And you have cloud services
that get you global reach.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.660
This is the time for us to
make games social again.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.060
We believe that games at their
best bring people together.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.345
And the conditions and
opportunity to do so

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:37.710
are right now.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.830
Now that's an easy
call to action to say.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.930
But you have to
consider, OK, well,

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.319
there's nothing magical
about a platform

00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:45.360
and the number of people.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.510
There has to be a reason.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.232
There has to be kind of
a system in which the way

00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:50.030
you think about it.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.010
So I realize that one
way to look at this

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.500
is you can dissect the way that
all of these games kind of take

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.030
design approaches for reaching
people and bringing them

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.890
together.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.180
And they do so roughly
in these three buckets.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.630
The first is creating
new relationships.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.810
We help people directly
engage each other in games.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.250
And we bring groups of people
and this nucleus of people

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.670
together to play together.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.150
We also help people express
themselves through games.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.825
We feel good when we
become competent at a task

00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:23.280
or when we're achieving
certain goals.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.770
And we want to represent
that self to others.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.050
And the last is we can
build a sense of belonging.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.910
So many people find
better motivation

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.410
through passive forms
of social interaction.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.200
And games help people
identify with and get accepted

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.060
by a community of
people of like mind.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.920
So I want to step
through each of these

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.970
and talk about some
stories of where

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.430
I think we've been effective
at this in the industry

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.840
and talk about how Play
Games helps you get there.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.580
So I'll go back to board
games because I mentioned them

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.000
earlier, and more specifically,
the board game groups

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.427
that you see today.

00:10:55.427 --> 00:10:58.010
I think many people will think
of the heyday of the golden age

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.450
of board games, the Monopolies,
the Scrabbles, or maybe

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.720
later, the Settlers of
Catan, or in my household,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.390
I guess it would be Candy Land.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.106
Queen Frostine is a big deal.

00:11:09.106 --> 00:11:13.630
But the idea here is that
video games had an intent

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.990
to capture the spotlight.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.740
And when you dig
a little deeper,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.330
you realize that there's tons
of these board games groups

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.030
that are out there
that are thriving.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.639
This is a screen
shot from meetup.com.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.805
This group here that brings
together all these board

00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:30.030
game groups has 308,000
members in 42 countries.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.840
That's a lot of people.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.850
And when you look at the
things that people say

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.808
and kind of the group
names that are out there,

00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:37.740
you're seeing friends
and family playing.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.140
But you're also seeing complete
strangers coming together

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.930
through this medium.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.620
Even this one actual group
name that I pulled out

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.510
says extremely shy,
looking for friends.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.440
If you're consider
to be an introvert,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.360
this would be an incredibly--
an open invitation to just start

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.650
playing with others and
being an ice breaker for you.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.934
But board games don't just do
this because of just groups.

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:03.600
Games are effective
at this because what

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.360
they do is they're in the
business of simulating

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.675
social bonds.

00:12:07.675 --> 00:12:10.530
And what I mean
by this is that we

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.906
remove the risks, so
competition and cooperation

00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:16.780
in an environment where
it's safe to be wrong

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.720
or just to fail.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.210
For example, we can create
low risk competition and trade

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.540
offs between people who
don't even know each other.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.610
Or if you and I are
playing a strategy game,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.550
there's a reason for us to
collaborate, perhaps form

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.130
an alliance.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.120
And that's a way to
kind of break the ice

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.470
and have two people
who don't necessarily

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.130
know each other start
to build a relationship.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.760
And the best part
is if you're really

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.272
great this, the experience is
a little different every time.

00:12:44.272 --> 00:12:49.380
And that brings you back and
encourages you to keep playing.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.880
A phenomenon that's
going on right

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.510
now is this phrase
called phygital.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.010
If you haven't
figured this one out,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.480
it's physical meets
digital board games.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.200
And what's really interesting
about these is these

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.630
are basically
hybrid board games.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.150
They take a physical board.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.720
But what they do is they
have gameplay assistance

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.300
through mobile devices.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.180
The screenshots that you see
up here for an upcoming game.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.080
I think it was a Kickstarter
project called [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.790
What they do here
is really clever.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.110
Board games, particularly
the ones with miniatures,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.430
can have very complicated rules.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.130
You might spend two or three
hours just teaching somebody

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.630
how to play.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.160
And by then, everybody's bored.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.510
But what's great is the
tablet acts as the referee.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.630
It knows all the rules.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.910
It knows how to take turns.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.429
It directs and guides
what people will do next.

00:13:39.429 --> 00:13:40.970
There's a little
bit of a renaissance

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.010
here going on in the way
that the physical world

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:44.934
meets the digital.

00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:47.350
And when I read what players
are saying about these games,

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.760
it's very encouraging.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.571
I hear quotes like I
can focus on my friends

00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:52.445
and not on the board.

00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:54.250
Or there was another
memorable one.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.525
The guy's saying like, hey,
I can see my girlfriend

00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:58.250
and I playing this
every night, and which

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.080
is a testament to how accessible
a complicated game can

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.060
be for a larger audience.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.790
And so this hybrid experience
creates that nucleus,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.360
the small nucleus of players.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.290
And it's a great example
of how games will continue

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.580
to bring groups of
people together.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.830
I want to go back
to arcades, as well.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.110
The original arcades--
I guess I'm old enough

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.750
now to kind of
reminisce about this--

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.945
is that in North America,
particularly, they

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:27.890
were cultural hangout of sorts.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.140
Friends and strangers
would engage in games.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.180
It was a relatively
simple way for people

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.300
to hangout and all ages have
fun and without spending

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.650
too much money.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.580
And I'll tell you a
personal story of mine.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.430
It was in an arcade.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.350
I was eight years old.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.880
I played a game
called "Duck Hunt."

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.140
And for those of you who
remember "Duck Hunt,"

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.070
it was a light game.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.180
You shot cartoon ducks.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.350
No ducks were harmed in the
making of that game, I'm sure.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.670
And yes, games were
violent back then, too.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.920
And I was particularly
good at this game.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.070
I popped in one quarter,
and I just kept playing.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.770
And I wasn't losing.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.490
I just kept knocking
them all down

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.170
and incrementing every level.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.201
And I got to a point where I'm
like, I'm at like level 92.

00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:06.700
I wonder if it will
go to level 100.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.850
And I just kept playing,
playing, playing, playing.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.055
And I got to level 99,
passed it, expecting

00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:13.550
it to get to level 100.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.780
And to my dismay, they didn't
think there was a level 100.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.750
It actually just
stayed at level 99.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.690
The guy didn't code it
to have a third digit.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.495
And so I gave up.

00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:26.480
I handed the light gun to a
guy who was sitting or standing

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.320
next to me, rather.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.419
And I turned around.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:29.960
And as an eight-year-old
kid, there's

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.235
a group of 40 people
who had been watching

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:35.230
me the entire time, [LAUGHTER]
this kid that's just cleaning

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.080
up "Duck Hunt," like
it's nobody's business.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.715
And for an eight-year-old
kid getting high fives

00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:43.810
from random strangers,
right, and getting cheers,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.590
that's a really cool moment.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.170
Right?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.700
And that was impossible
without the way

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.742
that arcades are set up,
because you have friends

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.783
and your have strangers
who are playing together.

00:15:52.783 --> 00:15:53.960
You're kind of co-located.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.990
The pattern is there's
this nucleus of people

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.900
who love playing games,
and you have the freedom

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.420
to connect with people in
that type of environment.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.440
You can meet anybody as long
as you have similar interests.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.830
And you make friends in return,
and experiences that, well, you

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.870
can apparently tell everybody
for the rest of your life.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.400
A game that I think is
particularly good at this,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.710
simulating that pattern,
is one called "Ingress."

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.510
This is made by Niantic Labs.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.490
It's a science
fiction theme game,

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.880
massively multiplayer game,
using location and augmented

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.495
reality.

00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:29.620
That's a lot of buzz words.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.270
Basically, you choose a
faction, the Enlightened

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.640
and the Resistance, and you
try to capture these portals

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.990
by visiting them
with your device

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.220
and visiting these points of
interest, which are basically

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.070
landmarks in the real world.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.500
And as a team captures
a set of portals,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.810
which you can see by
these different dots,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.230
you create more surface
area and connect them

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.480
for what your faction controls.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.700
You can see here
on the screen shot.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.080
The green team's got this
amount of surface area covered.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.950
Now, one day they zoomed
out 100x and the saw this.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.140
The green team has this really
bizarre and massive surface

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.180
area.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.710
This is covering virtually the
entire state of California.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.710
But the bizarre part is in
the Northeast corner there,

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.920
that triangle, that's in
the middle of the desert.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.500
There's no cell
signal out there.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.630
How do you capture something
like a point of interest

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.640
without a cell signal?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.980
So the opposing
faction rightfully

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.849
complained and said, look.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:32.390
There's no way that
anybody did this.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.490
They must be hacking it.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.970
So the Niantic Labs
team investigated this.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.890
And it turns out it
was actually real.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.670
What happened was is that
those people from that faction

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.730
decided to rent a portable
cell tower-- [LAUGHTER] dead

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.580
serious.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.350
They spend a few
thousand dollars.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.590
They drove it all the way
out into the Nevada desert.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.880
They set it up,
popped open the game,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.440
captured whatever the point
of interest was out there.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.870
And this is the
part that I love.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.500
They took the cell tower down,
so now nobody can go back there

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.290
and recapture the portal.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.440
That was really clever.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.550
And so I use this story
because "Ingress" demonstrates

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.627
like how-- what
they're doing, really,

00:18:11.627 --> 00:18:13.960
is that this is a set of
people who are friends or maybe

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.640
people who are just
brought together

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.220
in this simulated social
bond using video games in all

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.210
of these ways that
I described earlier.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.540
And it's encouraging to
see that alive and well.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.090
So let me take a step and
talk about relationships

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.520
and what Play Games does
to help us build those.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.830
If you remember the
'90s like I do you,

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:41.990
you remember really bad dance
music, feel-good group sitcoms,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.900
and game called "NBA Jam."

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.260
And if you've played it on
mobile-- and you should--

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.150
you'll remember
that you missed it.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.430
It uses the Play Games
multiplayer system

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.240
to connect users and
friends in real-time play

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.139
with all of the
excitement of the arcade.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.930
What they take advantage
of, though, that's

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.960
really great is something
we call auto matching.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.920
And auto matching accesses
the hidden social graph

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.820
of your game.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.627
These are people who
are playing right now.

00:19:08.627 --> 00:19:10.710
So that way, there's always
somebody to play with.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.780
So it really has that
pattern of creating

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.600
the nucleus of players
that are always there.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.500
And so whether it's
strangers or friends,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.010
it's a wildly fun experience.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.570
Our multiplayer system
accesses your social graph.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.880
We rank and sort it based
on active players or players

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.670
you've played with recently.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.120
It comes in real-time and
turn-based multiplayer forms,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.750
and we handle the
notifications and turns for you

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.280
and handle all the hard problems
like punching through NATs

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.904
and creating peer-to-peer
sessions when

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:43.810
it comes to real-time play.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.640
If you're interested
in a very good example

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.220
of a turn-based
multiplayer game,

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.107
it's "1941 Frozen
Front" by HandyGames.

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:53.690
I recommend you try
it out, especially

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.160
if you like strategy games.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.860
And quick, I mention here too,
is for turn-based multiplayer,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.990
we're adding it to our Play
Games C++ SDK which will be

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.080
supported by [INAUDIBLE],
which will make it even easier

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.160
for you to implement multiplayer
in your title if you're still

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.500
making games in native code.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.600
Another game I'll
point out is "Quizup."

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.150
"Quizup" takes great
advantage of our achievements

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.470
in leader boards.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.140
The game encourages you
to answer trivia questions

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.350
with strangers and friends.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.910
And leader boards,
for those of you

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.150
who are a longtime
game designers,

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.440
tried and true way of
fostering competitions

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.450
by extending your game play.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.867
And people try to beat
each other's best scores.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.700
What's great about our
social leader boards,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.470
though, is I'm never
going to be number

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.060
one in the "Quizup"
worldwide leader board.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.592
But I can apparently be number
three amongst my friends.

00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:47.300
And if I'm really
excited about the game,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.630
I'll invite them along, so
I try to get the number one.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.870
Another service that we launched
recently was Game Gifts.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.940
This is "Eternity Warriors 3"
by Glu Mobile-- MMORPG hack

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.650
and slash type of game,
really fun experience.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.640
Basically, Game
Gifts is designed

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.604
for games that want more lighter
weight social interactions.

00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:11.020
You're not going
to find everybody

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.810
who's willing to sit down and
play a real-time multiplayer

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.310
game.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.893
But you could convince
them to just do

00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:18.310
a very simple in and
out social interaction

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.560
with a high degree of reward.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.400
In this case, they use
it to send potions.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.250
They give your friends
an edge with some set

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.680
of limits each day.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.740
And sending gifts
works a lot of the ways

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.320
that multiplayer does today.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.560
You can use the
same social graph.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.420
You get your game
discovered in the process.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.370
But I'll explain the mechanics
of this in a little more depth.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.065
You can think of
it in three phases.

00:21:43.065 --> 00:21:48.326
The Game Gift service pops
open in Intent, the gift intent

00:21:48.326 --> 00:21:50.699
that players use to
choose up to eight people

00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:52.740
to send basically a blob
of data that represented

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.297
this in-game object, like
a potion or a free life.

00:21:56.297 --> 00:21:57.880
And when you send
it to friends, we'll

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.410
store it on our servers
for several days

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.430
while your friends decide
what they want to do with it.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.900
The receivers,
those friends, get

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.150
notified based on their
notification settings.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.890
If they have set you up as
a priority notification,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.140
it'll buzz the phone, and
they'll get into the game.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.020
And if it's an
unsolicited notification,

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.299
then it'll show up
silently in the shade.

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:18.590
Finally, when the receiver's
ready to consume the gift,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.120
they open it up in the Play
Games Inbox or the Play Games

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.250
App, and it will
launch your game.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.970
And as with multiplayer, if the
receiver doesn't have the game,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.860
it will redirect them
to the Play Store,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.790
so they can acquire.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.030
And so if you're in
the business of getting

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:37.970
incremental installs, this is
an acquisition pro-tip for you.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.940
I mentioned the Play Games App.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.210
This is our consumer experience
that kind of aggregates

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.150
all of this is what your
friends are playing and creates

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.540
that nucleus of
player activity that I

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.000
keep referring to
that is so effective.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.180
And like the arcade
or the common places

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.471
where people play, like
what "Ingress" does,

00:22:57.471 --> 00:22:59.970
Play Games gives you a view of
what your friends have played

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.350
recently and creates
kind of that community

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.870
feel, constantly reintroducing
you to your friends

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.470
and seeing what they're playing.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.380
So after you've long
stopped playing a game,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.310
you can keep up with what
your friends are doing,

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.370
and you can invite them again.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.230
OK, so that covers
relationships.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.552
The second part of our
model here is expression.

00:23:24.552 --> 00:23:26.260
Expression is a really
interesting thing.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.640
Games help you
motivate us because we

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.550
accomplish something.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.210
And by accomplishing
things, it kind of improves

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.290
our well being.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.380
We express ourselves
through accomplishments.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.300
We do so through mastery
and gaining confidence.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.894
And we enjoy sharing that
accomplishment with others.

00:23:42.894 --> 00:23:44.810
And there's a lot of
real science behind this.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.566
It can be boiled down
to this, but it's

00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:47.940
a well-known area
of study called

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.900
self-determination theory.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.550
I'm not going to do
self-determination theory

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.390
injustice in two minutes,
but I'll tell your story.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.620
Harry Harlow is a
professor of psychology

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.210
at the University of
Wisconsin in 1949.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.110
And he did a study with
primates or monkeys

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.430
to kind of prove what drives
and motivates people, or rather

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.834
monkeys in this specific
case, to complete tasks.

00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:16.250
And he had this
interesting set-up

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.710
where he took two monkeys, and
he put their living space-- OK,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.250
they were cages-- and he put
a puzzle inside of the cages.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.330
And he noticed a couple things.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.630
One is that he would reset
the puzzle every day.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.935
And each monkey would
go and take the puzzle

00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:33.157
and then start figuring
it out and solve it.

00:24:33.157 --> 00:24:35.490
And they would consistently
do this over and over again.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.150
And that didn't really
invalidate his experiment.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.010
It just kind of like,
oh, that's interesting

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.426
that they would
automatically just

00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:43.760
be drawn to doing
some arbitrary task.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.550
And then to set up a
variable, what he did

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.920
is he gave one monkey
a treat every time

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.680
that monkey completed
the puzzle every day.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.170
And after a time, he
took the treat away.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.380
And he noticed something
really interesting.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.070
The monkey that got the
extrinsic reward, the treat,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.730
stopped solving the
puzzle, because he

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.020
wasn't getting the treat.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.594
But the other monkey that
was left as the control

00:25:05.594 --> 00:25:07.260
continued to solve
the puzzle every day,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.190
as long as he reset it.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.070
So what was really
interesting here

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.500
is that the unrewarded
monkey found

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.850
the act of completing the
puzzle alone satisfying.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.670
Later, this was
proved with humans.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.230
There's something called the
over-justification effect.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.940
And what it shows us is that
the act and the satisfaction

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.045
of accomplishing something,
in gaining mastery,

00:25:29.045 --> 00:25:30.520
is something that
we're drawn into.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.540
And game design, really
good game design,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.580
takes advantage of this
in really deep ways.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.560
But expression goes deeper
than accomplishment.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.500
There's also the desire
to express oneself or even

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.870
escape through a persona.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.950
There's tons of
research on MMORPGs

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.300
that show how people grow
attached to their online

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.170
personas and avatars,
showing sense of identity

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.130
and relationship with the
characters that you create

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.130
and as you interact with others.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.880
So I went on to the
role-playing section

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.260
on Google Play, the
Google Play Store.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.437
And I was thinking of well-worn
fantasy in medieval titles.

00:26:07.437 --> 00:26:10.020
And it turns out there's a lot
of other ways to role-play too.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.935
So there's games like "Knights
N Squires," here, or at

00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:14.750
the bottom, "Star Girl
Beauty Queen," which

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.700
is now my personal favorite.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.890
And role-playing
is partially really

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.180
about expressing yourself
through personification.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.140
What I love about these games
is it shows like whether age

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.290
or gender, everybody
kind of gets

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.110
attracted into like the doll
house effect of these games.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.465
And it's a way
for people to kind

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:36.675
of escape from everyday life.

00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:38.300
And while I'm talking
about expression,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.310
I'll splice this one in.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.440
Sometimes you just play
games to blow off some steam.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.111
This is best demonstrated by
this Japanese table flipping

00:26:48.111 --> 00:26:48.611
game.

00:26:51.908 --> 00:26:53.670
Maybe we'll get some audio here.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:59.670
No?

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.028
Audio?

00:27:01.028 --> 00:27:02.026
Here we go.

00:27:02.026 --> 00:27:07.515
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:07.515 --> 00:27:09.511
[PING]

00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:13.004
-Rack up the points.

00:27:13.004 --> 00:27:16.996
-You see she's
beating the table,

00:27:16.996 --> 00:27:18.493
supposedly getting angry.

00:27:26.976 --> 00:27:28.971
[SIREN]

00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:29.471
-Get ready.

00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:38.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:41.350
-Why didn't you get the woman?

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.971
-Oh, you missed,
you missed the mom.

00:27:43.971 --> 00:27:45.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.342 --> 00:27:46.260
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.340
OK, so table flipping
isn't for everybody.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.270
But I think what's
important here

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.780
is that games have a variety of
ways of helping people express

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.880
themselves, either in
very personal ways,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.980
or as it were, very inane ways.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.770
Play Games has a
number of tools that

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.580
help you tap into that
sense of accomplishment,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.000
help people express
themselves to others.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.800
And we provide a platform
in which you can do it.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.560
The great thing about
achievements, for example,

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.440
is they inform your players
of the depth of your game

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.710
that otherwise you
wouldn't have discovered.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.530
When I finish playing a game
like "Hitman GO" and I've

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.210
completed all the levels,
but these achievements

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:25.920
give me hints.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.600
They're almost like a
guideline of what else

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.480
I can do in the game.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.438
And they cause me to play
the game differently.

00:28:30.438 --> 00:28:32.580
They cause me to play
it longer in an effort

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.830
to explore and complete
all the content.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.670
And in return, we've
seen game developers

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.640
see pretty significant bumps
in day over day engagement

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.380
through great
achievement design.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.510
And exposing that information
at a platform level

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.220
is a way that we draw people
back in through the Play Games

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.580
platform.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.440
Talking about Google
Play Games right now

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.570
is we now show the world
what type of player

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.490
you are through our
new game profile.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.450
The game profile is where
you earn points in a level

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.700
and vanity titles from
unlocking achievements.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.870
And so through your play,
your profile evolves.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.870
You saw this yesterday
in the keynote.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.790
The closer look
at my profile here

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.410
is you can see my
profile picture there

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.230
with my level and
the number experience

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.260
and points that I need
to get to the next level.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.860
And let's face it.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.560
Who doesn't like leveling up?

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.340
There's a breakdown
of the genres

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.660
that I play, which I found
really interesting when

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.830
this first came live.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.670
I didn't think of myself
as a puzzle game player.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.420
But it turns out when you
look at the games that I play,

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.450
that is the type of gamer I am.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.320
And if I look ahead, I
can compare my profile

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.090
to other friends.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.040
And they may be an
action game player

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.670
or they may play a
lot of music games.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.445
And that gives me an invitation
to talk to my friends

00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:49.540
and something to compare with.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.040
And as a developer, you can
go to Google Play Developer

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.800
Console today.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.040
If you have achievements, you
can edit the maximum 1,000

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.130
experience points
that you can give out

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.920
across all of your achievements.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.940
There's no update to your
game necessary to help players

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.820
engage in this
type of experience.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.427
I mentioned
comparing to friends,

00:30:07.427 --> 00:30:09.190
so this is my friend Tom.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.750
And here I can see all
the different games

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.360
that he's played in
different genres.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.860
And I can kind of
see that oh, he's

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.441
this really cool arcade player.

00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:19.190
And he loves playing
those types of games.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.720
And that's how he's gotten to
a higher level than I have.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.790
And for the more
competitive, it allows

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:29.250
you compare that progress
amongst the different genres.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.050
We also announced a new
service called Saved Games.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.990
This help you stay
connected with users

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:39.450
by storing their saved progress
visually and showing it off.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.050
The best part about this is it's
not just about storing blobs.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.230
You can store many blobs.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.500
It's powered by Drive.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.452
They're up to
three megs in size.

00:30:47.452 --> 00:30:49.160
And players will never
have to play level

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.280
one again in your game
across any screen.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.180
But what we can also
allow you to do now

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.430
is give us a screen shot or
cover image and description

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.750
and time played.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.330
And we expose those in the
Play Games experiences.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.277
And so if I go on
vacation, and I

00:31:04.277 --> 00:31:06.860
forgot that I'm playing a game
like "Leo's Fortune" at the top

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.360
there, I'll pop open my app,
and I'll be like, oh yeah,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.290
that's right.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.690
I did leave off
at a level three.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.960
And I remember loving that game.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.668
And I'm going to
continue to play it now.

00:31:15.668 --> 00:31:18.161
So it really acts as
a digital bookmark,

00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:20.210
attracting players to
come back to your game.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.240
And we think it's a neat
little retention tool.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.110
OK, and last, but
certainly not least,

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.720
I'm going to talk about
building a sense of belonging.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.170
Perhaps the best story I can
tell here is through the game

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.760
"High School Story,"
from Pixelberry Studios.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760
They're here in the
Bay Area and decided

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.770
that they'd take a strong
position on building

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.870
a feeling of belonging
through game design.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.550
This game here, "High School
Story," started with the notion

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.550
that growing up in high
school years is hard.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.226
And fitting in is a
general problem for all.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:56.600
And there's a very
powerful story

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.395
by creating a sense of
belonging here and helping

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:01.420
with the issue of cyberbullying.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.649
And this story is really best
told by their CEO, Oliver Miao.

00:32:05.649 --> 00:32:06.315
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:10.430
-We designed "High School Story"
to be about a group of misfits

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.570
who don't always fit in
at their old high school,

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.520
and they've come together to
design their dream high school.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.070
Because of our
story line, we have

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.960
a lot of players who've told
us that the game has given them

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.730
more self confidence
or the ability

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.520
to feel like they can
just be themselves.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.290
And so it's messages like that
that really have encouraged

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.990
us to continue with these
type of story lines.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.200
But we were really
shocked when we

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.990
had a message from a player
that was much more serious.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.120
We had a player reach out to
us via our in-game support.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.030
And she told us that she was
planning to kill herself.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.540
We were surprised,
shocked, and scared.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.780
We didn't know what to do.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.034
We called the suicide
prevention hotline.

00:32:53.034 --> 00:32:55.415
And based on their
advice, we urged

00:32:55.415 --> 00:32:56.930
her to get professional help.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.620
But we also let her know that
we were there to listen to her.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.910
And over time, after
exchange messages with her

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.020
for about a week, she told
us that she was finally

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.650
getting professional help and
that it was because of our game

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.090
that she was still there.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.440
That incident showed us
the power of the game

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.990
and how when players
feel connected to a game

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.870
and to a community, it
can make a real difference

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:20.975
in their lives.

00:33:20.975 --> 00:33:23.690
After that, we partnered with
the Cybersmile Foundation

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.785
to create a special
cyberbullying story

00:33:25.785 --> 00:33:29.090
line that teachers players what
to do if they or their friends

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.360
are being bullied.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.780
Players also are given
links to Cybersmile.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.980
And if they have questions,
directly from within the game,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.590
they're connected to
Cybersmile counselors.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.200
As a result, every week,
over 100 of our players

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.110
get in touch with Cybersmile.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.270
These are players who are
often being bullied, sometimes

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.060
self-hurting, or even
thinking about suicide.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.290
In fact, they shared
with us a story

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.720
about a player who
was on a rooftop,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.140
and they were able to talk
the player down, get them

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.460
in touch with their parents,
and help get their life back

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.250
on track.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.950
Those type of stories
are amazing to us.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.830
We started our game
thinking that we

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:12.632
have a great source of
entertainment for players,

00:34:12.632 --> 00:34:15.200
and if we could, we could
help build some community.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.239
But knowing that our game has
been involved in saving lives,

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.300
helping people have
self confidence,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.325
and connecting them
to their parents

00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:28.849
and their friends has been
really inspiration to us.

00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:30.610
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.130
So that's a deep topic.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.870
Not every game can
claim that they tangibly

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:39.830
help people to save
themselves from themselves.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.305
And what's really fantastic
about what Pixelberry Studios

00:34:42.305 --> 00:34:45.370
is doing is helping raise
awareness with their players

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.219
and recognizing the
damage that cyberbullying

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.080
has on people's lives.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.090
And for those
individuals, this game's

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.520
been able to give
them that sense

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.853
that there's somebody out there.

00:34:54.853 --> 00:34:57.820
It gives them that
feeling of belonging.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.250
It helped encourage them to
reach out in an environment

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.520
where they may have
otherwise not chosen to.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.960
But this isn't just
merely because they

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.130
decided to make a game
called "High School Story."

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.980
It's really because
their design goals

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.254
are the reason why they
became effective at this.

00:35:13.254 --> 00:35:14.670
And so when you
look at the things

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.200
that they took into
account and talk

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.100
to them about their
game design objectives,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.890
they take into account race
and gender and, of course,

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.830
the anti-bullying message
that you heard earlier.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.545
So players identify
with characters

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:28.430
of apparent different
ethnic backgrounds.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.670
Other players are happy
to see no restrictions

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:34.480
on dating and relationships in
the game, even between genders.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.952
And so this goal carriers
today as they update the game.

00:35:37.952 --> 00:35:39.910
To give you an idea of
what they're up to next,

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.284
they're going to
have this update

00:35:41.284 --> 00:35:45.220
to create a screen shot about
an upcoming feature where they

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.210
raise awareness of
regional and world events

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.180
and by asking players trivia
questions that indirectly

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:55.260
inform them of potentially
serious issues and things

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.950
to be in touch with.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.520
And so they're kind of
shifting away from not just

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.430
the immediate locale of
building a community,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.480
but engaging a world community.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.220
So let's talk about
Play Games and what

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.160
it means to build a
sense of belonging.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.680
We launched this feature
that we call Quests.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.600
And it's acknowledging that many
highly successful games know

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.800
how to build and engage a
vibrant community of players.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.700
And sometimes this takes the
form of a weekend challenge

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.260
to find rare objects.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.370
Or in the case of
Pixelberry, they'll

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.390
progress their
story through a set

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.980
of in-game objectives
for a period of time.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.800
But running these timed
events is actually

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.360
tricky for developers.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.530
And we thought our game
services would help.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.900
So Quests is a set
of APIs that allow

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.600
you to run these time-based
events for your players

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.740
and reward them without
needing to update your game.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:51.730
To do this, developers send us
in-game activity data whenever

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.200
a player successfully
accomplishes something

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.690
in the game, like completing
a level, killing an alien,

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.160
saving a rare black sheep.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.900
This tells Quests what's
going on in the game.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.880
And developers can
use that game activity

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.290
to create these new quests
and run these quests

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:12.549
on a regular basis as
players achieve the goals.

00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:14.090
We think it's going
to be a fantastic

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.300
tool for re-engagement
and retention.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.980
And I'll take you
through a little bit,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.130
very quickly, how it works.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.500
First, we start by using our
events API and defining events

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.140
of in-game activities inside
of the Play Developer Console.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.940
So let's say it's a
pirate game, and it's

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.770
the number of treasures
you've discovered in the game.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.970
You integrate the events in your
game and our Quests listener.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.940
And signed-in
players start sending

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.620
signals of that
in-game activity.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.220
You can then use the
Developer Console

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.880
to monitor which
activities are being used.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.370
So let's pretend for a
moment that this treasure

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:51.000
mechanic in my pirate game
is actually pretty popular

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.750
and that everybody loves
discovering hidden treasure.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.870
So I can go into the
Play Developer Console,

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.110
and I can define a quest.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.770
I can use treasures,
the events that

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.431
are being sent to me, as
the criteria for completing

00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:01.930
the quest.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:07.400
So for example, I can create a
find 50 treasures this weekend

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.170
game super secret awesome
reward for your trouble.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.140
And I publish it.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.425
And as players go through
that and accept the quest

00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:19.540
and go through that
activity in your game,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.670
we automatically
aggregate the criteria

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:27.000
that you defined in your quest
and describe to your game

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.840
when somebody has accomplished
the goal, or whether time's up

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.960
and they have it.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.840
And we'll send a
unique reward code,

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.060
so you can design your game to
reward those users every time

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.560
they complete a quest.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.500
The beauty of this design is
you can continue to run Quests

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.730
without updating your
game because it's entirely

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.230
data driven.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.130
And we're really excited
to see what's going on here

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.580
and what you will
do with Quests when

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.560
it launches in a couple weeks.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.390
And those experiences for Quests
will show up in the Play Games

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.070
App by showing
players which quests

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.230
are available for your
game and notify them

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.700
for quests that are about to
expire and call them back.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.100
While we're talking
on the topic of gender

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.980
and designing towards certain
types of demographics,

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.900
I'll mention our
game statistics.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.410
When you integrate Play
Games into your title,

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.570
you get access to player
activity engagement statistics,

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.610
just through by virtue
of having people sign in.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.070
And so we recently updated
are stats to include

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.790
demographic information.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:27.250
You can get a sense of
what the ratio of gender

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.180
is in your game, what
countries are the most active,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.040
and what age ranges
you're attracting.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.320
So if you're accomplishing
your design goals

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.060
and getting out to a
certain type of audience,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.790
this is a great
way to confirm that

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:45.110
and tune your updates
towards those players.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.600
So that brings me to
the end of this talk.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.460
And so games, at
the end of the day,

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.600
are really about creating
these positive moments.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.515
I know with your creativity
and game design savvy,

00:39:55.515 --> 00:39:59.290
Google Play Games will help
you find the means to connect

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.750
with users through these tools,
creating new relationships,

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.860
helping people
express themselves,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.330
and building belonging
between people.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.530
And this is the set
of tools I encourage

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.073
you to look at when the docs
get published in a couple weeks.

00:40:16.073 --> 00:40:18.156
Saves Games and Quests
rolls out with the next set

00:40:18.156 --> 00:40:23.780
of Play services, along
with our Play Games App.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.250
And remember this.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.620
It's almost like everybody's
playing games now.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.780
You have these
ubiquitous devices

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.530
in your pocket and
Android and Google Play

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.450
have helped create
an environment where

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.990
this as possible.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.820
At their best, games
bring us together.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.470
And mobile games can
be great at this again.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.440
So my ask to you is go forth and
make your games social again.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.682
If you want some resources
on Google Play Games,

00:40:46.682 --> 00:40:47.640
you can find them here.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.955
This Is a great time to take
a screen shot of the QRcode.

00:40:52.955 --> 00:40:54.874
And with that, I thank
you for your time.

00:40:54.874 --> 00:40:55.540
I'll be taking--

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.590
[APPLAUSE]
