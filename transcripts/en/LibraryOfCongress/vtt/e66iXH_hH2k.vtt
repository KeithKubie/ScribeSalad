00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.190
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I think
we're all looking forward

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.100
to this superstar roundtable
on congressional reform.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.650 position:56%
There's two suppositions that are
commonly discussed whether you watch

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.500
television talk shows or
read popularly about congress

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.740
and those are that congress
is dysfunctional and that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.030
that dysfunction can be solved or
remedied by congressional reform.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.740
And I think we're going to talk
about both of those suppositions

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.020
in this roundtable and
possibly challenge both of them.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.980
This panel is being
chaired by Matt Glassman

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.720
of the congressional
Research Service

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.310
and I'm going to turn
it over to him.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.610
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Thanks Colleen.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.680
I am Matt Glassman from the
congressional Research Service here

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.410
at the Library of congress
and I'm thrilled

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.950
to be moderating this panel.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.270
I am going to say a few words
to frame the discussion,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.740
but first I want to introduce
each of our panelists,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.370
even though I think for most of us
they don't need any introductions.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.300
Sitting to my direct left here
is congressman Mickey Edwards

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.860 position:56%
who served Oklahoma's fifth district
for 16 years, a former member

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880
of appropriations committee
and budget committee and also

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.650 position:56%
in the leadership as chairman of the
house republican policy committee.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.290
congressman Edwards is a founding
trustee of the Heritage Foundation

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.840
and a prolific writer and
commentator on all things congress.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.270 position:56%
Next to Congressman Edwards is David
Mayhew, Sterling Professor Emeritus

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.770
of political science
at Yale University.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.730
Professor Mayhew has written on
congress both in scholarly outlets

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.060 position:56%
and popular press for over 50 years.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.060
Most of us are familiar
with his second book,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.740
Congress the Electoral
Connection published in 1974,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.700
perhaps the foundational political
science work on how to think

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.220
about congressional action.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.560
By my account in this room there
are at least four dissertations

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.490
that were supervised by
Professor Mayhew, including mine

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.180
and that may be a lowball
count there.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.860 position:56%
Next, we have Congressman David Obey
who represented the seventh district

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.420
of Wisconsin for 42 years, one
of the longest-serving members

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.240
of the house of representatives
from 1969 to 2011.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.590
Congressman Obey was chair of
the appropriations committee both

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.480
in 1994 and again,
from 2007 until 2011.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.010
Congressman Obey has
been a participant

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.860
on numerous reorganization
efforts in congress,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.460
most notably the 94th congress
on the Obey commission.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.680
Next is Eric Schickler,
professor of political science

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.810
at the University of Berkeley.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.520
Eric's the author of Disjointed
Pluralism, Institutional Innovation

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.570
and the Development
of the US Congress,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.880
which won the [inaudible] award
and also had a huge influence on me

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.820
and certainly an entire generation
of scholars in how to think

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.940
about congressional change.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.870
And finally, we have Sarah Binder,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.360
senior fellow at the Brookings
Institute and professor

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.830
of political science at the
George Washington University.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.250
Sarah's written numerous
books on American politics,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.510 position:56%
including Stalemate Causes and
Consequences of Legislative Gridlock

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.920
and Minority Rights and
Majority Rule, Partisanship

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.730
and the Development of Congress.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.160
Sarah's also an associate editor
at the popular Money Cage blog here

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.550
in DC and she also provides
a lightning fast analysis

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.090
of all things trending
in the senate,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.430
even stuff that just happened
this week so we look forward

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.340
to hearing from her about that.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.350
We have about 75 minutes
for the panel.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.090 position:56%
I've been told to reserve the second
half of the time for questions

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.840
from the audience, we may
spend even more there,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.220
I'm sure everyone has
questions for our panel.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.690
In lieu of any sort
of opening statements

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.690
from the panelists I'm going
to say a few brief words to try

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.540 position:56%
and frame the debate and then I'm
going to pose a few questions I have

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.530
to the panel, but hopefully they
will just be sort of general nature

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.040
to get them talking and then we
can get the questions you may have

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.530
as well.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.380
So, it's become customary I would
say in the last hundred years

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.020
to introduce any discussion
of congressional reform

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.790
with reference to two signposts.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.120
First, the dismal approval
ratings of congress and second,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.070
the wisdom of Woodrow Wilson and
I am I'm going to disappoint you

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.360
on either of those counts.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.190
Congress has rarely been popular
in public opinion approval polls,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.010
but the contemporary
dissatisfaction appears

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.110
to be even greater than normal.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.380
The most recent handful
of Gallup polls finds

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.010
about 20% approval
rating for congress,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.680
which is actually considerably up
from their 2015 single digit lows

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.410
that you might be familiar with.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.890
But this is all still
solidly below their average

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.360
in the last 50 years,
considerably lower.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.250
Wilson's scathing critiques of
congress in the late 19th century

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.930
and early 20th century of
course, weren't the first

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.120
to lament the inefficiencies
of the legislature

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.540
or declare the separation

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.920
of the power system
outmoded in the modern world.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.810
But they were however
among the first

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.720
to systematically diagnose
the problem as one

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.100
that could perhaps be overcome
or at least improved upon

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.420
through purposeful
institutional change

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.520
and he certainly was not
the last to claim this.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.120
This celebrated tradition
carries on to today,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.880
in fact you don't even need to
specify what branch you're talking

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.700
about when you write a book
called the broken branch,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.060
no one thinks you mean
the court system.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.370
But at the same time,
no one writes a book

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.500
with that title unless they believe
that what's broken can be fixed

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.790
and unless they think that
what's broken is fundamental

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.440
if not primary to the system.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.690 position:56%
Of course, a key challenge of
diagnosing and reforming congress is

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.950
that no one really agrees on what
a functioning congress looks like.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.480
For some like Wilson had
a responsible party flavor

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.340 position:56%
in which a majority party can easily
enact its national program upon the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.790 position:56%
greased skids of strong leadership,
majoritarian rules and parliamentary

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.480
like discipline among
the rank-and-file.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.950
For others it's largely
the opposite,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.260
a decentralized legislature

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.230
with strong committees
bolting a policy expertise

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.200
that can thoughtfully craft
durable and successful policy

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.160 position:56%
and multiple [inaudible] points that
require the meaningful participation

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.480
and deliberation of all
members, including the minority.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.960
Still others don't even think
about it in this dimension

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.110
and when they think about
congressional form they're looking

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.480
to seek or increase the relative
power of congress outside

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.840
of the legislative arena and the
entire constitutional structure

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.570
by finding ways to augment
the political capacity,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.180
power and prestige
of the institution

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.250
against the executive branch.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.770 position:56%
And of course, all this is
complicated by the ever-present fact

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.800
that congressional reform is a
process of collective action.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.030 position:56%
And so, layered on top of any vision

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.250
of a more functional congress are
all the short-term incentives both

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.920
members and citizens have, policy
incentives, partisan incentives,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.010
and powerbase incentives
that may choose

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.990
to sacrifice long-term broad
institutional objectives

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.790
for short-term narrow
benefits or vice versa.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.310
And so, we find ourselves at the
opening of the 150th congress

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.720 position:56%
with a conventional wisdom certainly
around town in DC and I think wider

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.720
around the country that we have
an unpopular institution mired

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.640
in gridlock despite the promise of
unified control of the governments.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.790
And a perception that it's
ever weakening in the face

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.980
of internal stalemate and external
power zapping from the executive.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.790 position:56%
And as this is a congress in history
roundtable I want to make sure

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.120
that we pay particular attention

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.630
to how the current
situation fits into the past.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.220
Is this a uniquely
problematic time for congress

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.800
or can we find similar situations
in the past to guide our thinking

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.100
about the prospects

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.630
and possibilities of
congressional reform?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.570
Likewise, what can we learn
from history by the value

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.920
of specific reforms or about the
political conditions that produce

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.520
and don't produce reform.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.120
There's probably something of
a Tolstoy problem at work here

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.510
that every dysfunctional congress
is dysfunctional in its own way.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.700
But I'd like to think we have the
scholarly experience on this panel,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.840
as well as the membership and
legislator experience to try

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.910
and leverage what we do know
about the past to the degree

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.840
that it can affect
the current congress.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.160 position:56%
And so, I want to start with kind of
the broadest question I can think of

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.150
and that is also in the place
where everyone is starting

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.090
in Washington these days and that's
with party polarization okay.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.680
There's a perception that the
increasing polarization is the root

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.840
cause of all of the
dysfunction in congress.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.210
And broadly speaking, this is
divided reformers into two camps.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.740
First, the ones who want to
accept party polarization okay

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.110
as just our new reality and
transform the institutions

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.870
to better match that okay, I'm
thinking here again Woodrow Wilson

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.470 position:56%
or the APSA committee in the 50's
or Tom Mann and Norm Orenstein okay.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.990
Democratize the institution,
strengthen the leadership

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.810
and make it possible for
the parties as strong

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.710
as they are to take command.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.060
But there's an opposing force
that says no, reformers should try

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.130
and constrain and channel
the party polarization

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.240
and find ways to mitigate it.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.260
Seek reforms that encourage
deliberation, negotiation

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.770
and compromise and increase
the capacity of congress okay,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.800
return to an older expertise based
legislative institution that's not

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.270
just an arena for party battles,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.290
but is actually a transformative
institution and a primary feature

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.590
of the system as a whole.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.150
So that's the first question
I want to take to the panel

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.240
and I will take anyone who would
like to jump in and participate.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.920
In the age of party polarization,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.960
what does a functional
congress look like?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.380
What would you like to see congress
behaving like now and should we try

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.820
to mitigate the party problem
or should we accept it and try

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.980
and shape the institutions
to take advantage of it?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.770
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: Well,
I'll say something to start

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.050
because the first thing I wanted to
say was, you know, how pleased I am

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.260
to be here with my good
friend, David Obey.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.380
And there was a time when we worked
together republican and democrat,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.600
liberal or conservative and we
worked together because we believed

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.980
in the institution and I
didn't ever know anybody

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.370
who was more an institutionalist,
more a representative

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.130
of what congress was supposed
to be than David Obey.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.530
And I'm just, you know, excited
to be with you again Dave so.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.830
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Thank you.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.660
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: I would just
make a couple of observations.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.220
I don't really see the problem
as polarization I see it

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.580
as partisanship and
they're different

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.490
because they're two
different things.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.530
And I also think that when
you have serious problems

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:40.100
in any entity it's usually either
because you have the wrong people

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.340
so you have members of congress
who are stupid, don't know anything

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.130
about or -- and I don't think
that's the case or its systemic,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.470
there's something wrong
with the system

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.360
that is producing the
results that we have.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.040
So, Wilson and is not the only one
who thought that the separation

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.100
of parties system was outmoded,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.220 position:56%
I think that the our current
domination, the system of domination

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.890
of our parties, of our
politics, our elections

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.980 position:56%
and our internal governance of
congress is outmoded, it's outdated,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.700
it's a relic of the past.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.680
We don't do anything in our lives,
we don't run anything in our lives

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.360
by dividing into two
rival clubs to fight it

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.760
out as though they were
rival football teams except

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.300
for the way we run the congress
and that's what we reward.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.220
We have a party primary system
that rewards intransigence,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.200
we have the sore loser laws that
allow party ideologues to determine

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.990 position:56%
who can be on the ballot in November
that we're paying for that price.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.810
And I think 20 years from now
over 50% of Americans are going

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.380 position:56%
to be registered as independents and
they're going to look back and say,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.140 position:56%
oh there was a time when people
thought everything should be a fight

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.510
between party A and
party B and they're going

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.860
to wonder what were we
thinking when we tried

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.970
to govern our country that way.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.940
So that's one of the
problems that I see.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.730
And I think the second problem,
the other one I'll mention,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.420
is that among the members
of congress

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.100
that I observe today are too many
who don't understand what the role

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.390
of congress is, they don't
understand article one,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.530
they don't know what their
powers and responsibilities are.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.870
Too many refer to the
executive as the boss or act

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.370
as though the president is the boss

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.390
and it's their job to
carry out his agenda.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:40.130
The news media reports all the
time about whether or not the party

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.730
in control is going to be able to
carry out the president's agenda.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.130
So, unless -- given the current
system unless we are able

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.940
to get a congress that not only
has the capacity to do the job

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.010
that it was elected to do, but
understands where its powers are,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.200
whether it's domestic
policy or foreign policy

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.990
which the courts have repeatedly
held was a congressional authority

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.130
not a legislative, not a
presidential authority.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.050
Unless we get to where
congress understands its duty

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.060
and does its duty we're going to be
here 20 years from now and talking

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.440
about the exact same things and
asking why is it dysfunctional.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.940
And so, I'm wanting some really
fundamental, basic changes.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.690
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: I'm not
dysfunctionalist, there are a lot

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.740
of problems out there, most of
them don't reside in congress

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.350
or are not generated by congress
they're problems with the parties,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.320
with the society itself, with
the elections, with the media.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.170
There is some with congress,
but only some are with congress.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.130
I think probably congress is beaten

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.870
up on too much, beaten
up on too much.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.950
It's possibly beaten up on
more, maybe not more today

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.940 position:56%
than it was I'm not sure about this.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.650
But I think maybe there's too
much media beat up out there.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.890
Let me give you some instances,
I've got four instances

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.460
of the way the media mislead us.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.490
And I say this because this is a
congressional history conference

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.240
so at the least, we
should be thinking history.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.390
And we should be thinking
about answering the phone

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.820
where a reporter calls up or
a student asks the question

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.010
and giving them something
that is reasonably true

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.270
about our congress
[inaudible] in history.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.950
Four instances, four instances
of this of misleading.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.570
One is this, we've
gone a hundred days

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.390
and they haven't passed any laws.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.860
We've been hearing about this
in the last few months or so.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.600
I looked back and here's
what I found,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.460
I think this is roughly correct.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.210
1933 was a genuine crisis and
they went on an immense binge

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.320
of lawmaking in March,
April, and May of 1933,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.620
the depression and all that.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.920
Since then, there's
only one instance

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.020
of a really important law passed
during the first hundred days

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.860 position:56%
of a new president's term and that
was the stimulus bill in February 09

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.870
where there's another
crisis, another crisis

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.710
and since then it's a blank.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.920
This is a fake yardstick and the
next time they call you up and ask

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.480
about it you should say
it's a fake yardstick.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.600
Secondly, we've been hearing lately
or we've been hearing at least

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.630
under Obama that they
don't pass enough laws.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.150 position:56%
And the evidence for that lately
has become a list of laws that's put

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.410
out by -- I think it's by
the [inaudible] which as far

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.460 position:56%
as I know is a very good list,
probably as accurate as you can get,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.980
the government's very good.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.100
But the use of this list
is terrible, it's taking it

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.720
as a measure of congressional
content or achievement innocent

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.540
of the fact that you're going to
be gathering together Obama care

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.250
with the declaration of national
petunia week and innocent

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.410
when you think over a period of
time with the strong likelihood

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.720
that in recent times more stuff has
been put into big omnibus bills.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.020
Since more it is the
case that stuff is put

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.050
into big omnibus bills we
can have less fewer bills,

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.840
but we're not necessarily having
less content or less achievement.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.780
The third point is this,
I think that the media

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.930
and this is true not
just in the media,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.590
am I using this okay,
can you hear me, yeah?

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.830
The media overused
the term gridlock.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.440
Gridlock in life in a traffic
jam is not a good thing.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.750
You can look in the mirror and
comb your hair, you can do that

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.270
and so forth, but generally
speaking,

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.080
traffic jams are terrible
and we know that.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.060
And in political science, there
is the use of the term gridlock

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.240 position:56%
which is very fine, it's a positive,
analytic use as [inaudible] talked

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.170
about earlier and Keith
[inaudible] and some others.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.470
But in the newspapers the
term gridlock had come to have

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.110
or does have as it applies to
congress a negative connotation.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.100
They're not doing stuff,
they should be doing stuff

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.330
and they're not doing
stuff you see that.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.840
Now we can all point to
instances where they're right,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.690
there's some stuff they should
do and they haven't done it

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.210
like putting up the debt limit.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:41.300
But for any society the more laws
passed would be an insane standard,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.140
just an insane standard.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.530
I mean you have to look back
and say is it a great idea

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.050
to be passing these laws.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.540
I mean it's a wonderful thing
sometimes when congress deliberates

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.380
and fusses and frets
then does nothing.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.200
It could be a great public
service when that is the result.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.060
The fourth point is this
one, we here that the parties

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.340
that are running congress,
the majority parties,

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.820
they can't get their act
together, there it is.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.220
It's a kind of platonic
form out there

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.830
of a point source party
that's supposed to be able

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.500
to operate perfectly with all
its members on the same page.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.680
It's a fiction and generally
speaking in American history,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.670
congressional majority
parties are not

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.340
like that, they'll vary somewhat.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.850
But generally speaking, one of
the two parties is a slice --

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:32.100
a pretty large slice of American
life and there will be dissonance

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.380
between the parties, but there will
be dissonance within the parties.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.740
Just look back in history you can
see this that is that Sam Rayburn

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.030
and Truman Kennedy had their
Dixiecrats, it was a big problem

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.020
within the party, within
the ruling party.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.390
You ask President Taft and
Hoover and Coolidge and Harding

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.320
about the terrible problem
of dissident progressivists

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.620
within the republican party

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.790
on capitol hill those people
were impossible to deal

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.810
with decade after decade.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.520
Ask Clinton about his blue dogs.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.720
So, now we're getting with the
republicans we're getting the New

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.260
Jersey folks and the Arkansas
folks and it's like herding cats.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.060
But this is pretty normal stuff.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.860
Beyond that there's the question
of whether we should really like it

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.440
if they can get their
act together the parties.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.710
It's not clear as an analytic or an
empirical it's a theoretical matter

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.960
that it's a great thing for the
parties to get their act together.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.780
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: That was great.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.150
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Let
me start by saying

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.610
that my favorite political
scientist is Archie the Cockroach.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:41.050
And Archie observed once
that the important thing

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:46.330
in politics is not the system the
important thing is what you do

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:50.020
with any system you
happen to have and I fall

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.570 position:56%
into that school, I believe in that.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.030
In my view, there is nothing
wrong whatsoever with the congress

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.830
that sending 30 more Mickey Edwards
to the congress wouldn't cure.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.330
Again, I don't say that
just because he's here,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.680
I say that because I believe it.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.540
If you want a congress
that is more cooperative

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.460
and less dysfunctional then you
ought to stop sending people

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.670
to congress whose self-declared
intention is to blow things

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.880
up rather than build things that's
the main thing that's the problem

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.900
with congress these days.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.240
When I came to congress, the
congress was controlled largely

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.650
by southern white,
sometimes racist men.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:42.800
And we reformed the institution in
many ways over the next five years.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.730
And then that congress faced
Watergate and it faced Vietnam.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:55.430
That institution was
able to handle those,

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.990
you may not like the
way they handled it,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.910
but that institution was able
to deal with those issues.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:07.460
For I think one reason because
they came from a generation

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.500
that had experience -- well
they had two common experiences,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.400
the first was the Great Depression
and the second was World War Two.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.380
And I think those instances
taught them that if you wanted

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.290
to get along, if you wanted to
work things out for the welfare

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:37.050
of the country that excuse me,
that they were all in it together.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.140
They had a more communitarian
approach certainly to problems

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.920
than the congress has today.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.110
That generation believed
that you needed

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.120
to knock the rough edges
off capitalism in order

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.270
to give everybody a
buy in economically.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.490
And it also recognized
that sometimes

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.450
in a legislative body
it is more important

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.650 position:56%
to protect the institution's ability
to function than it is to press

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.870 position:56%
for that last inch of political
advantage in dealing with any issue.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:16.640
Example, when Mickey and I ran the
foreign operations subcommittee,

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.700
appropriations subcommittee
on the outside.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.440
For part of the time the
senate chairman was Bob Kasten,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.310
a republican from Wisconsin.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:34.180
When we sat down with our staff
to try to work out what we needed

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.130
to put in my mark which I was
going to present to the house

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.630
and then later what our position
is going to be in conference

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.900 position:56%
with the senate the very first
question I always asked my staff was

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.430
what does Bob Kasten need
that we can afford to give him

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.820
so that everybody walks
away from the deal feeling

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.160
like they got something and that
it was responsible given the

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.790
constituencies they
had the answer to.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.410
And I tried to do the same
thing thinking about Mickey.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:11.540
If you want to know or if
you want to have an example

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.490
of what the problem is in the
congress today I invite you to look

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.240
at one sheet of paper, this one.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.310
This is the seating chart of
the United States Senate in 1960

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.590
and I invite you to
look at the chart.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:32.670
You will find names on the
republican side like Case, Keating,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:40.790
Pearson, Simpson, Javits, Cooper,
Aiken, Saltonstall, Dirksen.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:46.590 position:56%
Those people were reasonable
partisans and they were able to work

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.410
on the other side of the
aisle without being devoured

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.150
by the threat of the
primary opponent.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:59.660 position:56%
And so, the place might've been --
it civil, at least it was civil even

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.160
if you didn't like some of the
legislation that it produced.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.450
Compare that to what
happened in the house.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:16.010
I became chairman in 1994 the first
time halfway through the session,

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.380
we were behind in our work and I
desperately wanted to finish all

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.990
of the bills that we had before
the end of the fiscal year.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.460 position:56%
We did that, but it wasn't because
I was so blessed smart it was simply

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.900 position:56%
because I was able to walk across
the aisle, talk to a guy by the name

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.110
of Joe McDade who was the ranking
republican on the committee

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:40.820
and I said to Joe, Joe I know we'll
never agree on the numbers in each

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.160
of the bills for each
of the programs,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.780
but at least can't we agree,
can't we get a bipartisan mark

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:52.590
for the 302B numbers in
the budget resolution.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.090
In other words, in plain
English, couldn't we agree

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.810
on how many dollars would go
into each subcommittee even

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.820
if we differed within
that subcommittee

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.890
on where the dollars would go.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:07.540
He did that that's the only reason
that we were able to pass all

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.060
of those appropriations bills
before the end of the fiscal year.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:20.320
Compare that to the atmosphere
that Obama faced when on the night

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.410
of the inauguration you had
people like Eric Cantor meeting

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.250
at a restaurant in
downtown Washington pledging

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.970
that they would deny Obama
any victory on anything.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.140
What that meant is that
they would oppose him

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.170
on things even if they
agreed with him.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:45.390 position:56%
The problem you have today, my major
objection to the congress today is

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.470
that they're artificial flights
that are created day after day.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:58.180
And so, you have a fight over
things that people really agree on,

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.230
but for political reasons
they decide they're going

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.460
to make life miserable for
the other side of the aisle.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.750
That's in my view what
has to change.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.780
The stimulus was mentioned, it
was my responsibility to put

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:20.210
through the house the appropriation
portion of the stimulus package.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:27.060
And so, to do that I want to my
ranking republican on the committee

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.540
and I said Jerry, here's
roughly what we would like to do.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.120
I walked him through the five
categories that we were looking at

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.300
and I said, you know,
we would like this to be

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.410
as bipartisan as possible.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.970
Would you shop this stuff
on your side of the aisle,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.820
tell me what you'd like in the
bill, tell me what you don't want

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.560
in the bill, we're not
going to agree totally,

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.760
but we'll try to accommodate
whatever we can.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.720
He simply grinned and
looked at me and said Dave,

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.360
I'm sorry instructions from
headquarters I can't play.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.790
So, the most serious
economic problem

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:05.060
since the Great Depression I was
told that no matter what I did

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.990
as chairman of the
committee they'd kick the hell

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.510
out of me and they did.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.620
That wouldn't have happened
in the congress that I came

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.910
to because I think there was
a generational difference

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.330
and that older generation while
I often differed with them

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.100
on substance they had a respect for
the institution and they recognized

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.380
that institutional values
are sometimes more important

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.110
than issue values.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:39.600
So that's the way I see the
situation and I would also point

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.730
out if we're going to be looking
forward instead of backwards.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:51.380
We have an irony facing us at this
point with Mr. Trump Speaker Ryan.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.490
The hope expressed in a lot of
newspaper stories in this town

00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.650 position:56%
for a couple of months had been that
while Trump is off the reservation,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:07.210
he's got his own run amok agenda,
but as a practical matter we've got

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:12.440
to rely on people like Paul Ryan
to moderate what trump does.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.280
In fact, in some ways I
think it's just the opposite.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.580 position:56%
If Trump had on healthcare if he had
stuck to the kind of healthcare bill

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:27.010 position:56%
that he had told the American people
he would pass he'd already have it

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.100
through both houses
because what he said

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.770
on the campaign trail did
not overreach in terms

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.670
of savaging the base bill.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:44.200
But instead because of internal
caucus pressures Ryan insisted

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.470
on going much further than Trump

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:51.140
and attacking the basic safety net
aspects of that healthcare bill.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:59.100
And that's I think going to be a
very interesting process to watch

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.540
because it means that Trump
initially ran his campaign

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.670
against the establishment
of his own party.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:13.020
But in the end, he will
be the instrument by which

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:19.390
that party establishment tries
to deliver what is on their minds

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:25.990
in economic terms and that is
going after Medicaid and Medicare.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:29.780
They want that so badly
they salivate.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.250
And so, Trump isn't
the person who pushed

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:39.730
that that agenda is being pushed by
the house republican leadership not

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.370
so much by the senate
republican leadership.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.240
But I think we're going to have a
very different role to be played

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.280
by Ryan and Trump than people
expected when Trump was elected.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.560
&gt;&gt; Eric Schickler: Yeah, thanks,
thanks so much it's great --

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.760 position:56%
a pleasure to be here on this panel.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.570
And I guess what I want to say
is thinking about the framing

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:09.180
of the question about harnessing
versus countering polarization.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.410
I also agree with Mickey
Edwards' point

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.880
that it's actually partisanship
as much as polarization

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.180
that we should be talking about.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.680
I actually think that when you
think historically it's seems to me

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.270
that neither of those options
is actually the right one

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.570
and here's what I mean.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.880
I think first in thinking
historically about what's going on,

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.010
I think it's wrong to look to
history for analogies in this case.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.640
I don't think there actually is
a really good historical analogy

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.990
to the problems we face today.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.450
There have been periods where the
parties have voted quite apart

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.540 position:56%
and distinctly, but it's not clear
the processes generating it were the

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.610
same as what we have now.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.100
But I do think that we should
think about historically

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.210 position:56%
in the following sense that
polarization or this intensification

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.460 position:56%
of partisanship is itself a
self-reinforcing historical process.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.610
In other words, that a whole
variety of actors, institutions,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.140
players in our politics
have essentially adapted

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.580
to this present polarized
partisan environment

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.470
and now have a stake
themselves in reinforcing it.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.270
When we think about the structure
of the media and media voices,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.560
the way organized groups
operate in politics,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.200
the way primaries operate today.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.050
And so, what you have is a whole
set of actors where the stakes

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.890
of your side winning becomes
so high that you're willing

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.190
to put up with an awful lot.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.620
And I think the Trump
case is actually in a lot

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.970
of ways a perfect kind
of exemplar of that.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.970 position:56%
If you were to think if you'd asked
political scientists what's the kind

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.990
of thing that could upset
intense polarization

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.020
or partisanship it would be the
arrival on the scene of a president

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.680
who doesn't come from
within the party structure,

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.760
offers some positions
that are quite unorthodox,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.150
and is you know is
everything that Trump is.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.060
And what's happened is Trump
has become absorbed exactly

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.470 position:56%
into the exact same partisanship
and polarization that we saw before.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.500
And so, I think that
suggests to me that the idea

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.730
that there's some strategy
out there for reformers

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.540
to counter this I don't
think is right.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.030
At the same time, the idea of just
harnessing it for good in some way.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:17.310
I just don't think is realistic,
I think that the idea if what

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.690
that would mean is just empowering
party leaders you still face the

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.140
basic tension that we have a
checks and balances separation

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.440
of power system that's not
premised on that kind of governance

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.820
and we have an immensely diverse
country that's not really --

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.220
doesn't give a clear majority to
one side to implement that program.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.700
So, it's not clear that would
solve any problem either.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.810
So, then the question
is well what do we do

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.130
or how do we think about this.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.580
And I guess I'd want to
make two points about that.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.940
One is I think that in some ways
the deepest problem is the one

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.270
that Mickey Edwards
alluded to at the start,

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.170
which is a commitment
to the institution.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.540
That what we have now is
essentially the partisanship

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.510
and policy cleavages have become
so sharp that the number of members

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.080
who are institutionalists, who
have some sense for congress's role

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.280
in the system and commitment
to upholding

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.530
that has become much, much smaller.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.260
And the willingness to make any
trade-offs toward, you know,

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.030
when it comes to sacrifice, you
know, Dave Obey referred to giving

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.080
up a little on policy in order to
get by and that willingness to do

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.930
that for the institution
is just way down.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.270
And, you know, this is the one
place I disagree with my, you know,

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.490
my mentor David Mayhew
about dysfunction.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.990
Like the place where I see it
as really problematic I agree

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.850
with him entirely, it's
not the number of laws

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.240
that gets passed that's so
important, but it's the idea

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.640
that there were periods where
you could count on members

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.830
of both parties if there was a case
of executive abuses for example

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:46.330
or a foreign policy disaster,
both parties to step up.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.630
Whether it's, you know, thinking

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.160
about Fulbright during the Vietnam
War or you'd think about cases

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:57.050
of republicans, at least some
republicans in the Nixon era.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.920
And that assumption I
think doesn't hold anymore

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.220
and I think that's a problem.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.860
And so, thinking about are there
ways to reinforce some commitment

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.850
to the institution, I
that's really critical.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.230
And then secondly, I think
that what we should think

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.630
about is are there reforms that
can somehow either hold constant

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.220
partisanship or put it to the side.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.340
In other words, are there ways to
appeal to other kinds of interests

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.510
that members have whether it's
electoral of personal power

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.560
or ideally congressional
capacity and power

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.170
that essentially bracket
partisanship.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.560
In other words, that don't
have an immediate impact

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.120
on their partisan goals yet
serve these broader interests.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.340
But I think the idea that
you're going to get democrats

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.950
and republicans to
unify on something

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.660
that has clear partisan
stakes or partisan effects

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.550
in the short-term I just don't
think that's going to happen.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.110
Thank you.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.090
&gt;&gt; Sarah Binder: Great, well thank
you very much for including me.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.150
I have to say I think the
first book I probably read

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.170 position:56%
on congressional reform was Congress
Against Itself from Walter Oleszek,

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:06.470
presumably down the hall somewhere
so and Roger Davidson of course.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:10.910
I guess I have one quick thing to
say on dysfunction and then another

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:13.850
to follow up on Eric's
comments about reform.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.830
I think on the dysfunction
question I'm totally onboard

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.560
with why we don't want to count
up numerators and count up laws

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.570
and the difficulties and
whether that's a reliable

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.890
or a valid measure, particularly
in a historical sense.

00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:30.870
I would question though whether we
are really not dysfunctional given

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.710
the levels of public approval,
which although they've rebounded

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.130
from the depths of
the depths of the 7%,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.980
which is probably meaninglessness
distinguished from zero.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.330 position:56%
But it's still quite low, so I mean
one possibility is congress actually

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.270
is making tough choices and passing

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.830
on popular things and
so approval is low.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.080
But that doesn't seem to
quite fit it seems more likely

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.690
that there are problems out there
granted there's disagreement

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.800
about whether all things are
problems the parties disagree

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.200
about whether things are problems.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.330
But the fact that there are
many issues on the plate,

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.630
very little happening and public
approval is getting quite low

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.330
suggests that there is at least
a crisis of legitimacy even

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:17.430
if it's not necessarily
a legislative crisis.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.970
Second, I think I would just
raise just two points about

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.470
and these are both sort of obvious,
but just the sheer difficulty

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:32.160
of reform unless it's a
sheer partisan reform sort

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.110
of where Eric was going at the end.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:41.870 position:56%
Even the appeal to institutionalists
I think sometimes there could be

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.280
less than meets the
eye there as well.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.480
And what I have in mind here
is in the late 80's I worked

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.100
for Lee Hamilton on the hill

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.770
who is every bit a Dave
Obey as Mickey Edwards.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.350
And I once asked him after I had
left the hill and was working

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.660
on my dissertation about procedural
rights for minority parties.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.610
I said Lee, why do you ever
as a majority party member,

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.020
why you ever create rights to
help out, procedural rights,

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.730
[inaudible] rights to help
out the minority party.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.480
And Lee six foot plus looked
down at me and scratched

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.820
that Hoosier haircut and
he said, we create rights

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.480
to help the minority well
that must be a mistake.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:26.090
At first that just blew my,
you know, four years of working

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.430
for who I thought was like the
most principled institutionalist

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.820
that there was.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.740
But I took his point to be that
even the most well-intentioned

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.010
of reforms, meaning that the
reforms are tied typically

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:44.020
to particular policy choices
or policy pursued policy goals,

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.900 position:56%
even those well-intentioned reforms
it's very hard to find tuned reforms

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.270
to get the outcomes that you want.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.770
Compounded by the difficulty is
that the rules and practices,

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.430
but rules here in this case,
last of course far longer

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:02.870
than the coalitions that
put them into place.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:06.270
And the difficulty here I just
think of examples this year

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.730 position:56%
as [inaudible] every day talk about
reconciliation right and its purpose

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.300 position:56%
versus how it's being tried to be
used by the two parties whether it's

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.870
on taxes or on Affordable Care Act.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:22.070
And efforts to kind of update
rules, in this case laws,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.140
congressional budget act also
create their own difficulties

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.260
for the Byrd Act and the
difficulties of then trying to live

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.310 position:56%
under the Byrd Act and the pressures
it creates on parliamentarians,

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.200
let alone minorities majorities.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.070
So, I think the issue here on the
difficulty of reform is borrowing

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.680
from Eric's work on sort of
the layering of institutions is

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.230
that we don't really ever get the
chance to take out a clean sheet

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.200
of paper and write the
institution that we want,

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.210
it is almost always laid on top
of these existing laws and rules.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:59.120 position:56%
It just it gives me pause when we're
thinking about could there be ways

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.880
to alter the institution.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.860
I've just become quite a skeptic
given the difficulties of doing so.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:13.240
And just one other point on reform
and the difficulties of reform.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.000
Maybe this is just
hypothesis, it certainly --

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.300
it could be the case

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.160 position:56%
that centralized institutions I
guess perhaps ironically may be more

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.390
difficult to reform.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:30.640
Just thinking here, the examples
from the 1970's from Julian's work,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.730
from new work by Emily
Baer at Minnesota,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.550
by Oleszek and Davidson of course.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:41.680
Just the amount of time it
took, a decade plus in order

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.970 position:56%
to build the type of coalitions even
just within the democratic party

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.590
to build the type of coalitions

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.440
that could eventually
make a major change right.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.900
Even just watching the birth of
the democratic study group how long

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.880
that took and just this sort
of teaching as I understand it,

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.270
trying to help democratic
members sort

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.870
of develop procedural
preferences which we talk a lot

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.170
about policy preferences.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.630
But I think there's something
to be said about thinking

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.300
about how lawmakers develop
their procedural preferences.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.200
And that's what I take away from
the 70's is how long it took

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.580
to make these [inaudible]
mark changes to the rules,

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.320
some of which obviously the
Budget Act are still here today.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.640
But I would just I think as
I've grown old and gray come

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.470
to appreciate the difficulties
a little bit more of kind

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.250
of institutional frictions
and the difficulty

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:34.100
of building these effective
institutional reforms.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.660
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Thanks Sarah.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.620
Before we open up the questions I
have one more general question I'd

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.970
like to bring to bear
for our panelists

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.750
and that's more current
events right to this week.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.640
I think there's two
developments this week

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.020
that certainly are
[inaudible] change,

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.050
but seem to be the
institution changing.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:54.940
One is that we have talk all of
a sudden of preemptive omnibus

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.660
in the appropriations process.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.590
And that doesn't signal
kind of the complete failure

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.050
of the traditional process
it signals something.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.150 position:56%
And the second thing that's happened
this week is the perceived level

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.540
of secrecy that is being brought
to the AHCA in the senate,

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.190
which again secrecy is
nothing new on the hill,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.350
but this certainly
seems like a new level.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.560
I think Sarah wrote something
about this on Twitter that many

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.960
of us read or at least I read.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.090
And I'd like to get the panel's
thoughts on those two things

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.620
because these seem like plausibly
big changes that are coming.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.410
The idea of a preemptive
omnibus and complete scrapping

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.880
of the appropriations process
ahead of time, not just after a CR.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.440
And also, the use of kind of
completely private means to deal

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.100
with large bills instead of going
through even kind of the paces

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.070
of something that looks like the
traditional committee process,

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.090
development process of legislation.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.120
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Well I
wouldn't mind taking a --

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.780
well let me do something
a little bit different.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.500
I'll comment on those, but first
I want to mention something

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.340 position:56%
that I forgot in the first instance.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.510
I don't want to leave the
impression that I don't think

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:10.450
that there are any reforms that
might improve the situation,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.970
but I don't think they are
necessarily congressional reforms.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.810
The two that I have in mind
are first of all redistricting

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.900
and my state is a good example and
I would urge you to watch that suit

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.240
that is now working its way

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.060
up the Supreme Court
it's really interesting.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.810
It's a suit from Wisconsin's
legislative redistricting.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:38.090
But in Wisconsin two elections
ago the republicans got 48 1/2%

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.110
of the vote and yet they elected
almost two thirds of the members

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.630
of the state assembly because
of the way they drew the line.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.940
Lest you think I'm being
partisan, democrats did same thing

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.460
to the republicans in Illinois.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.150 position:56%
And the problem with that isn't just

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:59.970
that the losing party is hurt the
problem is that when that happens,

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.190
when you create so
many districts that are

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:08.660
so one-sided either democratic or
republican, you destroy incentives

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.370
for compromise because
then all members have to do

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.190
to get reelected is
to satisfy their base.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.230
If I hear the word base once more

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:23.530
from either party I will
gag to death so help me God.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.790
The second thing is
campaign-finance.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:32.750
When I first got into politics
I spent $1,160 to get elected

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.360
to the [inaudible] County
Second Assembly District.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:43.890
In this last election, Betsy
DeVos' pack poured $400,000

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:48.060
into that state, that
same state assembly race.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.570
When you do -- now we're
in the business of trying

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.320
to recruit another
candidate for that district.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.060 position:56%
Nobody will want to run because
they will say how in hell do I raise

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.980
that kind of money, so not
only do you deprive people

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.790
of any meaningful vote in a
lot of these safe districts,

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.250
but you also make it unlikely
that you're going to get a lot

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.400 position:56%
of quality candidates in the future.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.750
The third is internal
with the house.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:22.330
I think the main problem with
the Budget Act is simply this,

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:30.000
the budget committee brings out its
ideas, it's flying at 30,000 feet.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.640
What they do is they lay out the
macro numbers, but they don't get

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.670
around to applying those numbers
to each individual program.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.350
So, then the house passes
the budget resolution.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.520
Then after the budget
resolution gets passed

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.340
because it's a generalized press
release rather than a budget.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:55.610
Then poor Hal Rogers got stuck
with the job of having to translate

00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.020
that general package of ideas

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.770
into specific program
by program legislation.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:09.930 position:56%
That's when members of the house who
voted for the budget resolution say

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:17.080 position:56%
to Hal Rogers, you expect me to vote
to cut what, are you crazy as hell,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.670
I'm not going to do that.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:24.090
And so, the appropriations
committee gets the heat

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.520
because the budget committee
overreached in its estimate

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.880 position:56%
of how much you could cut from a lot
of programs and safety net and so

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:37.960
that winds up slowing down
the whole institution.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:44.140 position:56%
So, I think it is the
overreaching of the budget committee

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:51.180
to use the budget resolution
to go just 1 inch from the wall

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.020
in order to get a product out.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.750
I think that's the main
problem with the Budget Act.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:01.980
And so, if I had my way I
would abolish the Budget Act

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.430
or not the Budget Act,
but the budget committee.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.670
Short of that what I would do is
make the chairman of ways and means

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:13.800
and appropriations cochairman
or at least make them rotating

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.270
so that the guy who presents the
brilliant ideas for budget cuts

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.920 position:56%
in the budget resolution has to then
carry them out on real legislation.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.060
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: Yeah,
well let me to add here.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.410
First of all, yeah I totally
agree, I mean [inaudible].

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:38.990
I was on a panel one time years ago
with a number of the leadership,

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.520
I was in the leadership then on
our side and a number of republican

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.280
and democratic leaders speaking
at a big conference like this.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.470
And the only thing
that we agreed on was

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.890
that creating the budget committee
was a mistake so, you know,

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.440
I just lay that out there.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.160
So, I just want to make a couple

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.310
of points before we
get to the questions.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.700
First is Professor
Mayhew's comments,

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.920
he's right there are problems here,

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.770
we're focused on the
congress in particular.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:12.430
But the problems that we face are
more than that, they're social,

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.620
they're cultural, they're
universities

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.710
that don't really teach the
humanities in critical thinking

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:25.040
and civics and that have become
essentially voc-tech schools

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.210 position:56%
teaching people how to make a living
as opposed to how to be citizens.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:35.020
It's corporate short-term
greed, it is the same thing

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.740
with the media as corporations.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.340
You know there are so many
kinds of things out there

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.390
that we're not really going to fix
it if we only focus on, you know,

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:49.440 position:56%
the specifics about the operation
of congress there are bigger reasons

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.670 position:56%
for the problems that we are facing.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:56.720
And I just want to say a
word to you all, I've had --

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.860
I've been lucky enough to
do some teaching my own,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.370
I wasn't very good not like
you, but I taught for 11 years

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.110
at the Kennedy School then I
taught at the Wilson School.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:15.680 position:56%
And one of the things that I
observed and I have great admiration

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.650
of your professions, but I
think there's also an obligation

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:25.390
to be careful about where there
are so many things that are hard

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.160
to put hard numbers on that
you have to make assumptions,

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.830
you have make leaps of things
that you can't quantify.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:36.760
And I think you need
to be a little careful

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.900
about instilling cynicism
about the system.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.730
Instilling cynicism in your
students about why members

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.710
of congress do what they do.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.700
Even though I was in the
minority every single day I was

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.100
in congress members on both
sides of the aisle that I knew,

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.150
including the majority were people

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.810
who didn't have this
clever calculating strategy

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.010 position:56%
about whether they're going to offer
an amendment or where they're going

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.180
to -- they believed
things, they have views,

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.670
they have sincere beliefs.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.790
And they go there to try to carry
out the beliefs that they have

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.470
and that their constituents have
and you have to be really careful

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.840
about inadvertently, you know,
having your students walk

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.060 position:56%
out of there with the idea that this
is a bunch of crooks out, you know,

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.610
just to, you know,
feather their own nest

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.150 position:56%
or pursue their own private agendas.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:34.290
And so, I think we need to rebuild
institutional pride in congress

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.970
and I think that you all
have a role to play in that.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.220
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Well we
have about half an hour,

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.400
which is about two thirds of the
time that we're supposed to reserve

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.970
for audience questions,
so do we have the mics?

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:58.530
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: [Inaudible]
down here.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.830
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Yes.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:09.310
&gt;&gt; I didn't see who you're
pointing to, I'm sorry.

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.610
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Yup,
down here to Richard.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:22.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, I enjoyed all those comments.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:28.040 position:56%
I particularly enjoyed the ideas
that reform of congress is something

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.310
that can't be internal to congress.

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:32.810
That a lot of the problems
that we see

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.420
with congress are in fact external.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.470
I also think they can't
be controlled.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:40.430
But let me talk just
a little bit about it.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:44.530
David wrote a book some
time ago, America's Congress

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:50.730
and America's Congress had imagined
a public sphere in which members

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:53.620
of congress took positions
and they took positions

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.390
that were daring and
they were risky.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:01.370
And to creating the congress
was to create an institution

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:08.570
in which those opportunities to
take positions in the public sphere

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.430 position:56%
that were daring, these were the
good ones, there were some bad ones.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:18.060
But the good ones was to grab the
attention of the American people

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:24.620
and say, this is wrong or this
is right or whatever it would be.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:30.040
But there was a public sphere
and this public sphere in the way

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.760
that David modeled it in
the book was fairly unified

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.820
in how it paid attention,
it knew what was daring,

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:45.590
it knew what was a moral
stand, it knew the logics

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:50.230
within which people were taking
these positions and so forth.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:55.670 position:56%
The thing that has happened not just
since that book, but David like many

00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:00.090
of the books we write are right
on the cusp of major change is

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:03.810
that public sphere has
largely disintegrated.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:08.260
And it's disintegrated because
now we have multiple spheres,

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:14.120
the big three television stations,
the big organs and newsmagazines

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.500
and so forth that created
a common platform in which

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.740
that daring move would be
reported to everybody in sort

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.520
of the same way that's gone.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.220
So, you know, it's hard for
me even to imagine a member

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:36.340
of congress making a daring
position anymore that would be yes,

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:40.980
they're taking a moral stand and
it's not characterized that way.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:45.120
I mean it's Fox News will do it one
way, CNBC will do it another way,

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.170
you'll see it in CNN another way.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:52.190
There is not a single -- this gets
back to the institutional thing,

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.010
but one of the things that's
happened with the institution

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:58.730
and institutional affiliation
is we've lost a common logic

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.010
about how we think
about causal connections

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.850
between things that happen.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:11.310 position:56%
So, climate change the causal
connections that are imagined in one

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.890
of these public spheres is

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.830
that scientists are just
feathering their own nests

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:22.220
and in the other spheres this is
science and asserts it as truth.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:28.890
But there's not a single attention
to the causal mechanisms themselves

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:34.140
as being claims on policy.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:39.560
That's all extraneous to congress,
that seems to me beyond the ability

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.750
of congress to control, they
shouldn't try to control it.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.780
But boy it looks like
a major factor.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:50.110
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: I think
that's finely said.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:55.110 position:56%
I would say that in the past when we
did have senators and house members

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.720
who made a big fuss
with some consequence

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.800
in the public sphere often
they were quite sectarian.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.940
I mean you take Charles
Sumner and slavery

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.150
or you take Robert La Follette
with this, that or another.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:11.020 position:56%
It's not as if they were speaking
for a consensus they were out there.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.600
And there's a certain similarity
to folks like Bernie Sanders

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.170
who spends a day on the senate
floor or Ted Cruz who spends a day

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.720
on the senate floor
making some kind of case.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.000
The senate is still there
to engage in that kind

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.220
of what public mobilization
it's there.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.470
&gt;&gt; Eric Schickler: Yeah,
I think it's there,

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:39.770
but I think the problem is
you always had members who did

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.480
that that could be lumped in or
seen as partisans, but you also had

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.110
and so that the statement
would be reported as such,

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:50.710
you had a greater share
of I think counter.

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:52.220
You know I mean think
about La Follette,

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.720
it's La Follette is the
progressive republican taking

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.480
on his own party right.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.930
And we don't have the equivalent of
that in the same way I think now.

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:04.510 position:56%
And I do think that there -- I think
the media point though is important

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.710
in terms of the reinforcement
of incentives.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.930
You know the problem is
that if you think of --

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:14.710 position:56%
I think it's certainly it's not
about the goodwill or the principles

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.010
of the individual members,

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.510
it's a matter of you know can
I do this and will it work.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:22.340
And as long as you have a media
universe that's bifurcated

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:26.250
in this way or fragmented in
this way makes it much harder

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.980
for a member to see the reward
and effectiveness in taking a kind

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:35.680
of counter stereotypical bold stand
as opposed to taking the bold stand

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.980
that just reinforces the line.

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.480
&gt;&gt; I want to just make a
couple of points about various

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.380
because I take the point
that Professor Mayhew makes

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.030
about not over-refocusing
on congress

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:59.070
and looking at external features.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.410
And also, the fact that congress
is facing these problems over time.

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:04.550
But I think it's worth
making the point

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:07.790
that there are some unique aspects
to the contemporary congress

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:13.380
and that is its persistent failure
to address high priority issues.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.190
The fact that we've gone year after
year with virtually no action taken

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.760
on issues that I think
most people recognize

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.670
as being not only significant, but
where there are significant levels

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.450
of public support whether
that's around immigration policy

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:31.400
or unemployment policy
or around gun policy and

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.880
yet no action taken whatsoever
I think does differentiate.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.440
And the way I would remind people
broadly about that is it's not

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.400
that long ago that you did have
a congress that was able even

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.860 position:56%
in a situation of divided government

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.680
to address highly controversial
issues.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.930
If you look back to 2008, we were
able with a republican president

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:56.090
and democratic congress
to pass a stimulus bill

00:55:56.090 --> 00:56:02.850
to address the financial crisis and
to pass car bailout legislation,

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.400
notwithstanding the fact that there
were high levels of partisanship,

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.640
not within the fact that there
was the continuing struggle

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.500
for congressional control.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.070
I do think and I forget
exactly who made this point,

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.280
I think a lot of this does go
back to not necessarily the nature

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.030
of the institution alone, but
to the individuals who are

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:26.890
in the institution, what their
objectives are which is one

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:32.150
of the reasons why I think if you
only deal with congressional reform

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:35.580
at the point at which people arrive
in congress you're bound to fail

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.850
because they've gotten there
by virtue of processes.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:44.820 position:56%
Whether that's nominations or
financial rewards or media attention

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.200
that reward them for taking
the most extreme positions

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.580
and unlikely having gotten
there under those circumstances

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.120
to take daring positions.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.360
I think you've really got to
look at the primary system,

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:58.080
I think however fanciful
it sounds you have to look

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.570
at the campaign finance and perhaps
you can build some broader public

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:05.680
support around those types

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:11.830
of crosscutting structural
change issues that will build

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.890
and provide some bipartisan support

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:18.610
for addressing those
kinds of issues.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:23.130
But simply railing at people who
are rewarded on a daily basis

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:26.030
for taking extreme positions,
to take moderate positions

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:29.410
or to take collaborative
positions seems to me something

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.310
of a fool's errand
it's simply not going

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:33.450
to work that's not
how they got there

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.780
and that's not how they secure
their rewards which is reelection.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.710
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: A
couple of brief reports.

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:42.720
One is that you mention 2008
stimulus I think that's a very

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.020
good instance.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.660
But another recent instance would
be under Obama, I mean Pelosi

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.090
and Boehner and Obama
dealing year after year

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.210
with the country's
fiscal difficulties

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:58.670
and bad optics no question, but
they really did bleach the deficit

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.350
and the debt over there
about four years

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:04.170
or so that's really quite
consequential legislating them.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:06.540
Another brief one immigration,

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.870
I think you take all the
American history back

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:13.070
to the 1870's the lawmaking
and immigration

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:14.740
on the record today
is quite difficult.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.740
I mean it's always been difficult
to do immigration policy.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.840
The country has gone decades and
decades and decades of pressure

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.340
to do immigration policy and they
never did anything until just

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.400
after World War One
as a circumstance

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.820
of refugees coming in
after World War One.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.770
And then in the 1960's when
all the Anglophone countries

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:35.520
for whatever reason were passing
immigration loosening bills.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.550
Otherwise, it's largely
a desert the history

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:42.230
of immigration policymaking,
but is quite difficult.

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:43.590
&gt;&gt; I'd like to follow
up on that one,

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:48.010
but I think that's exactly a
good point because in 2013,

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:51.220
the senate did pass a
bipartisan immigration bill

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.910
and what happened was it
came over to the house

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:56.600
and they wouldn't even allow it
to come up in the subcommittee

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.870
for a hearing or they wouldn't
even allow the senate bill to come

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.220
to the floor for a vote and.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.040
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: Quite
right, but over 160 years

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.060
or so failure is the norm

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.250
on immigration policy,
it's not a new thing.

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.500
It's a very difficult thing to
put together winning coalitions

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.800
across the whole government

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.880
on immigration policy,
it always has been.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.860
&gt;&gt; But in point of fact, had
they put that senate proposal

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.540
on the floor it would have passed.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.960
And so, it goes to the
question of the people

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.260
who were there and the vote.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.560
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: I think
you're right about that,

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.860
put it on the floor it
probably would've passed in more

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.160
than one congress, maybe two.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.450
But there we are that's another
that's an intensity was feeding

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:35.570
into congress and that could happen
also that on the republican side.

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:37.500
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: Well I want
to pick up on the first part John

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.400
of what you said which
was about what's fixable.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.470
So, one of the things I know I
harp on, but 2% of the population

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:53.360
of Texas, 2% voting in a runoff
primary made Ted Cruz the only

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.140
republican allowed to be

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.770
on the general election
ballot in a republican state.

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:03.380
In Utah 1/10th of 1%
of the population

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:08.070
in a convention kept Robert
Bennett from running for the senate

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.260
for reelection which he would've
won and that's why we ended

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.210
up with Mike Lee and Ted Cruz
in the senate when the majority

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.560
of the people in their state
would not have elected them.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.190
And so, unless we begin
to really say

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:26.650
where in the system are there
problems that can be fixed

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:31.820
and that will produce a different
kind of senator or house member

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.490
at the end of the process
we're going to be stuck

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:36.390
with this for a long time.

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:42.960
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Let me also
buttressing what you said John.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.240
One of my great frustrations when
I was chairman of the committee was

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.650
that we had no such thing as
a filibuster in the house,

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.700
but nonetheless we had a
filibuster in the house every day.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.640
And that was accomplished by
introducing 150 amendments

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.090
to each appropriation bill

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.950
as they were brought
before the rules committee.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:09.280
And the strategy on the part of
the minority at that time was

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.380
to simply slow walk us so we could
not in any way finish our business

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.900
and then they would attack us
for not finishing our business.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:24.160
Steny Hoyer and I in public on
the house floor had a dialogue

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.430
with John Boehner on this
and we tried to find some way

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.300
to give the Republicans a
reasonable number of amendments,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.720
but still enable us
to finish our work.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.830
And Boehner was willing to do that,
we met in private and we worked

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.350
out an agreement, came
back to the floor.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:48.030 position:56%
And when we tried to pass it Boehner
had a revolution in his own caucus,

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.200
he was in good faith negotiating

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.570
and he got his legs cut
off by the tea party types.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:02:00.610
And that isn't the only time that
you've had that inconsistency.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:06.870
This is not just something
that happened along the way

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:11.280
in the history of the house it
was purposeful and determined.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.720
And if you -- I would
invite one other comparison.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.800
Look at what happened
when George Bush Junior W.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.870
when he presented the tarp
package to the congress,

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:28.260
it went down the first time,

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.260
but it passed the second
time with bipartisan support.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.940 position:56%
That was a hard vote to cast, I
think it's the best vote I ever cast

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.030
in the house, but it
was very unpopular.

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.140
But you had bipartisan
support for that.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.690
That was the first half

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:47.400
of the economic crisis
legislation that was dealt with.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.860
The second half was the stimulus
package, but when that package came

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.790
up we got no help whatsoever.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:03:03.730
That's not a historical incident
that is a determined policy

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:07.420
of simply bringing
the institution down,

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.130
as well as the party that runs it.

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.710
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: Josh.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:15.930
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'd like to talk a
little bit more about some

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.840
of the internal changes
that are being discussed,

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.140
particularly in the house.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.860
And one of things that struck me in
the opening remarks how it's hard

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.100
to draw historical comparisons
between this era and previous ones.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.410
But when I look at congress today
I see all sorts of similarities

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.610
to the 1910's, the 1920's
and the 19 [inaudible]

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.040
and things of that nature.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.640
Matt pointed out that there's
a very secretive bill going

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.960
through the house and the senate
that's being negotiated behind

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.260
closed doors.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.270
And then the committees were
simply rubberstamping it

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:45.570
and then sending it to the floor.

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.380
That doesn't sound too different
than the democratic team caucus

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.260
as we talked about
in the early 1910's.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.930
Or for example, the arguments
that are being made by the house

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:58.960
of freedom caucus members, the
similarities between Justin Amash,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.700
republican member from
Michigan and Congressman Hepburn

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.750
who is a republican
member from Iowa back

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:11.260
in the 1900's are almost
strikingly similarity

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.580
in how much pushback they have

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.550
against centralized
power and the leadership.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:18.140
In other words, what I'm asking
is do you think that the types

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.930
of arguments that are being made
by this group that's blowing

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:23.950
up government essentially
amongst their own leaders,

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:29.530
does it have teeth or
is it just bluster?

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:31.230
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Well
it's got teeth enough

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:38.730
to destroy Boehner's speakership,
it had teeth enough to insist

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:44.500
that the caucus abide
by the Hastert Rule.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.630
So, I would not underestimate
their ability

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.990
to blow things up whenever
they want.

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.640
&gt;&gt; Sarah Binder: One thing
to add is just to think

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.660
of the broader partisan
context in which you have

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.150
that type of factionalism right.

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:03.080
If you have 1910 you have two
parties where the factions are

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.150 position:56%
in the middle right, so there's some
cross-party coalitions you're able

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:07.450
to get the place to work right,

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:11.700
even if it costs right the
speaker eventually his job.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.550
But if you have the factions coming
from in this case the far right

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.850 position:56%
and the [inaudible] of polarization,

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.650
obviously there's no cross-party
coalition right that's going

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:19.950
to help them out right.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:23.080
Like Charlie Dent bless his
soul isn't going to line

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.220
up with Nancy Pelosi
any day even though

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.300
that could create a new
winning cross-party coalition.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.430
So, I think it matters not
just where the factions are,

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.980
but where the broader array
of the parties are in terms

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.040
of whether it's going to make
the system still be [inaudible].

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.810
&gt;&gt; Eric Schickler: Just to build
real quickly off of Sarah's point,

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:44.280 position:56%
I mean I think that's exactly right.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.140
I mean it's not that there are
no similarities or parallels,

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:51.890
but the structural situation that
was distinctive throughout most

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.120
of American history was
that you would have factions

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.180
within the majority party that
one could see plausibly working

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:03.390 position:56%
with the minority party and that had
a substantial impact on incentives.

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:08.850
Now there are a whole range of
factors that cut against that

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:11.040
and so I think make
that less likely.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.230 position:56%
I think this goes back to the Mainer
case is actually a really good one

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:17.940
for thinking about why it's
tempting to say what we need is

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.880
to centralize more power in
leaders and yet why I think

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.810
that ultimately is
not going to work.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:24.890
Because the problem is
no matter how much power,

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:29.740
formal power one grants the speaker
of the house if there is a faction

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.430
of members in that party
that's potentially pivotal

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:38.290
that want something else and
is willing to take, you know,

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:42.010
and has a strong electoral
interest and personal, you know,

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:46.190 position:56%
ideological interest in pursuing
that no amount of carrots and sticks

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:49.060
that you grant Boehner is
going to take a cohesive group

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.860
like the freedom caucus potentially
and disempower them ultimately.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.820
You can try but ultimately,
it's just not going to work.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.570
So, the idea that just giving
more power to the speaker is going

01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:01.400
to discipline the factions
and allow them

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.520
to govern effectively I
think is just a pipe dream.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.890
&gt;&gt; David Obey: There is no
requirement to the democracy

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:09.190
that there be a happy ending.

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:19.530
&gt;&gt; Could I ask, for me always one
of the striking parts of the 60's

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:23.660
and 70's beyond Richard Bowlings
[phonetic] that Sarah was referring

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.670
to is just the way in which social
movements, the major movements,

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:31.500
civil rights, the antiwar movement
took the congressional process

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.200
as something to focus on and
were part of all these efforts

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.230
to build attention to reform and
to round up votes from reform.

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.740
Even the union movement
and Andrew B. Miller

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:46.700
and others were there
kind of working on this.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:51.700 position:56%
A, is that still the case today with
all these groups, climate change,

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.280
immigration reform, Black
Lives Matters on the right,

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.180
the tea party that are invested
in a better system are they kind

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.540
of paying attention to trying
to fix the legislative process

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.240
and if they are, why
are they less effective

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.160
than what we saw in
the 60's and 70's?

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.290
&gt;&gt; Sarah Binder: Well there was
a great group called Action Not

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:19.090
Gridlock in 93 and 94, it's
paid for by the Labor AFL,

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:23.810
hey it's been a long day AFLCIO
which was trying to build support

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:27.030
for generating a filibuster
reform in the senate.

01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:30.100 position:56%
And I went, Steve Smith and I were
working on a filibuster book we went

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.890
to go and find them in 1995
and the doors were closed.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:37.100
Funding was yanked,
it had disappeared.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.810 position:56%
So, in part, I guess one question is
whether the groups are more closely

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:44.090 position:56%
aligned with parties in their
partisan agenda that would lead them

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:48.090 position:56%
to turn on a dime once they realize
the consequences of particular types

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:51.790
of reform that's one possibility.

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.480
&gt;&gt; Mickey Edwards: Two
things [inaudible].

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.640
One is that both parties
now and most

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.660
of the outside groups there
is far more focus just

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.210
on the executive branch.

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:06.740
You know talk to the agencies,
talk to the departments

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.250
as though they have forgotten you
know the role that congress plays

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:13.050
and that it could be
the final say in that,

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:16.340
I think that's a significant
part of it.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:22.460
The other is that there is -- as
they bring these ideas forward

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.430
about what their causes are
on both sides of the aisle,

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:29.590
on both left issues
and right issues,

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:34.330
too few people now care
at all about process.

01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:37.500
They want the outcome they want
no matter what process it takes

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.140
to get there.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.810
And the result of that is to
undermine the legislative process

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:48.630
as we go along, you know,
and so then the members

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:51.370
of congress start doing
the same thing.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:54.330
I've seen the democrats
did it under Pelosi,

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:56.190
the republicans have done it.

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.990
And that is, this is the
outcome we want and we'll skip --

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:02.430
we'll go around the process
if that's what it takes

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.580
to get the victory and that's
really doing great damage.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.460
You know there has to be a respect

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:11.370
for what the process is
whether it's a justice issue,

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:16.740
whether it is an economic issue
and I don't see that anymore.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.820 position:56%
I mean I gave a talk one time called
does the constitution still matter

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.800
to you and I find not a whole
lot of people who think it does.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.420
You know the constitution
and the ways

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.380
that the legislative process
is supposed to work just seem

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.800
to be almost irrelevant to a lot of
people who want the bill they want.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.360
&gt;&gt; David Obey: Let me
give you an example

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.420
of how important processes can be.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.780
It would be nice if congressional
leadership understood process

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.970
and I've seen time after
time when they didn't.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:55.490
One story, Bill Young
was ranking republican

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:59.090
on the Appropriations Committee
and then he was chairman

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:03.190
of the Appropriations Committee,
he and I were very good friends.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:10.470 position:56%
And during an especially nasty
period when the budget wasn't moving

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:14.660
and appropriations weren't
moving Bill said to me,

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.660
I just have to tell you
something, I said what's up.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:23.250
He said, yesterday I was called
into the speaker's office,

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.040
this was Hastert's office.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.690
And he said, the speaker
said you've got to get

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:31.660 position:56%
down here right away we've got a
revolution on our hands and you have

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.830
to answer some questions.

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:38.210
So, Bill said I went down and I
walk into the speaker's office

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:42.230
and the speaker said to me
with a bunch of tea party types

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:48.530 position:56%
in the room, Bill we've got people
who are very restless about inaction

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:51.980
on the appropriation bill, when can
you start bringing appropriation

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.360
bills to the floor.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.180
And Hastert said or I
mean Bill said to Hastert,

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.000
well first I have to
have an allocation.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.570
By that he meant that
the budget committee had

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:06.710
to give the Appropriations
Committee the dollar number

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:10.070
that the Appropriations
Committee could then divide

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:13.910
up into 13 subcommittees
and move the bills.

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:18.060
And Bill said, well I have
to have an allocation.

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.960
Hastert's response was
what's an allocation.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.720
Now when people that close to power

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.870
in that institution don't know
what the hell they're doing

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:31.790
on a procedural basis
is it any wonder

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.650
that the institution
gets screwed up.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:39.290
&gt;&gt; David Mayhew: On process,
a couple of process points,

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:42.430
there are a couple of things that
for us history of congress folks,

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:44.780
there are possibly a couple
of us to keep in mind.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:51.400 position:56%
One is this the Hastert Rule wherein
the majority party in the house

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:56.370
so going by the likes of its
median member simply dominates.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:13:00.930 position:56%
It snuck up on us, it's norm not a
role, it's a party role, it's a norm

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.620 position:56%
and it's a practice, it's a behavior

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.330
to somewhat degree followed
I suppose as behavior

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.710
on the democratic side,
it kind of snuck up on us.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:12.140 position:56%
I mean the Hastert Rule has got like
what 25 years, something like that,

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.870
I don't know where it
came it's like an implant.

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.160
I think it's an implant that
doesn't really work very well.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.770
I don't think it's a great
way to run the house.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:22.600
The other point is this
on the other filibuster,

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.870
the flagging filibuster
in the senate right now.

01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:29.160
I think it's good for us to
keep in mind as now we're going

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.340
to be considering this
and watching this again

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.560
over the next few years I think
the filibuster stuff in the senate

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.500
that the country and this has
been written about by Shukla Moron

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.440
and by Greg Koger very nicely.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.780 position:56%
It's that the country went for about
200 years without having a hard

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.820
and fast filibuster blockade
practice in the senate, you know,

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:55.360 position:56%
a hard veto point, I mean the hard
veto point where you could just say,

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.050
you don't have 60 votes you're
toast over a whole list of issues.

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:03.190
I mean that's the development of
the 1980's, it just wasn't there

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:06.420
across American history and we
should know that, we should know

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.720
that and we should keep saying it.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.710
It's not in not the constitution,
it's not in the Magna Carta,

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.470
I mean the toughness

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:16.290
of the appellate practice
comes [inaudible] the 1980's.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:23.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matt Glassman: We've got time
for one more quick question, anyone?

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:30.510
Okay well thank you to
our panelists and we are.
