00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.080
Comedian Mike Birbiglia was having trouble
with sleep.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.650
Though not with the actual sleeping part -- one
night, while staying in a hotel, he dreamed

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.120
that a guided missile was on its way to his
bed, and in his dream, he jumped out the window

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.130
to escape it.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.760
Unfortunately, he also did this not in his
dream.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.350
From the second floor.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.440
And the window was not open.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.490
This little episode cost him 33 stitches and
a trip to a sleep specialist.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.870
Mike now sleeps in zipped-up mummy bags for
his own safety.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.990
The lesson here?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.480
Sleep is not some break time when your brain,
or your body, just goes dormant.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
Far from it.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.149
In truth, sleep is just another state of consciousness.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.409
And only in the past few decades have we begun
to really plumb its depths -- from why we

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.760
sleep in the first place, to what goes on
in our brains when we do, to what happens

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.460
when we can’t sleep.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
And there is a lot that science has to say
about your dreams!

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
Talk about weird!

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.539
It’s like Sigmund Freud meets Neil Gaiman.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.440
So, even though it may seem like you’re
dead to the world, when you sleep, your perceptual

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.739
window remains slightly open.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.379
And kinda like Mike Birbiglia’s hotel room
window, a trip through it can make for a pretty

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.379
wild ride.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.790
But for your safety and enjoyment, I’m here
to guide you through this state of consciousness,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.100
where you’ll learn more than a few things
about human mind, including your own.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.159
And here’s hoping you won’t need any stitches
when we’re through.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.689
[INTRO]

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.420
Technically speaking, sleep is a periodic,
natural, reversible and near total loss of

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.359
consciousness, meaning it’s different than
hibernation, being in a coma, or in say, an

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.359
anesthetic oblivion.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.810
Although we spend about a third of our lives
sleeping, and we know that it’s essential

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.590
to our health and survival, there still isn’t
a scientific consensus for why we do it.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.810
Part of it probably has to do with simple
recuperation, allowing our neurons and other

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.619
cells to rest and repair themselves.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.149
Sleep also supports growth, because that’s
when our pituitary glands release growth hormones,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.420
which is why babies sleep all the time.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.299
Plus, sleep has all kinds of benefits for
mental function, like improving memory, giving

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.720
our brains time to process the events of the
day, and boosting our creativity.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.090
But even if we’re not quite sure of all
the reasons why we sleep, technology has given

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.649
us great insight into how we sleep.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.729
And for that we can thank little Armond Aserinsky.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.769
One night in early 1950s Chicago, eight-year-old
Armond was tucked into his bed by his father.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.560
But this night, instead of getting a kiss
on the forehead, little Armond got some electrodes

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.920
taped to his face.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.440
Armond’s dad was Eugene Aserinsky, a grad
student looking to test out a new electroencephalograph,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.110
or EEG machine, that measures the brain’s
electrical activity.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.920
That night, as his son slept peacefully, he
watched the machine go bonkers with brain

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.010
wave patterns, and -- after making sure that
his machine wasn’t somehow broken -- discovered

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.870
that the brain doesn’t just "power down"
during sleep, as most scientists thought.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.349
Instead, he had discovered the sleep stage
we now call REM or rapid eye movement, a perplexing

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.180
period when the sleeping brain is buzzing
with activity, even though the body is in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.180
a deep slumber.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.860
Aserinsky and his colleague Nathaniel Kleitman
went on to become pioneers of sleep research.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.560
Since then, sleep specialists armed with similar
technology have shown that we experience four

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.709
distinct stages of sleep, each defined by
unique brainwave patterns.

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.920
Say you’re just going to bed.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.939
All day your endocrine system has been releasing
“awake” hormones like cortisol.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.629
But with nightfall comes the release of sleepy
melatonin hormones from the pineal gland.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.829
Your brain is relaxed, but still awake, a
level of activity that EEGs measure as alpha

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:16.829
waves.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.560
You’re feeling sleepy, your breath slows,
and suddenly you’re asleep.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.560
This exact moment is clearly evident on an
EEG reading, as those alpha waves immediately

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.959
transition to the irregular non-Rapid Eye
Movement stage one (NREM-1) waves.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.989
It’s in this first stage of sleep you might
experience hypnagogic sensations -- those

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.860
brief moments when you feel like you’re
falling, and your body jerks, startling you.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.680
As you relax more deeply, you move into NREM-2
stage sleep, as your brain starts exhibiting

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.900
bursts of rapid brain wave activity called
sleep spindles.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.120
You’re now definitely asleep, but you could
still be easily awakened.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.670
NREM-3 comes with slow rolling delta waves.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.870
We now know that you can have brief and fragmentary
dreams in the first three stages of sleep,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.079
but eventually you’ll get to the most important
stage: full REM sleep, that famous stage of

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.219
sugarplum slumber that makes eyeballs go nuts,
grants vivid visual dreams, and provided the

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.349
namesake for a certain famous rock band.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.870
REM sleep is kinda paradoxical.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.320
Your motor cortex is jumping all over the
place, but your brainstem is blocking those

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.100
messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed
that you’re basically paralyzed.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.440
Except for your eyes.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.550
That whole sleep cycle repeats itself every
90 minutes or so, transitioning back and forth

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.760
between the stages of sleep.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.640
Obviously sleep is super important, and lack
of sleep is terrible for your health, mental

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.710
ability, and mood.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.200
In fact it’s a predictor for depression,
and has been linked to things like weight

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.880
gain, as your hunger-arousing and -suppressing
hormones get out of whack.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.550
Sleep deprivation also causes immune system
suppression, and slowed reaction time which

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.680
is why you should not drive sleepy.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.910
Of course, a bad night’s sleep here and
there is part of life, but there are a host

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.870
of bona fide sleep disorders out there that
can really make life pretty terrible, or in

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.300
Mike Birbiglia’s case, land you in the emergency
room.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.080
We’ve got insomnia, which is persistent
problems of falling or staying asleep.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.480
And kind of its opposite, narcolepsy, whose
sufferers sometimes experience brief, uncontrollable

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.080
attacks of overwhelming sleepiness, called
“sleep attacks.”

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.260
This, as you can imagine, can get in the way
of all sorts of things that you might enjoy

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.040
doing, like driving, eating, pole-vaulting.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.670
Narcolepsy may have several different causes,
including a deficiency in the neurotransmitter

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.640
hypocretin, which helps keep you awake.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.750
But in more rare cases, brain trauma, infection,
and disease may contribute to it as well.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.980
So, that’s rare, but you probably know someone
with sleep apnea, the disorder that causes

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.910
sleepers to temporarily stop breathing, until
their decreased oxygen levels wake them up.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.280
Birbiglia, meanwhile, turned out to have a
REM sleep behavior disorder, which we don’t

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.670
fully understand yet, but appears to be associated
with a dopamine deficiency.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.660
Then we’ve got night terrors, which are
as terrible as they sound... spurring increased

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.790
heart and breathing rates, screaming, and
thrashing that’s seldom remembered upon

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.790
waking.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.600
Night terrors are most common in children
under seven, and may be spurred by stress,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.160
fatigue, sleep deprivation, and sleeping in
unfamiliar surroundings.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.610
Much like sleepwalking and sleeptalking, night
terrors occur during the NREM-3 stage of sleep,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.320
and are NOT the same as nightmares, which
occur, like most dreaming, during REM sleep.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.400
But oh, in REM sleep, what dreams may come...

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.740
There you are, running naked as your teeth
fall out, being chased down the beach by a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.910
Matt Damon centaur.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.150
You wake up, feel around your mouth thinking
what?

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.150
What?

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.150
What?!

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.150
WHAT?!

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.580
Welcome to your dreams, those vivid, emotional
images racing through your sleeping brain,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.790
often providing a backdrop so bizarre that
it may seem like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.980
and Tim Burton are trying to out-weird each
other in a film festival.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.710
A really, really long festival, considering
the average person spends about six years

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.050
of their lives dreaming.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.120
So yeah, sometimes you have really crazy dreams.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.450
But mostly, your average dream usually just
sort of unpacks and reshuffles what you did

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.450
that day.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.360
For example last night I dreamt about Tumblr,
cause I spent a lot of time on Tumblr yesterday.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.820
If you played Tetris all afternoon, you might
dream of blocks falling from the sky.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.220
If something traumatic happened to you, your
brain might provide you with a nightmare to

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.040
help extinguish your daytime fears - Thanks,
brain!

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.770
Then again...you might be unable to stop dreaming
about the trauma, which we’ll look at in

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.460
the future when we discuss post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.240
Our two-track minds of course allow us to
register more stimuli than we outwardly acknowledge

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.380
during the day, and in that way, the sounds
of car alarms or stinky dog farts that you

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.970
might not even have noticed may get incorporated
into your dream, too.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.920
And that’s all interesting and weird and
sometimes a little gross, but what’s the

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.780
real purpose of dreaming?

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.020
Whyyy do we do this?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.930
Well, as you might have guessed, there’s
more than one idea out there…

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.940
The study of dreams is is a mix of neuroscience
and psychology known as oneirology.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.570
Oneiros is the Greek for dream, and if you’re
a Neil Gaiman fan you may recognize it as

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.090
one of the Sandman’s many names.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.750
The one that comes with a toga and Orpheus’s
head.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.280
But Sandman aside, if you want to talk dreams,
we might want to start with our old friend

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280
Freud.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.470
In his landmark 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams, Freud proposed that our dreams

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.570
offer us wish-fulfillment.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.270
He thought a dream’s manifest content, the
stuff you remember in the morning, was a sort

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.780
of censored and symbolic version of whatever
inner conflict was really going on in that

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.090
dream’s unconscious, or latent, content.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.180
Not surprisingly, the wish-fulfillment theory
lacks scientific chops and has for the most

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.340
part fallen out of favor -- because, really,
you can interpret a dream any way you want.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.620
Like, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.510
Luckily we have some other theories to consider.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.990
The information processing theory proposes
that our dreams help us sort out and process

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.570
the day’s events and fix them into our memories.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.340
This may be particularly important when it
comes to learning and remembering new information,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.300
and some studies show that people recall new
tasks better after a good REM sleep full of

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.300
dreams.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.010
But if brainwave readings show us anything,
it’s that there’s a lot going on in your

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:39.070
brain when you dream, and the physiological
function theory suggests that dreaming may

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.539
promote neural development and preserve neural
pathways by providing the brain with stimulation.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.529
When our brains are stimulated, they expand
their connections more.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:51.279
So, babies, for example, spend much of their
sleep time dreaming, perhaps in part to help

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.439
their brain circuitry develop more quickly.

00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:56.889
This is similar to the idea that dreams are
part of our cognitive development.

00:08:56.889 --> 00:09:00.939
By this model, dreams draw on our knowledge
and understanding of the world, mimicking

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:04.920
reality, and engaging those same brain networks
that light up when we daydream.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.939
And finally, there are theories that focus
on the way REM sleep triggers neural activity,

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:13.660
and the idea that dreams are just sort of
accidental side-effects, the brain’s attempt

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.850
to weave a story out of a bunch of random
sights, emotions, and memories -- which is

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.910
how in dreamland you might actually marry
that Matt Damon centaur and give birth to

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.180
a baby with banana fingers and a raccoon tail.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.820
For now scientists continue to debate the
function of dreams, but one thing we know

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.510
for sure is that REM sleep is vital, both
biologically and psychologically.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.930
But, hey, you think your dreams are nut-bar?

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.750
Next week, we’re looking at other altered
states of consciousness, where you’ll learn

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.279
what your brain really looks like on drugs,
and whether you can actually hypnotize someone

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:46.399
to do your evil bidding… or just act like
