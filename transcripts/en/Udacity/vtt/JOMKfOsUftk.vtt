This conic section would just be a circle. Great work if you chose that one.

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:09.668
Just like before, we want to get the X squared term on the same side as the y

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:14.902
squared term. So we can add x squared to both sides of the equation to get this

00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:19.240
equation. Now, you might not be used to seeing, the y squared term come first,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.084
and in fact, we can reverse the order of addition since it's commutative. Two

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.764
plus one would be the same thing as one plus two. So y squared plus x squared

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:33.275
is the same as x squared plus y squared. And just to be sure, I'll show you

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.155
each of these equations graphed, so we see that they represent the same exact

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:41.442
circle. This is the first one, this is the second one, and this is the third

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:46.410
one. All three circles are exactly the same.
