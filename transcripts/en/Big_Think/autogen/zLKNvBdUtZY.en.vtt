00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.180
I’m almost as embarrassed by the word spirituality
as every other atheist.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.100
It’s not – I’m not comfortable with
my use of it.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.140
The problem is – and this is a problem you
almost never encounter in English.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.359
We just don’t have a good word for this
domain.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:24.310
We just do not have a good word for the project
of taking seriously the notion that you could

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.560
become like Jesus or become like the Buddha
or become someone who inhabits the far end

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.750
of the positive side of the continuum of human
psychology and human well-being.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.220
And someone who can have really radical insights
into the nature of consciousness by virtue

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.320
of a disciplined practice like meditation.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.340
So to talk about things like awe and well-being
and love and positive psychology and happiness,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.520
that doesn’t get at how deep and rarified
this project can be.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.000
It also doesn’t link it to the traditional
context in which people have pursued similar

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
projects.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.530
So there is a point of contact between what
I’m talking about and, you know, what a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.030
Tibetan Lama is doing in a cave for five years.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.670
I mean it’s very explicit.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.520
Most of these teachings come out of traditions
like Buddhism.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.750
So while I argue that we have to get out of
the religion business and the doctrines that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.909
have framed most people’s discussion of
these experiences are as unwarranted as I’ve

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.690
always said.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.440
There is no alternative term for the efforts
that people can make through meditation or

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.770
psychedelics or some other means to really
transform their consciousness and have insight

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.660
into the – it’s intrinsic selfless nature.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.080
And it’s inconvenient but I feel like the
other words that are available are even spookier,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.700
something like mysticism, you know, or more
specific like contemplation, the contemplative

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
life.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.110
I use contemplative a fair amount but again
that doesn’t get at for most people what

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.209
the subject matter is.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.020
So for better or worse I’m just – I’m
trying to rehabilitate the word spirituality.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.280
I mean one burden I think we have is to reclaim
good and powerful words no matter how they’ve

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.730
been misused in the past, no matter what the
inconvenient details of their etymology is.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.750
So I would say spirituality is one of those
words.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.930
But a word like evil is also spooky for many
people.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.459
It’s felt that evil is a holdover from religion.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.970
When religious people talk about evil they’re
thinking about things like Satan and a force

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.370
that is somehow not to be understood in scientific
or naturalistic terms.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.069
And it’s thought, I think, rightly that
once we understand psychopathy at the level

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.780
of the brain fully we will have a discussion
of evil that will seem to erode any basis

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.500
for using this spooky word.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.280
But I think to lose the word evil would be
unfortunate and would disempower smart people

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.200
from making strong moral claims and fighting
a war of ideas on this front.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.060
And so we need potent words.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.430
We just need to be precise about how we use
them and the kinds of experiences that merit

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.870
their use.
