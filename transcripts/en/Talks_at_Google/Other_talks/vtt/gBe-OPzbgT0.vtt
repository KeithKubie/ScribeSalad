FEMALE SPEAKER: Alyssa Goodman
is the Robert Wheeler Wilson

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.930
Professor of Applied
Astronomy a Harvard University

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.480
and a research associate of
the Smithsonian Institution.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.530
Goodman's research
and teaching interests

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.780
span astronomy,
data visualization,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.370
and online systems for
research in education.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.386
We're really honored
to have Alyssa

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.260
talk about the WorldWide
Telescope Initiative

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.310
today at Harvard.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.830
And without further ado,
I want to welcome Alyssa.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.240
Thank you so much for joining.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.323
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Thank you.

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:29.409
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.770
ALYSSA GOODMAN: I
don't need that, right?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.540
Hi.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.310
Well, welcome,
everybody who's here

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.050
and the many people
who I understand

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.910
can't walk in the rain.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.770
California.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.830
So anyway, you're
probably wondering

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.151
why there's a picture of
Chicago on the screen.

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:46.650
I'm curious.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.025
Does anybody here
have any reason

00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:50.040
why there's a picture of
Chicago on the screen?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.540
OK.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.080
So that means
probably none of you

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.900
were involved in the
meeting that gave birth

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.760
to WorldWide Telescope.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.510
So before I continue, can I
just ask-- raise your hand

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.376
if you have an interest in
astronomy for some reason.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:04.709
Just about everyone in the room.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.910
OK.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.200
Now I know why you came.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.760
OK.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.970
Raise your hand if
you work for Google.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.250
Almost everyone.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.750
OK.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.820
Not quite.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.390
And raise your hand if you're
interested in writing code

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.849
for open source projects?

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:18.390
A few of you.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.080
Excellent.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.090
OK, good.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.730
All right.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.130
My goal in this talk is to
explain the interesting history

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.740
of how this project known
as WorldWide Telescope

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.030
came to be and tell you
where I think it's heading.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.450
And hopefully, many people here
at Google and around the world

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200
are going to be inspired to
contribute to what is already

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.290
a very large project.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.000
But the bottom line
is that this project

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.560
went open source
a few months ago

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.710
and is hopefully going to become
a very big worldwide effort

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.680
that will let the public share
in the joy that is astronomy.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.780
So let me tell you very quickly
how I wound up standing here

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.490
and what WorldWide
Telescope has meant to me.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.360
So the first picture
that you see here

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.250
on the left, this picture is
my friend and colleague Curtis

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.039
Wong.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.840
And then this picture is me.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.360
And we were at a meeting, the
first astronomy visualization

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.430
meaning that either Curtis
or I had ever gone to,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.040
in Chicago in 2005.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.745
And we were both sent
there by friends.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.390
It was almost like being
fixed up on a blind date.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.220
So we were sent
there by friends who

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
thought that we would both
enjoy a little respite

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.000
from our normal
meeting schedule.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.250
And let's go this fun astronomy
visualization meeting.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.249
Because I have interest
in both of those things,

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.980
but never in
specifically outreach

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.760
and that kind of
visualization in astronomy.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.940
And Curtis Wong had
done a lot of work

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.570
using cutting edge
media to tell stories

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.320
about interesting subjects.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.380
So he made an incredible
CD-ROM about Leonardo da Vinci

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.344
that some of you may have seen.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.010
Another one about the
Barnes Foundation.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.930
But anyway, he's all about
integrating audio, and video,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.880
and data, and text, and
all kinds of information

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.580
in as seamless an environment
as you can possibly

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.700
offer for somebody to explore
and learn on their own.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.740
So at this meeting,
I was talking

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.800
about a new project
we had started where

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.320
we were using medical
imaging software

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.691
on high dimensional
astronomy data.

00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:24.190
And that's not something I'm
going to talk much about today.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.140
Ask me afterwards if you
want to know more about it.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.210
We're still doing it.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.480
We have a new software
effort on that separate

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.120
from WorldWide
Telescope called GLUE.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.910
That's a high dimensional
data visualization program.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.130
But Curtis was talking
about this dream

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.890
that he had to take all this
astronomy data that was online

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.910
and make it available
to people as kind

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.450
of a substrate for a program
that would let you move

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.170
through the sky or
through the universe

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.110
and tell stories about
astronomy and about the universe

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.160
to each other.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.070
And the idea was
that you would build

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.360
these tours of the universe
where an object in the sky

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.720
would be almost like a
weird little celestial

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.384
hyperlink, where you
could be at that object

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:06.800
and you could be
there because you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.258
were trying to
learn about nebulae,

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:10.216
but somehow, something
about that object

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.590
would reveal that,
actually, it's

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.102
also in the catalogue of
somebody named Messier

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:15.560
and that this is
somehow important.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.732
And you could learn about
the Messier catalogue.

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:19.940
When I show you the software
the now actually exists,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.231
you'll see a little bit more
of what I'm talking about.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:26.000
But basically, Curtis
described this dream

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.130
that he had that
wasn't yet a reality.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.550
And I told him that
that sounded great

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.130
and that I would basically
help him if he ever did that.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.240
And so, in the end, he did
get a chance to do that.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.310
I'll tell you more
about that later.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.170
And the software
was coded mostly

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.640
by one unbelievable
software architect

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.684
named Jonathan Fay, who I will
tell you more about later.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:50.600
You're not going to
believe-- maybe you will--

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.000
but that this was made
mostly by one person.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.880
Anyway, so in 2005,
this was just a dream.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.450
By 2008-- and the
meeting was in Chicago.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.430
And then a young
six-year-old in Chicago

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.102
used the software to make
a tour, which I'll show you

00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:06.560
in a minute, one of these tours
inside WorldWide Telescope.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.220
Tell us about what
he sees in Chicago.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.290
And then by about
2010, the software

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.190
was so capable that it was
used by the Adler Planetarium

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.280
in Chicago to make a
completely digital planetarium

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.640
show for what turned out to
be about 1/10 the cost of what

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.750
a planetarium show
normally costs to produce.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.691
And then, about a year
ago, it became clear

00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:35.190
that it was going to be possible
to make WorldWide Telescope

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.970
open source.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.990
I'll tell you more
about the details later.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.045
But it had been seven
years since it started.

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:41.870
And Microsoft had spent
about $10 million.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.240
I forgot to mention that Curtis
Wong and Jonathan Fay worked

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.910
at Microsoft Research.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.810
And so this project,
which is now open source,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.160
did start at Microsoft Research.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.300
So yes, I feel honored
to be coming to Google

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.100
and telling you
about a project that

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.880
started at Microsoft Research
that you can participate in

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.310
if you'd like.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.620
Anyway, so we had this meeting.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.312
There's a series of meetings
in astronomy called .Astronomy,

00:06:06.312 --> 00:06:08.270
which is for people who
are interested in using

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.030
the internet to both do
astronomy research and outreach

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.820
and also education.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.190
And so at the annual
meeting last year,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.349
which was oddly enough at the
Adler Planetarium in Chicago,

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.890
we made a video that
you can go watch

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.556
about how much everybody
loves WorldWide

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:25.780
Telescope to introduce
it to the world

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.730
as a project that was
about to go open source.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.250
But what I want
to do is I think I

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.450
want to start by just showing
you one tour before I really

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.880
explain what the structure
of all of our efforts are.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.220
And I promise I'll give you
a little bit of astronomy

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.780
and a little bit of politics and
where this stands as an effort.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.947
But I'll try to
weave them together.

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:51.530
So here we go.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.830
Let's look.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.757
This is the program.

00:06:53.757 --> 00:06:55.340
And I'm going to
show you lots of what

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.720
it can do as we go along.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.201
I'm not going to try to
show all of it to you now.

00:06:59.201 --> 00:06:59.700
OK.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.760
So if I go here on the WorldWide
Telescope Ambassadors site

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.740
and I go to Tours,
then I should be

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.340
able to open all
these YouTube videos.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.491
And we'll go down
to the Ring Nebula.

00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:15.990
OK.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.364
So I'll scroll through these,
and you can have some idea.

00:07:18.364 --> 00:07:22.010
There are all these tours that
are featured on the Ambassador

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.800
site.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.660
But one thing I
should explain is

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.560
that anybody can make a tour.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.390
And then, you can share
it with other people.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.160
You don't have to put
it on the website.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.400
So let's just-- sorry.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.690
This is what happens when
you try to search and talk

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.160
at the same time.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.140
Let's see if we
go one more page,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.700
I think it's
probably under "the."

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.050
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBAK]

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.090
-I am six years old,
and I live here.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.940
Actually, I live over here
in a big city called Toronto.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.090
On clear nights, when
I look up in the sky,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.310
I see something like this.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.970
The tour I want
to take you on is

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.840
of the Ring Nebula,
which Wikipedia,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.490
the free encyclopedia,
also calls M57.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.530
I don't know what
that means really,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.530
but I think it's like
a jewel in the sky.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.720
The Ring Nebula is in the
constellation of Lyra.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.909
Lyra is also where the
brightest star in the sky is.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.880
This star is called Vega.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:51.070
The Ring Nebula is a little
ways away from Vega over here.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.170
My dad says that he
doesn't think the Ring

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.020
Nebula is too far away.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.210
I read that it's 2,300
light years away,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.910
which seems like a very
long bike ride. [LAUGHTER]

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.640
This is not how I
see the Ring Nebula.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.130
I see it like this.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.900
The Ring Nebula was discovered
a long time ago by someone

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.020
in France.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.465
This picture of the
nebula is beautiful.

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:15.410
It looks like a
precious blue gem

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.570
in the middle of some
red, orangey stuff that

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.310
looks like fire.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.140
I read that's because
different gases give off

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.380
different colors.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.410
You can see green,
yellow, red, and blue.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.250
A nebula is what happens when
a star like our sun dies.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.050
It lets out its remaining
energy and expands,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.730
making lots of pretty
pieces that one day can

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.980
become planets.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.800
I think it's neat that stars
can be so amazing for so long.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.630
I wonder what Vega will
look like when it dies.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.260
That's my tour.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.767
I hope you liked it as
much as I liked making it.

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:55.600
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.610
ALYSSA GOODMAN: OK.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.280
So that is just a video.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.500
But importantly, what I
was showing you over here

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.920
is the actual tour.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.790
And I am sorry that we don't
have sound working completely

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.800
correctly because the tour
itself is interactive.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.312
So if I hit play and then I
start going through the tour,

00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:17.770
I just want you to see that
it's basically just this series

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.680
of slides up here at the top.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.990
And at any point, I could just
stop the tour and move around.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.680
So I could investigate
the surface of the Earth.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.331
I could investigate the sky.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:32.830
All right.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.950
So anyway, the tour
is itself interactive.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.550
And the video versions
are just to be

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.830
able to share the tours with
people in a very easy way.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.199
But what we noticed
from the early tours

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:46.990
that people started to
create is that there

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.119
was this educational opportunity
because kids, in particular,

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:52.410
were willing to really put
themselves out there and say

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.951
things that they
might not be able to

00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:57.670
or not be willing to say in
something like a PowerPoint

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.500
presentation or a poster that
is the standard kind of thing

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.530
that they do in astronomy
units in school.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.791
And so if you listen
carefully-- many of you

00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:06.040
said you know about astronomy.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.540
If you listen to
what Benjamin says,

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.320
he says, some guy in
France, who's Messier.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.060
And then he says, M87.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.275
And he says, well, I don't
know what that means.

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:15.650
And I don't know
who this guy is.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.672
And so what the role
of the ambassadors is,

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:19.630
is to sort of connect
that kind of information,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.800
to tell him, yes, some
nebulae are when a star dies.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.250
But other nebulae are
when stars are being born.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.570
And so anyway, that
was the whole start

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.490
of our WorldWide Telescope
Ambassadors outreach program.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.910
But what I can tell you today
is that WorldWide Telescope

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.570
is useful in many,
many more settings

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.480
besides public outreach.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.930
So I'm going to give you a taste
of all of the different ways

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.470
that we've used it to date.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.980
But because I don't have time to
demonstrate the entire program

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.094
for you, I'm just going to leave
this panel up for a second,

00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:51.760
and go through it,
and tell you that you

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.396
can navigate the universe
in three dimensions.

00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:55.520
And I do mean the universe.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.103
You can go all the
way out to the edge

00:11:57.103 --> 00:11:59.960
of the observable
universe back in time.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.600
You can look at the Earth.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.090
You can add data to
the Earth or the sky.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.800
You saw before we started
that you can navigate around

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.000
on the surface of Mars.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.060
And you can, importantly,
switch back and forth

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.580
between the
three-dimensional views

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.480
and two-dimensional views of
the universe to let people

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.620
know what various phenomena
look like on the sky.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.290
So officially, the
title of this talk

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.320
is Open Source on
a Universal Scale.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.380
And the idea is
that this program

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.580
has been downloaded as an
application something like 15

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.760
to 20 million times.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.580
We lost count at one point.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.110
And the number of online
users in just a web browser

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.290
is also extremely
difficult to count.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.390
But it's in the many tens if not
hundreds of millions of uses.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.660
So a lot of people
are using this

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.140
for a lot of different
purposes, but we still

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.820
think that much
more could be done.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.620
So let me explain some
context by going back

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.610
to the history of
astronomy and tell you

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.740
where these kind of
virtual skies came from.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.940
So if you think
about Stonehenge,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.740
OK, that's where we get
the 3,500 years ago.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.930
That was clearly
one of the earliest

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.730
astronomy observatories.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.600
No telescopes.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.570
And then this picture of
Ptolemy in Alexandria--

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.850
looks like he has a telescope.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.110
But we should all remember
that Ptolemy was just

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.770
looking through a
tube and mapping out

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.530
the positions of stars and
that people started coming up

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.110
with theories for how
the heavens worked

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.970
at about that time.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.761
Ptolemy was the one
with all the epicycles,

00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:31.740
for those of you who
know what that is.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.010
And then people built fancier
and fancier facilities

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.960
for observing the heavens.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.210
But still no telescopes until
Galileo came along a little

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.190
over 400 years ago
at point a telescope,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.230
which was then a new
gizmo, at the sky.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.872
And he learned a lot of things.

00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:50.830
You saw, at the beginning,
I was playing around

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.610
with the WorldWide
Telescope tour that

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.780
explains how important
Galileo's discovery of the moons

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.360
of Jupiter was to our
understanding of the Earth's

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.960
place and the Sun's place
in the solar system.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.730
So again, then something
tremendously important

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.030
happened right around
the time of Galileo.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.720
You have this shift in science
to a data-driven approach

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.190
where your theories have
to be actually verified

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.550
by observations.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.730
And astronomy was a big
part of that transition.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.000
And so if we skip way ahead
to the 1930s, the reason

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.820
that there's a picture
of a radio telescope

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.820
there is because that
was when people stopped

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.530
using optical wavelengths.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.440
So the wavelengths we can see
with our eyes, how many people

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.620
think about astronomy, are
called optical wavelengths.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.740
And so the first
foray out of that

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.310
was with radio
astronomy in the 1930s.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.940
And a lot of that technology
was developed hand-in-hand

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.520
with radar.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.831
That's where that came from.

00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:47.330
OK.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.391
So then, the next big milestone
was to leave the Earth.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:51.890
OK.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.620
So the first
space-based observatory

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.680
was NASA's Explorer 7.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.950
So that was now 1959.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.030
And then, something that is
most important here at Google,

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.780
comes the advent
of the internet.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.990
And what's really interesting
to me is that the first thing

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.780
people thought about when they
thought about the internet

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.130
and astronomy was, wow, we
don't have go on observing

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.760
and stay up all night anymore.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.170
We're going to build
these robotic telescopes,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.680
and we don't have to
actually go there.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.910
We can just have instruments
take data for us, which,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.710
while a good idea and
important in astronomy today,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.120
is not actually
the real potential

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.560
of the internet for astronomy.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.850
The real potential
is in data sharing.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.350
OK.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:40.230
And in doing research using
vast, vast repositories now

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.210
of online data.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.980
And someone asked a question
over the internet about-- I

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.480
think in the abstract
for this talk,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.920
I mentioned that astronomy data
were economically valueless.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.680
And that's why--
yes-- and that's

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.890
why a lot of computer
scientists love

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.080
to work with astronomers
because there's not

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.920
a lot of economic
politics that go along

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.910
with sharing data in astronomy.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.420
And the person asking
the question online

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.013
did point out that,
yes, astronomy data

00:16:09.013 --> 00:16:11.070
have been very important
in navigation and things

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.570
like that.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.690
So indirectly, astronomy
has some economic value.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.630
But most astronomy
data can be thought

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:23.050
of as valueless in an economic
way and very easy to share.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.480
So anyway, that's
way astronomers

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.007
are often thought of as in
the forefront of data sharing.

00:16:28.007 --> 00:16:30.590
I'll tell you a little bit more
about the politics of what all

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.377
those logos mean down there.

00:16:32.377 --> 00:16:34.710
But let me just say that I
think that this dividing line

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.500
between pre-telescopic
and telescopic observing

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.050
is as important
as the opportunity

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.111
that we have now, where there's
all of this astronomy data

00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:44.610
online.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.030
And I think the way
that astronomy is done

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.407
has just completely changed.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.240
And just for fun, I
thought I would give you

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.930
some idea of the financial
numbers involved.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.870
So just before Galileo
and his telescope,

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.300
Tycho Brahe built two
observatories with money

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.970
from the King of Denmark.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.050
And the cost of one
of these observatories

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.240
was said to be 1% of the gross
domestic product of Denmark.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.950
OK.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.040
And then, by the way, it was
kind of too windy at that one,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.539
so they had to build
the second one.

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:15.660
And nobody talks about
how much that costs.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.040
But anyway, so
then-- what is that?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.310
That's 29 years later, Galileo
comes along and disrupts

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.640
this system and starts
using a telescope.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.140
OK.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.420
So now, how much did the
Keck Observatory cost?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.480
So this is a big,
modern telescope,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.720
the first of its kind in
terms of being really big,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.890
expensive, 8-meter
class telescopes.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.891
And that's I think the 0.00002%
of the GDP of the United

00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:40.390
States.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.790
And this is still considered
an extremely expensive project.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.130
Well, all the modern things
are even more expensive.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:52.570
Anyway, but just for reference,
if you add 29 years to that,

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.360
you would get 2024.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.110
And I think that it will
be possible to essentially

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.960
have full sky virtual
astronomy at every wavelength

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.690
that we know about
by about 2024.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.680
We almost have it now.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.180
OK.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.170
So the very best
data, the newest data,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.620
data taken for special
purposes, they're not usually

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.570
immediately shared.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.827
But almost everything
else actually is.

00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.910
And so you should know,
if you don't already know,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.730
that Google is actually
involved in this big project

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.020
called the LSST, the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.240
that surveys the whole sky
essentially every three nights,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.980
and can look for
time varying sources.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.410
And all of this data is
just an absolute gold mine

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.300
for basically data mining
and trying to understand how

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.080
the universe changes with time.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.530
But most astronomers
are not very well

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.340
equipped to deal with that
kind of big data science.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.040
So there's a big
effort in astronomy

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.270
to try to bring the
techniques of data science

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.710
and visualization more
into the mainstream of how

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.500
people do science.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.192
And WorldWide Telescope is a
little bit of a part of that.

00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:56.900
What I won't talk
about very much today--

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.560
but if you're interested
in that aspect of changing

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.770
the culture and all these
other tools for data

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.170
sharing and data
visualization, go check out

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.340
our larger group effort, which
is called Seamless Astronomy.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.940
And it has to do with bringing
data and literature together

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.920
into the hands of a
researcher without them

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.452
having to worry exactly
about where it came from.

00:19:15.452 --> 00:19:17.160
But today, I'm going
to talk about what's

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.730
just in this little
shaky blue square, which

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.850
is these tools for
getting to the data

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.920
and looking at it in
the context of the sky.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.170
So the name,
WorldWide Telescope,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.060
comes from an article that was
written by Alec Szaley and Jim

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.422
Gray in 2001.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.130
And I'll just read
the introduction here.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.380
It says, "All astronomy
data and literature

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.460
will soon be online and
accessible via the internet.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.870
The community is building
the Virtual Observatory,

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.870
an organization of
this worldwide data

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.910
into a coherent whole that
can be accessed by anyone

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.940
in any form from anywhere.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.780
The resulting system
will dramatically

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.740
improve our ability to do
multi-spectral and temporal

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.810
studies that integrate data
from multiple instruments.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.930
The Virtual
Observatory data also

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.940
provide a wonderful base
for teaching astronomy,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.780
scientific discovery, and
computational science."

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:10.280
So there's the abstract of
my talk, but written in 2001.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.350
Now, what's important
is-- how many people here

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.840
know what the Virtual
Observatory is,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.980
what that means?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.480
Yeah.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.020
Just a few of the kind of
professional astronomer types.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.530
And so there's a whole
political back story

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.220
that I'm not going to go into
except for the importance of it

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.650
toward data sharing
and the future.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.130
And so the extremely short
summary of this story

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.730
is that in 2001, not only
was that article written,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.420
but the Virtual
Observatory that they're

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.880
talking about in the article
was a government-sponsored NSF

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.230
program to try to build
the infrastructure

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.040
to make this vision possible.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.430
And the reason
Jim Gray's picture

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.570
is on there is because
he's one of the co-authors

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.367
of this original article.

00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:54.700
And he's one of the inspirations
for WorldWide Telescope

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.340
that I'll explain in a second.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.840
OK.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.540
So in 2002, many countries we're
trying to have these Virtual

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.600
Observatory efforts.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.110
And so they joined together to
make a standards body basically

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.620
called the IVOA or the
International Virtual

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.600
Observatory Alliance.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.070
And then in 2007,
two projects started.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.899
One was called Google Sky.

00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:18.940
And the other one was
called WorldWide Telescope.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.050
So raise your hand if
you've used Google Sky.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.800
Almost, but not
quite, everybody.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.940
Raise your hand if you
worked on Google Sky.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.540
No one.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.040
OK.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.520
So Google Sky is not
officially supported by Google

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.500
anymore as far as I know.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.610
And I don't really want to
say this, but I have to.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.410
So at one of these
meetings in Chicago,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.640
the team from
Google Sky was there

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.010
and the team from WorldWide
Telescope was there.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.260
And they basically-- Google
Sky conceded defeat by-- yes,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.640
some Googlers are nodding for
those of you can't see them.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.740
But anyway, by saying,
you guys built a Harley

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.460
and we built a chop shop.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.245
So go have fun with your Harley.

00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:02.870
And actually, what I'm going to
tell you at the end of the talk

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.790
today is that I think we should
turn a Harley into a chop shop

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.950
a little bit more.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.810
So you'll see what happens.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.630
But anyway, in 2007,
some of you may

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.890
remember Jim Gray was a
great database pioneer.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.261
And he disappeared at sea.

00:22:16.261 --> 00:22:18.260
And there was this worldwide
effort to find him.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.800
And he was never found.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.710
But as a tribute to
Jim Gray, Bill Gates

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.300
gave Curtis Wong
and Jonathan Fay

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.350
the permission to go ahead and
work very hard on this dream

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.400
of WorldWide Telescope.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.270
So this is why Jim's
picture is on the slide.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.680
And Google Sky came out first
because WorldWide Telescope

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.470
was very guarded.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.690
And they didn't want
to release the software

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.000
before it was done.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.340
But anyway, I used to have
to go around and explain

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.190
that WorldWide Telescope was
like Google Sky only better

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.480
and that even though
I'm a big Apple Machead,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.200
I was working with
Microsoft because it

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.272
was this amazing stuff.

00:22:50.272 --> 00:22:52.230
But I don't really have
to explain that anymore

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.930
because now it's an
open source project.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:54.430
OK.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:23:00.230
So then, the government effort
was not managed optimally.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.960
And the project was
canceled in 2014

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.920
even though, actually,
much more money had

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.990
been awarded in the interim.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.540
And that's why the
logo had changed.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.520
But what's important is
that also in 2014 and then

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.780
ultimately 2015,
Microsoft Research

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.530
agreed to open source
WorldWide Telescope.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.750
So that's why we have
the little GitHub thing.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.020
So the two things that are going
are the standards, the IVOA,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.220
and the software project
WorldWide Telescope.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.060
So just for reference, this is
what Google Sky looks like now.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.850
You can still try to use it on
the web, and it still works.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.320
It just only does what it
did in, I believe, 2011.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.089
And just for fun, I went and
looked up the Wikipedia page

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:44.630
for Google Sky to see if I could
figure out a little bit more

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.370
about the history
before coming here.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.360
And I noticed this phrase,
which I and no one at Microsoft,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.410
as far as I know, put
in the Wikipedia page.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.730
You can go look at the history.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.800
It says, "It's
facing competition

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.410
from Microsoft's
WorldWide Telescope."

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.670
And then I thought,
where did that come from?

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.600
So I clicked on the
little reference.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.310
And it's this article it says,
Microsoft's online telescope

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.816
blasts Google out of the sky.

00:24:05.816 --> 00:24:10.300
So you can understand how
odd I feel standing here.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.440
But thank you, again,
[? Tory, ?] for inviting me.

00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:15.390
All right.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.556
So now, you're getting a
little bit-- let's get back

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:20.440
into the software and what
it can actually do and stop

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.542
talking about politics.

00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:23.500
But for those of you who
didn't know the story,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.481
I thought it was
important to tell you.

00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:25.980
OK.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.460
So let's talk about this.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:27.960
OK.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.109
So the last thing
before-- sorry.

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:31.650
I will tell you one
more thing, which

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.820
is just that you
can go to GitHub

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.314
and you can actually
get the code.

00:24:35.314 --> 00:24:36.980
And I know some of
you are going to ask.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.070
So it's at MIT open
source license.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.890
And again, Microsoft was working
on this for about seven years

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.760
to the tune of
about $10 million.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.450
And the really
important thing is

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.010
to give credit to the two
main people at Microsoft who

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.350
made this happen, who are
Jonathan Fay and Curtis Wong.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.580
I'm just their pet
astronomer friend.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.140
OK.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.790
I've done a lot, but
not written any code.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.440
So one of the things that fell
to me was when the software was

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.190
open sourced, there was a call
for interest and participation

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.750
that was issued by the
American Astronomical Society,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.940
the main society in
astronomy in the US.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.460
And I'll explain their role
a little bit more later.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.240
But a lot of people
weren't familiar

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.220
in the professional community
with WorldWide Telescope even

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.900
in the academic
education community

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.210
because they thought it was
just this outreach tool.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.084
And I've shown it to
you as an outreach tool.

00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:29.090
But let me show you
some more about what

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.510
you would tell research
astronomers and educators

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.940
at a higher level, at
a university level,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.870
for example, what they would
do with WorldWide Telescope.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.120
So I'm just going to flip
through this pretty quickly.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.620
You've seen a little
bit about what

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.780
the interface looks
like from me showing you

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.540
the program a minute ago.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.750
But I'll show you
what you can do.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.290
OK.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.610
So one important point
that I made earlier

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.920
is that you can actually run
this program in a browser.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.340
And so let me just go ahead
and do that for you now.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.230
So if you go to the
WorldWide Telescope web page

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.107
and you just click on this thing
that says Run the Web Client,

00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:09.565
here we are in
WorldWide Telescope.

00:26:09.565 --> 00:26:11.320
I'll make the screen bigger.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.200
And I personally work
on star formation.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.170
And in star formation,
we're interested in the gas

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.720
and the dust that forms stars.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.660
And so, I prefer to look
at the universe this way.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.390
But some people
like to understand

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.120
what that dusty
orange glowy stuff is

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.300
in the context of the stars,
so I can set an optical image

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.600
as the background.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.240
And then, I can set
that infrared image

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.440
as the foreground.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.370
And I actually can just
then fade back and forth

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.140
between an optical and
infrared view of the sky.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.510
And I could do that for
any set of all sky surveys.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.160
And there are many that are
already in WorldWide Telescope.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.580
So let me just leave us in
Orion there for a minute.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.550
And I could bring up this
thing called the Finder Scope.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.050
And so I can just click
anywhere in the sky.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.230
And then, I can go here.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.910
And I can ask for information.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.510
And I could look up the
Orion Nebula on Wikipedia.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.060
Or I could look up all the
professional publications

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.145
that have ever been written
about Orion on a data service.

00:27:16.145 --> 00:27:17.770
A lot of this is in
the slides that I'm

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.540
going to show you, so
let me stop demoing.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.240
I think I've made my point
that this runs on the web.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.990
And let me tell you that
the creation of these tours

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.340
gets a lot more
sophisticated than what

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.790
you saw from the six-year-old,
even though we love

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.010
when six-year-olds make tours.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.490
And so this is a
tour that I won't

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.750
show you the whole
thing of, but this

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.416
is sort of a little
insider view of what

00:27:39.416 --> 00:27:40.870
it looks like to make a tour.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.620
It's a tour about a very famous
astronomer who, unfortunately,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.400
died an untimely death.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.880
His name is John Huchra.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.590
And Bob Kirshner and
some other people and I

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.550
made this tour as
a tribute to John.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.400
And we used just
about every feature

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.720
that WorldWide Telescope
has in making this tour.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.630
So there's 3D data.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:58.590
There's 2D data.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.170
There's links to literature.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.060
All kinds of things.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.643
And so I'm not going to take the
time to show that to you now,

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:06.600
but if you get interested in
this, go check out that tour.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.780
And again, we did post
the tour to YouTube.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.620
And the only sad thing about
posting a tour to YouTube

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.040
is that you lose this ability
to use it interactively.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.680
So let me just take one
little jump out of here

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.780
again to show you what I mean.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.130
So if I go back
here and I-- let's

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.350
just open a different tour.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.710
So if I go here,
and I go to Tours,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.730
and some of our favorites are
in this folder called Kiosk.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.030
I go here to John
Huchra's Universe.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.520
And I ask to play the tour.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.850
You can kind of
almost hear the sound.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.627
What I mean-- by the way, I can
skip like a slide at a time.

00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:46.960
I'm just going to hit the
Forward button to sort of skip

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.577
through this tour.

00:28:49.577 --> 00:28:51.660
But what I mean is, let's
say that I'm interested.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.826
Oh, you know, wait a minute.

00:28:52.826 --> 00:28:53.770
What is that galaxy?

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.560
I can just hit
Pause at any time.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.630
And then, I can go explore the
universe while I'm in the tour.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.709
And so at the bottom
of the screen,

00:29:02.709 --> 00:29:04.750
you'll see these little
links come up to tell you

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.750
what else is in there.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.850
And this is what I meant
about objects in the sky

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.837
becoming way-points the same
way links are in web pages.

00:29:10.837 --> 00:29:12.920
So basically, you can think
of WorldWide Telescope

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.620
as a web browser for the
sky because I could go here.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.120
And I could say, oh, actually,
I'm interested in that thing.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.987
And it's going to tell
me about this galaxy.

00:29:19.987 --> 00:29:21.320
And then, I'm going to zoom out.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.466
And then, you can see the
context of other things.

00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:24.840
And if there are
other tours that

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.740
cross through the
place I'm looking at,

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.380
those would also come up in
this preview at the bottom.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.850
So it's bad for people with
a short attention span.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.690
Just watch the tours on YouTube
if you have a short attention

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.780
span because otherwise,
you get constantly

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.210
distracted by what else is
available to you on the sky.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.880
So we like to think of
these tours as guided paths

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.120
through the sky.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.710
Then, this is something
that is really

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.310
interesting for the future.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.840
So there's an API and
a software development

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.970
kit for WorldWide Telescope.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.670
And it's all HTML5
and JavaScript.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.500
And so this has been
used by some rather large

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.250
organizations.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.850
This particular
example is from NASA.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.730
And there was an
important mission

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.740
that released its
data recently called

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.130
Planck that was an all-sky
map at a relatively

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.085
long wavelength.

00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:17.710
And this is just a
little demonstration

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.810
of what it looks like to use the
website that they built using

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.610
entirely WorldWide Telescope.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.320
So the links on these
slides all work,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.780
and I'll post the slides
so you can go check it out.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.370
Now, I showed you a tiny
little bit of how this works.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.900
This is just the finder
scope that you saw before.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.040
And here, you can see that
when deal with the information,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.380
ADS Articles is the
astronomy literature.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.090
SIMBAD Data is all
of this online data.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:45.190
And then Wikipedia is-- I think
you're familiar with Wikipedia.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:48.010
So you can right-click
anywhere in the sky in the web

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.010
version or the Windows version
and get all the information

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.910
that we know about any
particular position in the sky,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.060
which, actually, I find
probably the most mind blowing

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.120
feature of WorldWide Telescope.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.192
But I'll show you more.

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:02.474 --> 00:31:03.390
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Sorry?

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.855
AUDIENCE: Is it easy to
[INAUDIBLE] telescope?

00:31:05.855 --> 00:31:08.000
Could I also put the links
on the Wikipedia page--

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Oh, yes.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.490
Oh, please, give me a minute
and I'll show you one.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.100
See, this is what's
going to happen.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.660
It's the best laid plans.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.720
But now, let's go see
if this still works.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.730
This is living dangerously.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.230
Here you go.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.210
So here's one of my favorite
nebulae, the Iris Nebula,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.380
which is NGC7023.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.440
Here's a link that says see
NGC7023 in WorldWide Telescope.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.030
And then, when the internet
speeds up just a little bit,

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:39.780
it'll open WorldWide
Telescope to NGC7023.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.960
And do we have time to wait?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.667
Sorry.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.500
The faster the internet
connection you have,

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.800
the faster this goes.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.140
So anyway.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.450
Oh, there it is.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.260
OK.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.069
So we can just click on NGC7023,
and it'll take us there.

00:31:54.069 --> 00:31:55.610
And then if you want
to see something

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.120
that's really like
bizarrely self-referential,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.604
you can go here.

00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:01.645
And you can say Research.

00:32:01.645 --> 00:32:03.380
And you could say Information.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.040
And you could look
it up on Wikipedia.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.660
And you'd go back to
WorldWide Telescope.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.430
So I think the answer
to your question is yes.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.050
OK.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.840
So indulge me with another demo.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.960
This is another one of
our favorite projects.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.030
And this one actually has,
I think, huge relevance

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.510
to Google's mapping efforts.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.630
And I think that a similar
project to what's done here

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.340
could be done for the Earth.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.990
I'm going to show you all
of the astronomy literature

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.970
on the sky.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.560
But imagine, for example,
"The New York Times" articles

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.380
on the surface of the Earth.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.500
So I could show you a movie.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.730
But instead, I'm going to
show you the real thing.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.960
So if I go to ADS-- this
is the worst acronym ever

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.030
by the way-- ADSASSS.org.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.800
It's my fault, too.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.600
So this is a project that we
have that's funded by NASA.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.750
Because ADS is the literature
service for all of astronomy.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.819
And we've been in the
vanguard for a long time

00:32:59.819 --> 00:33:02.110
that all of the literature
has been online in astronomy

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.570
for a very long time.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.150
And so there's more than
100 years of articles.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.820
And there's an
organization in France

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.570
called CDS that tags
the objects that

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.000
are mentioned in the articles.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.340
So you actually can associate
positions and articles,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.620
sometimes many positions
mentioned in one article.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.120
And obviously, many
articles about any position.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:26.090
This weird map that you see--
this, again, is all HTML5--

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.489
is a super position here.

00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:29.280
Let me put an optical
map in the background

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.524
so it's a little easier.

00:33:30.524 --> 00:33:31.940
I'll make it just
a regular image.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.970
So hopefully, you
recognize here's Orion.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.470
OK.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.840
So you recognize that.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.560
Now, if I switch
the slider this way,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.330
that is a map of the
article density on the sky.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.667
So you can actually see Orion
in the density of articles.

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:47.250
And then, if you
actually want to know

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.560
what are those
articles, you could

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.580
show the individual sources.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.640
And then, you could
click on one of them.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.140
And then, eventually,
it'll bring up

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.270
a list of all of the papers
and all of the data associated

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.640
with that particular reference.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.980
And that takes a second, so
how much patience do we have?

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.896
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.770
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Yeah.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.179
OK I'll turn this off.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.460
Now the other thing won't
come up because I moved,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.350
but it works.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.799
Anyway, so these weird
stripes are like giant surveys

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:23.090
of the sky that have been done.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:27.422
And they're not actually
giant squares in the sky.

00:34:27.422 --> 00:34:29.380
So anyway, it's very
interesting from a history

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.570
of science perspective.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.120
You can filter by
different kinds of objects.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.090
Here's just articles
about H2 regions.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.219
And suddenly, those
big stripes go away.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.510
And so you can actually use
this for science as well as

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.844
for the history of science.

00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:43.010
But anyway, I think this
would be really interesting

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.630
as an Earth-based
project as well

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.600
with Earth-based resources.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.260
And at the moment, I
think it would look better

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.610
in WorldWide Telescope than
it would in Google Maps.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.070
So maybe we can have
some kind of meeting

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.030
of the minds about that.

00:35:01.869 --> 00:35:03.910
This, by the way, this
little demo will show you.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.990
We did a little cute trick
where we filtered articles that

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.180
mentioned Harvard authors
versus ones that didn't.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.690
I'll skip that.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:12.360
OK.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.050
So this one is another one
of my personal favorites.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.690
So this ADS All Sky
Survey has two more parts.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.080
One is the heat map of
articles on the sky.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.340
Another one is being
able to put images back

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.880
on the sky where they
go from the literature.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.400
So raise your hand if you've
heard of astrometry.net.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:28.900
OK.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.210
So astrometry.net is
a miraculous service

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.650
that will look at
images and figure out

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.997
where they go on the sky without
any coordinate information.

00:35:36.997 --> 00:35:38.580
Ask me later how it
works because it's

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.625
really interesting.

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:42.090
But right now, we
have some of this

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.770
implemented as a prototype
in the ADS All Sky Survey.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.640
But for fun, I'm
going to just show you

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.260
an image on the web
being moved to Flickr.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.689
So there is on Flickr.

00:35:50.689 --> 00:35:52.230
And then what happens
is a little bot

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.390
crawls around on Flickr
and puts it where

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.110
it goes on WorldWide Telescope.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:02.480
So if I click this, I think I
can demonstrate this to you.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.280
So it brings the actual image.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.000
The question you asked-- it
just takes you to the position.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.670
This is actually
bringing the image

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.680
that you asked about to
the position where it goes.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.400
So now, you can see
that that lines up

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.140
with the underlying
All Sky image.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.760
But then, if I was
interested, for example,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.280
in what does that look like in
the infrared in the background,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.910
I could go over here.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.785
And I could say, make
that the background.

00:36:25.785 --> 00:36:27.910
And then, I would learn
something very interesting,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.030
which is that those dark
regions are actually

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.337
bright regions in the infrared.

00:36:32.337 --> 00:36:34.170
And again, I could do
all the right-clicking

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.670
and find out about
all the articles,

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.140
but I don't want
to take all day.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.110
So let me continue.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.714
OK.

00:36:40.714 --> 00:36:42.130
The American
Astronomical Society,

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.200
why are they interested
in WorldWide Telescope?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.870
Part of the reason is education
and outreach obviously.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.700
But another part of the reason
that might not be so obvious

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.090
is that scholarly publishing is
in something of a crisis moment

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.040
right now.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.290
People are saying, why don't
I just publish my article

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.010
on the web?

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.830
What's the value of
journals anymore?

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.640
Why am I paying all this money
for you to publish my article

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.510
and then charge me
money to read it later?

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.120
OK.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.960
So that's a whole other scandal.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.760
But my friend and
colleague Josh Peek and I

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.620
and a bunch of other people
wrote this little prototype

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.420
"Paper of the Future" last year.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.190
And this is just
scrolling through it.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.800
And if you go check
this out, you'll

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.150
see a lot of possible
technology, some of which

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.470
have definitely been adopted
already by the American

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.410
Astronomical Society where
data can be embedded in papers,

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.600
links to the Python code
is embedded in the paper,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.500
interactive figures
are in the paper.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.080
And, in particular, what
you just saw before,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.550
this linking a figure out of the
paper into context on the sky

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.320
is now also possible
with WorldWide Telescope.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.810
And so that's part of the reason
that the AAS is interested.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.090
They have a separate
project through the press

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.630
that publishes their journals,
the Institute of Physics Press,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.780
called Astronomy Image Explorer,
where the images are sucked out

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.700
of the papers.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.450
Now some of them are just graphs
and tables or they're graphics.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.580
But they're not actually
images of the sky.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.850
But what we can do is we
can identify the ones that

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:09.330
are actually images
after you do a search

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.050
and then offer all of those to
be seen in context on the sky.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.320
So this ADS All
Sky Survey is going

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.550
to probably become the AAS
All Sky Survey, the American

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.340
Astronomical Society.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:20.840
OK.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.140
So I mentioned a
little bit about K-12

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.990
in the beginning
with Benjamin's tour.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.520
But let me just tell you
that this Ambassadors program

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.740
has had a lot of success.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.620
And I could show you all
the education research data

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:40.850
or I could show you my personal
favorite quote from a kid who

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.640
actually said that
the software was--

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.270
and I do quote-- "cooler
than Call of Duty."

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.430
And then later, I will
show you-- hopefully

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.200
we'll have time-- a
very inspiring tour

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.730
about Pluto that was made
by two high school students.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:59.345
And just to let you know that
the outreach side of WorldWide

00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:01.820
Telescope is quite
a well developed

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.860
in terms of that it's now
funded in part by NSF,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.640
and by NASA, and by the
Templeton Foundation.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.620
And there are
various projects that

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.420
have to do with
letting kids think

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.440
about the likelihood
of life in the universe

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.860
and have them understand
multiple spatial scales.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.480
And I know a lot of
you are interested

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.480
in outreach projects,
and I'd be happy to talk

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.220
more about that later.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.870
And this is being used at
the college level as well.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:30.480
Some labs are being replaced
or augmented by online labs.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.730
And then, in graduate
education, we've

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.840
actually had graduate
students make

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.550
outreach modules
for undergraduates

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.940
to try to explain
difficult concepts.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.370
So that's what this thing
on the upper left is.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.030
We've also built interactive
touch screen kiosks

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.460
with graduate students.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.590
Here's a graduate student at
the USA Science and Engineering

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.100
Festival where the WorldWide
Telescope booth is always

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.290
extremely popular.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.790
Oh, yes.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.740
I forgot to tell you that--
I feel like saying, but wait,

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.620
there's more.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.680
WorldWide Telescope
also works in 3D.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.070
And I didn't bring enough
3D glasses for everybody.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.680
But I think I did bring enough
postcards for everybody.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.060
So you can write to me
and ask for 3D glasses.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.410
But anyway, yes, right.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:19.250
And it also works with the
Kinect and Xbox controller.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.890
And no, not Google
Glass or anything yet.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.274
But we're talking
about HoloLens,

00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:24.440
which is actually important.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.470
I'll get back to that
in a little while.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.760
I mentioned already the "Cosmic
Wonder" planetarium show

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.260
at the Adler Planetarium.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.130
There are more of
those in development.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.020
And I also mentioned that
there's this fancy video

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.770
that you can go watch to
see how inspired people

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.255
are about WorldWide Telescope.

00:40:41.255 --> 00:40:43.102
But I'm going to
skip that for now.

00:40:43.102 --> 00:40:44.810
And I promised in my
abstract to give you

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.610
three examples of
things that people

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.260
might want to do with
WorldWide Telescope,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.440
So there's the Pluto tour.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.430
There's the talk
I gave yesterday

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.475
at NASA Ames about
using WorldWide

00:40:55.475 --> 00:40:58.630
Telescope and other software
to actually look at data

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.010
and understand the structure
of the Milky Way in new ways.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.202
And then, there's even
really crazy things

00:41:04.202 --> 00:41:05.910
like trying to understand
the large scale

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.730
structure of the universe in
the context of observations

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.130
and of new simulations.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.607
So let's see.

00:41:13.607 --> 00:41:16.190
You want to see what high school
students do with New Horizons

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.480
data and Pluto?

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.980
Yeah?

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.510
We have a lot of
yes on that one.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.009
OK.

00:41:20.009 --> 00:41:21.180
Let's do that.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.670
So let's go back to
WorldWide Telescope here.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.795
And let us--

00:41:27.795 --> 00:41:29.420
AUDIENCE: How old is
this presentation?

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.910
ALYSSA GOODMAN:
Which presentation?

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.440
The one I'm going to show
you from New Horizons?

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.470
It's from August.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.980
I'm sorry.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.180
It's like really old.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.930
OK.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.310
So let's see.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.150
Let's open that.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.160
So I just open.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.210
So again, opening these
tours is a little bit

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.600
like opening a
presentation file.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.822
And you can email them
around to other people.

00:41:48.822 --> 00:41:51.280
They're not that large unless
there's a lot of audio in it.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.650
Because all of the data--
I'll get to that in a minute.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:57.860
But they're all stored
in cloud services,

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.250
so there's not much on
your local computer.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.550
Oh, we're not going
to be able to hear it.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.050
Darn.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.655
Let's see.

00:42:08.655 --> 00:42:11.030
Apparently the people online
can hear better than we can,

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.242
so we can go watch
this on YouTube again.

00:42:13.242 --> 00:42:14.200
AUDIENCE: I hear music.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.010
ALYSSA GOODMAN: You hear music?

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:15.422
OK.

00:42:15.422 --> 00:42:16.246
He'll start talking soon.

00:42:16.246 --> 00:42:16.660
Oh, it's gotten better.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.576
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:20.030
-New Horizons began its journey
off the coast of Florida

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.160
on a rocket called
Atlas 5, aiming

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.944
to reach the edge of the
solar system and beyond.

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:44.766
First stop, Jupiter.

00:42:44.766 --> 00:42:45.760
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:45.940
ALYSSA GOODMAN: OK.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.580
So I'm going to skip
through it because I don't

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.705
want to take too much time.

00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:51.390
But I'm going to go all the
way to the New Horizons data.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.920
OK.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.310
So they keep talking about going
past the orbit of other planets

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.876
et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:57.876 --> 00:42:59.250
And then, finally,
they get-- OK,

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.400
so there's some old
images of Pluto.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.316
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:02.316 --> 00:43:04.550
-Years after it first
took off, New Horizons

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.480
reached the goal its mission.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.240
Awakened from its
deep sleep, it was

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.830
able to capture
many images of Pluto

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.300
and its moons, which are
being sent back to Earth

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.815
over the next 16 months.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.710
Through a series of
detailed imagery,

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.980
New Horizons revealed the
existence of massive mountain

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:30.220
ranges in Pluto's heart,
which, at 3.3 kilometers high,

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.009
are comparable in size to
our own Rocky Mountains.

00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:34.050
Impressive, considering--

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.770
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.570
ALYSSA GOODMAN: So
again, let me just

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.060
show you that this
is interactive.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:37.560
Right?

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.040
So this is a tour,
but this is actually

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.980
an interactive view of the
data that have been added.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.730
So there's slightly
better New Horizons data,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.170
but they haven't been added yet.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.750
And then, if you
want to say, you

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.740
know why is Pluto not a planet?

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.550
Right.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.310
That was the
question I was asked.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.924
So if you were an
ambassador in a classroom

00:43:58.924 --> 00:44:00.340
and a kid asked
you that question,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.939
you would just zoom out, or
easier, just go to the Sun.

00:44:04.939 --> 00:44:07.355
And then you just tilt the
solar system down a little bit.

00:44:07.355 --> 00:44:09.590
And then you say, where's Pluto?

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.720
You're like, oh,
Pluto's this crazy thing

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.350
on this highly tilted orbit very
far out in the solar system.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.260
And then they're like, oh, you
know, I'm still not convinced.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.680
And so then you say,
well, maybe you'd

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.560
like to see the rest of
all the crazy stuff that's

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.990
friends with Pluto.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.560
And you can turn on all of
the asteroids and Kuiper Belt

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.180
objects that we know about.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.500
And then, you can go really,
really detailed on them.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.820
And you can say, well, how
about if I speed up time?

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.900
So here's real time, 10,
100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000,

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.250
a million times.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.110
Boy, this is really
taking a lot.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.200
Oh, I had to go like
100 million times

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.300
to start seeing
those asteroids move.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.910
But actually, then you can
see that Pluto is essentially

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.350
a Kuiper Belt object.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:00.280
And so it's not like
the other planets.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.984
And so kids are usually
pretty convinced

00:45:02.984 --> 00:45:04.025
by that kind of argument.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.490
And then in terms of what is
the true nature of the structure

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:12.110
of the Milky Way, I'm
going to refer you

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.290
to this website, which
is called wwtstories.

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.260
And one of the stories
is about this discovery

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.340
that we made a couple years
ago originally that's called

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.260
the Bones of the Milky Way.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:26.740
And in there, is a video that
explains the whole story.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.417
And since it takes
a few minutes,

00:45:28.417 --> 00:45:30.000
and I want to get
to a little bit more

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.974
about the architecture
of the software,

00:45:31.974 --> 00:45:33.640
I'm going to skip
that and just tell you

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:40.280
that this amazing
ability to look

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.740
at images in a very wide
context and modern images

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.390
all being in there already
as All Sky Survey really does

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:53.294
let you do real research science
as well as outreach science.

00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:54.710
And I'm trying to
get to the point

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.890
where it actually shows
the overlay of data.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:59.640
Here we go.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.210
OK.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.626
This is why I
shouldn't use video.

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:04.250
I should use interactive.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.066
Well, thank you, YouTube.

00:46:06.066 --> 00:46:07.440
You can go look
at this yourself.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.160
Oh, there it is.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:08.910
Just as I gave up.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.760
So you see these
little blue dots?

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.970
Those are actual measurements
that have been made

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.080
and that have been added
to WorldWide Telescope.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.210
Turns out that this very
interesting story, which

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.830
I told at one of
your Sci-Fu meetings,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.930
for those of you who were
here, about how you can use

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.470
the fact that the Sun is not
in the plane of the Milky Way

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.880
to actually understand the
three-dimensional structure

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.450
of our galaxy.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.282
But again, in the interest
of time, I skip that.

00:46:33.282 --> 00:46:34.740
And instead, I'm
going to just show

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.765
you one more very zoomed out
feature of WorldWide Telescope.

00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:39.140
But before I do
that, let me show

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.760
you a tiny bit of the most
modern simulation of structure

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.380
formation in the universe.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.380
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.760
-Pull the tightly woven dark
matter web into a looser

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.260
network--

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.801
ALYSSA GOODMAN: So
this is simulated.

00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:51.610
--of giant galaxy clusters.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.880
A big challenge, the team say,
was recreating the variety

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.450
of galaxies we observe.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.010
The model's 40,000 galaxies
include this spiral one

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.860
like our Milky Way.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.890
In fact, the simulation
produces a world

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.860
that's remarkably similar
to the real universe

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.514
as we see it through
our telescopes.

00:47:09.514 --> 00:47:11.680
And because this simulation
matches our observations

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.794
so well, it gives us greater
confidence in our understanding

00:47:14.794 --> 00:47:15.460
of the universe.

00:47:18.218 --> 00:47:19.051
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:19.051 --> 00:47:20.320
ALYSSA GOODMAN: OK.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.110
So what I haven't done for
you in WorldWide Telescope

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.700
is actually zoom
out all the way.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.070
So let me show you what
happens if we do that.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.390
So let's pause this
so that we don't

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:33.320
crush the GPU of my computer.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.680
Let's do that.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.180
OK.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.971
And then, if I just
start zooming out-- let

00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:41.680
me firstly make sure I have the
whole universe turned on here.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.611
We want the microwave background
as well as everything else.

00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:45.110
OK.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:49.140
So if I zoom way, way,
way out-- and actually,

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.110
it's easier to do this
using the Xbox controller.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:56.050
So if I just hold down the
zoom out trigger button,

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:57.640
you can see the
stars start to move.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:05.530
And then eventually, I'll
get to a model of our galaxy.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:10.180
And then, eventually, I'll
start getting to the Sloan

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.640
catalogue of external galaxies.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.200
There's a lot of space between
our galaxy and the next galaxy.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.590
And so here is-- I might turn
off the background there.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:25.014
That's the cosmic microwave
background in the background.

00:48:25.014 --> 00:48:25.930
It's hard to say that.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.430
Say that 10 times fast.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.930
OK.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.890
So I'm going to turn that off.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.550
And so you can
see-- hopefully, you

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.610
can see-- each one of those
little dots is a galaxy.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.680
And if I wanted to,
I could choose one.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.430
And I could just say,
could you please fly

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.370
to that particular galaxy?

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:41.120
And then, when I would
get to that galaxy,

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.590
I could actually find out all
the data in the Sloan catalogue

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:48.510
about that galaxy, again, with
the same kind of right-click

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.640
that I showed you before.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.470
So I mentioned that--
yes, that is Malala.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:58.360
So I mentioned that we're
interested in exploring

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.430
new ways to interact
with the data as well.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.430
And so yes, an Xbox
controller is nice.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:07.380
But it would be even better if
we could really use our hands

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.710
in a more literal way.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.780
And so this already
works with the Kinect.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.610
But the kind of mixed reality
devices like the HoloLens

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.160
and whatever's coming
next from Google

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.800
will be even more
interesting for interacting

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.070
with the large data sets.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.450
And we're particularly
interested in that interaction

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.470
because of this other
software project

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.760
that I mentioned
before call GLUE, which

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.120
is a high dimensional data
visualization package that also

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.217
includes 3D volumetric data.

00:49:34.217 --> 00:49:35.800
But importantly--
and so we want to be

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.780
able to do 3D selection
with our hands

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.950
if anybody's interested
in that problem.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:45.724
But importantly, the way that
the API, the web-based API

00:49:45.724 --> 00:49:47.140
for WorldWide
Telescope works now,

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.340
you can already connect it
to other software packages.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.220
So this is just a little
demo of a Python program

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.430
which is this GLUE software
talking to WorldWide Telescope

00:49:56.430 --> 00:50:00.030
and sharing data across
the two applications.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.780
So this does have powerful
research applications as well

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.550
as those in outreach.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.160
So to just summarize
what I've said

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.680
and then I'm going to close
with a little video about what

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.784
we might think is going
to happen in the future,

00:50:12.784 --> 00:50:14.200
there's a bunch
of communities who

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.390
are interested in
using this software

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.950
and who are already using it.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.740
So people in planetariums,
in the educational world

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.970
at all levels, certainly
outreach organizations,

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.740
researchers, and the one you
might not have thought of,

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.507
the publishing industry.

00:50:28.507 --> 00:50:29.340
What are they doing?

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.464
They're making these tours.

00:50:30.464 --> 00:50:31.700
They're making websites.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.010
They're making YouTube videos.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.971
And most of the resources
for that are cloud resources.

00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:38.470
OK.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.053
And the way that
they're doing it now,

00:50:40.053 --> 00:50:42.720
you've seen that the desktop
version that I'm running here,

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.800
which is what's used
for tar authoring,

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.300
currently only runs in Windows.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.280
That should change.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.530
It's an open source project.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:49.030
Hint.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.620
Hint.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.010
OK.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:57.050
And stuff plays back
on the web just fine.

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.360
And the interactivity of
looking stuff up on the web

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.300
is fine, too.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.280
The reason that there's
a toaster on there

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.180
is because there's a special
algorithm called Toast, which

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.800
is a hierarchical image
tiling format that

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.570
actually works a lot
better than what's

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.990
in lot of other software.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.570
And there's servers for
doing that Microsoft

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.450
has made available
and will continue

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.640
to make available for free.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.030
Great noise.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.340
And in terms of those other
operating systems that

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.432
are shown there, the web
versions of WorldWide Telescope

00:51:27.432 --> 00:51:29.140
work fine on all those,
but there are not

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.820
native versions for
anything other than Windows.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:37.430
And so you've already seen
the sort of sky, planet, 3D,

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.990
et cetera, and access to
data that WorldWide Telescope

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.510
offers.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.760
And if I just rearrange
this into the kind

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.140
of org chart of resources
that is in the proposal that's

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.590
going to the American
Astronomical Society,

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.557
you can kind of see how
this all fits together.

00:51:52.557 --> 00:51:54.140
For those of you who
really interested

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.390
in this, what this
is basically saying

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:58.780
is that there's a bunch of
assets that have already

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.069
been assembled by Microsoft
Research and the other people

00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:03.860
who've been working on
WorldWide Telescope,

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.430
then a bunch of tools for
dealing with those assets,

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.590
and many different end
user modalities for how

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.660
to get to those resources.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.760
But again, this is what's most
developed over here, the web

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.300
client and Windows.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.950
And this is what most
needs developing over

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.445
on the other side.

00:52:21.445 --> 00:52:21.945
OK.

00:52:21.945 --> 00:52:25.120
So where might Google
come into this story?

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.820
This is an actually real chart
now of all of the organizations

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.530
that are participating
in this effort already.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.950
And it's a rather complicated
consortium set up.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.490
Because right now,
the institutional home

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.260
for WorldWide Telescope
is not completely clear.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:43.760
OK.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.030
I mentioned that
it's being discussed

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.510
at the American Astronomical
Society will take this on.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.700
There's a vote on January 4.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.700
And so you will see news
if this vote goes well.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:55.861
I give it pretty good odds.

00:52:55.861 --> 00:52:56.360
OK.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.900
But once this project
has an institutional home

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.935
with some full time
people committed to it,

00:53:02.935 --> 00:53:06.120
it'll be easier to marshal all
of these other organizations

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.890
that are already participating
both in terms of staff time

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:12.720
and financially.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.740
And so I just put a
bunch of Google on here

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.220
in all the places
where I think Google--

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.800
and in particular, down here,
the open source development

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.740
being one of the most important
aspects of the project where

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.966
Googlers could
participate as well.

00:53:27.966 --> 00:53:29.840
And I'm going to stick
around this afternoon.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.610
And anybody who wants to join
these conversations about how

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.110
we could make that
all happen, please do.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.490
But I want to--
before I go here,

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.760
does anybody know this
person on the screen?

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.260
OK.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.000
So this guy's name is Gonzo.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.140
And he's a friend of
Chris DiBona's apparently.

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:53.820
And what I'd like to do
is just for a minute not

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.010
talk over him and let you
hear what he's saying.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:59.720
Because he made this point
at a meeting a few weeks ago

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.090
of the consortium
about what he thinks

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.697
WorldWide Telescope should
become in the future.

00:54:04.697 --> 00:54:06.030
And many of us think he's right.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.571
And so I'm just going to let
him make that point for himself.

00:54:08.571 --> 00:54:11.050
And then, I'm going to end
and take your questions.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.034
Here we go.

00:54:13.034 --> 00:54:13.950
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.490
-At some point,
you're going to have

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.970
to make some decisions
about how to evolve

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.490
beyond this two-client model.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.390
And you have a
number of options.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.910
But the one that I think makes
the most sense is probably

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.280
to stop trying to shove
everything into one interface,

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.125
but instead, turn the
WorldWide Telescope

00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:34.200
project into a platform
and a framework

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:38.110
for services built on a
dataset and to run applications

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:41.569
small, perhaps overlapping,
but targeted applications

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:43.610
for each set of functionality
that you want to do

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:47.430
and perhaps for each community
you want to approach.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.200
And start thinking
about engineering

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.820
to your next phase,
which is going

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.450
to be some sort of apps model.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:55.240
And then that also
gets multi-platform

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.840
because you can have different
apps targeted for the platforms

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.385
where the communities are
for the people who actually

00:55:00.385 --> 00:55:01.490
need to use them.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.540
-So use the data infrastructure.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.206
Use some of the
API and build apps?

00:55:06.206 --> 00:55:06.705
-Right.

00:55:06.705 --> 00:55:07.110
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:07.930
ALYSSA GOODMAN: OK.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.530
So I think he's
actually probably right.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:15.681
And so what I wanted to
offer in the last few minutes

00:55:15.681 --> 00:55:17.180
is I'll just tell
you that there are

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.179
a bunch of projects that
are going on right now,

00:55:19.179 --> 00:55:20.820
only some of which
I've mentioned.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:20.990
OK.

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:22.510
So I mentioned
Thinkspace and Life

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.260
in the Universe,
which are the projects

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.410
through the ambassadors.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:28.160
I didn't tell you that there's
a third piece of the ADS All Sky

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.160
Survey where images
that can't be solved

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.430
through that automated
mechanism are actually

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.840
being solved in a citizen
science project, where people

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.700
are shown images and
asked to add metadata.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.720
Some of those people are
high school students.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.570
And that project is being
done through the Zooniverse

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:46.301
collaboration based in Chicago.

00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:47.800
We're also using
WorldWide Telescope

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.340
in a very big online course that
I'm working on at HarvardX call

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.110
Prediction X. We're
using it to explain

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.090
both Earth-based and space-based
phenomena having to do with,

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.840
for example, people charting
their course across the ocean

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.970
using the stars.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:05.200
So you can use it in odd
circumstances like that.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.890
At lunch, we were talking
about this proposed project

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.590
that a friend of
mine, Eli Bressert

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.660
has called Raspberry
Sky, where you

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.800
use Raspberry Pis and
cheap little cameras

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.729
and observe the
whole sky every night

00:56:16.729 --> 00:56:18.395
and look for things
that change in time,

00:56:18.395 --> 00:56:22.700
and put data in a WorldWide
Telescope custom API interface,

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.885
just like what Gonzo
was talking about.

00:56:24.885 --> 00:56:28.470
And so the last little
block is for you.

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.140
This is your scheme here.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.530
And I think [? Tory ?]
and I are hoping

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.990
that people have some
interesting ideas

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:37.160
to propose from within Google.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.910
And I have to say, the sound
effects are really excellent.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.910
AUDIENCE: They're
reconstructing--

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:41.410
ALYSSA GOODMAN: OK.

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:41.970
Great.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.990
So if you go to the
WorldWide Telescope website,

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.390
you can see the
overview of the SDK

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:50.280
that's already there if you're
interested in actually starting

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.240
to develop things.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.968
So anyway, thanks very much.

00:56:52.968 --> 00:56:55.258
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:58.820
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
being able to take

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.840
a picture of the sky and
finding where in the sky it is.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.700
How do you do that?

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.320
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Oh, yes.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:03.820
OK.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.966
So that's this
astrometry.net program.

00:57:05.966 --> 00:57:08.340
And there used to be these
sort of brute force algorithms

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.381
that would actually just
look for things at known

00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:11.780
positional orientations.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:16.990
But the way this actually works
now is groups of four stars

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:18.720
that they call quads
are identified.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.590
And then, they look
for the-- if you

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.390
draw an X or a twisted
X between those,

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.680
then the length of those
lines and the angle

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.430
between those lines is a
very unique fingerprint

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:30.470
if you have a bunch of
those quads in an image.

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:33.320
And so it's compared against
a catalogue of the sky.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.220
And it's remarkably fast.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.299
By the way, it's
being used also--

00:57:37.299 --> 00:57:38.840
this thing called
DASCH, which stands

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.860
for Digital Access to a
Sky Century at Harvard.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:46.390
So we own 600,000 glass
plate images of the sky.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.840
It's the largest
collection of images.

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.070
It goes back 100 years.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:52.680
And so that
astrometry.net program

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.550
is actually also be used to
solve for the coordinates

00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:58.090
of these historical plates.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.090
And hopefully, we'll wind
up with all those data

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.240
in WorldWide Telescope as well.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.820
And by the way, you can't
get 100 years of time series

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.660
without waiting 100 years.

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:11.360
So even in the data that are
kind of crappy and very old

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.660
are incredibly valuable.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.280
Because even if you have LLST,
to get 100 year time baseline,

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.882
you have to wait 100 years.

00:58:17.882 --> 00:58:19.340
AUDIENCE: For people
who would like

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:23.860
to be involved, both Googlers
and the greater world,

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.152
how do you become involved
with the WorldWide Telescope

00:58:26.152 --> 00:58:26.651
initiative.

00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:28.240
And what opportunities
are available?

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.360
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Thanks.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.776
So there's a lot
of opportunities.

00:58:29.776 --> 00:58:32.050
So there's a GitHub page
that has all the code on it.

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.360
And there's active discussion
through the GitHub page.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.180
But also, you can just go to
the main WorldWide Telescope

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.250
website or wwtambassadors.org.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.690
And you can find all kinds
of contact information.

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:46.070
And basically, if you email
anybody in the organization

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:49.720
with any kind of volunteering,
you will be volunteered.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.860
AUDIENCE: And it's not
bound to Massachusetts?

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:52.620
It can be really anywhere.

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:53.180
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Oh, not at all.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:53.780
Not Harvard either.

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.405
You were very kind
in the introduction.

00:58:55.405 --> 00:58:57.640
And while we do a lot
of this at Harvard,

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.450
this is not connected
to Harvard other

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:02.720
than that the Ambassadors
program is run from Harvard

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.470
and it's part of
Seamless Astronomy, which

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.240
is also run from Harvard.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.990
But no, there's people
actually all over the world,

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:10.760
including-- apparently
WorldWide Telescope

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.470
is quite big in China.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.220
So you can run this
program-- I forgot

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.391
to mention-- in many different
languages, including Chinese.

00:59:17.391 --> 00:59:19.390
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you
so much again, Alyssa.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:20.410
We really appreciate it.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:22.062
And we look forward
to learning more.

00:59:22.062 --> 00:59:23.020
ALYSSA GOODMAN: Thanks.

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.570
