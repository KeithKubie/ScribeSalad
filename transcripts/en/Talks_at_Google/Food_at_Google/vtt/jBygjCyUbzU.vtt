00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.020
Olivia: Hi, everybody. Welcome.
I'm Olivia, and I'm an executive chef here,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.890
mostly hanging out at Oasis Cafe.
[clapping] Wait, save your applause for this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.400
guy.
Okay. So I am thrilled.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.159
I think most of us here are thrilled to have
David Chang here as our guest and our speaker.

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.930
He is, of course, the chef who opened Momofuku
in New York, and then followed with Ssam,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.359
Ko, Milk.
I haven't asked him yet, but I think he had

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.230
a reaction to a four-syllable restaurant.
And so, the next three are one-syllable names

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.440
for his restaurants -- all really good and
catchy and bold, which is the kind of person

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.179
David is and the kind of cuisine that he does.
In a lot of ways, I feel like we've all been

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.999
waiting for David.
I have been.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.740
You know, we went through decades of fusion,
and then post-fusion.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
And then, all of these cuisines -- some of
which was very good, but a lot of which, I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.380
thought were more like the people I know:
Americans I know, who go oversees for two

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.140
weeks and bring back chotskies and maybe a
burra head, which they spend a lot of money

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.640
on and they put it in their living rooms.
I felt so often I was eating off plates that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.909
were full of chotskies of a two-week trip
that an American chef took overseas.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.039
And I will follow that with a story that I
tell about when I was in the San Francisco

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.189
Chronicle as a writer, mostly in the food
and wine sections.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.539
And we run through a lot of recipes.
We test them. And there are a lot of good

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.579
recipes.
But once -- and I consider my colleagues at

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:14.030
the Chronicle to be literate, progressive,
educated, open people -- very open to diversity.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.400
But, when I think a local -- I forget Filipino,
or Japanese -- chef sent in his recipe for

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.900
spaghetti with meat sauce, the reaction of
my colleagues was, "What is he doing with

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.709
spaghetti and meat sauce?"
And that really disappointed me deeply, because

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.060
it's okay for you to do fusion if you go to
the East and pluck from there.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.629
It's not okay for somebody who's not western
to try to do his version of your dish.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.220
And so, it's -- for me, it's never been a
two-way street and a real expression of diversity.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.450
And what we've waited for is somebody who's
here today, David.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.420
So, he's somebody who, for me, follows what
I think is a maxim of art.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.900
You know, as a writer, where I'm told other
writers say, "Write what you know about."

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.440
And for me, it carries into what I cook -- cook
what I know.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.420
Cook from the flavors of my past.
So that what I do is a full expression of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.519
the totality of who I am, past and new experiences.
And I think this is what David does so beautifully.

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.580
His recipes in the book are down to earth,
real, bold.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.049
And I've seen him say and write, you know,
so many times that "I'm just trying to do

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.439
the best food that I can."
And I think it's also very instructive to

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.939
know that when I ask David what were his favorite
restaurants to go to when he comes to the

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.650
Bay Area?
He says he likes to hang out in the Mission

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.360
and go to all the taquerias. [laughter]
So I totally get that, and I totally love

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.430
that food myself.
And I think it's one of the best expressions

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.230
of what's happening in America with American
food.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:24.450
So, I think you'll find he is really down
to earth, really honest, and his flavors and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.970
plates and bowls speak to that.
My first introduction to David was the article

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.000
I read about him in the New Yorker.
Anybody read about him?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.610
Where it seemed like every time you were quoted,
there was an F word.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.610
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:46.420
Olivia: Yeah, you did. You did.
But it really is how real he is and, despite

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.390
the cult following that he now has and all
the fame that he's garnered, he's just really

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.260
himself.
And I'm very, very happy to introduce you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.640
to him.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.880
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:09.000
David Chang: How are you guys doing?
This is pretty cool going on.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.100
I had no idea that I'd be -- one day cooking
would lead me to Google and speaking in front

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.540
of people on the Google campus.
Brought Peter Meehan and dude from the Sweeties.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.380
[laughing]
But I was supposed to prepare something today,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.540
but as usual, I didn't prepare anything.
Which is why I would never get a job at Google,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.460
because they would never hire me.
Because I did terrible at -- I wasn't very

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.190
good at anything until I sort of got into
cooking.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.430
And when I started to cook, I didn't think
that I would ever be as good as the chefs

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.920
that I worked for.
And you know, I guess a lot of it was sort

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.840
of because I played a lot of competitive golf
as a kid.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.040
And when you're playing golf, it's you against
a golf course and a scoreboard.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.121
So it was always checking the competition.
I'm always looking to, "How can I beat everybody?

00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:10.250
I have to shoot such and such, whatever round."
And I think that's carried over into, you

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.740
know, the cooking career.
And long story cut short, got out of the fine

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.230
dining world, because I realize that -- I
say this a lot, and it's true.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.420
I didn't, nor did I think that I was going
to be better than the chefs that I was working

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.540
for, whether that be chefs like Daniel Boulud
or Thomas Keller or whatnot.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.870
I just didn't think I could ever attain that
level.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.810
So the goal was just to open up a restaurant,
and that was it.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.990
I sort of got out of it.
My mother was going through cancer.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.300
There was a lot of family things going on.
And then, I think -- I wish I had a better

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.120
game plan in terms of what happened after
we opened the restaurant.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.050
But I don't think anyone in their right mind
would have opened up a restaurant in the East

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.810
Village, 2004 that's 600 square feet.
And when we opened up, we didn't even know

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.060
if we had enough room for chairs.
We thought it might have to be standing-room

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:17.020
only.
And I lived, literally, above the restaurant,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.620
and that was that.
And I never thought anything other than that.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:28.400
"Let's just try to stay in business a year,
pay back the almost-$200,000 it took to open

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.460
up that restaurant, and it was really just
a test to myself.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:39.940
Well, one thing led to another.
And then, what's sort of become a maxim at

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:49.190
our restaurant is to make mistakes.
To -- if you're going to fuck up, you know,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:56.360
go big. [laughter]
And no one's made more mistakes than myself.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.690
And I think that's how we've grown, and that's
shaped our cooking philosophy.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.850
That's shaped how we treat our employees.
And it's how -- it started off, really, as

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:11.460
one -- myself and Joaquin Baca, he's recently
opened a restaurant in Brooklyn called the

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.190
Brooklyn Star.
It was just two of us.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.350
And nobody believed in us; nobody thought
that anything would ever happen.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.780
And we were just going to be a statistic.
We were going to be another restaurant that

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.520
was going to go out of business in under a
year, which is something like 99 percent of

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.960
all restaurants.
And somehow, we caught lightning in a bottle,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:42.370
and the food got better.
We were on the verge of going out of business

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.610
very much.
You know, it was hard to learn how to run

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.760
a business.
It's hard enough to cook, but to learn how

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.080
to run a cash register, learn how to be a
manager too.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.360
That was a very difficult process, and it
still is a difficult process to learn how

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.240
to do.
But we made every mistake you could ever make,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.660
opening up those first few months.
And then, people started to trickle in.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.350
But before that happened, it was sort of a
watershed moment.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.100
It was really like, you know, we're going
to cook whatever we wanted to cook.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.871
If we're going to go out of business, let's
just really go out of business.

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.110
All right? [Laughter]
It doesn't matter; who cares, you know?

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.440
People around the world do not care about
us.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.040
No one in the City cares about us right now,
so let's just try to do something that is

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.980
honest and full of integrity.
And that's sort of when we started to learn

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.520
not to cook for the customer.
You know, the maxim that "the customer is

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.470
always right" -- that doesn't apply to our
restaurant.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:57.530
And that's sort of the beginning of the Momofuku
culture and how we've started to run things.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:04.370
Usually the customer is always wrong.
That's the way I look at it. [laughter]

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.700
The places where "the customer is always right",
they take the shotgun approach, and they're

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.600
the T.G.I. Fridays, the Cheesecake Factories.
And you know, they're there, but that's not

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.570
what we wanted to be.
And we're in New York, and there's a lot of

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.770
variety.
So we wanted to add to that variety and that

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:29.851
eclectic mix.
So, that led to Ssam Bar.

00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:35.610
Noodle Bar became a success.
I don't know how, still, when I look back

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.430
on it. [laughter]
In Ssam Bar, I had this great idea, because

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:48.420
I was -- I became friends with Steve Ells.
He's the founder at Chipotle, and I was inspired

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.770
to do a Mexican-Asian like, burrito bar.
And we did it.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.530
We actually made it and on the corner of 13th
Street and Second Avenue.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:04.040
And I think, in the annals of New York City
restaurant history, it might go down as one

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.500
of the biggest failures of all time.
And I was almost relieved.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.900
I think we wanted it to happen, because we
won a lot of awards.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.690
And I was struggling with the process of,
you know -- you guys all work for Google.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.900
You guys probably did well in school and all
that stuff.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.940
I was never that person.
When you start out cooking -- at least when

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.580
I did -- it was because it was something that
was honest.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:38.890
It was something that I could get better at.
And I could be mentored by people.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:48.450
And now, it's a very different food culture.
But going back to Ssam Bar, we had won these

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:54.460
awards, and I think subconsciously, I wanted
us to fail, so we could get back to cooking

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.240
"not for the critics" and get away from the
spotlight.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.510
Because in New York, it's pretty intense.
And right now, it's pretty intense.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:13.690
But through that failure -- and we don't have
to go into the problems of Ssam Bar, but if

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.300
we never had that terrible idea, I wouldn't
be here today speaking to you.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:24.260
And that's why I always encourage people to
make mistakes and to analyze them and to be

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.990
your harshest critic.
It was a really bad idea, but then once you

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:35.120
make that decision, it opens up doorways and
new variables that you would not have access

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.279
to, are suddenly available to you.
So we opened up late night to make ends meet.

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.980
And then, that late night menu became the
full-time menu.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.520
And Ssam Bar became just a regular restaurant.
And then, we renovated it, got rid of the

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.320
last -- got rid of the burrito bar concept
completely.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.460
Next thing you know, we're reviewed by the
New York Times.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.500
We get two stars.
And then, we get three stars.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.991
And it's probably the most hated restaurant,
I think, in New York City.

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:07.960
If I worked at another three-star restaurant
and I saw that Momofuku Ssam Bar got three

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:15.491
stars, I would be upset.
Because we have paper towels. We don't even

00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:20.290
have paper towels.
We have disposable chopsticks. We have flooring

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.800
as our decor.
A big picture of John McEnroe. And that's

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.240
about it.
And disposable napkins.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:34.060
And it didn't really follow the genre of what
a three-star restaurant in New York City was

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.160
about.
And then came the crazy thing like "Restaurant,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.760
top 50".
Ssam Bar was named the 31st best restaurant

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.640
in the world.
And, you know, that's a very subjective thing

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.870
by voters and whatnot, but it really made
things surreal.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:14:01.720
And everything has presently become more surreal
than absurd, but that's how that happened.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:09.510
And then, you know, over the past five-and-a-half
years, we moved Noodle Bar to a bigger location.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.360
So we're going to have five restaurants.
We open up in Midtown.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.940
And then Ko was where the original Noodle
Bar was at.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:27.821
And I think it was our most ambitious project.
And ambitious, not in size, but in terms of,

00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:36.790
I guess, trying to say, "Fuck you" to everybody.
And I know of no other way to describe that,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:43.040
because there were a lot of people that were
doubting us, doubting our ability at Noodle

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.000
Bar, at Ssam Bar, doubting myself.
I was doubting myself.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:56.930
And we were going to open up a 12-seat restaurant.
And we had to because of the -- if you haven't

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.750
noticed, I don't really follow an outline;
I don't follow a game plan.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:06.430
And usually how things work for us was out
of necessity.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:12.950
And that's -- the 27-seat restaurant that
was the original Noodle Bar was doing 350

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.220
covers a day.
We were doing over $4 million in sales out

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.810
of a 600-square-foot shop.
We were doing incredibly well.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:27.480
And one of the things that allowed us to make
the decisions that we continue to do is that

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.149
we didn't have any investors.
So we were allowed to dwell on our mistakes,

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:36.280
you know.
It's sort of -- one thing I learned in college

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.070
was, I did study a lot of religion and kaizen.
And it was the whole concept of getting better

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:49.960
every day.
And

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.300
Ko was an example of that.
And it was -- it's a place -- well it's 12

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.000
seats.
We don't need reservations.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.550
We can't do 300 covers, because the place
was literally falling apart.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.500
And we don't have enough money to really renovate
it.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:12.520
So what would be the biggest and most radical
thing we could do in terms of food?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.760
And for me, at that time, I was really -- and
I still think one of the coolest things that

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.670
could ever happen foodwise, besides actually
manipulating the food is, serving great food.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.010
Like, the best food -- imagine the best food
in the world you've ever had coming out of

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.100
a truck, a food truck, or a little hole in
the wall.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.330
Like, why does it have to stop?
Why do people have to set their standards

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.320
to the environment they're in?
So what we've done at Momofuku, and I'm constantly

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.490
trying to push upon people is, "Let's have
the highest standards possible."

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.100
I always say like, "Why not us?"
Why can't we have the best food in the world?

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.720
We can aspire to be that.
Why can't we have the best service in the

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.290
world?
Even though people don't expect it, we want

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.390
people to leave being like, "Fuck, that was
amazing, I can't believe that happened."

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:08.390
If that doesn't happen, you know, we fail.
But it's really important that all of our

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:14.010
employees get that notion that -- and it's
hard for cooks, because they're allergic to

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.860
anything corporate or any type of message,
unless they're getting yelled at, so.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:27.959
Back to Ko -- 12-seat restaurant and no menu.
We're just going to serve you food.

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:33.170
Three cooks.
It was a way to pay the cooks more money.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.970
Sort of bothers me that -- I'm very happy
that servers are getting paid what they do,

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.940
but it bothers me that cooks don't get -- they're
not allowed to in New York, or probably in

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.230
the rest of America.
Part of the tip rule, so.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:54.470
Ko was born out of that process a little bit.
If the cook served the food, we were allowed

00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:02.410
to legally pay them from the tip pool.
So cooks at Ko make a lot of money for line

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:07.240
cooks.
And we do 24 covers a night.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:13.250
And we receive three stars in New York Times.
And I'm still blown away by this.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:19.400
And the pressure of it really is intense.
Because, as a chef, and one that really respects

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.890
French culture -- The Michelin guy gave us
two Michelin stars for Ko.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:31.020
And it's something that -- it was a team effort
and it always is, but it was very difficult.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.730
And it still is difficult to sort of be like,
"Okay, we have two stars.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:42.960
Like what do we do?" Like how do you improve?
If you lose it, it's the worst feeling in

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.360
the world.
So, you know, that's sort of what happened.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.730
And we opened up Milk Bar.
And things just -- it was snowball effect,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.120
and all these things happened.
And we sort of stayed true to our philosophy

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.120
of just trying to do things the right way.
And I say, I define integrity -- at least

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.480
when I hire cooks -- you know, you can make
a dish, and there's a thousand different ways

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.521
you can go about doing that.
But if you choose to do it the right way,

00:19:10.521 --> 00:19:14.811
it's usually the longest and the hardest way.
And integrity, to me -- at least in the kitchen

00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:19.280
 -- is, when nobody's looking, nobody really
cares what you're doing, and you're working

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.090
on your project, and you're creating mise
en place, and that's basically you're prepping

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.910
out food.
Say, you're prepping out a dish, and you're

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:34.420
taking -- nobody notices, but you take the
road that is the most difficult, because you

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.330
know it's the right way.
Even though the end product -- if you take

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.050
a shortcut -- it would not be noticeable,
that's integrity to me.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.120
When somebody chooses to do that and they're
not getting a pat on the back.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.580
And we try to instill that in our cooks, and
we try to instill that in all of our restaurants.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:58.679
So, that's how Milk Bar opened up.
Everything happened by accident.

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:05.870
We had a really bad landlord, who threatened
to put in a new restaurant and that would

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.290
have messed up Ssam Bar.
So we took his space.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.110
We have an incredibly talented, pastry chef
named Christina Tosi.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.600
And I just sort of let her do whatever she
wanted to do.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:24.559
And if you ever come by New York and you're
in need of a sugar fix, yeah, be careful.

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:29.610
It's highly addictive stuff.
And things have moved on, and all these projects

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.230
have happened.
And I'm sort of glad that we signed a deal

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:38.850
in Las Vegas, and it fell through.
Well, the hotel is not going to ever probably

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.750
happen.
And we signed a deal to do a restaurant in

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.790
Midtown.
And I never thought we'd open a restaurant

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.180
in Midtown.
It's going to be called Ma Peche, and it's

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.831
going to be French/Vietnamese.
And I feel like my good friend, Tien Ho, who

00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:58.840
I worked with for a long time ever since Cafe
Bleu, who's incredibly talented.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.870
It's too hard in New York right now for a
young chef to open up a restaurant.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.520
It's too cost-prohibitive.
We are fortunate enough to provide opportunities.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.770
So I feel like everything's been done.
Like, my original goal was just to open up

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.030
that restaurant, and everything else has been
gravy ever since.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:29.640
So if I can help facilitate the goals and
dreams of my friends, then that's all the

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.020
better.
And that's sort of what we're working on in

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.000
Midtown.
And it's a new project.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:45.420
And I guess that's sort of what Pete helped
document in the book. And yeah.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.520
But the funny thing is, people are like, "Why
would you want to document it?"

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:59.910
I have this sense of doom.
Every day I feel like everything's going to

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.890
fall apart.
And I told Pete, "Well, things are going pretty

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.040
well now, but I don't know if we'll be in
business next year, so let's just document

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.441
this and see what happens. And let it ride."
So, that's sort of how it happened.

00:22:12.441 --> 00:22:18.510
And then, it stopped sort of March 2008.
And, you know, a lot of things have happened

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:25.200
since then, and we're here now.
So I never, ever would have thought that I'd

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.230
be at Google campus, talking to a bunch of
Google employees.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:36.330
And realize it's a very small world.
I've met several people here that I have some

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:42.240
funny stories, I can't share with you guys.
[laughter] It's been a very strange trip.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:49.910
I've been very lucky, but at the end of the
day, it's been about focusing on mistakes

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.390
and having the courage to just go for it,
you know.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.470
Because I always say, "You're going to be
dead. No one's going to care what you do."

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:07.679
And you know, I mean, I think when you're
young enough, and if you don't have responsibilities

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:16.610
like supporting a family or children or wife,
you should be as selfish as possible and go

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:22.860
for broke.
And that's sort of how we've approached our

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.650
food, how we look at our food, and how we've
grown our business.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:32.140
And that's something that is actually fearful
for me, because I don't know if we're going

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.179
to be able to continue that approach as we
get bigger.

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:39.710
Now we have -- we had no employees, I couldn't
hire anybody.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.480
Nobody wanted to work with me.
And now, we're going to have over 300 employees.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:52.300
So things have changed a dramatic amount for
me, and I'm just learning how to deal with

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.640
it, so.
I'm just trying to stay as grounded and humble

00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.830
as possible, because all this stuff can really
screw with your head, so.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:12.710
That's pretty much it.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:24.090
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.680
&gt;&gt; And so, we're live with questions on the
Q and A mic.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.990
David Chang: By the way, you guys should know
that, in the cooking community, it's a big

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.490
joke.
Like, "We should have done better in school.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:39.610
We could get a job at Google."
[Laughter] Cooking is not that glamorous.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.980
It's not that -- it's fun, but like, there
are certain points where you're like, "Man,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.419
I really fucked up." [laughter]

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:58.870
Q I'll start it off with an easy question.
My friend, Grace, is a food blogger in New

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.690
York City.
She wanted to know if your parents had to

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.910
go through the online reservation system when
they ate at Ko.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.580
David Chang: They did.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.580
Q And could you expand on that?

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.030
David Chang: They did. They had their opportunity
 -- my friends and family.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:19.190
And it's really important to me that managers
 -- myself included, sous chefs, chef de cuisines,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.679
these are all variety of management levels
 -- hold themselves to a higher standard.

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:27.740
I never want them to be in a position where
they can take from the employees.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:33.179
I never want them to be in a position where
they can be morally compromised.

00:25:33.179 --> 00:25:38.300
So we have, for the restaurant industry I
think, ridiculously high standards for how

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:45.059
things are done.
And I think that, had I cheated the system

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:47.059
for my parents, it wouldn't have set a good
example.

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:51.841
So if my parents have to do it, then everyone
else has to do it. So.

00:25:51.841 --> 00:25:57.810
Q David, thanks so much for coming.
I think I speak for everybody.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:03.900
My question is, would you ever consider opening
a restaurant in San Francisco?

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.900
Love Mission burritos, but frankly, I'm kind
of sick of eating things on the plate.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.640
David Chang: Yeah, well I got a lot of heat
for -- a lot of trouble for -- recent comments,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.299
but I stand by that.
You know, as a generalization, I'm learning,

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:22.520
you know, what I say actually gets out in
the public, which is a totally weird concept.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.559
[laughter]
But when I said that -- and we spoke about

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:37.510
it last night with couple other chefs, and
I don't know if I'd open up a restaurant in

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.850
San Francisco, as much as I'd like to.
I don't know if that would happen.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.820
I'd like to open up something because of the
produce.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:51.840
I think San Francisco and California -- even
L.A -- arguably has the best produce in the

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.660
world.
You know, maybe I didn't articulate it well-enough,

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:05.559
and that was probably what happened.
But I just feel that I love Alice Waters,

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:10.690
I love what Chez Panisse has done.
I love the off-shoots of it.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.669
And Alice is like my mom.
I have these mother figures in my life, and

00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:15.250
she's one of them.
So it's really important.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.760
And I know that her and Tony don't get along,
so it puts me in an awkward position.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:29.380
[laughter] But she provides the ideal -- the
utopian concept -- and it's very important

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:39.470
that she exists and that she pushes her vision.
But, at the same time, it's been the success

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.910
of Chez Panisse.
The success of Oliveto, Zuni Cafe, and a lot

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:52.299
of those restaurants have been so, so strong
that I think that it's killed any other creativity.

00:27:52.299 --> 00:28:00.619
And I just think the Bay Area almost -- outside
of the French Laundry and a handful of restaurants

00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:07.750
 -- it just promotes the status quo in terms
of what food is.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:13.049
And I think that, as a city and as an area
that is as culturally diverse, ethnically

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:16.500
diverse -- I think the food should be representative
of that.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.730
And that's what I meant by, "Every restaurant
is always serving figs on a plate."

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.220
Obviously that's a generalization.
It rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:32.429
I didn't mean to offend anybody, but [laughter]
It was more like, "Hey, you guys have awesome

00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:37.590
stuff. It's great.
You guys have enough restaurants that are

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.260
cooking with that philosophy of purity, and
it's important that those restaurants exist."

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.710
Chez Panisse, Oliveto -- these are some of
my favorite restaurants.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.289
But why does every restaurant have to sort
of be in that family tree?

00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:56.150
And I think that, if you don't encourage young
talent, if this city doesn't encourage progressive

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:04.320
cooking -- and 'progressive' doesn't have
to be modern culinary, you know, push an envelope.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.740
It can be simple as well.
Just a variety of different things.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.520
And that's what I was trying to say.
I love San Francisco, I love the Bay Area,

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.980
and I just I want it to have -- just like
I want America -- I just think that America,

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.350
New York in general, we can always strive
to do better.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.320
And that's all I'll say. So.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:32.230
Q Hi, David. In your talk, you mentioned a
lot about 'focusing on mistakes'.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.410
Can you talk about some of the culinary mistakes
that you or your chefs have made that would

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.460
make interesting stories?

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:46.690
David Chang: Well, I can think right off the
top of my head, I was so bad in cooking school

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:55.080
that my partner quit cooking school. [laughter]
Yeah, it's a true story.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.970
She owns a restaurant in New York, and she
decided to go to culinary school.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:07.530
And yeah, she's like, "I refuse to."
She found out that I was going to be her level-two

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:13.890
partner, and she said she would rather quit
than be my partner.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:18.450
That's how bad I was as a cook.
And that's the one thing about cooking.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:26.620
I have this guy -- he's actually from Berkeley.
I told my guys at Ssam Bar that this guy -- he

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:32.460
was a cuni at Ko, and he makes blunder after
blunder after blunder.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:39.059
And maybe I see a little of myself in him.
But he's just got this stubbornness about

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:43.070
him where he's just going to work and work
till he gets it right.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:48.440
Is he the fastest cook? No.
Is he the best cook I've ever seen? No.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.610
But, it is that sort of doggedness and this
determination to get it right where I told

00:30:53.610 --> 00:31:00.520
everyone, I was like, "I would rather have
like, ten cooks like this guy than have like

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.470
five, super-star cooks."
Because I think building a team around people

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:10.230
like that is how you build a company and particularly
how you start a restaurant.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.549
And so, yeah.
I've seen every mistake I think under the

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:21.039
sun.
So yeah. I've made a lot of them.

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:29.169
Fortunately for me, I haven't been on the
receiving end of a lot of like, missing fingers

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:31.669
and digits and stuff, so. Yeah.

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:37.020
Q Cool. You mentioned that, in the beginning,
you just really wanted to open one restaurant,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.919
and it was you and another person actually
doing the cooking.

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:43.150
Now that you have like multiple restaurants
open, what percent of your time would you

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:48.600
say you spend managing the book of business
and the 300 people working for you?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.680
And what percent of the time would you say
you spend actually in the kitchen and working

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.610
on your dishes?

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:05.020
David Chang: That's a very, very -- that question
is something I ask myself every day.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.340
I don't spend that much time in the kitchen
anymore.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:14.539
And that's something that's very difficult.
Because when you're a cook, you come in the

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:17.780
mornings and afternoons.
You get a piece of paper.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.080
There's another piece of paper from your nighttime
partner.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:28.080
And you write a mise en place list.
And your goal is just to prep out, cross stuff

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.460
off, until dinner service starts.
And then, you work service.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.190
You have a good service or you have a bad
service, but you feel completed, because that

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:41.870
was your day.
That's how you could define yourself.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:51.240
And that's still how I feel about work.
One of the reasons why I enjoy cooking so

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:58.530
much is because it was actually, for me, I
could quantify a good day of work.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:04.510
Now, for many reasons, I'm not in the kitchen.
I'm not cooking.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.929
For instance, like Ko, I really shouldn't
be in the hospitality business, because I'm

00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:16.159
not that friendly to guests, I guess.
But it's also because we have open kitchens,

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:24.030
and it's just too much.
And my time would be better spent observing

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.809
behind the scenes and teaching the cooks,
before service starts.

00:33:29.809 --> 00:33:37.810
And you know, becoming a manager has probably
taken up most of my time these days.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:44.620
I have to cook occasionally, but I thought
that I'd be able to sort of come up with dishes

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.179
theoretically speaking.
And it just doesn't happen.

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:50.090
You need to work with the product, at least
for me.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:57.039
And, you know, I was telling Pete, "Hopefully,
by the summer, I'll be able to get back into

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:59.900
the kitchen."
But part of it is, I have this weird thing

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:06.000
about creativity.
I just think that, for me as a cook, I just

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.509
think that you hit a point where you're not
going to get better.

00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:16.649
You know, cooking is one of those industries
 -- or at least fields -- where I just don't

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:20.529
think you get better as you get older.
Ideas don't come to you as easily.

00:34:20.529 --> 00:34:25.289
Obviously, that's not the case for everyone.
But for myself, you just get bogged down with

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:28.309
other stuff.
So, you know, whether it's opening another

00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:33.469
restaurant, or say, I have a family down the
road, my energies are going to be elsewhere

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:38.009
other than thinking about food.
And for five years straight, it was pretty

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:42.200
much only food, and I could just focus on
that.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.619
And I was really supported by an incredible
team.

00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:51.810
And it's really not just me.
I mean, I am really blessed to have an amazing

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.519
staff.
I think we have one of the best crews in New

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:57.759
York City. So.
And I still don't know how or why they're

00:34:57.759 --> 00:35:00.890
still working with me, but I'm lucky for that.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:07.930
Q Hi. So I was working at a three-star restaurant
in New York when Ssam got it's three stars

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:14.359
in the New York Times.
And I don't think we were pissed, but we were

00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:15.359
kind of like, "What?"

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:16.359
David Chang: You were like, "What the fuck?"
[laughter]

00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:19.940
Q Yeah, I guess it was like a "What the fuck?"
kind of thing.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.460
But I think -- what you said in the beginning
was that the customers are always wrong.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.390
And the philosophy that I was taught where
I come from is, "Customers are always right,

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:33.260
and then some."
But you've got too much _____ stars at Ko.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.339
So obviously, you guys are doing something
right.

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:37.190
So I'd just love to hear more about your customer
service philosophies.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:42.150
David Chang: That's the thing.
It's like, I like looking at things in, obviously,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:47.950
a different way when people say it's a bad
idea or something is a cliche or something

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:52.829
is just not working.
I like to analyze it, because people aren't

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:54.710
looking at it.
And I think that there might be something

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.359
more to it.
I'll give you a perfect example.

00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:02.999
And you know, Daniel Humm.
He's a chef at another management park.

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:08.029
But the old Noodle Bar -- customer was complaining
about pork belly in our pork buns.

00:36:08.029 --> 00:36:12.880
And I've served enough pork belly.
I know pork belly. I know exactly what it

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.380
should look like.
And we served him.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.650
And Daniel was actually right next to him,
and he was laughing his ass off.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:25.759
He was like, "This isn't pork belly; there's
too much fat in it." And I'm just like, [laughter]

00:36:25.759 --> 00:36:30.539
He wanted a refund, he didn't want new pork
buns, and I'm just like, "I'm sorry no."

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:35.640
I mean, this is what you ordered.
This actually has less fat content than most

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.210
pork bellies, so.
And he was going on and on and on, how much

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:46.519
he knew about pork bellies.
So I was like, "Just shut the fuck up." [laughter]

00:36:46.519 --> 00:36:52.799
And you know, most restaurants would, obviously,
go the other way.

00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:56.839
It worked for us at that time.
I don't know if it will continue to work for

00:36:56.839 --> 00:37:01.180
us.
But, you know, a lot of times when we make

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.780
mistakes -- like, if we're going to make a
mistake, I want us to be aware of it, and

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.400
I want us to be two steps ahead of that.
So hopefully, we're not making mistakes.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.680
But if we do make a mistake, like if we overcook
a piece of fish and, you know, it's objectively

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:20.710
proven that we fucked up, you know, whether
it be on a service end or the creation of

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:26.859
the dish, we'll go out of our way to make
that person -- we'll go out of our way to

00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:32.499
make it right.
So yeah. Customer is not always right.

00:37:32.499 --> 00:37:37.739
I mean, that's the thing.
It's like, these maxims -- these platitudes

00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:47.789
 -- they're like, Why can't they be challenged?
So. You know like, I had to attend this stupid,

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:50.690
corporate thing, because we're getting bigger.
[laughter]

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:56.099
I never thought that we'd attend -- like have
management coaches.

00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:58.809
And I call them like a Bob and Ross office
space.

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.180
And they were like, "You don't have a mission
statement."

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.760
And I was like, "Why do we need a mission
statement?" [laughter]

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.009
And I was like, "I'm pretty sure we know what
we need to do."

00:38:08.009 --> 00:38:11.039
But she was adamant like, "You need to have
a mission statement." [laughter]

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.999
And I was like, "But why?" And she couldn't
answer it.

00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:18.430
Because she's like, "Every company has one."
But I was like, because -- how we go about

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:23.749
doing stuff or whether it's creating a dish
or coming up with a new idea, I think it's

00:38:23.749 --> 00:38:29.510
incredibly inefficient.
It doesn't, it's not the way most people would

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:36.230
go about doing it. We don't.
It doesn't follow a linear path, and I'm happy

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.650
with that.
And basically, she couldn't understand that

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:48.339
concept, that I'm happy with this crazy, windy
line that we're following, because I think

00:38:48.339 --> 00:38:53.579
the end product is going to be superior than
following this planned outline.

00:38:53.579 --> 00:39:00.279
And it's a very organic, crazy process, so.
That's why we don't have a mission statement.

00:39:00.279 --> 00:39:03.839
And then, I was just like, "We just won't.
We don't."

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:08.519
So you know, I don't know. So that's what
I told her.

00:39:08.519 --> 00:39:10.550
She's like, "Well, everyone has to have a
mission statement."

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.789
I was like, "But why?" And she still didn't
answer me.

00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:18.270
So
I don't get it.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.769
Q Hi. So you seem to take some pretty firm
stances and have strong opinions.

00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:27.019
And I'm just wondering, in general, related
to your industry or food, What you think's

00:39:27.019 --> 00:39:28.559
overrated and underrated?

00:39:28.559 --> 00:39:44.460
David Chang: In the restaurant business?
I would start with our restaurants for sure.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:51.960
I think, what's underrated...
There isn't actually enough going on I think

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.890
in the American food culture to say that there's
anything underrated right now.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:03.579
I think that, overall, going back to what
we were talking about in the beginning of

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:08.380
the conversation about figs, there isn't enough
creativity.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:13.640
People aren't -- it's sort of stagnant.
We don't have people that are pushing the

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.300
envelope.
You have pockets here or there, with Wily

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:24.859
in New York and you know Chicago the whole
scene is sort of like that.

00:40:24.859 --> 00:40:31.190
But it's really -- it doesn't have to always
be that type of food, and I think that is

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:36.789
underrated.
People may say "it's stupid" or -- I just

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:41.190
don't feel that it's properly understood.
And I don't think people understand -- I almost

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.829
consider it like high fashion.
People don't understand that it actually does

00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:52.979
trickle down and changes everything.
And right now, if you speak to most people

00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:57.940
I think in general like, America is still
a steakhouse town -- a hamburger town.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.809
And that's a problem.
Not a problem, I just don't think that there's

00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:09.299
anything that's underrated.
So. I don't know if I answered your question.

00:41:09.299 --> 00:41:11.160
I confuse myself. [laughter]

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:17.559
Q Hi. Given the importance that you put on
creativity, how do you inspire that as a manager,

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:20.070
since you can't do it for all your restaurants
from the kitchen anymore?

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:27.410
David Chang: I am going through that process
right now.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:32.170
It's very difficult.
Managing people is one of the worst things

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:36.759
in the world. [laughter]
You know, I guess some people.

00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:38.619
But the thing is, I don't think people are
born with it.

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:41.329
Just something you learn.
You learn to deal with it.

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:48.810
And for a long time, I could work just on
pure rage and anger. [laughter]

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:58.549
And I literally could. Pete's in this.
I could work and just be in a fit of anger.

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:01.950
And it would last all day, and I could just
get so much done.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.819
It was like adrenaline.
And I could sort of, you know, get people

00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:17.670
to get -- I could move people faster, because
 -- out of sheer fear. [laughter]

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:23.619
Maybe a little still. But it took a toll on
my health -- stress, for sure.

00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:31.769
And I'm trying to find a better way in terms
of managing people.

00:42:31.769 --> 00:42:35.290
Because not everyone -- I assume that everyone
has the same goals.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:43.522
Maybe I should write a mission statement down.
I don't know. [laughter]

00:42:43.522 --> 00:42:48.579
But I do assume that people have the same
goals, and recently, with the Midtown project

00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:58.920
that we're working on, I was just like, "Why
are

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.489
we just meeting expectations?"
And it really made me upset.

00:43:01.489 --> 00:43:06.190
And then, I'm going through this process right
now.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:12.190
So I'm trying to figure it out -- how to manage
people and to have them be inspired to sort

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:21.609
of exceed expectations -- from a distance.
I feel like I'd be able to be more effective

00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:28.140
with that message if I was at Midtown.
But I'm not. I'm here.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:34.069
And I'm not going to be in Midtown that much
this year at all because of the growing business

00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:39.219
and different ventures going on.
So, I got to learn quickly how to manage people

00:43:39.219 --> 00:43:42.619
at a distance and.

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:53.569
Q Hi. As a long-time New Yorker and have recently
moved out here, I've sort of found that the

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:57.089
Silicon Valley, the South Bay, is actually
sort of bland for food.

00:43:57.089 --> 00:44:04.749
How do we as sort of customers and consumers
make or help good food to happen?

00:44:04.749 --> 00:44:11.420
David Chang: I think this is, again, a question
 -- great question -- that was brought up

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.450
yesterday.
I disagree with the panel. I didn't voice

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:17.200
my opinion.
I think that a lot of it has to depend on

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.239
the cooks. The chefs.
We're the middlemen between the purveyors

00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:27.920
and the farmers and to the customer.
And we have to take the chance.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.719
Chefs have to take the chance.
Restaurant tours have to take a chance to

00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:39.239
open up restaurants that will challenge your
palate -- that will please your palate, that

00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:47.380
will at the end of the day be a good restaurant.
But a lot of that -- but, you know, you got

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:54.190
to meet us sort of halfway a little bit.
Because, you know, I think Rob brought up

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.019
a good example of this restaurant called Winchell
Land.

00:44:57.019 --> 00:45:03.940
And it failed, but a lot of it -- the reason
it failed, I'm sure the biggest reason was

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:12.450
lack of support from the neighborhood.
Again, they didn't want to support something

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:18.049
that was going to be drastically different.
It didn't fit the San Francisco mold.

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:24.299
So, I think that -- I don't know.
I don't have that answer.

00:45:24.299 --> 00:45:30.160
But I do know if you find -- you read the
local newspaper, and they were reviewing some

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:37.809
spot and some young kid is doing something
crazy or sounds wacky, go support him.

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:42.299
Because trust me, you're not making much money
in this business.

00:45:42.299 --> 00:45:49.509
And to take that leap of faith and to open
up a place that is unconventional, you know,

00:45:49.509 --> 00:45:53.450
that's the best thing you can do is support
them, so.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:58.589
And be patient.
Because we're the perfect example of making

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:02.969
really bad food and learning how to make it
somewhat tasty now, so.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:06.029
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:26.859
Q So I'll end it up with one final question.
So what's on the plate when you cook for yourself

00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:29.309
when you're eating at home or outside the
restaurant?

00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:38.989
David Chang: In my refrigerator right now
I have some beer and a bottle of champagne

00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:48.710
that I will never drink because I just won't.
I never cook for myself.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.980
I don't even have a plate where I have nothing,
because usually I order delivery.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:02.210
[laughter] It's one of the few pleasures of
living in New York is that you can get almost

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:08.260
anything you want delivered.
And, you know, the meal that I want to have

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:14.809
 -- the meal that I eat the most -- and I
consider restaurants my home -- is the staff

00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:17.279
meal.
And it's the most important meal of the day,

00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:21.000
and it's something that I witness here today.
It's really cool that you guys have these

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.500
cafeterias.
I don't think how -- maybe you guys do fathom

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.390
how important it is that you guys have an
amazing F and B program here.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.039
And staff meal is the most important meal
of the day.

00:47:34.039 --> 00:47:38.900
And I tell my cooks that.
"If you're not going to spend time and love

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:44.930
and passion trying to make something delicious
for your peers -- for the servers and the

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:50.509
guy next to you -- how are you going to care
about a paying customer?" So that's why staff

00:47:50.509 --> 00:47:53.979
meal to me is the ultimate judge of like,
how our restaurant's doing.

00:47:53.979 --> 00:48:00.630
So for me, even though I don't cook at home,
that's what I eat usually.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.829
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Well, thank you very much, that
was an amazing talk.

00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:04.829
David Chang: Thank you very much.

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.830
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
