&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.470
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So welcome
everyone to today's topic

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.090
and preservation series,
presentation.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.190
Delighted to have you
here and welcome also

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.460
to everyone we have
participating online.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.390
The presentation today
is by Dr. Eric Monroe.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.540
And this will be on Broken
Cylinders: Uncovering the nature

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.180
of damage to early wax cylinder
audio recordings during storage.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.070
So Eric is a supervisory physical
scientist here in the preservation,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.650
research and testing division.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.460
He received a Ph.D. in chemistry

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.570
from the University
of Illinois in 2008.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410
Following a postdoctoral work,
following postdoctoral work

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.040
at the University of Alabama,
Birmingham and the University

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.570
of Arizona he was a chemist in
the corporate characterization lab

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.620
and came to the Library
of Congress in 2015.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.110
I was delighted when I was talking
with him when we started talking

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.700
about degradation mechanisms
and reverse engineering.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.630
I thought hum, I think we
have a project that's waiting.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.360
So without any ado I will hand
over to Eric and we will learn more

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.510
about fun things we'll be
doing with wax cylinders.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:31.690
[ Pause ]

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.130
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: All right.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.020
Thanks [inaudible], thanks
to everybody for coming

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.800
and those who are online.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.230
What I wanted to talk to you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.450
about today was the work I've
been doing with wax cylinders.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350
Before coming to the Library wax
cylinders, I said what is those?

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.940
So what they are is turned
out to be quite exciting.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.630
They're the first successfully
commercialized recorded

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.930
sound carriers.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.760
So about four inches long and like
LPs, vinyls, they groove media.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.460
But unlike modern disc groove
media these grooves are very wise

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.760
and very shallow.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.130
This presents a challenge
I'll talk about later.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.160
And also unlike the normal
grooves the audio is on the bottom

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.900
of the floor, of the groove.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.890
So you can see kind
of a topographical map

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.810 position:56%
on the bottom right or actually this
is an optical image from a cylinder.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.220
You can kind of see how the needle

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.300
of the stylist would
write along this groove,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.810
it then vibrates a plate
and that produces the sound.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.550
So this was a massive change
in humanity basically.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.540
Now we can record our
sounds and go from there.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.470
So, one of the manufacturers
was Thomas Edison's companies.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.620
It had a couple of different
names over the years.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.440
And he had a group that
would produce the material,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.520
they would sell the
material to the company

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.850
that would then cast it
and put the audio on it.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.960
But over time they had a
couple of different iterations.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.900
They started off in 1889 releasing
this brown wax on far left.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.770
They were the first manufacturers
to use a homogeneous composition.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.510
They kept that for a while.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.670
Had some difficulties in how
they were doing the reproductions

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.390
such that it was an
instantaneous recording.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.660
So, for the most part the band
was in the room with the cylinder

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.960
when the cylinder was made.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.020
When we, toward the later portion
of the time before they moved

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.250
to the black cylinders in 1902
that they came up with a nifty way

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.760
of using pantograph
kind of situation

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.980
where they could have a
number of master cylinders

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.140
and then record a handful of
others, five or ten at a time.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.500
So needless to say they got,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.370
decided that that wasn't
necessarily commercially feasible

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.390
in the long term so
they worked really hard.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.110
Came up with a way of
making molded cylinders,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.310
that is that gold molded
cylinder in 1902.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.590
From there they changed their
formulation quite dramatically

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.530
to make a four minute cylinder.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.830
So instead of having
just two minutes

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.600
of audio they can now
put a whooping four.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.860
They did this just by
making the grooves smaller

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.200
and upping the density.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.400 position:56%
And then they finally moved to using
a celluloid based material in 1912.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.220 position:56%
This talk is going to focus entirely

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.830
on the really old stuff,
the brown waxes.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.050 position:56%
And so here is kind of images of
how they were doing these recordings

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.780
in these commercial cylinders.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.590
So you might the entire band,
I believe that's the Navy band

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.680
on the left and they are
recording nine cylinders at a time.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.980
That's high throughput for them.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.740
So they would play
the song, pull it off,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.560
put on new cylinders,
fire up the band again.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.770
So they were making relatively
few of these at a time.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.350
And particularly, you know, they
were useful, interesting and the,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.140
were used a lot as entertainment.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.960
The very first applications were
using these auto phonographs

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.340
on the left where they
would be touring casements

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.360
with a phonograph player
inside with one cylinder.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.130
It would sometimes be changed
out once or twice a week.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.920
You go in, put your nickel, put the
earbuds in and listen to the song.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.510
They also had of course home
models with a reproducing horn.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.740
And then often times they would
be used in kind of parlors.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.830
Now very interesting, we have a lot

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.400
of cylinders that have
music on them.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.060
That's not where this
project came from.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.150
It was learned and
utilized very early

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.040
on that these wax cylinders
could be used

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.260
to make ethnographic
field recordings.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.580
So the Library has approximately
10,000 of these things.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.440
And they start, they date
back to as early as 1890

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.380
with the [inaudible] recordings.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.180
So we have all of these.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.390
They're down NAVCC, the National
Audio Visual Conservancy Center.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.430
And we're slowly going through and
looking to do digital transfers

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.730
of these cylinders again.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.450
They've been transferred
a while ago but now

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.620
that technology has gotten better
we can get much better audio

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.080
of the material.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.920 position:56%
Unfortunately sometimes when we open
the box the cylinders have damage.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.560
Sometimes it's a crack.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.850
Sometimes it's a service
[inaudible].

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.000
But the biggest concern
was the cracking.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.010
When I mentioned before that
those grooves are very shallow,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.000
they're only about 10 micron deep,
that's the 10th of a human hair

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.990
and about 125 micron wide.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.100
It's almost the reverse for vinyl.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.380
So if you try and play that with
a stylist it's going to skip

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.590
and often times damage
the rest of your cylinder.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.520
We don't really like doing that.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.040
We are, of course do
have a developing Irene

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.800
which is a noncontact
playback method.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.520
But for kind of high
throughput and some

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.740 position:56%
of the best recordings come back,
still back playing with the stylist.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.940
So that's where this
entire project started was,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.190
the question is, why
are they breaking?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.490
Why are they breaking?

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.790
What can we do to stop it?

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.870
And really is this
a ticking time bomb?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.870
These cylinders were commercial
or basically a commodity good.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.030
They weren't meant to last forever.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.160
They actually in the
very early stages

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.800
when that particularly
the auto phonograph,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.400
it was kind of a selling point
to the for bands and musicians

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.300
that these things actually
have a limited playback time.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.870
So you're guaranteed to be
called back in to record

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.790
with us again if you sign now.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.090
Long term employment.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.570
It's great.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.300 position:56%
So when I was thinking about how can
we, how should I develop a project

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.740
to try and address this situation.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.760
Just coming in from
industry, it was okay.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.450
I'd been doing reverse
engineering of materials.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.510
I've got all the tools in lab.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.210
So I can go do [inaudible]
analysis, identify what's there,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.390
make the materials and
then test them again.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.000
Are they the same,
are they different?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.900
Also thought of well let's
go back into the records.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.200
What do we know?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.880
So I started looking at some 20th
century reports, various books,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.350
papers, things like that.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.350
And the stated composition
was not the same

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.360
in any single one of those records.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.840
Well okay, that was
a kind of strike.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.250
And I'm thinking okay,
maybe I really need

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.550
to do this whole reverse
engineering.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.780
This is going to be
much more difficult.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.250
Then I got lucky.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.700
I got lucky because at Rutgers
University is currently digitizing

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.600
all of the Edison Company's papers.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.750
And as the material
was initially developed

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.800
by Thomas Edison's
companies, that's in there.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.440
I say I got lucky because
they had digitized to 1905.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.660
And in 1905 there was a lawsuit.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:02.300
The lawsuit was between,
so not, sorry reverse.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.730
Not only is it a lawsuit but
I also can then go through

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.100
and grab lab notebooks, which
as a scientist is really cool.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.750
So the lawsuit.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.770
So I could spend probably a
good hour just walking you

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.310
through the ins and outs of this
and kind of the funness with that.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.840
Unfortunately there aren't many
images that can go with it.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.470
So I'll try and keep
it relatively brief.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.850
It's still kind of funny.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.590
So National Phonograph
was Edison's company.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.940
As I was mentioned they had,
they had released the brown wax

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.440
in the finalized form in 1889.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.030
At the same time American
Graphophone was producing their

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.330
own cylinders.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.590
Large, their cylinders
were paper core

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.310
with a thin mineral wax coating.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.930
These were not very robust.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.850
They were prone to cracking.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.040
So they were really not
having much of a market share.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.820
They were basically being
taken to the cleaners.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.120
So a guy by the name of
Thomas MacDonald got in touch

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.050
with American Graphophone,
signed a contract with them

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.670
to produce a much better material.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.110
He bet the farm on a
lead based composition

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.850
and said this is the
way we need to go.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.340
That composition had
a lot of problems.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.970
They would mold the cylinder very
similar to the Edison cylinders

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.390
and it would look fine initially.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.480
But in a day or two it
would haze over the surface.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.500 position:56%
Haze over an [inaudible] surface
when you're trying to play a stylist

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.540
with very tiny little bumps at the
bottom means it just doesn't work.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.220
So they were getting
lots of complaints.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.360
Basically were going
to have to do a recall.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.070
So MacDonald's bosses came to him
and said okay you have three months

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.860
to make a composition that is
as good or better than Edison's.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.450
Get it in the factory and get
it sold otherwise you're fired.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.010
And if you look at the details in
your contract you owe us damages.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.870
Needless to say he got a little bit
creative at that point to the tune

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.570
of three different mechanisms

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.900
that were effectively
industrialized [inaudible].

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.080
Two industrialized [inaudible] and
one things that happen in industry.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.080
So he got in touch with
the procurement agent

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.200
for National Phonograph
and said I'll give you $500

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.810
if you tell me what's your ordering
into the production facility.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.520
He then hired away one
of the mold makers.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.070
So he was just dipping cylinders
all day every day saying I will

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.370
hire you.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.670
I'll pay you three
times what you're worth.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.610
You won't even really
have to work for us.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.070
All you have to do is
go across the hallway

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.840
to where they actually
make the composition

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.550
and bring me that recipe.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.660
The third thing is he got
in touch with a soap maker

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.820
out of Evansville, Indiana.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.590
Sent him a couple of cylinders
and said please replicate this.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:06.150
The soap maker turns around,
decides yeah I'll do this.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:12.060 position:56%
What we'll do is I don't know how
much this will cost us but just pay,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.810
I'll keep track of how long it
takes us, what the costs were

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.380
and just reimburse us for that.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.490
This is kind of an
interesting challenge for us.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.580
It's something we don't get
to mess around with a lot.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.690 position:56%
A couple of weeks later that guy
has reverse engineered the material,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.490
recreated Edison's composition
and sent the cylinders

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.900
and the formulas back to MacDonald.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.570
MacDonald then now has these
three different recipes.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.750
All are basically the same.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.090
There is a slight difference with
another one because Edison ended

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.750
up making their composition
two different ways.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.590
I'll talk about that in
much more detail later.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.720
So MacDonald then turns
around and patents it.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.080
He applied for the patent in 1896.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.330
It was awarded in 1898.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.050
It has only his name on it.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.340
He did not of course let
the patent office know any

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:12.170
of those three levels of trickery
when he received the information.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.410
So now this is a lawsuit in 1905.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.800
That's nine years later.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.210
What happened was when,
so the two companies ended

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.540
up just manufacturing the same
material over that time period.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.670
Edison knew that he didn't
really, he couldn't do anything

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.800
because he didn't patent
the material.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.790
He was using it as a trade secret
saying no one will understand what

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.290
my secret sauce is.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.950
So there's the patent.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.320
And so the only way that National
Phonograph could not lose this suit

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.310
very badly and particularly

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.420
since the lawsuit's
basically saying you've done,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.260
you've been using this composition
since I invented the composition

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.620
so you've got now nine
years of infringement.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.850
But what triggered
this was Edison's move

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.630
to the two minute black
wax cylinders.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.270
The gold molded process.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.160
The two compositions are
very, very, very similar.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.950
All they do is they changed a
little bit of the ceresin wax

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.530
to ceresin and carnauba wax.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.080
That is a derivative work.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.410
We would probably both invalidate
Edison's patent and possibly lead

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.970
to a large loss on Edison's part.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.480
So in order to get around that
all they had, or they needed

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.300
to show prior, they needed to show,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.240
no we actually developed
this back in 1889.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.740
And we've been doing
that ever since.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.960
So in the deposition
is many, many, many,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.380
many pages of Jonas
Aylsworth's testimony.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.730
And in this process he says I
am the one that invented this.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.860
In 1888 we finalized
the formulation in 1889.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.930
And these were all of the steps
that I took to get to that point.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:05.360
And we were producing this form,
see lab notebook experiment X

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.880
at XY&amp;Z places from
these time periods.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.190
And then we moved to
here and did this.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.490
We did this.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.790
We did this.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.090
We did this.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.390
And then we changed the
formula because of this reason.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.760
And these are the two
that are in the patent.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.230
So this got quite interesting.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:27.590
And so, on the bottom right is
just a, from the brief were saying

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.660
that the letters patent
hereupon is invalid and void

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.620
because the same was obtained
surreptitiously and unjustly

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.480
for the invention which was in fact
invented by the author or others

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.520 position:56%
who were using reasonable diligence.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.430
Basically we created it
and you didn't create it.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.180
Your soap maker made it for you.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.980
So this now gives me a
great wealth of knowledge.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.740
Not only do I have all of
the legal or legal lead,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.850
basically binding recipes,
I also have reference to all

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.110
of the lab notebooks which I can
go into and science geek out at.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.940
So what is this material?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.270
Don't get concerned by all
of the chemical structures.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.040
It's relatively easy.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.830 position:56%
Basically he used the process used
to make soap with two minor changes.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.860
Instead of using a large
fat which has three

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.130
of these fatty acid chains, they
used a purified steric acid.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.780
Back then it was a one to one blend
of the steric and palmitic acid.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.570
You melt that down and
you add in some base,

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.570
sodium hydroxide or
sodium carbonate.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.020 position:56%
They used both at one point in time.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.790
That is the same process
for making normal soap.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.270
The magic here was they
didn't add so much base

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.620
that it turned everything from
the acid form to the sodium form.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.360
They also did this in
the presence of aluminum.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.970
The aluminum was their,
was their secret sauce.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.800
That's the, that aluminum stearate
gave them the right physical

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.800
properties for wear resistance
and the ability to mold

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.610
and basically make
nice little chips.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.810
If you had too much sodium
stearate it goes crystalline.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:17.560
If you don't have enough of the
sodium stearate it is too soft.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.850
And so this was that thing
that was in the middle

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.570
to give them some leeway
during production.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.320
They also then had to add
a little of the ceresin wax

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.970
to basically soften the material
and to make it water resistant.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.410
So I want to go back
in the lab notebooks.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:40.430
And so having these kind of
lab notebooks gives you an eye

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.250
into what they were
actually thinking

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.790
when they were developing
this material.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.900
And I actually highlighted
a number of things

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.460
that weren't in the patent.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.180
A lot of the failure
mechanisms that we see now

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.860
with the cylinders nowadays,
they knew all about back then

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.780
because they were actively
developing their materials

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.760
to not have those problems.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.590
The various hazings, the surface
defects, they were all noted.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.840
And well I've got his
lab notebook on my iPad.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.140
I've read through most of them.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.660
Thankfully he has pretty
reasonable handwriting.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.220
So this experiment 857
is his ah-ha moment.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.160
Up until this point
he had been using,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.670
he had been going similar route

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:26.960
as American Phonograph had
using various mineral waxes

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.410
in various combinations trying to
make just the right properties.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.210
[Inaudible] say well
what if I make some soap?

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.530
So he did.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.310 position:56%
And it, what this was was he took
his steric acid and sodium hydroxide

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.240
and did just the partial
saponification.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.120
So he did, he just added, you know,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.810
about 50% of what he
needed for the base.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:57.270 position:56%
And when he cast that carb to groove
he says it cut to almost perfection.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.050
He then continues, until
basically a couple of days later

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:07.470 position:56%
when it became a little bit
crystalline so it made a lot of pops

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.790
and it was very sensitive to water.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.010
So he's like okay well but
this was a changing moment.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.650
This was the basis for everything

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.170
that happened over
the next 20 years.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.150
So he realized at that point if he
added another metal he could have,

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.440
start to tease out
various properties.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.010
So here 871 he stumbles
upon aluminum acetate.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.550
So here he is adding the
aluminum in in this form

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.020
in the hot molten magma bath
it's basically like napalm.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.090
It's about 400 Fahrenheit by
the time you're done with it.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.810
So it's, you don't
want to get it on you.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.830
But in the process this releases
acidic acid so he doesn't have

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.040 position:56%
to worry about having something else

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.270
in the soup other than
his pure aluminum.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.330
It worked nicely.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.200
He's like well let's
do some other things.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.150
So he spends the next couple
of months looking at all sorts

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:11.270 position:56%
of other metals, lead, nickel, iron,
you know, the list goes on and on.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.380
He had about another 30 or 40
different metals he had looked at.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.080
And decided no, aluminum
was the best thing for us.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.700 position:56%
He then went and had to optimize his
method so he could then scale this

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.870
up from doing it in a
couple of pounds to doing it

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.040
in a production scale
in large metal kettles.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.210
So then they start
making that material.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:36.750
That was in December of 1888.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.740
They then cast the
number of cylinders,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.120
took them to their
recording department.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.680
And the recording department was
complaining because it kept wearing

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.170
down their shaving knives.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.070
So it would come out the mold
and then it be made smooth.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.750
And they couldn't keep a sharp edge

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.210
because the material
was just too hard,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.980
they couldn't cut it
in a production scale.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.530
So, they went back, he's okay,
I'll just add oleic acid,

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.210
it'll soften, it will be great.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.100 position:56%
It was great for a couple of months
until summer happened in New Jersey.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.340
So June, 1889 now they're
getting all sorts of complaints

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.900
because well yeah it's softer,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.120
it takes a groove great,
it sounds great.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.940
But then humidity comes
along, a little bit of heat

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.160
and now the surface
is no longer shiny.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.760
Now it's just exuding what he later
figured out was the oleic acid.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.400 position:56%
So he knew he had to get rid of that
but still put in something softer.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.280
So that's he stumbled
upon the ceresin wax,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.770
it's just a hydrocarbon.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.070
He can throw that in.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.810
And it has the added benefit
of not only making it softer

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.200
but removing the oleic acid.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:45.770 position:56%
From there he wanted to change the
way they were adding in the aluminum

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.090
in a large part because they
were trying to up the process

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.380
and if you didn't boil it long
enough you had acidic acid there.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.730
If you had any acid leftover as
soon as it came out of the mold

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.900
and saw a little bit of moisture
the entire cylinder would just

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.200
haze over.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.400
Again, not what he wanted.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.900
So he'd also decided okay
well let's make the aluminum

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.200
[inaudible] offline.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.250 position:56%
This will allow us to, we'll just
make a bunch of the aluminum stearic

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.240
because we added in
relatively small amounts.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.670
So we can make it in big
batches instead of in one pot.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.320
Set it aside and just
kind of sprinkle it

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.510
in as seasoning whenever
you need to.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.030
He then cut costs by changing

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.890
from sodium hydroxide
to sodium carbonate.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.730
That's also a whole lot safer
because to add the sodium carbonate

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.210
as a powder instead of
liquid sodium hydroxide

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.620
into 400 Fahrenheit boiling
pot of effectively oil.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:45.970
This was a method that they then
ran with for a number of years.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.340
Jonas Alysworth actually
left this project.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.540
And I think at that point
in time went on to go work

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:57.110
on I think it was the
lightbulb production line.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.050
Until they started to have
a lot of more problems

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.570
about six years later, so 1895.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.670
It turns out this is
also the same time

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.010
that MacDonald was snooping around.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.010
So I said that there was two
different copies that he had.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.260
One was the second,
this other method

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.610
where when Alysworth came back

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.310
and was identifying well what the
problem was, he looked in the vats.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.550
And when they were making the
stearic acid they're supposed

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.980
to put them into pans
and cover them.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.500
Well production had gotten enough

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.930
and they had been doing
this for long enough.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.180
They said awe we'll just cut
out the whole cover it problem.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.930
So they were making the aluminum
stearic putting it in pans

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.870
and then leaving it in
the room for a couple

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.420
of months until they needed it.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.360
So it was just dirt
and grime and dust

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.310
because it was an industrial
situation.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.000
So he went back and okay, we'll
just use this all in one pot

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.340
and we'll just throw
in a chunk of aluminum.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.530
It turns out it actually works
and it was quite simple to do.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.200
It's all one pot, throw everything
in, boil it until it stops boiling,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.670
cast it and we're good to go.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.420
So these were the two
methods that he had used.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.980
And needless to say I've got a
lab, I'm going to make these.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.020
I made not only those last two that
they did the long scale production

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.780
but each of the ones that I had
just talked about was something

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.930
that they had produced
commercially outside

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.090
of that very first one
at some point in time.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.510
When I mentioned that the
material's quite easy to make.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.900
The ones that are on the bottom

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.090
for reasons I'll explain
here shortly were all made

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.720
by a high school graduate
student that I had

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.110
as a summer intern last summer.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.010
So we made these materials but
we actually learned something

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.430
in the making of the materials.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.290
One of which was that my
materials were too pure.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.940
In my first iteration of trying

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.400
to make these materials
I was using stearic acid

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.960
that I purchased from
a chemical company.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.140
It's 100% pure almost.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.540
In going through that process
I always saw crystallization.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.160
It wasn't until I was flipping back
through the notebook and he noted,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.740
our stearic acid, we had
these specifications.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.120
It can be 50% palmitic
acid, 50% stearic acid

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.720
and no more than 2% oleic acid.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.880
Oh, yeah that'd do it.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.180
Just having that slight
different length was needed

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.600
to make that amorphic material.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.810
When I started blending the two
together it went from something

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.550
that had always formed crystals
on the surface to something

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.170
which is perfectly amorphous
and by hand is identical

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.030
to the materials I was
seeing from way back.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.130
Also learned that the color of the
cylinders is a, it's a function

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.450
of the time, temperature and
metals that the material sees.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.360
So these things were made in a cast
iron kettle, kept warm for a while.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.020
They then were poured out
into pans to solidify.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.800
They were then taken across
the hallway when needed,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.070
the cylinder molding room,
they were melted down again

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.210
and then they were
cast into cylinders.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.690
So by the time, the amount of time
I just kept this thing boiling can

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.570
dramatically affect the
color of my material.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:08.070
This was somewhat novel
in looking at those people

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.930
who have been looking at
cylinders and mostly home hobbyists

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.970
that are interested
in these materials.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.490
Some of them had been thinking that
because there's such a variation

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.080
in color of the cylinders
that it was actually

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.890
that they were always
tweaking the recipe.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.260
Well the data or I can replicate
that change here as well

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.440
as looking back in all the
records to know it was a very,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.080
very stable composition that really
only had two compositions they were

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.380
ever really making.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.390
So I also mentioned metals.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.680
So when we started looking at
the composition of cylinders

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.790
from our collection we saw that
more than just sodium and aluminum

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.680
as the metals which we
would expect to see.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.910
So here using x-ray fluorescents,
basically it's a little x-ray gun,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.850
put it up next to the
thing, pull the trigger,

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.320
the x-rays excite the metal
atoms that are in the material

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.750
which then emit another photon with
certain energy that we can measure.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.490
And that energy is,
corresponds to the elements.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.280
So we can identify what they are.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.460
In this case we can't
do it quantitatively

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.430
but we can see what
elements are actually there.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.430
So we don't have much of a response
for sodium and aluminum here,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.410 position:56%
that's because it's a limitation of
the method and how I was running it.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.970
But I do see a lot of other things.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.140 position:56%
I see a fair amount of Sulphur, that
was a contaminant in the ceresin.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.300
Calcium shows up from time to time,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.800
nickel was an interesting
one as was the iron.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.980 position:56%
So those came from the kettles in
which they were making the material.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.390
More often than not they were
producing in cast iron kettles

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.130
so just a contaminant from that.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.270
The nickel was from a
very brief time period.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.550
I think it was, it was less than
a year where production was moved

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.220
to the Silver Lake facility

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.010
because they were renovating
another manufacturing plant

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.850
and they had nickel kettles.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.020
So I actually had one that
likely came from there.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.900
We also had a couple that
hit positive for lead.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.640
Those were likely from the American
Graphophone or some knockoff there

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.470
who was using their composition.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.800
So we have all these metals and
going back to the lab notebook.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.640
Oh, oh, what's going on?

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.700
Do these metals have an effect
on the properties and material?

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.850
I can make the really
pure stuff but does

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.510
that really simulate what I have?

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.350
Does it matter?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.530
Well it turns out that the having
iron at levels which we detected

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.280
in the material did
change the color.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.940 position:56%
It actually made it a whole lot more
similar to the cylinder material

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.530
that we see in the collection.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.640
So it does have an effect on color.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.550 position:56%
Next question would be well how does
this relate to overall properties?

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.990
So really it's now time to get down
to the nitty gritty and the science

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.720
of what do, what did I make?

00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.370
Are my materials similar enough to
the old broken box of sad things?

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.270 position:56%
Thankfully most of those are blanks.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.150
Unfortunately not all of them.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.370
And in our collection again
sometimes we see cracks.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.940
But the question again
is well what changed?

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:17.240
Is the things that I've just made
are they the same or as what I have

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.510 position:56%
in the box whereas when the box
broken because things are degrading?

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.720
In which case it's all
hands digitalis time

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.150 position:56%
to just digitize everything used and
the best techniques we have in order

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.080
to not lose any more information.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.950
So one way to do this is to look at
the exact or the quantify the level

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.750
of metals in the cylinders.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.700
So I can do this very
sensitive or very sensitively

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:44.530
by taking a small scrapings
from the inside of the bore

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.880
of a cylinder or of a fragment.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.170 position:56%
In this case this was a blank with a
big hole in the back you can't see.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:58.180
And this amount of material is
enough to do about ten analyses.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.270
So I can use a very small
amount of this material.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.230
We then digest it down and shoot it
into this fancy piece of equipment,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.090
inductively coupled plasma
with optimal [inaudible].

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:13.370
Basically it throws a liquid into
a plasma similar to what you see

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.430
if you put a fork into a
microwave except this is

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.010
in an argon atmosphere
instead of air.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.310
So it's an argon plasma.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.610
It has a little coil just
like your microwave does.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.300
It's very, very hot.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.250
It excites the metal
elements similar to the XRF

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.720
that I was talking about before.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.640
It emits another photon.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.940
We measure those.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.490
And now we can identify
what elements are there

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.640
and at what quantity.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.700
When we do that we get
a whole lot of numbers.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.830
Don't really need to go
too far into this one.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.790
The most important thing is
to look in this top right.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.820
This is the only cylinder
that I have tested in this way

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.570
that has a known provenance.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.100
This was a cylinder from 1890.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.500
That was when they were
making composition 1058.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.140
My aluminum and sodium levels
are very, very similar.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.210
We were making what we
thought we were making

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.860
or I was making what I
thought I was making.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.200
They were making what they
thought they were making.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.670
Using all of these numbers
is where the project

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.780
for my summer student came.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.340
And so he doped in all
of these materials or all

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.600 position:56%
of these other metals into the
compositions in order to make those,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.190
that second set that
was much more brown.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.600
So our metals are there but none
them were radioactive metals.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.820
So they're not decaying,
they're not going anywhere.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.580
They are what they are.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.150
So then it's what about the
other portions of the cylinders?

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.790
What about the organics?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.460
So for that we can take
a little glass rod.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.410
Touch it to the interior of the
bore, of the cylinder and put

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.230
that in front of our
mass spectrometer.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.510
So in this case I've got yet
another plasma, air plasma,

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.120
not actually helium, sorry,
coming through the blue piece

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.410
of instrumentation on the right.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:07.490
That then bounces ions
off of our glass surface

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.960
that transfers the charge.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.200
And desorbs our analyte which
then gets sucked into the vacuum

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.640
of our mass spectrometer which
tells us the molecular weight

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.360 position:56%
of the things we just threw into it.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.730
Once we do that we get some
other data that looks like this.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.790
What it is is molecular
weight on the bottom

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.300
and relative intensity
on the y axis.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.920
I can identify almost all of
those peaks as salt adducts

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.820
or fatty acids themselves
through this process that sodium

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.250
and aluminum stearate component.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.130
The metal gets knocked off so
we just see the acid forms.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.380
And these three higher
were here are complexes

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.680
of stearic and palmitic acid.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.600
So it's two palmitic, two stearic
or one of each stuck together.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.770 position:56%
The really important thing here is
I've looked at this in great detail.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.140
And in many different
ones of these I've taken

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.410
from different cylinders
and all of mine.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.750
And I really only see
two differences.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:11.330
In the period brown wax on the top
I see the presence of oleic acid.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.730
I don't have that in mine
because I didn't add it.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.460
I'm using pure materials.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.070
Later on I did add in oleic
acid to get that kind of signal,

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.920
it's right in that
one or two percent

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.540
which was the specification
they were using in the way back.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.170
Kind of cool.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:30.490
I also know where my suppliers
are getting their stearic acid

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.790
supplies from.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:37.230
It's coming from cows because
I see margaric acid, margarine.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.510
So but I see no evidence of
any degradation products.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.630
I would expect to see either
something down here or something

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.270
in through here that's
different between the two

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.030
if I was seeing some degradation.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.900
Either a reaction that
things come together,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.350 position:56%
gets a slightly larger mass or
things fall apart, they get smaller.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:03.200
So the stearic acid and palmitic
acid aren't degrading, okay.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.270
What about the ceresin wax?

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:09.580
Didn't see that in using the
previous method, the [inaudible],

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.460
so I dissolved the stuff up in
some chloroform and shoot it

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.680 position:56%
across a different instrument, a gas
chromatography, mass spectrometer.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.560 position:56%
Basically it separates the molecules
out by roughly molecular weight

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.050 position:56%
or hydrophobicity and then puts
them into another mass spectrometer.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.810
Breaks them apart so I
can see what they are.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.450
This is just a trace
of the separation.

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:31.490
And you can see that the two
period fragments are, well,

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.540
pretty much indistinguishable
from what I had made in lab.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.160
The bottom is the raw
ceresin wax that I was using.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.580
I've used a couple of
different ceresins,

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.840
the slightly different
molecular weight.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.020
But even the top period looks more
like the ceresin than the period,

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.610
to period comparison but it's
still the same as my lab prep.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:57.140 position:56%
So now I've looked at everything and
I see no differences outside of some

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.150
of those additional metals.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.900
Time to look at some
physical measurements

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.530
to see if I can explain that.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.770
But it doesn't appear that we're
actually chemically degrading.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.070
This is great.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.940
It means we likely have some time.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.110
But it means at this point I
didn't know what the cause was.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.070
So let's look at hardness.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.490
Hardness was a big thing
that they kept measuring

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.000
and harping on in the notebooks.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.040
So I have all these previous
cylinder fragments to the left

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.310
that were melted down into
little pucks as well as two

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.120
of my compositions, that 1058 and
the 38 were the commercial forms.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.750
And I'm right at the right hardness
as the period, okay, that's good.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:42.320
That 892 and 957, those were
the materials prior to adding

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.120
of the ceresin wax where
they said it was too hard.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.910
Okay, it actually was too hard.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:55.050
So then I decided okay well one
thing is when I cast these things

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:59.550
in these little cups, little
melt aluminum cups they shrink

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.010
and I can easily pull them out.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.460
It makes analysis really
easy and you can see how

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.090
that would be in a little mold.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.420
But how much is it
actually shrinking?

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.820
So I did a series of experiments
where I took these cylinder pucks

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.030
and measured the diameter
in multiple places across it

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.050
and multiple temperatures
and humidity's.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.270
Did the hardness of the same thing
with temperature and humidity.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.460 position:56%
These things really do not care
about the humidity, the differences.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:37.030
But I do see a sizeable expansion
when I change the temperature.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.030
I can quantify that by using the
coefficient thermal expansion.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.970
Basically it's a measurement of
if you change the temperature

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:49.240 position:56%
of an object x degrees it will
expand or contract by this fraction.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.900
And what I found was these
materials, so the period cylinders

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.010 position:56%
as well as the 1058 and 38
compositions are, have a coefficient

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:03.930 position:56%
of thermal expansion of about 200
parts per million per degree Celsius

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.430
temperature change.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.620
What does that mean?

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.300
Well it means that these things
are changing quite a bit.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.610
A cylinder will expand or
contract about 10,000ths of an inch

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.750
at the 20 degree Fahrenheit change.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:24.830 position:56%
To put this in perspective modern
plastics their coefficient expansion

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.390
is about 150.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:31.070
These materials do expand and
contract if you're making a mold

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.710
to produce a glass or something.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.100 position:56%
You need to account for that
shrinkage otherwise you're not going

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.860
to get the right measurements.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.050
But those polymers that make

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.640
up the plastics have molecular
weights in the millions.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.730
They're incredibly large.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.260
Stearic acid and palmitic
acid have molecular weights

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.350
between 200 and 300.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.940
There's just not a lot
of interaction there

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.040
that can hold the materials
together.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.270
Seeing this data in
the first iteration,

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:07.170
so this is about 20
different samples

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.010
and there's 55 across all of these.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.590
Most are in the 1058,
38 compositions.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.740 position:56%
When we first saw that information
we immediately called down to NAVCC.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.960 position:56%
How are we dealing with moving the
cylinders from the collection spaces

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.980
into the recording studio?

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.430
Because I think we might
need to talk about this.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.780
So in doing so, it's like
okay, let's make cylinders

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.750
to make sure before I
undergo any big process change

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:36.290
that the theory at, this is just a
thermal effect could be plausible.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:42.300
So I don't have any molds from
the late 1800s sitting around.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.080 position:56%
So I went down to Home Depot, picked
up some iron pipes with a little bit

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.270
of silicon in the middle
to hold it together

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.440
so it doesn't leak
all over my bench.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.740
And cast some pseudocylinders.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.040
I'm calling them pseudocylinders

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.500
because the diameter's not quite
right, it's a little too small.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.880
But the wall thickness
is spot on for period,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.080
for historical cylinders.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.320
Could then take that and be harsh
to it, really mean and cycle it

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.890
from zero degrees Fahrenheit
to 100 degrees Fahrenheit

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:11.310
in the time it took to
walk across the room.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.610
I'd done some measurements

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.630 position:56%
on how rapidly the waxes will
equilibrate to a temperature change.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.940
And the answer is normally
about five minutes.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.560
So we're doing this much
harder, much faster.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.800
But in just cycling 8 to 12 times
we were, we're causing cracks

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.680 position:56%
in our cylinders that look just like
what we're seeing in the period.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.080
So it's not that the
materials are degrading

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.680
but it's been thermal
shock over the years.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:44.810
Now we're taking it really quickly
but changing even 20 or 30 degrees

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.240
or being in an attic in
the summer or a garage

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.800
in the winter and the summer.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.600
And having that thermal
cycling in the course

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.270
of 120 years it makes
plausible sense.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.360
Our cylinders are living in
a very acclimatized space.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.010
They're back in the vault at NAVCC.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:06.250
They're actually back
behind this facility

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:11.490
in that mountain in
Culpepper, Virginia.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.940
And so the vault conditions
are very stable

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.650
at 50 degrees Fahrenheit,
50% relative humidity.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:21.060 position:56%
The cylinders had been going through
an acclimatization room which is

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.600
at 65 Fahrenheit and 30% relative
humidity so slow the transition

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.160
of the humidity, to
slow that transition.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.650
Because all of the other
recording materials

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:38.170
down there they are more sensitive
to the effect of humidity changes

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.330 position:56%
on them rather than the temperature.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.480
Here we're the opposite
because then they were going

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.840
to the recording studio,
you know, at 72 and 30.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.120
We did a very, okay not really.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.510
So sometimes the best
solution is the easiest one.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.680
Now instead of our
cylinders going from the vault

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.800
to that acclimatization
space on a cart

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.240
in the little boxes they
now get to take that trip

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.550
in a fishing grade Igloo
cooler which can slow

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:13.200 position:56%
that temperature shift from a couple
of minutes to now 24 to 48 hours.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.930
So we're trying to make that
transition as slow as possible

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.670
and limit the number of cycles
that they see that anyway.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.550
The same time it makes
it very important

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.390
that when people are handling the
cylinders they do what they've been

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.290
doing since they were taught
how to handle cylinders

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.830
which is to keep them moving.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:32.010
Because just the touch of your hand
can change the local temperature.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:36.170
The four minute black [inaudible]
are really notorious for that

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.470
because they're much more brittle.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.840
It turns out they have the same
coefficient thermal expansion

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.140
as these other ones.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.790
So not only were we able to
say that yeah our collection is

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.750
in relatively good hands, it's now

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.580
in its happiest place they could
possibly be as the temperature

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.310
and humidity are now
nice and constant.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.060
And we take steps to slow any sort

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.710
of thermal transition
that we may have.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.850
With that we think we
can reduce the risk

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:06.030
and has come together what I
think at least is a really kind

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.630
of interesting story
that all started off

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.640
with the really kind of worrisome.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.200
Are we going to lose
this entire collection?

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.020
And so we have to just
take everybody

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.500
in do this mass digitization.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.000
What it really likes like
now is the cylinders look

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.300
like they're going
to be quite stable.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.510
They're much more stable than any
of the current discs that we have

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.290
with CDs, DVDs, Blue
Rays, things like that.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:32.230 position:56%
So now we can decide what do we
need, what kind of effort to we need

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:37.090
to do the preservation by saying
okay what is at most risk?

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.340
In this case the cylinders
are much better off

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.170
than we thought they
were to begin with.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.380
And so with that I need to
acknowledge a number of people.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.070
Fenella and the folks in the
PRTD have been great help.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.810
So was Andrew Almeida, he
was my summer intern student.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:55.220
He's now a freshman at the
University of Maryland.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.030
Peter Alyea for a lot of helpful
communications as well as NAVCC

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:03.110
and the Folk Life Center for really
making this project possible.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.510
With that I'll gladly
take any questions.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:11.990
[ Audience Applause ]

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: I just want to
say I think the only time in my life

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.860
when someone on my staff
has walked into my office

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.500 position:56%
and says I've just broken something.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.670
I went yes [inaudible].

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:25.760
So we'll open this up to questions

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.160
and Eric will actually
repeat the question

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.510
for our online folks as well.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:37.610
[ Pause ]

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.080
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: No questions, oh.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.310
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:47.320
I think I saw a [inaudible]
image, a 3D of that.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.620
I'm wondering if you're
considering using visualization

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:56.010
of the cylinder before,
before subjecting it

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.480
to imaging or [inaudible]?

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.510
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Sure so the
question was whether or not,

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.040
since I had the 3D image of the
grooves if we're using that prior

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.610
to doing a transfer,
something like that.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.580
That is the Irene process
in snapshot.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.760
So it was something that the
library's been working on

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.890
and developing with folks
at, I really lost it,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:27.750
at Berkeley National Lab, sorry,
which uses an optical probe

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.980
to measure the depth and image
the depths of those grooves

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.950
which then we can play
back with an algorithm.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.510
So it's been quite useful.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.210
[ Pause ]

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.020
&gt;&gt; You talk about the
[inaudible] still cracking.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:48.200
Do you ever see any flaking
[inaudible] cracking?

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.750
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: So the question
was if we ever see any flaking kind

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.280
of cracking rather
than a straight crack?

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.110
I haven't seen any on any of
the fragments that I have.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.750
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.890
I'll have to reach out to the
folks at NAVCC to see if that's one

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.330
of their failure mechanisms
that they do see.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.790
&gt;&gt; You looked at the [inaudible]?

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.260
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: We do on occasion.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.580
Mostly those are, the only
time I've ever seen that is

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.530
when there's a much larger
crack and the pieces come off.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.480
I guess by, you know,
abrasion in and out

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.700
of a box you might see
something like that.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.190
But as far as a failure mode itself
I haven't necessarily seen it.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:33.320
I wouldn't expect it as the
material itself should be amorphous

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.250
so it shouldn't have any
interior stress points

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.560
that would just flake off
a little particle unless

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.700 position:56%
that stress point kind of loops part
way through and then comes back up.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:48.310
In which case it's possible,
I just haven't seen it.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:53.690
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if
you're accelerating

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:58.130
and heat testing [inaudible]
for how many

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:04.360
of those thermal shocks it may
take to cause some of this damage?

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.930
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: The answer is
some and probably quite bit.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:11.670
We needless to say haven't, I
didn't inflict the port intern

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.510
to doing 100 Fahrenheit
to, you know,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.160
what we see over a normal cycle
of going form say 100 down to 60

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:26.120
or 80 to 60 if it was in the
sun and in the shade in a room.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.770
The fact that it does
happen is promising.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.600 position:56%
I mean, I'm not saying that this is
the definitive reason why everything

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.900
is happening.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.860
It's very plausible
in this point in time.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.250
We do, I did have, do have
some plans of kind of reducing

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.550
that to see if I still get it.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.600
That can give us a better idea.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.750
At this point for preservation
it's try and minimize it as much

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.780
as you can just like anything
else is try and minimize the risk.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.910
&gt;&gt; Very interesting presentation.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:59.030
I'm wondering, I'm sure you
haven't done a massive survey,

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.210
all media throughout the world.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:04.160
But from what you've heard
of, from what you're familiar

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:10.360 position:56%
with would you be able to perhaps
make a guess as to which other types

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.560
of media might have similar issues?

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.960
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: So the question
is if I can think of other media

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.980
which have a similar
issue to the cylinders?

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.590
I mean, there's kind of two
failure modes that we see a lot.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.910
And those are more with
the modern materials

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.040
where there's delimitation
of various layers.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.580
This gets around that by just
being one material in a whole.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.100
That's some of the problems
with the other cylinders.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.110
I'm trying to think.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.570
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Unless you took
the [inaudible] already looking

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:51.540
at all the different types of audio
visual materials that are different

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.880
in the way they're
played and the background

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.220
and so we're looking
at those [inaudible].

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.500
This is very specific.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.540
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Yeah
there was outside

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.720
of the cylinders once they ended

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.020
up with the wax cylinders
then they went

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.180
to plastics from there effectively.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.190
So everything went to completely
different style of polymer.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.980
So I'm trying, yeah
I don't really think

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.530
of anything even used these
materials once they move

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.510
to the four minute waxes.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:21.660
[ Pause ]

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.850
&gt;&gt; So if you haven't seen any
evidence of chemical degradation,

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.680
it all seems to be
thermally induced.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:34.670 position:56%
Do you think there's maybe a case to
be made for not storing them at 50

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:39.870
and storing them or 50 Fahrenheit
and storing them at 70 [inaudible]?

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.170
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Sure.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.470
So the question was
since we're seeing

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:45.150
that thermal is the likely problem,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.710
does it makes sense to
not store them at 50?

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:52.510
Part of the reason to store them
cold if to prevent any other kind

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.280
of degradation that might happen.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:01.440 position:56%
There's some evidence that there
can be some transfer from encasement

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.690
or the boxes or something
like that onto the surface.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.410
So trying to, you know, even

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.870
if the cylinder's not degrading
the box it came in might.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:14.680
And so I've got a summer student
that starts next week who's going

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.000 position:56%
to be looking at what kind, what
are the other failure modes that are

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.370
on the surface of the
cylinders as well as coming

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.260
up with better ways
of doing the cleaning.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.830
Now if you don't have access

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:28.280
to a cold storage room
keep them where they are.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.420
The cylinders will
spend most of their life

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.220
at room temperature
rather than cold storage.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.370
But down there I think
that's about all we've got

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:37.120
because it's just underneath,
it's in the mountain

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.040
so it's like an almost cellar.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.190
&gt;&gt; That was my question.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.330
Yeah and I think that it comes

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:49.680
with so many materials it's
the fluctuation, you know,

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.580
[inaudible] that keeps heating

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.880
up those potential failure
modes [inaudible] materials.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.880
&gt;&gt; Just a [inaudible].

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:19.550
It would be interesting though
to say for an institution

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:27.700
that was maybe able to
house the material, the,

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.970
put them in a temporary
[inaudible] and stable

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.990
and you can't [inaudible]
climate control the areas

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:39.680
that could be a new, new room
for best practices as far

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.040
as [inaudible] preservation
for housing.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.270
And you keep recommending that you
keep them at a higher temperature

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:47.570
to avoid the [inaudible].

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:48.870
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Right.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.550 position:56%
So the statement was along the lines
of if they can't [inaudible] place

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:54.540
with these cylinders can't afford
it, doesn't have the access

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.070
to colder storage then,
you know, rehouse them

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.360 position:56%
and then keep to into another space.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.680
And in that case it's
yeah, you want to be

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.060
as climate controlled as possible.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.880
Whatever it is just keep
it as stable as possible.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:14.260
And thankfully most of the
storage spaces are now designed

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.540
to be rock solid for that,

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.900
for special collections
and things like that.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.910
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: And I think
what's really interesting is

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:27.490
that to be able to say you don't
need to worry about humidity

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:29.890
for these materials
[inaudible] is huge.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.300
The other thing would
[inaudible] look

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:39.080
at is the cause quite often a small
organization will transfer them

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.100
to another location
to be transferred.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.900
One of the implications into the
transportation of trying to control

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.530
and not we, you know,
actually doing more damage.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:56.520
Though I think that's another
question I'd like to talk

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.970
with [inaudible] colleagues about
and, you know, probably think

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:02.140
about that and keep [inaudible]
recommendations for [inaudible].

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.190
Do I see a hand in the?

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.490
&gt;&gt; I was just curious.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.820
I understand it's about
storage that you've been doing.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.980
What is the process for putting
the broken pieces back together?

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.280
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Right
now there's not,

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.920
so the question was
what process do we have

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.190
to put the broken pieces
back together.

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:23.200 position:56%
And right now unfortunately there's
not a lot of options if it's really,

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.570
really broken to a bunch of pieces.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.770
With Irene we've been
able to stitch together,

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:34.190
kind of if it's broken off a U
chunk or a big piece we can piece

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:35.490
that back together again.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:40.770
Image that and then fix everything
basically using Photoshop

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:44.650
for cylinders, Photoshop for audio.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:48.780
And so if there's large
pieces we can do that.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:53:00.200
And I think the plan is with
the [inaudible] iterations

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.240
of the software is to be able to
basically image individual pieces

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:11.160
and then stitch them all back
together in the computer.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.940
So as long as we had all

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.040
of the pieces we could put
them back together again.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:23.450
If you have a little bit of a
loss it's much more difficult.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:28.650
So these things are spinning on
the mandrel just short of 200 RPM.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:33.770
So even a small loss or small
long scratch or crack can lead

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.640
to quite a bit of data loss

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.060
because it's now every half
second you're seeing a click.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.480
&gt;&gt; Fascinating your
presentation [inaudible].

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.780
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Thanks.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.310
&gt;&gt; I was interested in
the long [inaudible].

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.810
What are your thoughts
on the [inaudible].

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:54.300
There could be two or three

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.740
or perhaps four different
kinds of [inaudible].

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.690
I wonder whether there was a
kind of rudimentary [inaudible].

00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:04.990
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Okay,
so the question was

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:09.060
in the lab notebooks the
apparent notching of the pages.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.540
They're not notches at all.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.990
Those are little weights that
were used at Rutgers to hold it,

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.890
the paper, the pages
flat for imaging.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:20.030
And so they're not really notches,
not labeling or anything like that.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.330
It was just to hold it flat.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.770
It's the reason why it looked
like he wrote around it is

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.740
because they put the
weight so it didn't cover

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.450
up anything for us to see.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:33.190
&gt;&gt; The entry [inaudible] notches
though it looked like birds.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.490
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: I think it's felt.

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:35.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.090
&gt;&gt; I just love that we're
all [inaudible] more curious

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:38.390
about the notebooks too.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.870
And I'm wondering if reading those
notebooks has changed the way you

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:42.170
keep your notes?

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.200
And the work you've been
doing, do you have good detail?

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.360
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: I do keep
pretty reasonable with detail.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.540
My handwriting is completely awful.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.580
So mine's all on my or most
of mine's on my computer.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.450
But yeah, that's one of
the things that, you know,

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:06.940
as scientists were taught to do
is lab notebooks are important.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.560
And it turns out that lab
notebooks are really important even

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.860
for mundane things that, you
know, you might not think

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.160 position:56%
that someone's going to come looking

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.460
at your lab notebook
130 some odd years

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.760
after you did the experiment
but it does happen.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: And basically
we've got a big approach it would be

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.420
trying to extract the metadata
from the instruments to sort

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.720
of try and make it easier.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.020
Because the last thing you
want to [inaudible] scientist

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.320
with doing really cool stuff

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.620
like this is make sure you've
written all of it down.

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.920
But we all know that we
[inaudible] little things and so

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.220
if there's a way to
really capture that.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.520
And it's something that we're
actually working through from some

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.820
of the digital perspective to
try and capture [inaudible].

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.120
Well if there's no more questions
I want to thank you all for coming.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.420 position:56%
Thank you to the online [inaudible].

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.720
So the talks will be [inaudible]
probably sometime in June.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.020
So watch the online and
watch the space for that.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.320
And we look forward
to seeing you there.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.620
Thank you again to Eric.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.920
&gt;&gt; Eric Monroe: Thanks.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.220
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
