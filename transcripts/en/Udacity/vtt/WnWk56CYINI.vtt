Tell you what, Ilia. How about I go to a page, record a timeline trace,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.810
save it, and find a couple places to optimize? Afterwards, I'll send it to you.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.210
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea. However, instead of

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.750
just sending it to me, why don't you share

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.280
your findings on the forum with other students? Let's

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.730
see if you can identify some common performance problems.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like fun. What kind

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.850
of website do you think I should check out?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.010
&gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. Pick some favorites. Let's see what we can find.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.200
&gt;&gt; Cool.
