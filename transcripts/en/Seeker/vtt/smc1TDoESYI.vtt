00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.080
Not enough people are swiping right on my
Tinder.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:16.840
Maybe if I take my shirt off...

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.740
Welcome potential matches, I’m Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.029
We talk a lot about the changing landscape
of online dating because it’s a new way

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.710
for our species to interact and we’re curious
about what this means for our collective future.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.619
And because most of us haven’t given up
on the idea of love yet.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.380
One of the criticisms of online matchmaking
is that it can be shallow, especially if you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.300
use certain apps where you make a snap judgment
about someone based on their appearance and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.620
distance from you.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.120
You know, Tinder.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.280
But is it possible that shallow swiping could
negatively affect how we feel about our bodies

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.620
and our self worth?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.490
To find out, researchers from the University
of North Texas surveyed 1,044 women and 273

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.490
men.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.580
Why the disparity?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.800
Because the study was primarily aimed at understanding
how women were affected, though the researchers

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.870
did find some insight from the men.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.780
The survey asked the participants to rate
their own body image, psychological well being,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.220
and their perceived objectification by others.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.920
Lastly, they were also asked if they used
Tinder.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.530
About a tenth of those surveyed said they
did and those Tinder users generally reported

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.480
lower levels of satisfaction with their faces
and bodies than did their non-swiping counterparts.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.530
Interestingly, only Tindering men reported
lower levels of self-esteem.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.980
Apparently the ladies of Tinder aren’t going
to let a negative body image ruin their sense

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.980
of self-worth.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.850
This lead researchers to conclude that men
are just as affected by exploitation as women,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.880
if not more so.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.740
The findings were presented at the annual
convention of the American Psychology Association

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.330
by Dr. Jessica Stübel, who coauthored the
study.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
Stübel suggested the correlation between
Tinder and body dissatisfaction could be a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.390
result of how the app works.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.760
Tinder sort of exists in the Upside Down,
you could call it a dating app or you could

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.049
call it a game, and the chief strategy officer
of the company that owns Tinder describes

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.350
it exactly that way.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.670
Heck, before I was on DNews I hosted a show
that talked about Tinder, and why the gamification

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.119
of dating was a good thing because it encourages
people to get out there and try and win.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.400
But some players may have realized that in
order to win a game that’s so focused on

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.190
looks, their best strategy is to be attractive.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.099
Even worse, as they’re swiping left through
stacks of photos, it may dawn on them that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.500
others are doing the same to their picture.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.620
In the dating game they have effectively become
an NPC, and nobody wants to be an NPC.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.849
That is one possible explanation, but of course
it’s not the only one.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.980
Stübel also speculated that people with lower
self esteem could gravitate towards Tinder

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.769
as a means of validation.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.019
Of course, as with all surveys like this,
it’s impossible to tell if Tinder leads

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.150
to low self esteem or if low self esteem leads
to Tinder.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.890
There have been a bevy of studies about how
couples that meet online fare, compared to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.079
people who used the old-fashioned method of
dumb luck to find their soulmate, - spoiler

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.220
alert: married couples who met online seem
to do a little better.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.040
But not a lot of research has looked into
how online dating makes us feel about ourselves.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.700
You know the line, “More research is needed.”

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.219
Incidentally putting that in your Tinder bio
is a guarantee swipe right…

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.950
By me… you’ve been warned.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.419
If you like the game part of Tinder you could
take it a step farther and date a video game

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.419
character.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:20.660
Seeker Stories covers what it’s like to
have a virtual relationship here.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.279
And if you haven’t found the perfect partner
who isn’t made of 1s and 0s, is it better

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.919
to settle or be forever alone?

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:48.209
Julia and Trace tell you what science has
to say in this episode.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.890
So would you risk feeling less satisfied with
your appearance if it meant striking a match?

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.019
Wait is that why it’s called Tinder?

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.079
I just got that!
