00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.330
JACKIE: Please welcome to Google
New York, Chris Stang

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.540
and Andrew Steinthal, aka
Immaculate Infatuation.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.780
JACKIE: Hi.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.250
CHRIS STANG: Hi.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.699
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Hi.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:16.149
JACKIE: Again.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:16.820
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.150
JACKIE: Thanks for joining us.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.730
CHRIS STANG:It took us like two
months to write that bio.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.830
JACKIE: And it is a great bio.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.670
CHRIS STANG: Sounds really
good, though.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.500
JACKIE: It really does.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.130
CHRIS STANG: Especially coming
out of your mouth.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.750
JACKIE: Well, thanks.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.780
I've rehearsed it 10
times morning.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.367
CHRIS STANG: Oh, I'm sure.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.680
JACKIE: I'm very excited.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.210
So these guys have a great
presentation to share and some

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.640
basic background about who they
are and about the website

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.470
and how it grew.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.380
So I'm going to turn
it over to them.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.290
And then we'll do
some Q&amp;A after.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.400
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Let's not get
carried away with great

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.780
presentation.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.940
It's actually a PowerPoint.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.000
CHRIS STANG: No, we should
actually build it up to be.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.390
JACKIE: I've seen
these photos.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.490
CHRIS STANG: It's
very technical.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.000
JACKIE: They are.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.260
They are very tech savvy,
and their photos are--

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.270
CHRIS STANG: There's an
algorithm involved.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.470
JACKIE: Yes.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.230
CHRIS STANG: You'll
be impressed.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.820
Hi, I'm Chris.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420
This is Andrew.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.200
Thank you for having us.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.460
This is all very surreal when
we do these things.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.950
Because you have to understand
that we still sit behind a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.130
computer and write these
restaurant reviews every night

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.910
and forget that people
actually read them.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.585
So it's nice to be here.

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:14.070
This is cool.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.170
JACKIE: This is great.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.065
CHRIS STANG: So I guess the
presentations we've done, when

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.040
we've done this, and just
started off with us talking

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.430
about how we started the
website, why we started the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.710
website, how it grew, where it
is now, and then eventually,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.360
where we think we can
take it and what we

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.930
want to do with it.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.170
And then we'll get into that
awesome, very impressive,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.850
presentation.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520
JACKIE: Amazing pictures.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.350
CHRIS STANG: So Andrew and
I met about 10 years ago.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.740
We were both at our respective
universities--

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920
Colorado State for
me, which is--

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.885
JACKIE: My alma mater--

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:44.790
CHRIS STANG: Which is Jackie's
alumnus, too.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.190
And then Andrew was at Ithaca.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.170
And we are both working in
college radio, so we ended up

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.260
at the CMJ music convention,
I guess it was

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.750
like the year 2000.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.140
And it was right during the time
when Carson Daly was in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.980
the heat of it.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.310
He was the baddest dude
on television.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.100
ANDREW STEINTHAL: TRL was hot.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.010
CHRIS STANG: TRL was really,
really, really hot.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.780
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Remember
that time?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.730
Those were crazy times.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.570
JACKIE: It was fun.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.990
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Music
was a huge deal then.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.770
JACKIE: I know.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.190
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It was
not like it was today.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.260
Not that music's
not a big deal.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.530
But it was the marquee event.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.210
It was Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync and Britney, and things

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.970
were happening.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.910
CHRIS STANG: We miss
those days.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.816
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Limp Bizkit.

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:21.232
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:22.410
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Oh yeah.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.540
CHRIS STANG: So we had
a mutual friend

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.400
that ran a music company.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.920
And he had somehow weaseled his
way into getting passes to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.910
go to the TRL studio.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.290
And we each, independently,
got a phone call that was

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.480
like, dude come down
to the TRL studio.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.810
And absolutely we were going.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.800
So we ended up meeting each
other as we were sitting in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.750
line to go into the studio.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.030
And I think Destiny's Child
was on that day.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.530
JACKIE: Amusing.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.210
CHRIS STANG: And they put us
right in that corner window

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.570
right behind Carson.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.443
So we were sitting next
to each other.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:53.870
It was like, oh what's
up dude?

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.600
And they went through one
segment and Carson

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.230
was doing his thing.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.990
And basically walked up to us
when the commercial break came

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.812
on, and they were like,
you guys gotta move.

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:02.070
We were like, what?

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.650
What are you talking about?

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.130
They were like, you're
not clapping enough.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.610
And so basically, they pretty
much subbed in two 14-year-old

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.010
girls that would lose their
mind every time he said

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.970
Beyonce, or whatever else.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.900
JACKIE: Destiny's Child,
Limp Bizkit.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.800
CHRIS STANG: And we
got relegated to

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.070
the crowd off camera.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.400
But we met and got along, and
hit it off, and kept in touch

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.050
until we graduated, and then
ended up both in New York City

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.350
after school, with a mind set
on the music business.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.480
We were convinced that we could
take over the world.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.950
JACKIE: And clearly, you are.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.140
ANDREW STEINTHAL: That's not--

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.440
CHRIS STANG: Combine our
talents, and get into some

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.790
sort of music career Voltron.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.210
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Yeah, so we
came up together in the music

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.090
business and always had
this idea that we

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.870
wanted to do something.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.690
We really believed that we could
do something together.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.970
We weren't exactly sure what
it was going to be.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.620
But we knew we could
do something.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.290
And we had lots of ideas
along the way.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.060
Most of them never
materialized.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.080
We had a t-shirt company that
made one t-shirt once.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.400
CHRIS STANG: We didn't
even sell it.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.710
ANDREW STEINTHAL: No.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.480
I have it.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.480
JACKIE: Why didn't
you wear it?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.450
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
It didn't fit.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.840
It was terrible.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.010
CHRIS STANG: It was bad.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.710
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Anyway.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.340
CHRIS STANG: It was
a really deep V.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.080
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
No, it wasn't.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.110
No.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.240
It was a crew neck, dude.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.510
CHRIS STANG: All right.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.839
ANDREW STEINTHAL: So we
had a couple ideas.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.850
We started.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.940
We worked in the music business,
so I do publicity

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.630
and Chris does marketing
at Atlantic records.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.520
And I work at Warner
Brothers records.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.330
And we became the guys in the
office that knew the city

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.890
really well, were always out,
and people would come to for

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.520
recommendations, whether it was
a bar, or restaurant, or

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.330
whatever, because we were going
to all these shows.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.010
We had bands to entertain, bands
to take out to dinner.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.310
So there was a lot of decisions
to be made.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.160
And we would likely be the ones
to make those decisions

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.070
and plan a fun night
around a show or

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.220
with a band, or whatever.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.070
So we wound up going to tons
of dinners, eating a lot of

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.920
meals, going to a
lot of shows.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.000
And just became this thing where
people would come to us

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.560
with all these things.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.170
We were like, damn.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.580
If we can recommend places for
our friends in the office, and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.650
then our regular friends outside
of the office, whether

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.790
it's like our friend banker
dudes from JP Morgan, or

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.280
whoever, being like, yo dude I
got a date, where should I

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.650
take her, whatever, come through
for them-- if we were

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.900
becoming these guys, we were
like, maybe we can make

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.010
something of that.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.710
Because there wasn't really
anybody talking our language

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.990
about restaurant reviews
and restaurants.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.190
CHRIS STANG: I think
that's the key.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.130
We realized as our friends would
call us and be like,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.060
where am I taking my mom
for dinner tonight?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.680
It just occurred to us that they
were calling us because

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.420
there wasn't a good resource for
them to find it otherwise.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.560
So the "New York Times" wasn't
necessarily filling

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.170
that void for them.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.240
Yelp was probably too much--

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.140
there's too much noise there.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.750
And so I think friends of ours
were finding it difficult to

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.190
find a place to turn to find a
good way to sort out from all

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.890
the restaurants in New York City
where to go specifically

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.600
for certain things.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.220
JACKIE: And for the trusted--

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.960
they know you guys.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.850
They trust you guys.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.890
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.330
So then it just became, can we
do this on a larger scale and

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.100
serve that purpose
for other people?

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.980
ANDREW STEINTHAL: A lot of
places that do restaurant

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.180
reviews, it's very highbrow.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.060
And for us, personally, a lot
of it's over our heads.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.810
We are not food critics.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.390
I mean, at this point, I guess
we are food critics.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.200
But we're not experts in the
field of culinary brilliance.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.060
We didn't study it.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.890
We don't know the ins
and outs of it.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.270
But we know New York City.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.070
We know restaurants.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.070
And we know how to read a
situation and whether

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.920
restaurant's good to take a girl
there, or good to just go

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.370
scope some hot dudes there, if
you're a female, good to go

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.910
with your parents, good
to go for whatever the

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:49.780
occasion may be.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.020
And I think it's putting that
into context that people can

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.040
use on a daily basis that's
made it separate.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.660
Because when we would go look
for restaurants in the past,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.880
we'd go to "New York Magazine,"
because that was

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.100
probably a resource that we
used to go find things.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.510
And we'd click, oh Chelsea
and Critics Pick.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.470
But Critics Pick was really
one of the only search

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.730
functions that you could
actually pick to find

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.705
something, where you
might want to eat.

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:14.130
JACKIE: Yeah.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.810
ANDREW STEINTHAL: So using that,
thinking about that, and

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.560
be like, OK, if we can expand
this and really make it

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.450
something that is useful on a
day to day basis, we could be

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.400
on to something that people
might find useful.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.120
JACKIE: So how did
you expand it?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.490
Did you start it as
a blog or website?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.970
CHRIS STANG: I don't really
know what the

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.200
difference is anymore.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.970
We just put up a website.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.910
I guess it was chronological,
like we would

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.710
plug a review in.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.670
And then we'd plug
another one in.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.710
It would move it
down the list.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.930
And we had tags that
you could sort by.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.530
We called these things "Perfect
For" categories--

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.630
so perfect date night, perfect
for girls night

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.080
out, whatever it was.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.560
And so we didn't really have
a conversation about it.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.110
We just started writing
restaurant reviews.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.790
We made up of format and then
put the "Perfect For"

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.600
categories on it, and then just
started plugging it into

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.090
the chronological, I
guess blog, format.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.750
And then after probably six
months-- we knew from the

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.310
outset that we wanted to move
really fast and we want to

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.260
start cranking out restaurant
reviews so that it became a

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.320
useful database, quickly.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.390
So a few, probably four or five
months in, we started

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.710
talking about how are we going
to make this searchable, and

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.100
make it something that you can
dive into, and add more than

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.730
one parameter to search by
and things like that.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.049
So we really just
were winging it.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.600
We're still just winging it.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.120
We just put it up online.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.890
And the funny thing was that
once we put the first few

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.210
reviews up and started
sending it around, it

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.350
just started spreading.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.140
And we felt that reaction
almost immediately.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.720
It's kind of funny going back
and looking at the emails we

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.340
still have from people.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.610
They started coming in
within a couple weeks

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.680
of putting it up.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.420
So that was really the
motivation to say, OK, let's

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:58.940
keep going.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.880
Let's keep doing this, and let's
figure out a really grow

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.370
it and serve a purpose.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.310
JACKIE: How many years
has it been?

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.750
CHRIS STANG: It will be
four years in April

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.190
that we put it up.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.450
JACKIE: And many followers
or community?

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.480
How big is your community now?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.360
CHRIS STANG: I think between
our app and the website, we

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.660
probably hit about 100,000
people a month.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.920
JACKIE: That's great.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.260
That's powerful.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.860
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.200
Look, it's been incredible.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.500
I think we're still
overwhelmed by

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.900
the response to it.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.320
And I think a big part of what
we realized early on too is

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.430
that we really wanted it to be
more than just a website.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.500
We wanted to build a community
around it, because we were

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.360
getting such great, passionate
response, and people saying,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.080
look you've become my go-to for
restaurant reviews, and I

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.070
love the way write.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.890
And we kept hearing from people
that they felt like we

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.840
talked like they talked and that
we eat like they eat, and

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.780
that it was just relatable
for whatever reason.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.220
So as we would discuss things,
we just decided, look, I think

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.400
we're doing it right.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.300
We set out to serve a purpose
for people that didn't maybe

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.180
have a great resource
for these things.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.400
And it occurred to us that
that's a community.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.850
Those are people that, why
wouldn't they like to hang out

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.400
with each other?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.750
And why wouldn't they want to
meet each other and be around

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.730
other like minded people?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.750
So we've always, from pretty
early on, thought of this as

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.810
more than just a website.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.560
How are we going to connect
the people that read the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:25.510
website together and really
build a community around it?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.800
JACKIE: Very cool.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.910
So what kind of things are
you guys doing now?

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.850
I know Turkey Leg Ball,
which I went to,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.330
which was a great event.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.480
ANDREW STEINTHAL: That's
our one time of year

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.870
where we get married.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.590
CHRIS STANG: It's the
Infatuation wedding.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.250
ANDREW STEINTHAL: No, just
kidding, but not really.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.330
It's the one time we get our
community together and just

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.120
throw a really good party.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.000
We bring in interesting--

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.920
try and do something cool
on the food end.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.810
Last year, we had Union Square
Events cater it, which is

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.120
Danny Meyer's catering
company.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.430
And the whole thing
was turkey legs.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.570
And it was lots of huge turkey
legs and girls eating massive

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.110
turkey legs.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.740
And it was funny and very
photogenic, too.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.750
Lots of good photos that
come along with eating

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.755
a big turkey league.

00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:12.570
But get a lot of really good
booth sponsors, and have some

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.670
music, and just have not a
non-stuffy food party, because

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.470
a lot of these food parties are
white tablecloths, $200 a

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.160
ticket, really high scale.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.900
And we want to just
go have fun.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.860
But you can do that with
food, as well.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.660
This year we brought in a
restaurant from Austin--

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.820
Foreign and Domestic--

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.820
who we really love.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.630
JACKIE: Amazing.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.250
ANDREW STEINTHAL: We did our
South by Southwest dinner

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.080
there last year, and we
were just blown away.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.260
And the chefs there, Ned and
Joby, are a husband wife team

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.420
that are just awesome.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.010
And we wanted to bring them to
New York for a night and

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.630
attempt to feed 500 people,
which they did.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.310
And it was great.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.310
And we had some great
booth sponsors--

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.930
Macallen and Brugal Rum and
wines from Domain Select.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.190
And it was just cool.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.020
It was a fun time.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.970
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, that's
a good example, too.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.820
I think the party--

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.130
it's funny how that developed
for us too.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.540
We just, about a year in, were
getting such great response

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.930
from people that reached
out to us.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.980
We thought, all right,
could we get these

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.850
people in a room together?

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.130
And the first year we did it.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.490
And it was great.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.430
It sold out really fast.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.270
And it was a lot of fun.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.430
So we decided that that was
going to be something we used

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.220
as a way to community
build again.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.760
And we want to do more of it.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.700
It's really, really, really
difficult to put on a

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.580
successful event.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.240
And it pretty much kills
both of us every year.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.960
But it's fun.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.020
We find that the group that
comes out is ready to have fun

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.230
and ready to eat.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.700
Our chefs from this year,
we had so much food.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.530
And they came up to us at the
end and they were like, I

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.985
don't know who these people
are, but they eat, man.

00:12:42.985 --> 00:12:46.830
And they were blown away by the
amount of consumption that

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.640
was happening on all levels
at the party.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.540
But it's fun.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.230
It's definitely fun.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.450
So that's something
we want to grow.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.430
And I think--

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.430
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It's
interesting to see, too,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.650
because the people are starting
to know each other.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.270
The people who communicate
with us online, like on

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.780
Twitter, and on Instagram and
stuff, they're starting to

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.570
communicate with each
other a little bit.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.610
And then they go
to the events.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.560
And they're starting to
know who they are.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.750
And there are definitely some
people we've picked out from

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.490
the crowd that we really like
think are hysterical or think

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.040
are entertaining and are just
blowing their spots up online,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.190
and making a big
deal out of it.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.110
And it's really interesting just
to see it go from the web

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.850
and then go into real life,
and these people actually

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.840
talking and becoming friends and
connecting with each other

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.220
and feeling like they're a part
of something that's not

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.900
just a website.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.190
JACKIE: Yeah.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.880
It's really interesting.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.340
Something that I'm really
fascinated by is the idea of

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.460
taking something that starts on
the web, bringing it into

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.880
an actual experience, and then
also bringing it back to the

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.100
web, and how that grows.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.500
And I think one of the reasons,
and the things that I

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.950
love about your site and about
you guys, is you do that.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.640
You do that really well, whether
or not you're giving

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.410
yourselves enough
credit for it.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.830
But it's fun, and it's
entertaining. and

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.130
it's great to watch.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.210
It's great reading, because I
feel like when I read your

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.530
website, and your reviews, I
feel like it's how you talk.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.840
It's not like I'm reading
something very formal.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.170
One of them you right something
about ectoplasm from

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.960
Ghostbusters.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.190
And it's very entertaining.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.500
And it's very fun and
user friendly.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.090
CHRIS STANG: See, I think we've
just always tried to

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.690
think in terms of what we like
and what people we know like.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.710
And really, you hit
it on the head.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.260
We're not writers, so we just
write like we talk, and try

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.470
and inject humor into it.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.740
I think we always also wanted to
be one of those sites that

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.790
people visit every day.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.420
I think you have a handful
of websites that you have

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.220
bookmarked and that
you hit every day.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.890
And we always wanted
to be one of those.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.890
So I think more than anything,
we just wanted to be part of

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.630
people's lives, more than just
a website, something that

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.810
people feel like they're part of
and rally around and enjoy

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.390
interacting with,
and all that.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.610
So it's been fun.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.150
Look, we talk a lot about where
we're going to go with

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.080
it and how it grows.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.830
And I think that's probably the
challenge that's been the

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.710
most difficult for us
here, at this point.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.080
You brought up a good point.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.140
We're talking about a few
different parts of this, one

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.280
of which is we can grow a
lot in New York City.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.480
So we're obviously
trying to do.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.930
And we want to be much bigger
than we are here.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.670
But then we also start talking
about national expansion and

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.360
how to do that.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.610
And the challenge is how do we
find people that are like us

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.120
to start it in other cities and
to write in other cities.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.390
Because I'm not so sure you can
just go grab a writer and

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.750
put them on the case of writing
restaurant reviews for

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.700
another city and have it feel
the same way that it feels for

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.450
us in New York.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.530
I think it's very key to have
just a common, average person

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.580
that loves to eat out, maybe
that has a good sense for

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.780
dropping an f-bomb at the
perfect time in a restaurant

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.292
review or something.

00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:07.270
But I don't think we can just go
hire people that write for

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.940
other websites or that
write about food.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.420
I think that's the thing that
we're trying to figure out.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.320
It's almost like on the music
side, it's like A&amp;Ring a band.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.090
You've got to go find great
people in other

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.010
cities that can do it.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:19.990
And then grow it.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.610
So that's the place we're in
now is we're basically

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.470
starting a process that over the
next year we'll start to

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.640
expand in other cities.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.400
And we'll show couple.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.730
I'm sure most of you that are
familiar with the site have

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.240
seen the app, and some of the
other stuff that we do.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.870
But obviously product
development, and on the mobile

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.050
side is super important to us.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.160
So those are some of the things
that we're going to

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.820
focus on as we move forward.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.380
But it's funny.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.050
As much as this has been us just
winging it based on gut

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.740
instincts for things and what
we think people will like,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.510
when you start to get into that
place of crossing over

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.460
into how do we grow this and do
it well and do it smart so

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.790
that it works in other
places, it's tricky.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.450
JACKIE: Very.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.380
Can we take a look at the app?

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:07.579
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, sure.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.264
JACKIE: I'm actually curious
for everybody

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:10.900
to take a look at.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.410
But also, is the focus going
to be on growing mobile?

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:15.890
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.579
It's funny, the app was
one of those things

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.130
that we talked about.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.990
We couldn't understand why no
one had done an app that was

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.500
just really simple, like
I'm standing here,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.860
what's around me?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.330
Yelp obviously has
that function.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.200
You can search a Yelp thing and
then flip it over and see

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.800
the locations around
you on a map.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.090
But it's not curated, right?

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.690
And I think that's maybe one
thing we haven't talked about

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.280
that's key for us is the curated
voice seems to be

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.710
something that people
really want

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.820
online in a lot of topics.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.900
So there's so much user
generated content.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.470
Everybody has an opinion.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.800
So many people in the tech world
now are coming up with

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.440
apps and things like that that
aggregate everyone's opinion

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.750
and try and weight it based on
whatever they decide to weight

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.930
it on, so that there's more
credible people, I guess, in

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.350
your feed versus less
credible people.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.120
But for us, we just
feel like the

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.050
one-way opinion is helpful.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.410
Whether or not you agree with
us, that's up to you.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.000
But at least you know
where we stand, and

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.610
it's a one-way opinion.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.720
Purposely we don't have
commenting on the reviews for

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.170
that reason.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.040
Because we don't want you to
read our restaurant review and

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.950
see our opinion and then have
somebody right under it just

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.380
be like, yeah right, or
I hate this place.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.780
Because even if it's only a
little bit, it undermines the

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.250
validity of the opinion,
I think.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.640
JACKIE: Yeah, the
curated aspect.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.770
CHRIS STANG: So to go back, the
reason I brought that up

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.470
is the mobile thing.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.710
We just felt like, why
doesn't "New York

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.650
Magazine" have this app?

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.420
Or why hasn't somebody
else done this?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.140
And we kept hearing from people
in our community that

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.830
just really wanted the ability
to take the website on the

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.600
road and when they're out.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.430
I'm sure we've all been there,
where you're standing around

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.720
and you're like, where
am I going tonight?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.210
Or you walk into a restaurant
and the wait's too long, and

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.370
you're trying to think
of a backup plan.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.270
So really the biggest thing with
the app, the first and

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.720
most important function was the
nearby function, which is

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.810
just basically very simple
geo-aware map.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.970
And it shows you our
reviews around you.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.950
JACKIE: Can we take
a look at that?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:18.330
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, sure.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.316
JACKIE: That'd be great.

00:19:19.316 --> 00:19:20.110
CHRIS STANG: We'll show you.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.935
It's very, very technical
and impressive.

00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:25.010
JACKIE: But that's one of the
things that's great about is

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.090
that it is very straightforward.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.520
But it is very user friendly.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.320
And I think the thing that's
really interesting is that

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.510
it's your voice.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.030
You guys have a very
strong voice.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.330
But it's very friendly and--

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.660
CHRIS STANG: Thank you.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.490
JACKIE: Very straightforward.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.200
CHRIS STANG: Can you
guys see this?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.340
No?

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.270
JACKIE: Can you guys zoom
in at all on that?

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.080
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It's not
optimized for iPad.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.820
CHRIS STANG: No, but--

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.270
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Sorry.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.920
AUDIENCE: Is it iPhone only?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.680
CHRIS STANG: Yes, right now.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.140
Is this working at all?

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.070
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I mean if
Google wants to pay for our

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.700
Android app to be developed,
we are--

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.150
CHRIS STANG: By the
way, no problem.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.840
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
We'd be down.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.960
CHRIS STANG: Does that
work at all?

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.790
Can you see it?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.420
So this is the nearby
function.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.740
It's pretty simple.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.140
You'll see these little pens
that each have our reviews.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.390
Is that better?

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:22.030
There we go.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.566
That's totally on Google now.

00:20:23.566 --> 00:20:26.060
It's on Android.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.440
So the way the app works is you
open it up, and the first

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:36.190
thing you see is our first 12
reviews, just chronologically,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.320
that we've written, and then a
little intro to the review.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.050
And you can go deeper in and
read the whole review from the

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:44.730
home screen.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.530
And we obviously knew that
we had to have all the

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.260
information in there, whether
it's the restaurant

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.760
information, the ability to
share it, so on and so forth.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.140
But like I said, the
nearby thing is as

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.070
simple as it sounds.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.770
It's just, basically,
I'm standing there.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.580
And here's the restaurant
around me.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.180
And you can basically get a
little summary of what it is

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.430
before you dive in.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.520
Obviously you can basically
search it and stack the

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.820
filters so that you deduce it
down to a certain review based

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.570
on location, perfect
for, cuisine.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.440
And actually, it started out,
because of our music business

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.410
background, part of the thing we
started with was we started

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.900
doing reviews, restaurants
that were

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:33.940
close to music venues.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.900
Because that was something that,
at least for the two of

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.850
us, was really useful.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.750
Because we were going to a show
and we needed to know

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.740
where we were eating
before that show.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.410
So we expanded that out now to
landmarks and things like that

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.100
people that are in town from
other places might use.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.710
And so you can basically just
stack a bunch of filters up

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.130
and hopefully find a couple of
options that are useful.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.330
And then the last one that came
towards the end of our

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.640
development phase was
the hit list.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.000
And basically the hit list for
us was just an answer to all

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.200
of our friends, including us,
that would start a note in

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.510
their iPhone or on the
BlackBerry or whatever, or

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.680
even an email draft, and
list restaurants.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.430
Because I know tons of
people still do that.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.450
Somebody will tell you
about a restaurant.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.400
You open up an email draft or
something, and you write the

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.710
restaurant name down.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.260
Then you lose your BlackBerry
or something.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.625
So the way that we decided to
deal with this was you go in

00:22:27.625 --> 00:22:29.855
and basically you
read a review.

00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:33.130
And if you decide you want hit
the place, you just add to

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.890
your hit list.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.850
And then it'll be in there.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.810
And then it turns the
pins red on the map.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.840
So hopefully, when you're
seeing a whole bunch of

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.570
different restaurants, you'll
see a couple red pins and

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.090
realize that those are hit
list restaurants that

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:45.780
you want to go to.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.380
JACKIE: Very nice.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.570
CHRIS STANG: And so
that's the app.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.450
It's pretty much the same.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.990
We've basically had
a few versions.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.410
We added the social sharing
to it not that long ago.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.250
But it's pretty much the same
as it was when it started.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.720
It was a guy that now runs
product development for us,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.740
who I used to work with.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.615
It was the first app
he ever built--

00:23:04.615 --> 00:23:05.540
he and his friend.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.100
So we got really lucky.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.250
They did a great job with it.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.320
We feel like it's really
simple and easy to use.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.490
And it's done really
well for us.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.690
It's been a really big
part of our growth.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.230
And I think it's been probably
the most important thing we've

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.280
done since we started
the site.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.730
JACKIE: Nice.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.512
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Yes?

00:23:22.512 --> 00:23:24.400
AUDIENCE: Do you only feature
places that you recommend?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.704
Or perhaps would a pin
show up and be like--

00:23:27.704 --> 00:23:31.530
ANDREW STEINTHAL: No, the pin's
got everything on it.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.320
In the app, you can get any
review that we've done,

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.140
whether it's a good
or bad review.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.070
Because you might like
that restaurant.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.730
You might disagree with us.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.130
I'm not looking to take bad
reviews out of the app.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.890
CHRIS STANG: We also want
you to make sure--

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.080
places we don't like--

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.860
the whole point is that you're
not going to go there and have

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.930
a bad experience.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.940
We're trying to keep you from
wasting money on a terrible

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.540
restaurant.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.590
And obviously, that's subjective
to some extent.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.980
But that's what this is for.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.480
It's to sort out the
good from the bad.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.590
And we have an opinion on it.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.340
So everything on the site is
in here and we definitely

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.310
review restaurants negatively.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.970
And that's also something that
we get a lot of feedback about

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.070
is we're just really honest.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.210
We're very careful not
to have ties into

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.200
the restaurant community.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.310
We're not friends with chefs.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.700
We don't tell people we're
coming into restaurants.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.740
We don't go to restaurant
industry events.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.900
So we try to stay very far away
from it, because we want

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.590
to remain outsiders.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.670
And it also allows us to just
be completely unbridled and

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.510
honest if we don't
like a place.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.070
And that way we're still--

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.010
ANDREW STEINTHAL: We might get
killed one day, though.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.960
There are a couple of people out
there that definitely want

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.890
to destroy us.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.096
CHRIS STANG: That's true.

00:24:37.096 --> 00:24:38.440
AUDIENCE: Are you able
to share the hit

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.790
list with your friends?

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.570
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
Next version.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.580
It's coming.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.790
Working on that, because that's
important, I think,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.630
being able to take the hit list
and not even just share

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.950
it with your friends on your
iPhone or whatever, but

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:56.110
online, on Facebook, on your
blog, on Twitter, wherever you

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.660
want to share it.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.260
I think that's a big part of
building this community up.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.960
We've started to have
this community.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.700
And now we want to engage
the community.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.400
We don't want to
have comments.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.580
But we want people to be able to
use Immaculate Infatuation,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.860
make it their own, and build
upon that, really get people

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.940
to interact with the site and
use it for something that

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.440
they'll enjoy using, and be
able to share with their

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.370
friends, and can quantify a
lot of this stuff better.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.880
And we're working on
that for soon.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.650
CHRIS STANG: I think that
goes back to what

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.320
you were saying too.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.060
It's that take it from online
to offline, and then back

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.720
online again.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.620
That's the next stage for us,
is really using the mobile

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.590
part of this to connect
everybody.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.650
So that if you're using the app,
you can, like you were

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.470
saying, share the hit list.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.240
But you can maybe also find
out where somebody's going

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.260
tonight and build in a bunch of
information into the mobile

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.840
side of it, too.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.210
So that's definitely a big
part of it for us.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.040
AUDIENCE: How are you keeping
the reviews up to date?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.210
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Stay up until
2:00 AM every night

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.100
writing restaurant reviews.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.550
CHRIS STANG: Do you mean,
like, older reviews?

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.080
Yeah.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.960
ANDREW STEINTHAL: That's
a problem.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.340
CHRIS STANG: We've done a
good handful of updates.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.040
I mean, we've definitely
realized from the earlier

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.530
stuff that we've done that there
are places we definitely

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.220
need to go back to
and reassess.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.190
And we try to.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.990
But for New York City, if
there's a restaurant that's

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.670
still around, and it's been
there for four years, there's

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.790
a pretty good chance it hasn't
changed all that much.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.270
The menu stuff probably
changes.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.475
But like Freeman's Alley
was one of the

00:26:31.475 --> 00:26:33.780
first places we reviewed.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.540
We actually updated that review
since we started.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.960
But those places don't
change all that much.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.500
But that's something we're going
to start probably doing

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.910
more of, especially now
that we've been

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.820
around for four years.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.920
It wasn't such a big deal up
until pretty recently.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.609
ANDREW STEINTHAL: And you go
back and read our old reviews.

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:51.485
And we're just like, wow,
these are terrible.

00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.390
JACKIE: So I'm really curious
to see this presentation.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.430
CHRIS STANG: So yeah,
we'll get in, I

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.240
guess, to more questions.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.690
But we have a Frequently Asked
Questions presentation.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.890
JACKIE: It could answer some of
the questions that could be

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.260
in the room.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.220
CHRIS STANG: So this might
answer some of the ones you

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.570
have already.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.510
ANDREW STEINTHAL: OK,
don't judge me.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.720
It's not my computer.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.090
There's cats in the
background.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.150
It's my wife's computer.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.510
Those aren't my cats.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.130
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Not that
cat people are horrible.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.330
But I just would rather be
qualified as a dog person than

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.810
a cat person.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.490
I have problems with this
whole cat thing.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.110
Anyway, OK.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.640
Sorry.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.280
CHRIS STANG: We should probably
put that into the

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.310
FAQs presentation
for next time.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.420
ANDREW STEINTHAL: How
did you guys meet?

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.710
We already went over that.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:40.080
But this is us at the Grammys,
the first year we ever met.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.590
And we legitimately wore that
and thought we were awesome.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.650
CHRIS STANG: Let's clarify
something, though.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.890
We weren't invited
to the Grammys.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.325
We bought tickets.

00:27:49.325 --> 00:27:50.410
ANDREW STEINTHAL: No, we
didn't buy tickets.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.220
We got free tickets.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:51.730
CHRIS STANG: We got tickets.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.570
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
We were excited.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.480
It was, like, the
best day ever.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.900
CHRIS STANG: Right, but
let's just be clear.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.410
We were not invited because we
were some sort of luminaries

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.480
from the music business.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.640
We were two guys in the nose
bleeds at Madison Square

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.150
Gardens in tuxes
that we rented.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.580
ANDREW STEINTHAL: And I wore
a Knicks headband.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.270
CHRIS STANG: And a
Knicks headband.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.540
ANDREW STEINTHAL: The Patrick
Ewing retirement

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.300
game was that week.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.460
It was important.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.390
And real puffy here.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:15.120
CHRIS STANG: And that tuxedo's
three sizes too large.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.990
ANDREW STEINTHAL: OK, next.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.660
Where did the name come from?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.320
So that is the original
Immaculate Infatuation.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.970
That is a fake British rock band
that we dressed up as--

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.110
me and my friends-- for
Halloween one night in college

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.500
up at Ithaca, and put on British
accents and called

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.020
ourselves Immaculate
Infatuation.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.400
And it just was a name that
always stuck with me.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.700
And I just liked it.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.060
And I guess the world was in
need of a food blog you

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.890
couldn't pronounce the name of,
and Immaculate Infatuation

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.720
was born, because we didn't want
to be something cheesy.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.880
The other thing we were thinking
of was Eats Beat,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.530
because it was food and music.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.380
But that was real lame.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.060
So we decided to go with

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.540
Immaculate Infatuation instead.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.960
CHRIS STANG: This is a
very astute use of

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.360
clip art, by the way.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.380
It took me hours to do this.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.480
ANDREW STEINTHAL: The
answer is what?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.320
Three days a week?

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.850
Four days a week?

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.570
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.380
ANDREW STEINTHAL: As
much as possible?

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.470
CHRIS STANG: Yep.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.940
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
But it's tricky.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.960
No.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.010
CHRIS STANG: Especially
not this guy.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.040
I hope that guy doesn't
work at Google.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.315
So yeah, like I said
before, that's sort

00:29:26.315 --> 00:29:27.350
of a cardinal rule.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.180
We don't tell people we're
coming ahead of time.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.510
We don't accept offers to
be guests of chefs or

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.700
restaurants.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.880
We just go in and eat, just
like anybody else would.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.980
It's really important to us to
have the same experience that

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.500
anybody going into the
restaurant would normally.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.360
So the answer to this is because
we run like we're

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.840
getting chased.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.480
Basically, the both of us run
probably 12 miles a week just

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.760
to work off the pork buns
and bone marrow that

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.940
goes into our system.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.300
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Now I'm
really into SoulCycle.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.550
CHRIS STANG: Yeah he's
into SoulCycle.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.267
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I'm fine
with admitting that.

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:05.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.860
CHRIS STANG: Are you
guys dating?

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.500
This comes up less now that
Andrew wears a wedding ring.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.220
But we dealt with questions
like that a lot.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.400
ANDREW STEINTHAL: The
answer is no.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.890
But we have probably one of
the gayer straight male

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.030
relationships that exist.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.390
CHRIS STANG: That's true.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.000
ANDREW STEINTHAL: And we are
definitely in a serious

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.500
relationship.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.026
CHRIS STANG: Exhibit A.
Photos like that.

00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:31.470
Go back.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.100
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Whoops.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.450
I don't know how to go back.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.900
Previous.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.470
CHRIS STANG: There you go.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:37.446
Keep going.

00:30:37.446 --> 00:30:40.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.720
CHRIS STANG: So yeah, I
think Andrew touched

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.360
on it a little bit.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.710
We write pretty much entirely
late at night.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.960
I think we both are up until
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.490
many nights, finishing
reviews.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.340
And then the weekends are
obviously full of activities

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.050
that are based around Immaculate
Infatuation.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.850
But I'm sure lots of people
here have experienced it.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.440
It's like you have a
moonlight hour job.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.190
It's one of those things where
if you're passionate and you

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.520
love it, it doesn't really
seem like work.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.260
But you realize that you're
probably doing very bad things

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.590
to your body by not sleeping
and only eating restaurant

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.075
food all the time.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.570
It's great that we get reached
out to all the time.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.130
This is even more relevant now,
because we are looking

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.050
for people to do some writing
for us in other places.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.980
But it's funny.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.090
The food blogger thing, there
seems to be an interesting

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.560
perception around that word.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.930
And not that we're
adverse to it.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.480
But it's funny.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.690
I guess the reason that image
is there is we try not to be

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.290
like food bloggers in
the sense that--

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.630
I think there's a bit of a--

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.490
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Stigma?

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.810
CHRIS STANG: No, not a stigma.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.220
It's almost like the
word foodie.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.590
People use it to separate
themselves from other people.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.240
And it's like, wait a minute,
you like food?

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.280
No kidding.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.790
I can't believe it.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.580
JACKIE: I like food, too.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.080
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.410
So yeah, I think we're obviously
on the lookout just

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.510
for people like us that love
to eat and aren't food

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:20.020
bloggers already, and aren't
writers already, but also have

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.270
similar interests.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:23.885
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Yeah.

00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:25.104
CHRIS STANG: So that's it.

00:32:25.104 --> 00:32:26.890
I hope you like the clip art.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.800
JACKIE: Clip art was amazing.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.310
So before we open it up to more
questions, we have some

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.850
questions put together.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.600
And it's pretty basic,
straightforward.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.786
But something we like
to do here is

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:45.150
some speed round questions.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:45.490
CHRIS STANG: Ready.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.470
JACKIE: So I have a couple
different versions.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.760
CHRIS STANG: Do we
have to go fast?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.400
JACKIE: Yes, very.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.370
So the first round is speed
round, Immaculate style.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.360
So in New York, the best place
for action at the bar?

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.634
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Spotted Pig.

00:32:58.634 --> 00:32:59.400
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.690
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Never
lets you down.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.300
Always action, so much action.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.900
You just got to be prepared
for the action.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.501
JACKIE: Chronic brunch?

00:33:10.501 --> 00:33:13.050
CHRIS STANG: Oh, that's
a good one.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:13.870
Chronic brunch--

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.440
Cafe Habana, probably.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.440
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Cafe Habana.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.980
CHRIS STANG: It's cheap.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.960
It's awesome.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.540
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Clinton
Street Bakery.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.410
I mean, Clinton Street Bakery,
the lines are impossible.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.410
But if you go there
on a weekday, the

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.820
pancakes are just absurd.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.585
JACKIE: They are amazing.

00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:28.380
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
They're amazing.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.380
Prune, also, for just straight
brunch is phenomenal.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.930
JACKIE: Dinner with
the parents?

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.510
CHRIS STANG: Either Maialeno,
Maraya, depending on who your

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.010
parents are.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.340
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, Babbo's
great, some of those classic

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:46.870
restaurants.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.480
I love Blue Ribbon Brasserie,
which is the original Blue

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.790
Ribbon, not the sushi place.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.010
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
Mas Farmhouse.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.760
My mom loves that place.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.110
It's a good spot.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.120
JACKIE: Moms love it.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.480
Mom's approve.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.390
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Five
Points, too.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.300
That's a great parents place.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.360
Because that's not as fancy
as all the other

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.620
ones, but really good.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.220
For the parents, that's
really cool.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.420
They go in there, and they're
like, wow, I'm having the most

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.219
awesome downtown New York
night right now.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:11.850
CHRIS STANG: There's a tree
inside the restaurant.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.679
That's always impressive.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.929
JACKIE: And what about
impressing out-of-towners?

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.600
CHRIS STANG: The Momofuku's
are always good for that.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.860
Same thing with Ippudo, just
because it's such an anomaly.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.510
I love that place.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.150
And it's just crazy.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:27.980
Those places are great.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.090
I still love the Blue Ribbon
Brasserie one for that, too,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.480
because it's open until
4:00 in the morning.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.350
So you can always blow people's
minds by having a

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.750
full on amazing dinner
at 2:00 AM.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.760
JACKIE: That's good stuff.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.949
So besides the cafeterias at
Google New York, where is the

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.980
favorite place for you guys
to eat right now--

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.630
locally or the US?

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.320
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Locally?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.260
Does Chelsea Market count?

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.150
Because you guys are really
lucky to have

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.190
that across the street.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.010
We work in midtown.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.239
And we got to deal with
Rock Center for

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.060
lunch, which is brutal.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.800
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.790
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Chelsea Market
is just like an oasis

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.970
of incredibleness.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.790
We walk around there, and we're
like holy shit, what

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.835
would we do if we actually
worked here?

00:35:01.835 --> 00:35:02.900
It would be great.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.705
CHRIS STANG: I would say that
probably the best answer to

00:35:04.705 --> 00:35:07.950
that question for us right now
is Austin, Texas as a whole.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:08.750
JACKIE: Interesting.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:09.800
CHRIS STANG: That
city is amazing.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.090
There's so much great
food there.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.980
And we go a lot just for
South by Southwest.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.230
But it's also just becoming
a place we go just to eat.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.970
Because there are incredible
restaurants down there of all

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.020
shapes and sizes, whether it's
barbecue or a place like

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.840
Foreign and Domestic,
who we brought for

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.170
our Turkey Leg Ball.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.110
It's a great city altogether.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.790
But the food, especially,
is amazing.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.220
JACKIE: Awesome.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.780
So being in music world, I need
to ask, if you could have

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.370
dinner with any musician,
who would it be and

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.320
where would you eat?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.130
CHRIS STANG: Good question.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.490
ANDREW STEINTHAL: That's
really good question.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.620
CHRIS STANG: Jay-Z at Lucali.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.530
That would be awesome.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.110
JACKIE: That's amazing.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.580
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I would like
to join that dinner.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.440
JACKIE: Can I join
that dinner?

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.480
CHRIS STANG: I think Lucali
might be closed forever.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.810
But we'll figure out where Jay-Z
likes to go after that.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.960
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I'd go with
Thom Yorke somewhere.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.930
But he'd be real weird.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.170
I'm trying to think of what the
weirdest place you can go

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.600
and not speak to somebody is.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.400
Because he probably wouldn't
speak at the dinner table.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.765
ANDREW STEINTHAL: He'd probably
just like freak out

00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:04.976
and whatever.

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:05.910
CHRIS STANG: That's
a good answer.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.010
JACKIE: That's awesome.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.300
OK, so the second set of
speed round questions.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.395
This is Googly Style,
as we call it.

00:36:12.395 --> 00:36:12.860
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Googly Style.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:12.960
Nice.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.460
JACKIE: Googly Style.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.390
So pick the best answer--
the best one--

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.290
that most suits you.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.300
And we'll do Chris.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.820
And then go right to Andrew.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.970
So coffee or tea?

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.520
CHRIS STANG: Coffee.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.280
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Neither.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.210
JACKIE: Ooh.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.210
Brown liquor or clear liquor?

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.066
CHRIS STANG: Brown.

00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:30.980
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Brown.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.870
JACKIE: Hip Hop, west
coast or east coast?

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.950
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It's not
even a thing anymore.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:36.640
JACKIE: It is for me
and my generation.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.230
CHRIS STANG: West coast.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.710
ANDREW STEINTHAL: East coast.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.430
JACKIE: 2Pac--

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.100
east coast?

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.560
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Yes.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.470
JACKIE: 2Pac hologram--

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.650
resurrection or lawsuit?

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.750
CHRIS STANG: I'm going
to go with lawsuit.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.540
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I'm going
definite resurrection.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.090
It was awesome.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.940
JACKIE: LEGOs or Muppets?

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.752
CHRIS STANG: Muppets, 100%.

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:54.560
ANDREW STEINTHAL: LEGOs.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.770
JACKIE: Kicks, Nike
or Converse?

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.700
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It's
the same thing.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.350
CHRIS STANG: Converse.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:58.790
ANDREW STEINTHAL: No.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.185
No, but I'm saying--

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:01.545
JACKIE: Yeah, but totally
different styles.

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:01.950
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Absolutely,
but--

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.150
CHRIS STANG: You're not
doing this right.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.950
ANDREW STEINTHAL: OK, sorry.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:06.360
JACKIE: I'm going to
say that you--

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.850
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Nike
all the way.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.730
Thank you, Nike.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.960
I love my sneakers.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.810
JACKIE: Dark chocolate
or milk chocolate?

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.567
CHRIS STANG: Dark.

00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:14.880
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Milk.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.290
JACKIE: They are really
the perfect pair.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.580
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.510
JACKIE: Last question.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.720
You're totally housed.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.200
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.850
Pizza or burger?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.640
CHRIS STANG: Burger.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.170
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Really?

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.170
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.682
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Joe's Pizza.

00:37:26.682 --> 00:37:28.080
Final answer.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.740
JACKIE: So if anybody else
has any questions.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.535
I know we did a little bit
before, but you guys are

00:37:32.535 --> 00:37:35.270
welcome to go to the mics.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.650
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Or just
raise your hands.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.540
JACKIE: Or just raise
your hands, and

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.600
we'll repeat the question.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.960
CHRIS STANG: I want to do this
like a presidential debate,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.862
where we face off.

00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:41.940
Sorry, go ahead.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.862
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about
turning this into a

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:47.784
business, perhaps where you
could get rid of your day job.

00:37:47.784 --> 00:37:49.245
You don't have to stay
up until 3:00 AM.

00:37:49.245 --> 00:37:51.680
Is that where you want
to take this?

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.260
JACKIE: So just to repeat for
people on VC and recording,

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.210
she's asking growing the
business, staying up now until

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.580
3:00 AM, is it something that
eventually you want this to be

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.270
your primary?

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.530
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, we're lucky
in the sense that our day jobs

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.240
are dream jobs for us.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.620
It's not so much the situation
where we're sitting, chained

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.060
to some desk, where we feel
like, God, if we could only

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.480
get out and do this thing we're

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.530
passionate about full time.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.050
Clearly though, we
would love to.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.660
It's something we are really
passionate about.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.550
And we're ambitious.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.640
I think we have lofty
goals for it.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.980
So just like anything on the
internet, the monetization

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.960
part of it is tricky.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.940
And it's also tricky to do
it right and do it well.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.070
So that's something we're
figuring out as we go.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.810
And I think we have some pretty
good ideas in terms of

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:42.470
what we can do.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.950
But also we're just trying not
to speed into anything,

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:48.000
because I think that's when
you make mistakes.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.360
So I think it's that
if you build it,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.060
they will come mentality.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.210
We can just do something that's
really great and build

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.205
a community around it, then the
rest of it will hopefully

00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:56.660
come together.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.590
ANDREW STEINTHAL: The one
thing we can definitely

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.130
control is the content.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:03.720
If we continue to focus on the
content and make things that

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.330
people want and continue to
build this thing, I think

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.520
hopefully we'll figure
it out along the way.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.320
Do we have a master plan as to
how we're going to make a ton

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.140
of money on this and be
able to whatever?

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.920
No.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.830
But we have ideas as to
what we want to do.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.290
And we think we can
figure it out.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.548
So getting there.

00:39:24.548 --> 00:39:26.090
JACKIE: Any other questions?

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.110
AUDIENCE: What is the best
burger you've tried?

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.160
JACKIE: What is the best
burger you've tried?

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.290
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Every burger's
the best burger.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.080
CHRIS STANG: I love
the one at--

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.566
there's a place called The
Burger Joint in the Parker

00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:36.680
Meridien Hotel here.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.230
JACKIE: It's good.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.300
CHRIS STANG: And it's
really, really good.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.940
ANDREW STEINTHAL: There's
different kinds.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.080
One burger, there's the
fast food burger type.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.760
There's the mid burger--

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.370
JACKIE: What's your
go-to burger?

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:47.540
ANDREW STEINTHAL: The
restaurant burger.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.692
AUDIENCE: There's also
the Hopdoddy's

00:39:48.692 --> 00:39:50.820
burgers in Austin, Texas.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.500
CHRIS STANG: They're great.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.300
That place is amazing--

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.370
Hopdoddy's in Austin.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:53.990
It's another one.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.380
Austin is so loaded with places
that that place doesn't

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.060
even make a lot of people's
lists of great Austin

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.660
restaurants.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.570
But yeah, I love it.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:03.220
It's really good.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.620
And they're really creative.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.850
It's certainly not all just
your traditional burgers.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:07.850
They do all kinds
of different--

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.150
I think there's an
ostrich burger

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.950
on the menu or something.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.420
But yeah, it's great.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.670
Love it.

00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:17.070
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
you don't or won't eat?

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.750
JACKIE: The question is, is
there anything that you won't

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.500
or don't eat?

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.180
CHRIS STANG: I'm pretty much
an equal opportunity eater.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.250
There's not much of my list.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.430
I don't think there's really
anything I won't eat.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.580
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I'm
really picky.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.730
Compared to him, there's a lot
of things I won't eat.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.820
Like mushrooms, I'm
petrified of.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.920
Indian food scares the
shit out of me.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.180
JACKIE: Indian food?

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.390
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
Yeah, olives.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.880
I don't understand how
people eat olives.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.900
It's disgusting.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.970
They're disgusting.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:45.930
JACKIE: So this is
interesting.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.200
So you guys go into a restaurant
and you're like,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.190
I'll have the mushroom and
olive pizza, without the

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.875
mushrooms and olives.

00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:53.850
And he's like, I'll have the
pizza with the brain and the

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:54.640
tripe on it.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:54.970
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Right.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.710
CHRIS STANG: But it's funny,
because I think that's also

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.380
part of what helps us remain
relatable is not everybody

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.260
that eats at restaurants is
Frank Bruni or Anthony

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.240
Bourdain and willing
to take down tripe.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.990
So I think I'm certainly
more adventurous.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.120
Andrew's a bit more picky.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.250
But that's what people are
like, aren't they?

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.810
Everybody has a friend or a
boyfriend or girlfriend that

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.710
doesn't eat all the same
stuff they do.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.160
JACKIE: Nice.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.283
AUDIENCE: How many times do you
visit a restaurant before

00:41:23.283 --> 00:41:24.590
writing a review?

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.030
JACKIE: The question is how
many times do you visit a

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.000
restaurant before you
write a review?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.260
ANDREW STEINTHAL: It depends.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.160
We can go once.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.760
We could go four times.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.970
If we go and have an experience
with a bunch people

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.230
that we really feel like we've
tasted the menu, and we feel

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.410
like we get the vibe, and we
know what the place is about,

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.120
we'll weigh in.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.150
But a lot of times, it'll be
two times or three times,

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.110
where we just want to make sure
that we didn't just go

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.410
and have a fluke of a meal, or
whatever, just had a couple

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.590
dishes and then weigh
in on a place.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.080
You want to give a place
a fair shake.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.360
You want to get an idea of what
they're all about, what

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.390
their serving is, what the
crowd is, and all that.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.090
So sometimes you can do
that in one time.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.840
Sometimes it takes a minute.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.740
CHRIS STANG: Yeah, but at the
same time, most restaurants

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.820
don't get that luxury from
normal people that just walk

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.580
into a restaurant.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.910
If a place bums you out the
first time, there's no chance

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.510
you're going back.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.740
And so it's something
we try and balance.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.980
Yeah, maybe they're having
an off night.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.750
But consistency is a huge part
of a great restaurant.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.940
So it definitely depends.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.810
But we're not afraid to go
into a place, have a bad

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.630
experience once, and write
about it being a bad

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.100
experience.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.300
Because that's what happens.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.420
JACKIE: Yeah.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.850
In the front?

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.626
AUDIENCE: Are you specifically
looking for more off the

00:42:35.626 --> 00:42:36.770
beaten path kind of
places that are

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:37.750
maybe less well known?

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.710
Or are you just as likely to
go to a super popular,

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.690
well-known place?

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.780
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Try
and mix it up.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.200
We love to try and unearth
some local finds.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.250
We rely pretty heavily
on our community to

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.070
unearth those for us.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.210
People email us all the time
and get after us on Twitter

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.090
and Facebook and stuff.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.410
And they come at us with
recommendations.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:00.090
And the places that we've never
heard of, we love to go

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:00.700
find a place.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.610
Like, You were talking about
Post Office in Williamsburg.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.490
It's a place that nobody's
really written about that

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.190
much, but it's incredible.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.570
It's easily one of our favorite
places in the city.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.440
It's just a brown liquor joint
that's got oysters and grilled

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.120
cheese and pulled
pork sandwiches.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.230
But it's perfect.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.500
It's exactly the kind of
place that we love.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.060
And the food's awesome.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.360
But nobody's really written
about it, really.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.630
CHRIS STANG: It's funny, too,
because that place we gave a

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.180
9.0, and nobody had written
about it at the time.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.300
And those places give us a
really good opportunity to see

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.220
what we can do with
our community.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.530
So if we really put a stamp on a
place like that that doesn't

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.700
have the "New York Times" or
"New York Magazine" or whoever

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.100
else writing about
it, it's great.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.960
Because we actually see
the impact of it.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.740
We'll see people on social media
a couple days later,

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.750
saying that they're there.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.250
And it's cool.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.620
It's hard to have that
opportunity, because there's

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.970
so many other people writing
about all these other

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:51.460
restaurants.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.165
It's hard to tell what
impact you have.

00:43:53.165 --> 00:43:54.410
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I think the
Post Office review was the

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.820
first time we ever actually
could see that we made a

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.910
difference somehow.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:04.480
I think that after that review
that weekend we had so many

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.360
tweets from people at
the restaurant.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.610
And that place is small.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.800
That place maybe fits 40 people,
and we had 10, 11

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.780
different groups that
were there.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.170
We were just like, holy shit,
there's people actually there,

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.180
because we gave a good review.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.860
It's cool.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.741
AUDIENCE: Aside from, obviously,
New York City and

00:44:22.741 --> 00:44:25.216
then Austin, do you see any
cities that have really

00:44:25.216 --> 00:44:27.350
exciting scenes?

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.739
JACKIE: So just besides New York
and Austin, do you know

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:34.190
of other cities, or what other
cities has really exciting

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.680
food scenes?

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.020
CHRIS STANG: It's funny.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.910
Every city now, just because
restaurant culture's changed

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.020
so much in the last 15 years,
I feel like every city has

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:46.010
some little pocket of an amazing
restaurant community

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.390
growing up around it.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.610
But there are certainly cities
that are just being overtaken.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:53.720
Like Portland has a great
restaurant scene, Seattle

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.320
obviously does.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.390
San Francisco is huge.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.880
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Nashville.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.245
I want to go to Nashville.

00:44:58.245 --> 00:44:58.530
CHRIS STANG: Nashville.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.700
JACKIE: Nashville
is awesome food.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.046
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Nashville's
got some really

00:45:00.046 --> 00:45:01.160
cool stuff going on.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.305
CHRIS STANG: Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:45:02.305 --> 00:45:03.220
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Yeah.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.890
CHRIS STANG: Even DC is starting
to have a cool

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.630
restaurant scene.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.640
They've got some great
restaurants.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.110
So those are probably the
top of the list places.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.670
Chicago, obviously, has
tons of restaurants.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.550
I left that one out.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.170
But those are probably the top
of the list in terms of at

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.100
least places we put
on our map of--

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.372
JACKIE: And L.A.

00:45:20.372 --> 00:45:21.550
CHRIS STANG: You know,
L.A.s funny.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.870
L.A.s great, but I've spent a
lot of time there, for me the

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.040
food that really is memorable
in L.A. is the ethnic food.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.270
Whether it's the Korean food or
Little Tokyo downtown, to

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.020
go to L.A. and go to the
restaurants that are New York

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.510
style restaurants, there's very
few that live up to it.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.730
And every single one of them
has a valet in front, which

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:42.690
just seems really weird to me.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:44.240
But it seems like in L.A.--

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.520
JACKIE: Because we
live in New York.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:45.810
CHRIS STANG: Yeah.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.600
Well, it's like the places that
really get talked about

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.880
in L.A. are more like
scene places.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.670
But the great food, there's a
few places we love, but the

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.726
places in L.A. that really are
memorable, at least to me, are

00:45:58.726 --> 00:45:59.560
the ethnic food.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.080
JACKIE: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.830
There's some amazing
food out there.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:06.210
AUDIENCE: How do you guys
decide where to go next?

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:10.330
JACKIE: The question is how do
they decide where to go next?

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.190
CHRIS STANG: We definitely
maintain our own hit lists.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:14.300
It depends.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.880
People will tell us
about places.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.310
Social media's great for that.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.440
Our community is great about
giving us a heads up on

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.900
restaurants we need to go to.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.170
ANDREW STEINTHAL: There's
no real science to it.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.890
We just like, oh shit
we need to go there.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:28.890
Remember.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.980
And oh, we haven't done a
Brooklyn review in a couple

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.146
weeks, we got to get
out to Brooklyn.

00:46:34.146 --> 00:46:36.310
CHRIS STANG: We go to websites
like "Eater" are great for

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.510
that, because they definitely
keep a good list of openings.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.740
And we also try not to just
depend on what's brand new.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.320
So we'll try and sometimes
just go look around a

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.200
neighborhood and think, what are
these places that people

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.360
talk about in this neighborhood
and places that

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.120
we might have missed?

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.790
We ended up at a place called
Kajitsu in the East Village a

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.570
few weeks ago that has been
there for years and it's got a

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.705
Michelin Star, and somehow,
we just hadn't been there.

00:46:59.705 --> 00:47:00.880
And it was great.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.930
It's just funny.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.370
New York's so unique in that
sense, that there's so many

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.740
restaurants that you really
can spend years.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.580
We've written 600 restaurant
reviews, and we feel like

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.428
we're barely scratching
the surface here.

00:47:12.428 --> 00:47:14.713
AUDIENCE: Do you usually
go with other people?

00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:15.630
Or just the two of you?

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.620
ANDREW STEINTHAL: We
go-- we try and--

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.140
JACKIE: Do they go
by-- it's OK.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.835
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I can redo
the question, if you want.

00:47:19.835 --> 00:47:20.720
JACKIE: Yeah, that'd be great.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.360
CHRIS STANG: She's the
moderator, man.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:21.720
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Sorry.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.040
JACKIE: Yeah, but Andrew,
take it away.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.840
Go for it.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.620
ANDREW STEINTHAL: In terms
of if we go together to

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.800
restaurants or if we go
with other people.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.570
Did you like that?

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:31.540
That was good, right?

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:31.815
JACKIE: Excellent.

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.200
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Right, cool.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.220
JACKIE: Bright future here.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:34.650
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
We definitely--

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:34.910
CHRIS STANG: You're done.

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.130
We don't need you anymore.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.260
JACKIE: I know.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:36.860
Thanks guys.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.230
I'm going to go grab some--

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.560
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Part of the
fun of this is getting a big

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.050
crew together and
going to eat.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.610
That's part of the game.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.160
We're constantly setting up
dinners, constantly going,

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.030
finding random people who share
our similar interests

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.430
and trying to go with
a bigger group.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.310
Not a huge group, but a group
that's sizable enough where

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.570
you can taste a lot of things
and over-order, and all just

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.480
get into it.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.960
We don't go together
all the time.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.160
We definitely go
together a lot.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.000
But we try and split it up so
that we each have different

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.119
things to write about.

00:48:06.119 --> 00:48:07.739
AUDIENCE: Are you paying
for all of your

00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:09.830
friends when you go?

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.110
CHRIS STANG: No,
definitely not.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.120
JACKIE: Are you guys going
to repeat that?

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.380
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Are we paying
for all our friends

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.060
when we go to eat?

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.600
Absolutely not.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.525
Hopefully someday we'll
be able to do that.

00:48:17.525 --> 00:48:18.880
That would be lovely.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.610
But as of right now, it's
expensive enough for us to go

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.710
pay for ourselves to eat.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:26.080
CHRIS STANG: My AMEX card is
warm in my pocket, most of the

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.330
time, from overuse.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.600
JACKIE: Great.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.170
Well, this has been awesome.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.270
I think it's just amazing to
see, just again, some ideas,

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:41.380
some passion, the web, good
friendship, love of food.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.400
And you don't even really need
to know how to use PowerPoint

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.710
in order to access the web.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:46.390
CHRIS STANG: Yeah,
clearly we--

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:49.510
JACKIE: And build a community
of 100,000.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.160
ANDREW STEINTHAL: I barely
know how to use a Mac.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.970
That's my problem.

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:54.970
JACKIE: Well, we have some great
solutions for that here.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:55.290
ANDREW STEINTHAL:
I was on PCs.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.920
JACKIE: So thanks, you guys,
so much for coming in.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.880
And happy Friday, everybody.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.040
ANDREW STEINTHAL: Cool,
thanks for having us.
