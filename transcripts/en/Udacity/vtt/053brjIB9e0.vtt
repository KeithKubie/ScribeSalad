00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.120
Let me just wrap up by doing a couple quick things. Earlier

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.190
on when we were talking, you made a kind of offhand comment about,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.210
or maybe I made an offhand comment, about the fact that because we're

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.750
doing this little prisoners dilemma thing, we have this sort of wall here,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.710
we're going to end up in this little bad place. Right? With

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.590
the -6, -6. And there was this kind of notion that what if

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.510
we could hear each other, would that make a difference? And the answer

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.190
was, no not really, because who ever goes first is going to lose.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.290
And if you try to get people to go at the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.210
same time, well in some sense, that's the same thing as having

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.049
a wall and you can't hear each other if you have

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.080
to go at exactly the same time. Right, does that make sense?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.640
&gt;&gt; I didn't quite understand. Why does the first, person who goes first lose?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.840
&gt;&gt; Because if I find out whether you're going to cooperate or

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.010
defect, then I will just then do the thing that makes sense.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.440
So if you do anything but defect, I will defect, and

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.500
then I will win and you will lose. So whoever goes first

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.920
runs the risk of the other person screwing them over. So.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.750
&gt;&gt; I see. Unless, unless that person defects.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.680
&gt;&gt; Right, but if that person defects, the other person's going to defect.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.770
&gt;&gt; Right, so, but you don't lose any more than you would have.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.660
&gt;&gt; That's true, and, but you still end up in this kind of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.130
unfortunate place. So, one question you might

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.340
have there is, yeah, but that's just

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.230
because you can only do this once. But what if you could do this

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.510
twice? So, let's imagine were, going to be in this situation today and then were

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.870
going to be in this situation tomorrow because, you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.970
know, you keep leading me astray. So, whatever happens today

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.620
I can use as information, for what I might

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.410
do tomorrow. So, if I decide to go ahead and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.700
cooperate this time. And you defect, and I know

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.260
you're the kind of person who defects, and so when

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.160
we're in this situation again, I am definitely going to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.810
defect. So maybe in that situation, it's in your best

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.760
interest to go ahead and cooperate

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.910
because, then we can keep coopoerating together,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.560
and in the end it sort of works out. So maybe this notion

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.213
of not just playing prisoners' dilemma

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.540
once, But playing prisoner's dilemma twice or

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.380
three times, or four times, or five times, might come to a different result.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems plausible. I mean, I could

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.880
imagine saying to you though this channel in the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.920
wall, something that says, you know, cooperate with me

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.940
or, yeah, right, or I will, I will stop cooperating

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.389
with you. And so, you get more reward if you, if you cooperate with me.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.910
&gt;&gt; Right. So, my question to you is,

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.000
what does happen exactly in this set? Where

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.550
I have two versions, two consecutive games of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.640
prisoner's dilemma to play. What am I going to do?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.450
&gt;&gt; Ok, well now I mean, we could turn this into a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.780
game, right? I mean, that's what you were teaching us how to do.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.302
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:31.860
&gt;&gt; So you, so now the game has four,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.730
well, I don't know. So one way to do it is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.540
to say A has a choice to make on the first

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.620
step, and [COUGH] that could be cooperate or defect, and then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.480
the second step could be cooperate or defect, so there's four possibilities.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.180
&gt;&gt; B has the same four possibilities. But maybe we can actually

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.080
have A be responsive to B. So A has two things to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.150
do on the first step and then two things to do on

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.120
the second step for each thing that B did on the first

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.400
step, for a total of eight combinations.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.470
&gt;&gt; Right. You could do that. [CROSSTALK]

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.300
&gt;&gt; So if we made an eight by eight matrix, we should be able to solve it.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.750
&gt;&gt; Right. So, that's pretty easy to do.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.260
You just kind of draw an eight by eight

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.330
matrix in, you know, that many dimensions. And

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.810
it, you know, you end up right here.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.890
&gt;&gt; I wasn't thinking about that many dimensions. I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.140
just thought, like the normal kind of matrix. But, okay.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.220
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see, I see, I see.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.655
&gt;&gt; I mean its eight by eight, so that's kind

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:22.170
of a pain. Right. So, its 64 cells and, I guess,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.890
I guess we don't want to fill that out.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you know. We could fill that out. But, I'm going to help

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.530
you out here by pointing out You know what? It's not going to make a difference.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.470
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.360
&gt;&gt; So, here. Let's see if I can walk

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.970
you through why it's not going to make a difference.
