00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.180
-I hope to answer a question
about my trajectory.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.550
And how is it that
the same writer

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.890
could get from the image on the
left to the image on the right?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.980
That's Alex Gray's
memorable painting

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.490
of the stoned ape theory
of how psilocybin led

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.670
to human self-consciousness.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.240
The path of someone's
career really only

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.920
appears as a path in retrospect.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.220
This is something we
construct after the fact.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.840
I really didn't know
where I was going.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.700
The path of a writer
is not like the path

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.740
of a doctor or a lawyer.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.770
It's really crooked.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.200
And so this appears--
something you figure out

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.180
after the fact, which only goes
to show that you don't know

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.240
on this journey
which books you'll

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.510
be grateful to have packed,
or where your curiosity will

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.290
take you.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.080
And this is another
writing lesson

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.930
I learned along the way, which
is that questions are more

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.780
important than answers, and
that a good question can drive

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.940
a book from beginning
to end in a way

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.640
that answers don't always.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.530
That questions lead to
more propulsive writing,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.820
more suspenseful writing.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.260
It becomes, indeed,
the difference

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.030
between a speech and
a detective story.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.260
So the question in this
book was what I think

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.296
of as the bumblebee question.

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:33.670
And that was, it
occurred to me--

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.980
you saw me planting
those weird looking--

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.430
I was planting potatoes.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.710
And one day I was planting
potatoes in my garden,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.120
and it was a beautiful day,
May in Northwest Connecticut.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.110
And while I was
planning potatoes,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.660
the bees were just avidly
going after this apple tree

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.860
that was in spectacular bloom.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.932
And gardening doesn't take
up that much mental space.

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:57.640
That's one of the
things I like about it.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.830
And it occurred to
me, I wonder what I

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.310
have in common with those bees?

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.190
Look what they're doing.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.481
They think they're getting
the best of this arrangement

00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:12.130
with the blossoms, that
they're getting the nectar.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.190
But in fact, they're being
manipulated by those flowers

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.100
to pay a visit, in
order to advance

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.610
the interests of the plant.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.440
So who's in charge?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.790
Are the bees in charge
or the plant in charge?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910
And I thought, well, is
that happening to me too?

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.500
I'm planting this kind of potato
and not that kind of potato.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.541
I've ordered these seeds.

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.460
They've been shipped
across the country.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.620
So are these plants
in some sense,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.860
these domesticated
plants, manipulating us?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.170
And that question kind
of launched that book.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.420
And that we too are in this
co-evolutionary relationship,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.850
one where we think we're
in charge, but in fact,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.080
very often we're
being manipulated.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.020
We are not the only
subject in nature.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.990
We think of everything
else as an object,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.040
but many other species are
acting on us-- that nature

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.330
is really this dance of desire.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.100
And so, I looked at human desire
as a fact of natural history,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.620
shaping evolution just like
the climate does, or the soil,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.620
or the preferences
of pollinators.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.210
I looked at four cases,
apple for the desire

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.390
of sweetness, tulips and
beauty, potatoes-control,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.730
and cannabis-intoxication.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.530
And I tried to use
each of these plants

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.350
as mirrors in which we can
learn things about ourselves.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.430
Because in the same way
you can look at a flower

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.010
and know precisely what a
bee or another pollinator

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.720
regards as beautiful
or aromatic,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.150
you can look at the plants
that have evolved with us

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.300
and understand a lot about us.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.370
And that was the basic
conceit of the book.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.360
So among the desires I looked
at in Botany of Desire,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.040
and I'm returning to in
this current project,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.270
was this very curious
universal human desire

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.230
to change consciousness,
the existence of which

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.890
has been a very
good thing indeed

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.810
if you are cannabis sativa
or opium somniferum,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.610
or a fungus like
psiloscybe cubensis.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.990
One of the things
plants do to animals,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.040
for their own
purposes, is drug them.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.029
It was recently discovered
that the nectar of many plants

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.459
contains caffeine.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.589
Why?

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.920
To make the pollinators
better at their jobs,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.390
make them work harder,
just as it does for us.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.000
And there are many examples like
that of plants drugging animals

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.290
to get things out of them.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.920
So the evolutionary
success of these plants

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.402
depends on that desire of us,
our abiding desire to change

00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:44.610
the texture of consciousness.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.670
So you sort of see, you see
that my real interest, food

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.140
is a very important interest.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.700
But I'm also very interested
in this engagement with nature

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.490
that happens on our
plates, and in our homes.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.130
And it's always happening.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.496
It's happening right now with
the microbes in your gut.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.910
And bringing this
to light has always

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.150
been what I'm interested
in doing as a writer.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.040
And this issue of altered
states of consciousness,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.800
it's another thing that
plants do for us, or mushrooms

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.300
do for us.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.940
And why?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.500
What's in it for them?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.240
What's in it for us?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.620
And what turned me on to this
as a subject that was time to do

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.270
it was news of a
remarkable trial that

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.320
took place at Johns
Hopkins and was published

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.470
in the Journal of
Psychopharmacology

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.030
with this decidedly
idiosyncratic title,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.760
"Psilocybin Can Occasion
Mystical Type Experiences

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.850
Having Substantial and Sustained
Personal Meaning and Spiritual

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.070
Significance."

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.240
Doesn't sound like a
pharmacology magazine.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.280
And what they discovered was
that a high dose of psilocybin

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.170
could be used to safely
and reliably occasion

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.130
a mystical experience, which of
course the psychologists have

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.900
defined and have their
are seven-point scale.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.610
That the participants
rank these experiences

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.480
as among the most
meaningful in their lives,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.030
comparable to the birth of a
child or the death of a parent.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.970
That was striking.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.980
And the volunteers who
had the most complete

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.210
mystical experienced,
by the scale,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.910
showed significant
and lasting increases

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.560
in their well-being and
their openness to experience.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.850
And openness is one of the
five criteria of personality

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.700
that psychologists measure.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.570
And this quality of openness
is a predictor of tolerance,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.680
aesthetics, creativity.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.630
And its effect
lasted for months.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.010
Now, I have never had
a mystical experience.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.290
I may in fact be
spiritually retarded.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.630
But suddenly, I was extremely
curious about the fact

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.860
that a mushroom could
have such an impact

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.927
on not only one's personality
but one's metaphysics.

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:52.510
Because a lot of
these people were not

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.999
religious to begin with.

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.040
So what does that have to
do with nature or food?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.750
Well, you've probably guessed.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.210
The chemical responsible
for these amazing affects

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.170
in our brains is
produced by a mushroom.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.310
How did that happen?

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.425
And it's kind of a food.

00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:15.370
The Aztecs called the
magic mushroom teonanacatl,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.900
the food of the gods.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.330
But it's more of a sacramental
food than a staple.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.621
Still, something from nature
that, ingested, changes us.

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:25.120
So what does it do
for the mushroom?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.650
Well, the curious
thing about it is

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.390
that the chemical, the
psilocybin or the psilocin,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.100
is not found in the mycelium,
the underground part, which

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.020
is the central part of a
mushroom, the part that's

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.820
the organism.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.560
The fruiting body, the mushroom,
is the only part that has it.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.250
And that's the part
that the mushroom

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.470
doesn't mind having
eaten, and doesn't depend.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.830
So it has something to
do with animals, who

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.700
apparently like psilocybin too.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.570
And in our own time, it's
been spread around the world

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.385
by the human interest
in these drugs.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.410
So anyway, I'm looking at
the natural history of it,

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.820
and I was very surprised to
learn that if you go back

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.130
pre-1965 that there was kind
of a golden age of research

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.770
into both psilocybin and LSD.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.670
And a lot of it, of
course, took place here.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.690
But what happened here
with Timothy Leary

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.310
was the end of this process.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.870
He kind of screwed it
up, and for reasons

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.020
that make some sense.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:41.070
But before his antics, there had
been a thousand peer reviewed

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.780
studies of LSD in
the literature,

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.000
and 40,000 research
subjects going back

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.590
to 1950-- and very
suggestive results

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.970
that it could be useful
for people who were dying,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.180
and addicts, and
obsessives and depressives.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.360
And all this research
is now coming back.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.820
The government has eased up
and is allowing scientists

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.380
to study it.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.460
And my guess is this
scientific Renaissance

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.940
is going to teach us
some extraordinary things

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.090
about consciousness
and the mind,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.900
about spirituality and
religion, about creativity,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.460
and about this handful
of mental disorders

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.670
it's being used to treat.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.120
The most interesting
and the first

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.220
was giving psilocybin
to people who

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.270
have terminal cancer diagnoses.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.000
And this study was done
at NYU and Hopkins,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.220
and I spent a lot of time
interviewing the people who

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.370
had this experience.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.560
And it was fascinating.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.200
But I want to end by reading one
passage about one character who

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.970
I actually never got
to meet because he

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.240
died before I had a chance.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.220
But his name was Patrick Metas.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.240
One of the most
compelling stories I heard

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.420
was from a volunteer in
the psilocybin cancer

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.600
trial I never got to meet.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.460
He died before I knew his name.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.290
However, I did get
to know him slightly

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.240
through the words of
his wife and therapist,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.390
and the remarkable
pages of his journal.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.060
Everybody is asked to keep a
journal of their experience.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.930
Patrick Metas was a
New York journalist

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.940
diagnosed with a cancer
of the bile ducts

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.710
that had spread to his lungs.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.960
As it happens, Patrick
was almost exactly my age

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.730
and had first read
about the psilocybin

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.330
trials in the same New
York Times article I did.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.640
Though he had never before
taken a psychedelic,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.050
he immediately called NYU to
volunteer in their psilocybin

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.150
trials.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.980
The experience he
had there would

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.570
change his life and his death.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.860
I first heard Patrick's
story from Tony Bossis,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.010
one of the investigators in
the psilocybin trial at NYU.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.340
Tony, a bearded, bearish
psychologist in his mid 50s,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.960
had been so deeply moved
by his work with Patrick

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.070
that he obtained permission
from his wife Lisa

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.450
to share his story with me.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.660
I need to share with you
just a bit of it now,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.520
since Patrick's experience
of learning how to die,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.070
what Socrates said is the most
important work we have to do,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.250
is one of the reasons
I decided to embark

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.510
on my own psychedelic
journey of research.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.380
In the course of four
or five hours spent

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.000
laying on a couch in the
treatment room at NYU,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.530
wearing eye shades and
listening through headphones

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.040
to a specially curated playlist,
Patrick underwent a journey

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.750
by turns wrenching and ecstatic.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.010
In his journal, he likened
the start of that journey

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.460
to the launch of
the space shuttle.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.110
That's me hunting for
psilocybin mushrooms,

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.830
but this is what I
want to show you.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.300
This is the setup in
the treatment room.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.120
And that's the
therapist, the guide,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.660
and that's the volunteer.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.644
And that's the spiritual
tchotchkes they put all around.

00:11:34.644 --> 00:11:36.810
In his journal, he likened
the start of that journey

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.250
to the launch of the space
shuttle, a physically-- this

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.480
is his words-- a physically
violent and rather clunky

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.870
liftoff, which
eventually gave way

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.590
to the blissful serenity
of weightlessness.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.200
Early on, he re-experienced
the trauma of his birth,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.180
but as both mother and child.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.330
Tony's session notes say Patrick
drew his knees up to his chest,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.540
convulsed, and when it was
over began to cry softly,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.410
saying twice, birth and death is
a lot of work, birth and death

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.360
is a lot of work.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.660
And then, oh God, it all
makes sense now, so simple,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.210
so beautiful.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.770
Metas also took an
internal tour of his body.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.910
I went into my lungs
and saw two spots.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.180
They were no big
deal, Metas recalled.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.180
I was being told without words
not to worry about the cancer.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.050
It's minor in the
scheme of things,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.620
simply an imperfection
of your humanity.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.300
Then he experienced what he
described as a brief death.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.080
I approached what appeared to
be a very sharp, pointed piece

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.020
of stainless steel.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.180
It had a razor
blade quality to it.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.000
I continued up the apex of
this shiny metal object,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.710
and as I arrived, I had
a choice, to look or not

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.080
look over the edge and
into the infinite abyss,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.890
the vastness of the universe,
the eye of everything,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.110
of nothing.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.640
I was hesitant,
but not frightened.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.600
I wanted to go all in but felt
that if I did I would possibly

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.400
leave my body permanently.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.680
Death from this life.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.850
But it was not a
difficult decision.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.590
I knew there was much
more for me here.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.420
Telling his guide
about the decision,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.380
he explained that he was not
ready to jump off and leave

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.000
Lisa, his wife.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.510
When Lisa came to pick
him up after the session,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.990
Patrick looked as though
he'd run a marathon,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.310
but also radiant.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.060
He told her he had
touched the face of God.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.720
Patrick lived for 17 months
after his psychedelic journey,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.580
and Lisa reports
he was a changed

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.960
man, able to enjoy
the time remaining

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.260
to him free from the
debilitating fear

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.110
and anxiety that had
plagued him before.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.080
The siege of his terror
had been lifted somehow.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.260
We still had our
arguments, Lisa recalls,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.220
but Patrick had a
sense of patience

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.220
he had never had before.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.240
And with me he had real
joy about things, she said.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.070
It was as if he had been
relieved of the duty of caring

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.100
about the details of life.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.840
Now it was all about
being with people,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.770
enjoying his sandwich and
the walk on the promenade.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.950
It was as if we lived
a lifetime in a year.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.740
Metas spent his good days
walking around the city.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.720
They lived in Brooklyn.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.400
He would walk everywhere, try
every restaurant for lunch,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.640
and tell me about all these
great places he discovered.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.910
But his good days
got fewer and fewer.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.600
In March 2012, he
decided to stop chemo.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.940
He didn't want to
die, she said, but I

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.880
think he just decided that this
was not how he wanted to live.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.870
In April, his lungs
failing, Metas

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.440
wound up back in the hospital.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.020
He gathered everyone together,
this is his wife's words,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.770
and said good bye, and
explained that this

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.650
is how he wanted to die.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.080
He had a very conscious death.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.100
Metas's equanimity
in the face of death

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.660
exerted a powerful influence on
everyone around him, Lisa said.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.350
And his room in the palliative
care unit at Mount Sinai

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.410
became a center of
gravity in the hospital.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.860
Everyone, she said, the
nurses and the doctors,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.320
wanted to hang out in our room.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.210
They just didn't want to leave.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.430
When Tony Bossis visited
Metas the week before he died,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.290
he was struck by
Metas's serenity.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.530
Patrick was consoling me.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.060
He said his biggest sadness
was leaving his wife,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.460
but he was not afraid.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.280
It is very strange to feel
something akin to envy

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.390
for someone dying of cancer.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.750
But hearing Patrick's
story, I realized

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.380
this man had acquired that
essential knowledge so few

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.020
of us ever will,
which is how to die

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.920
with equanimity, without fear.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.430
Somehow I didn't
completely understand

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.600
the mystical experience he
had in that room at NYU,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.650
courtesy of a molecule
produced by a mushroom,

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.140
had showed him how to die.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.320
Thank you very much.
