00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.507
- [Jay] Back in the day there
was a video from Motownphilly.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.743
Remember, A-B-C
B-B-D Boyz 2 Men?

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.078
Remember that? At the
very end of the video,

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
there were five white
guys in front like this.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.583
And it said, coming
soon: Sudden Impact.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.118 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's what we
were telling girls.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.152
We were Sudden Impact.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.821
(dubstep music)

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.739
(growling)

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.015
(breaking glass)

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.283
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.252
- [Ari] Thank you everybody.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.720 align:start size:88% position:13%
So if you don't know,
here's what the show is.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.355 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's just a bunch of
funny people telling like,

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.358
100% true stories.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.460 align:start size:97% position:3%
my friend and yours, mister
Jay Larson everybody.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.628
Let him hear it.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.231
(audience cheering and clapping)

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.332
- [Jay] Before I get into
my story, I'm gonna tell

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.967 align:start size:84% position:16%
you guys the
pre-story to the story

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.670 align:start size:94% position:6%
that I'm gonna tell, okay?
So what happened was,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.871
when I was a sophomore...

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
Freshman in high
school going on into

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.507
my sophomore year
in high school.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.376
it was the summer. Me
and my buddies decided

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.711
how do we spice up the summer
time? You know what I mean?

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.848
And we all decided how
'bout we rent a limousine

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:24.050
and we go up to Hampton Beach?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.752
Hampton Beach is this
divey little beach

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
in New Hampshire. Guys
drive by in T-tops.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
With like ground
effects and gold chains.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.293 align:start size:84% position:16%
Kinda like this dude
with the glasses.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.628
That's the kind
of vibe up there.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we were gonna go up there
and try and scoop chicks.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.732
That's what we did at that age.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.368 align:start size:97% position:3%
You play games. Video games
like the claw machine,

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.071
get cotton candy, and
try and talk to girls.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.673 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we're like, alright.
10 of us, we'll get

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.242
a six pass. That's
short for passenger.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.344 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we'll ride up there
in this limousine,

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
but how are we gonna
explain to girls

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.347
why we have a limousine?

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I go, I got an idea.
Why don't we tell 'em

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.718
we're in the band Sudden Impact?

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.587
Anybody know that
band Sudden Impact?

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.821
Of course you don't.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
Of course you don't.
(audience laughs)

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.092 align:start size:97% position:3%
But back in the day, there
was a video from Motownphilly.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.561
Remember, A-B-C
B-B-D Boyz 2 Men?

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.897
Remember that? At the
very end of the video,

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.966 align:start size:88% position:13%
there were five white
guys in front like this.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:16.169
And it said, coming soon:
Sudden Impact. He knows.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.972
(audience laughs)

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.073 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's what we
were telling girls.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.908
We were Sudden Impact.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.379
Because here's the genius.
10 of us, six passenger limo.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.982 align:start position:0%
We break off. So four guys
would go off looking for girls.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.084 align:start size:88% position:13%
Six guys would roll
around as Sudden Impact.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.719 align:start size:84% position:16%
Then two would shuffle
out, two back in.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.755
Another Sudden Impact.
It was so sudden guys.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:39.626
You have no idea how
sudden it really was.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.362
So me and my buddies, we're
out there. We're searching.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.197
I see a girl, I meet
her, we start talking,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.167 align:start size:97% position:3%
we hit it off. I think we
were next to a Q*bert machine.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.368
(audience laughs)

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're vibin', so
we're walking around.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.472
I tell her about Sudden
Impact. She's impressed.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.841
I get her in the limo. We're
driving around in the limo.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.010 align:start position:0%
As we're driving around, I
realize I really like this girl.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.578
I think I'm gonna come
clean about the whole

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.780
Sudden Impact vibe.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.982
Now we got the split window
to the driver right here.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.718
And my friends in the back
with other girls over there.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.955 align:start position:0%
So I say to her, I'm like,
listen. I'm feelin' a vibe here.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.356
I'm not really in Sudden Impact.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.824
And she goes, "No, I know."

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.394 align:start size:97% position:3%
And as I say that, my buddies
down this end of the limo

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:19.032 align:start size:97% position:3%
are all going, (sings
"Motownphilly" by Boyz 2 Men).

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.267
(audience laughs)

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.437
With a hard sell. I
mean, a hard sell.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:26.940 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they sounded horrible,
but every girl's like,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.008
"Oh my gosh, Sudden Impact.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.310 align:start size:84% position:16%
"When are we getting
the cassette?"

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.945
That's how early it was.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.913
(audience laughs)

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.582
Anyway, I hit it
off with this girl.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.084
We vibe, I get her number.
All my buddies, we're all

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
going home. We all
met girls. Great time.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.989 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're excited. We're
freshmen, gonna be sophomores.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.658
On the ride home,
limo breaks down.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.528 align:start size:88% position:13%
Okay. We had to call
our parents on payphones

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.330
because it's a long time ago.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.864
(audience laughs)

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.099
And tell them, hey, gonna
be late. Limo broke down.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.501
Limo broke down. Everyone calls.

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.036
And we all decide as
a group. We're like,

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.205
yo, this is ridiculous. We
paid for this limousine.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
We should get
reimbursed our money

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.943
because the limo broke down.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so all of our were like,
yeah, that's a good idea.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.780
So we go to the guy. Like,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.449
hey man, ya know we think we
should get some money back

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.284
because the limo broke down.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.786
The guys goes, "Talk to
my boss. Can't give you

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:16.923
"any money, but what we can
do is take you out next week

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.424
"and run the whole thing back.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.159
"Get the whole limo
a whole other night,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.461
"come back to Hampton Beach."

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.029
And we were like, done deal.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.766 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
Done deal.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.134
That's were we leave off.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.802
Now I'm gonna give you
the rest of the story.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.405
Which is the B story,
but really the A story.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.274
You get it goatee. He knows...

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.110
(audience laughs)

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
So it's the summer
before my sophomore year

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.981 align:start size:84% position:16%
in high school.
Freshman year's done.

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.916
Okay, I got through it.
We're about to crush it

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.851
in sophomore year.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.052
I'm walkin' up...

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.221
You guys know where I'm going.

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.789
You guys know I'm going
back to Hampton Beach.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.790
You know it.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm walking up to
the center of my town

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.627 align:start size:88% position:13%
because one of the
guys at the pizza place

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
I worked at was gonna
drive me back to

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.163
Hampton Beach. Okay.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.032
So I'm walking though
my town, it's like

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.533
nine o'clock in the morning.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.602
I get a radio for work. I'm
gonna drop it off at work.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.170
And as I'm walkin'
up through town,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.540
a black caravan pulls up
next to me with "Kiss 108"

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start size:97% position:3%
written across the side.
That's the local FM station.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.779
It's really 107.9,
but they go with 108.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.847
It's a little more effective.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.049
Kiss 107 point...

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.052 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't get it.
You don't get that...

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.486
So they go with Kiss 108, okay.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.255
They pull up to
me and the guy...

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.390
There's a guy driving and
the guy in the passenger

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.160
seat is dressed as
a gorilla. Okay.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.761
And they go, "Hey man."

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.064
And I go, hey man.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.133 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they go, "We're
with Kiss 108."

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.069
And I go, yeah man.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.270
(audience laughs)

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
Saw it. Saw it pull
up in the neon.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.808 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they go, "Are you
familiar with the Gorilla

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.776
"in the Morning contest?"

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.378
And I go, yeah man. Of course.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:46.612
Had no idea what it was.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.014
(audience laughs)

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
Just saw a gorilla
sitting in the passenger.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.383
That's all I saw.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.684
And they go, "Okay, so
you know every morning

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
"we give out a
number on the radio

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.388 align:start size:97% position:3%
"and then if we find
people we give you a number

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.357 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to choose between
and either you know it

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.726 align:start size:97% position:3%
"or you guess it and you
can win that dollar amount."

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.127
And I was like, yeah, of course.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.762
No big deal. Let's do it.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:07.133 align:start position:0%
The guy goes, "Okay, the
number's between 3200 and 3600."

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.868
And I was like, 3468.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.538
3468. I was pretty
confident about it.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.906
(audience laughs)

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:14.841
And they go, "Is
that your guess?"

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:15.975
And I go, yeah, that's my guess.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:16.809
And they go, "Okay."

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.044
Pull out the car phone.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.379
Got the cord to
call the station.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.646
Get me on the radio.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.049
As they're calling, a
blue caravan pulls in

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.317
behind this caravan with like

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.985
a little soccer mom in it.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.186
And she starts waving me over.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.688 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I go, hey, I'll
be right back.

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:29.822
And they go, "Whoa, you
can't talk to that woman.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
"You're in the
middle of a contest."

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.091
And I go, that's my aunt.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.860 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's getting
married in two weeks.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they go,
"Alright, go ahead."

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:35.995
(audience laughs)

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.996
Not my aunt.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.599
So I go to the car. I
go, what's goin' on?

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:40.833
What's goin' on?

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.768
She's like, "Are
you in the Gorilla

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:42.435
"in the Morning contest?"

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.703
I go, yeah!

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:44.504
She goes, "Doú you
know the number?"

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:45.304
I go, no, do you?

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.105
She goes, "Yeah!"

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.273
I go, what is it?

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:49.609 align:start size:88% position:13%
She looks at me, pause,
she goes, "3402."

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
I go, boom. Go back
to the caravan.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
They go, "That woman
can't help you."

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:54.480
I'm like, I know
man. You told me.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.515
They're like, "Alright."

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:56.449
Give me the phone. They're like,

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.683
"Okay, you're on the radio."

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.485
The guys goes, "It's
Matty in the Morning."

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:00.820
He runs the morning show.
He's still there today.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.922 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's still doin' it.
(audience laughs)

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.024
And he goes, "Hey Jay, this
is Matty in the Morning."

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.526
And I'm like, hey Matty.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.327 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's a pretty big deal.
It's Matty in the Morning.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.662
(audience laughs)

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.897 align:start size:81% position:19%
And he goes, "Jay,
where you at?"

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.398
And I go, I'm in Stoneham, Mass.

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:14.434
And as I'm on the car phone,

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.435
people are driving by.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.369
This is how small town is.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.570
Honking the horn like, hey!

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.338
I'm like, hey! Like
I'm a celebrity.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.907
(audience laughs)

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes, "You

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.042
"Gorilla in the
Morning contest."

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.510
I'm like, we sure are.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.778 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he goes, "Alright
Jay. You know it's between

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.548
"3200 and 3600. Do
you have a guess?"

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.916
And I go, I sure do.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:30.850
And he goes, "What is it?"

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.118
And I go, 3402.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
In the studio,
they're going nuts.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:39.192
Noise machines, I think
streamers are goin' off.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.627 align:start size:94% position:6%
In the caravan, different
vibe. Different vibe.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.763
(audience laughs)

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:46.032 align:start size:88% position:13%
Driver's pissed. Gorilla
took his head off.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.968 align:start size:81% position:19%
Head's gone.
(audience laughs)

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:53.172
I mean, he's smokin' butts.
Smokin' butts in my face.

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:54.507
They're like, "We told
you that woman couldn't

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.576
"help you. I told you
that. We told you that.

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:57.777
"Didn't we tell him that?"

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.179 align:start size:88% position:13%
The guy's like, "We
told him that." (blows)

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.681
(audience laughs)

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.883
This guy's just an intern.
Who knows what his deal is.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.751
Like he's got any authority.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:08.554
I just look at him, I'm like...

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.089
What do you want me to do man?

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.858
And they go, "Welp, we're
gonna see what Matty says."

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:12.992
And I got a little
attitude, I'm like,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.861
yeah, let's see what Matty says!

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.795
(audience laughs)

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:17.797
I got rapport with Matty.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:18.998
They get Matty on the phone.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
Matty's like, "Listen
Jay, they told me

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.434
"what happened. They
told me that woman

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.369 align:start size:88% position:13%
"helped you. We told
you, it was in the rules

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.572 align:start size:94% position:6%
"you couldn't do it. But,
we did it on the air.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.807
"We're gonna honor the contest.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.275
"We're gonna give
you the money."

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.743 align:start size:94% position:6%
I go, Matty, that's great
man. I appreciate it.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.912
And he goes, "But I
think you should give

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.180
"that woman some money."

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.681
And I go, yeah man.
I cut her in for 50%

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.984
before she even said 3402.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.652
(audience laughs)

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.887
Matty didn't like that so much.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.322
Now Matty's not
a big fan either.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.557 align:start size:84% position:16%
So these guys are
like, "Alright man."

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.058
They hate my guts.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're like, "Alright man,
let's fill out the paperwork."

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.028
I'm like, alright.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.696
Name, address, and
they go, "Alright,

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.398
"what's your social
security number?"

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.834
And I go, uh, I don't know.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:55.735 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they go, "What do
you mean you don't know?"

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.103
I go, I don't know.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.037
And they go, "How old are you?"

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.639
And I go, I'm 14.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.974
And they go, "Dude, you gotta
be 18 to win this contest!"

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.409
(audience laughs)

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.578
And I was like, dude,
I look 18? Alright.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.812
(audience laughs)

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.614
But the woman from the
caravan is still there.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:11.017 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I go, what about
her? Can we use her info?

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.618
They're like, "Yeah,
we'll use her info."

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.855
They get all her
info and so do I.

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.824
Because I called that
woman every single day

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:20.393
for the rest of the
year. Trying to fi--

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.861
You get that money yet?
You get that money yet?

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.663
Do you know what's
going on here, guys?

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:25.431
That's a lot of money.

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:26.599
A lot of money.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
Everyday, she
doesn't have it yet.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.634
Doesn't have it yet.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
Three days before school
starts, she calls me.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.837
She's like, "I got the money."

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was like, boom. I'm
workin' at the pizza place.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.908
Why don't you come up
on Saturday morning

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.510
and you can give me the cash.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.011
She goes, "Okay."

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.580
I'm coming up the stairs,
I remember clear as day.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.548 align:start size:94% position:6%
Coming up the stairs, I
have a stack of dough bins

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.450
above of my head. She comes in.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.985
She's like, "Hey!"

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:49.221 align:start size:97% position:3%
Has a white envelope, sticks
it in my pocket and goes,

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.623
"Have a great school year."

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.224
I'm like, alright, take care.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.492
Drop the dough bins, open it up.

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.028
11 one-hundred dollar bills.

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.931
3402 after taxes. They
kill you with taxes, bro.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.166
(audience laughs)

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.301
2200 after tax, you
gotta split it. Okay.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:06.272
$1100. I'm making 150
bucks every two weeks.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.674
That's like 42 million dollars.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:10.209
(audience laughs)

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.644
To a 14 year old.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.081 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'm pretty
good with my money.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.616
So I called my buddy right away.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.151
And I said I'm off work at
five, what are you doin'?

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.386
He said, "Nothin'."

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.188
I said, perfect. We're
goin' to Marshall's.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.756
Yeah, we're goin' to Marshall's.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.491
(audience laughs)

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:27.827
Daddy needs some school clothes.

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.228
He met me. I filled that...

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:32.431
I was buying things I
didn't even need. Okay.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.166
A yellow suede jacket?
You think you need that?

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.001
No, you don't.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.302
(audience laughs)

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.670
Filled it up. Had
the cart stacked.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.739
Had the blue flag. I'm excited.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.307
Get to the checkout.
I'm giving everything

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.642
to the woman. She's
ringing it through.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.543
She's like, "hmm!" Very
impressed with my money.

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.212
Had it all out.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start size:88% position:13%
As I'm paying, my mother
storms in the back.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
And she goes, "What
are you doing!"

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.283 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I go, I'm gettin'
school clothes!

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.586
And she's like, "That money's
supposed to be for college."

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:54.654
And I go, I need school clothes!

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.055
What's more important?

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.189
Sophomore year, it's a big year.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.758
(audience laughs)

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.226 align:start size:97% position:3%
She goes, "Fine, but I'm
taking the rest of the money."

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.694
I said, fine. Take it.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:06.232 align:start size:97% position:3%
I dropped 368 bucks. At
Marshall's is like 17 grand.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:09.135
(audience laughs)

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.069
First day of school.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.537
You know what I wore?

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.172
Orange silk shirt.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.440
(audience laughs)

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.142
Second day of school...

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:17.643
Green silk shirt.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:18.944
(audience laughs)

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.080 align:start size:84% position:16%
Third day of school,
I can't remember.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.982 align:start size:81% position:19%
But I'm pretty
sure it was fresh.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.418 align:start size:97% position:3%
And that woman saying to me,
'have a good school year'

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
was the understatement
of a lifetime.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.155
I crushed it.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.389
(audience laughs)

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:31.691 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thank you guys so

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.959
