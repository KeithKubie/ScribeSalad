so we're going to talk about the origin

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970
so we're going to talk about the origin
 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.849
so we're going to talk about the origin
the mathematical origins of Tetris

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859
the mathematical origins of Tetris
 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.620
the mathematical origins of Tetris
they're quite well-known computer game

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630
they're quite well-known computer game
 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.580
they're quite well-known computer game
and I thought about this because

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
and I thought about this because
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.039
and I thought about this because
recently I'm on a holiday in Crete as I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
recently I'm on a holiday in Crete as I
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.210
recently I'm on a holiday in Crete as I
was walking down the side all these

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
was walking down the side all these
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.710
was walking down the side all these
people said in kind of Tara's rubbish

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
people said in kind of Tara's rubbish
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779
people said in kind of Tara's rubbish
but there's this guy who's setting these

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
but there's this guy who's setting these
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150
but there's this guy who's setting these
really interesting like math and logic

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
really interesting like math and logic
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.130
really interesting like math and logic
puzzles and click this one here which I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
puzzles and click this one here which I
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.920
puzzles and click this one here which I
bought so this is a puzzle where it is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
bought so this is a puzzle where it is
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589
bought so this is a puzzle where it is
full of these elements here which these

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
full of these elements here which these
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389
full of these elements here which these
are not quite Tetris because Tetris is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
are not quite Tetris because Tetris is
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.959
are not quite Tetris because Tetris is
for squares these have 5 so these are 5

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
for squares these have 5 so these are 5
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119
for squares these have 5 so these are 5
squares so these are all the possible

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
squares so these are all the possible
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190
squares so these are all the possible
ways you can put 5 squares together

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
ways you can put 5 squares together
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.760
ways you can put 5 squares together
apart from this and rather brilliantly

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
apart from this and rather brilliantly
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.869
apart from this and rather brilliantly
so there are 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
so there are 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.450
so there are 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 there are 12 ways you can put 5

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
12 there are 12 ways you can put 5
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.799
12 there are 12 ways you can put 5
squares together and these are all the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
squares together and these are all the
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.279
squares together and these are all the
possible ones and it turns out that you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
possible ones and it turns out that you
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.450
possible ones and it turns out that you
can put them all together and there's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
can put them all together and there's
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889
can put them all together and there's
several ways to do it but they're quite

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
several ways to do it but they're quite
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450
several ways to do it but they're quite
difficult to find you can put them in at

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
difficult to find you can put them in at
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700
difficult to find you can put them in at
the square and all you need extra is the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
the square and all you need extra is the
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939
the square and all you need extra is the
4 by 4 so this is the sort of the runt

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
4 by 4 so this is the sort of the runt
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950
4 by 4 so this is the sort of the runt
of the family well you can do it because

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
of the family well you can do it because
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.450
of the family well you can do it because
you know there are 12 and there are five

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
you know there are 12 and there are five
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.020
you know there are 12 and there are five
of these and so 5 times 12 is what 60

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
of these and so 5 times 12 is what 60
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.640
of these and so 5 times 12 is what 60
yes 60 and 4 is 64 which is 8 by 8 so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
yes 60 and 4 is 64 which is 8 by 8 so
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.840
yes 60 and 4 is 64 which is 8 by 8 so
obviously you know the numbers are going

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
obviously you know the numbers are going
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880
obviously you know the numbers are going
to work and it's just finding it and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
to work and it's just finding it and
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.789
to work and it's just finding it and
again can it work and the reason why I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
again can it work and the reason why I
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.789
again can it work and the reason why I
wanted to buy this is because there is a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
wanted to buy this is because there is a
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.740
wanted to buy this is because there is a
person who is the first person to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
person who is the first person to
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.380
person who is the first person to
discover that you can get all these

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
discover that you can get all these
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780
discover that you can get all these
things with 5 squares and into a biggest

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
things with 5 squares and into a biggest
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600
things with 5 squares and into a biggest

stayed with the son of the French King
at the time it's kind of just sort of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220
at the time it's kind of just sort of
 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.680
at the time it's kind of just sort of
slightly apocryphal history and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
slightly apocryphal history and
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630
slightly apocryphal history and
apparently got into a fight and the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
apparently got into a fight and the
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400
apparently got into a fight and the
fight was over a game of chess because

the British were beating the French
blows were given basically obviously I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
blows were given basically obviously I
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.710
blows were given basically obviously I
started fighting and the chessboard was

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
started fighting and the chessboard was
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.940
started fighting and the chessboard was
quite over the head of someone and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
quite over the head of someone and
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.880
quite over the head of someone and
collapsed into thirteen different pieces

collapsed into thirteen different pieces
and the thirteen different pieces that

and the thirteen different pieces that
 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.920
and the thirteen different pieces that
are drawn in the 1907 canterbury puzzles

are drawn in the 1907 canterbury puzzles
 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.410
are drawn in the 1907 canterbury puzzles
are exactly these pieces and this is the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
are exactly these pieces and this is the
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940
are exactly these pieces and this is the
first time in the mathematical

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
first time in the mathematical
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340
first time in the mathematical
literature that you have the selection

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
literature that you have the selection
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.180
literature that you have the selection
of all the possible shapes that you can

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
of all the possible shapes that you can
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.520
of all the possible shapes that you can
get when you put five or in fact any

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
get when you put five or in fact any
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.000
get when you put five or in fact any
number of squares orthogonal next to

number of squares orthogonal next to
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.800
number of squares orthogonal next to
each other so I think that they've got

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
each other so I think that they've got
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.979

did another puzzle ten years later which

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
did another puzzle ten years later which
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.080
did another puzzle ten years later which
was all about stamps and folding stamps

together and that was the first time

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
together and that was the first time
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360

and starts to classify them and do lots

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
and starts to classify them and do lots
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.199

of maths on them and he starts to call

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
of maths on them and he starts to call
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.670

them polyominoes so the five one are

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680
them polyominoes so the five one are
 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.470
them polyominoes so the five one are
pentominoes and this is the set of the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
pentominoes and this is the set of the
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.229
pentominoes and this is the set of the
five of the 12 pentominoes there are

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239
five of the 12 pentominoes there are
 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.300
five of the 12 pentominoes there are
tetrominoes which are the ones with four

and they're the trial minoes

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250
and they're the trial minoes
 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.860
and they're the trial minoes
and then there's the Domino's - the one

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
