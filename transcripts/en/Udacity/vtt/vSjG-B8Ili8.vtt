00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.950
The sequence diagram and the communication diagram that we've seen aren't

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
particularly designed to deal with synchronization. UML has a separate diagram,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.970
called an activity diagram, designed for this purpose.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.640
In this diagram it's a variant of a state machine in which.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.310
Multiple states may be simultaneously active. That is have their own threads of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.539
control. This activity diagrams are derived from petri nets.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.600
Petri net diagrams that have been around for many years. In the diagrams trans,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.660
transitions are typically triggered by activity completion.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.380
That is you finished with one state. Rather than by external events. You can

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.190
use these diagrams to model workflows, process synchronization, and concurrency.
