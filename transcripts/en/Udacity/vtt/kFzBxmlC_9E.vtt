00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.230
So we have seen that in cycle 13 this instruction commits.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.260
It commits by depositing the value of four into register R2.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.080
Looking at the ROB entry for R2 to see whether it points to it, and

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.280
it does. And thus we make the entry in the RAT point to the register file, and

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.660
freeing the ROB entry. Now we will consider what happens in cycle 14.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.260
This instruction would write the result in cycle 16. This instruction is an add,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.670
it executes in 13 and writes the result in 14.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.120
The question for you is, does the RAT,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.470
any entry change? So for example, if you believe that the RAT entry for

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.100
R1 is going to change, the write R1 here. So which RAT entry

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.710
changes as the result of writing this value for ROB6 instruction?
