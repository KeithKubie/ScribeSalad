00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.580
- Good evening.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.260
Welcome.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.850
My name is Hisa Kuriyama.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.620
I'm the Faculty Director for
the Humanities at the Radcliffe

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.180
Institute.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.310
And it's my great pleasure to
welcome you and congratulate

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.240
you for being here.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.330
This is an event in the
series of the Roosevelt poetry

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.960
readings, which is an endowed
event at the Radcliffe

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.470
Institute, and an event which
brings poets of recognized

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.810
stature to Harvard.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.940
It's an event that was endowed
by a Radcliffe alumni who

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.190
was herself a poet.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.160
And in past years,
we've basically

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
featured one major poet.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.110
But this year, you're in luck.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.910
We have four wonderful poets.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.810
And giving you poetry not
only in English, but also

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.410
in French and Italian as well.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.310
It's an event--

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.540
I don't know; how many of
you were here last evening?

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.220
Were any?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.090
A few of you.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.140
So a few of you got a treat,
a foretaste of today's event.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.770
But today's event is one which
is sponsored in collaboration

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.210
with The Fellowship Program
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.370
And along with a wonderful event
which occurred last evening,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.470
which featured our poets--

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.470
also some recorded poets--

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.110
and a wonderful
musical performance

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.330
from a genius composer
from whom you'll

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.280
hear in just a few moments.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.590
And one of the themes of both
today's event, as you can see,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.230
and of the concert last night
was the theme of rootedness.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.460
The exploration of the theme
of home, of lost discovery,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.390
finding connections.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.960
And all of which
are related to one

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.940
of the major themes
of the Radcliffe

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.050
at present, which is the theme
of citizenship and belonging.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.690
So this evening, we have
four wonderful poets.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.610
And I'm going to just
briefly introduce

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.020
our biographies in the order
in which they will be speaking.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.920
Our first speaker will be--

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.150
or meter reciter--
will be Elisa Biagini,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.780
who lives in Florence after
having taught and studied

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.570
in the United States
for several years.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.980
Her poems have been published
in Italian and American reviews

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.280
and anthologies, and
she has published

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.240
seven poetry collections,
some bilingual, including--

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.460
I'm sorry, my Italian
is nonexistent--

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.184
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.070
--and The Guest in the Wood.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.950
Her poems have been translated
into many languages,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.010
and she teaches at NYU Florence.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.530
Our second poet is from
Jamaica, Shara McCallum,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.580
and she is the author
of five books of poetry,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.340
including Madwoman, which
won the 2013 OCM Bocas

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.620
Prize for Caribbean Poetry and
the 2018 Sheila Margaret Motton

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.420
Book Prize.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.750
Her work has been translated
into several languages

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.060
and has led to a Witter
Bynner Fellowship--

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.450
I should know this;
Witter Bynner--

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.370
from the US Library of Congress,
and a Poetry Fellowship

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.220
from the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.890
Shara McCallum is an English
professor at Penn State.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.420
Our third poet is
Irene Gayraud, who

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.510
was born in Sete,
(FRENCH ACCENT) France--

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.310
France, sorry-- In 1984.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.820
Wow.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.610
OK.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.430
And has published
three books of poetry.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.980
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.720
She has two books forthcoming.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.810
The poetry collection
[SPEAKING FRENCH],,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.470
and her first novel,
[SPEAKING FRENCH],,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.360
which the title is so great.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.710
I really want to read this.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.640
Her study of music has led
her to explore and experience

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.580
the relationship between
music and poetry,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.800
and to collaborate
with several composers.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.310
She is an assistant professor
of Comparative Literature

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.770
at the Sorbonne.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.030
And our fourth poet--

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:23.950
yes-- is Evie Shockley, who is
the author of semiautomatic,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.310
which was the finalist,
or a finalist,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.240
for the Pulitzer Prize and
the LA Times Book Prize,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.410
and winner of the 2013
Hurston/Wright Legacy Award.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.290
She's published four other
collections of poetry,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.550
including the new black, which
won the Hurston/Wright Legacy

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.410
Award in 2012.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.080
A critical study,
Renegade Politics--

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.540
Black Aesthetics and
Formal Innovation

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.000
in African American Poetry.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.205
And her honors also include the
2015 Stephen Henderson Award,

00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:01.270
and the 2012 Holmes
National Poetry Prize.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.480
And she's spending this
academic year as a fellow

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.190
here at the Radcliffe
Institute for advanced study.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.880
And she normally teaches
as Professor of English

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.060
at Rutgers University,
New Brunswick.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.330
So at this point, I'd like to
welcome the genius composer

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.480
from last year-- last evening's
concert, Marta Gentilucci.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.890
One of the things that you'll
notice about all these poems,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.240
and I think these poets--

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.060
and I think that was very much
in evidence last evening--

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.030
is that in addition to
speaking to this theme

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.810
is that they all share
this wonderful musicality.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.840
And so that even if you
don't understand Italian,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.420
or even if you
don't understand, I

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.837
think you'll be
able to understand

00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:54.960
a lot by the sheer language,
or the sheer communicative

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.620
power of the music.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.604
So with that, I'd like to
turn over to Marta Gentilucci.

00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:06.586
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:09.568
- Thank you.

00:07:09.568 --> 00:07:13.840
So I would pass on the
genius, but I am a composer.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.680
So thank you.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.860
And I would like to say a couple
of words about my research

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.270
here at Radcliffe, because I'm
a fellow here, and my work.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.880
So that is the composition of
a canzoniere-- a song cycle.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.430
So looking at the
political and social events

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.070
of the recent years,
years of many changes

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.460
and displacement of
people all over the globe,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.620
I needed to
re-examine, to question

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.720
my own sense of belonging.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.180
My own roots as a person and as
a composer, a female composer.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.430
Then for me, the most
direct way to navigate

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.530
these social changes
and these questions

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.990
has been to start from
and take to the simple,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.930
and at the same
time, complex fact

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.440
that I am a woman
and a composer.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.610
So my research is very
personal, and at the same time,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.880
I hope is not just about me.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.800
Central to the song
cycle, together

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.590
with several elements
of my musical research

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.070
and my recent work on the
voice, is the exploration

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.160
of the feminine
universe's many facets.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.090
The focus is on the experience
of the words seen and perceived

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.400
by the female body.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.370
That is one of the reasons
why I decided to work

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.650
with female living poets.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.900
I wanted to interact with
the creation of the text.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.470
I want to be fully
connected with the voices

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.890
and with the eyes of the
present time, even when it

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.390
is uncomfortable, partially
understood, or digested.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.360
In the past month, then, I have
been finding and collecting

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.860
material that tells stories of
other women and their songs.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.350
This heterogeneous
corpus of text

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.110
will be a part of
my compositions.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.370
In a way, they will be, I
would say, my musical roots.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.400
And the songs will be presented
as an independent sets

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.590
of pieces, but in
the future, they

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:17.740
will be performed as
an entire song cycle.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.100
One specific encounter
here at Radcliffe

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.370
has been the turning
point for my project.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.090
Evie Shockley, also a
Radcliffe fellow this year.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.430
The discussion we had and her
generosity opened new horizons.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.000
She introduced me to other
American female poets

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.060
who she believed could bring
an important contribution

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.700
to my project on
roads and belonging.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.590
And they have greatly.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.430
And one of them that is
here is Shara McCallum.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:53.560
Tonight, here, there is also
the Italian poet Elisa Biagini.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.470
And in a way, she is
also a root for me,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:03.130
because our work together began
almost, I think, 10 years ago.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.960
And there is also the
new root, Irene Gayraud.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.360
So a French composer
and new encounter.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.930
And in a way, it's connected
to my new home, France.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.330
And to conclude, I
really would like

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.480
to say a special thanks
to Sean O'Donnell.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.900
So I did it yesterday and
I want to do it also today

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.410
because he has been
really precious.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.970
Because it's thanks
to him that today--

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.550
he made it possible
today, four of the poets

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.020
that I'm working with are here.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.420
And his curiosity, openness is
listening to my musical ideas.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.100
His vision and trust have been
an invaluable contribution

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.860
to my research.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.170
So thank you very much, Sean.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.730
And enjoy the evening.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.336
And we will start
with Elisa Biagini.

00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:56.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.800
- OK.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.520
I have very old fashioned
thing to tell me

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.020
where I'm supposed to stop.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.270
And I want to--
thanks for being here,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.860
and thank you for
having me here.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.830
It's such an honor to be here.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.760
And to read under a tree is
something that I really like.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.100
It would be fun if we
had a different weather

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.210
to actually do it outside.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.810
But not now.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.320
Not at all.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.150
This is traumatic enough.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.950
So yesterday, whoever was here
listened to some fragments

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.320
from this series that
I wrote recently,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.450
will be published
in Italy next year

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.080
and in the US in a written
journal as well next year,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.410
of this Alternating Current.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.240
That's from Mary
Shelley's diary.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.670
You heard the Italian
yesterday, so you'll

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.712
have some handouts there.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.587
You have the English,
but I want to read some

00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:50.900
of the fragments in English.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.300
And then a couple of
poems are poems in Italian

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.930
so that you get both the--

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.790
yesterday was very
much about sound.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.740
Today is about sound, but, you
know, meaning imagery as well.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.590
So in this book, I
kind of investigate

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.952
the nature of electricity.

00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:09.410
And there are
different characters,

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.700
and one is Mary Shelley.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.117
You all know the story, so I
don't have to tell the story.

00:12:13.117 --> 00:12:16.820
Think about referring
to such huge figures.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.400
And the idea was this.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.670
Mary Wollstonecraft died after
giving birth to Mary Shelley.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.550
Why not regenerate
who generated you?

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.310
So the fragments of Alternating
Current from Mary Shelley's

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.640
diary are about her
figuring out the way

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.650
how bringing her
mother back to life.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.810
So forget about all
these men doing things.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.580
You know, a doctor
making a man figure.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.080
No.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.168
It's actually her
saying, wait a second.

00:12:41.168 --> 00:12:41.960
I've learned a lot.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.010
Let me try this out.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.720
So I will read a few
fragments from these

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.240
as if they were taken from
the pages of her diary.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.000
You will excuse my accent.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.560
You have to deal with that.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.280
"A lightning bolt,
a contraction.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.850
Bullet-like rain has been
battering us for days.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.180
The treetops converge
to many electrons here.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.050
Your memory fumes engulfs
like fog to windows.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.530
At a table for hours,
there is a sort

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.060
of tremor of plates
around my wrist.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.930
My sleeve is a
curtain for the blood.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.620
Outside, the color
is winter unleashed.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.335
You come back between
clouds and turf.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.380
It is dark like
inside of a crater

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.660
as you rise up, a
shadow from my truth.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.250
And on the threshold of my
leap, you acquire weight,

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.370
fall onto the center
of the page, open up.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.620
The winds and the
voices, wasps in a jar.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.520
The others crowd around by
the wand, ear, and table,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.980
uncluttered for our encounter.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.020
We are birds fleeing the
cold by heading north

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.980
where the wind carries
away saliva and syllables.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.715
They have made it here to
this glass numbed by breath.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.430
I've seen frog's tissue.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.320
A head come back to life.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.470
Where is the electric tongue
that gives voice and gaze

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.790
to your melancholic flesh?

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.830
In this wide darkness,
I've gathered

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.000
dirt in my pockets, electrons
under my fingernails.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.555
You grow larger, embrace
the roots at my years.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.910
To be here is to step
on our own shadows,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.410
even if far off I see the
lava under the claws of earth.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.500
It has the color of cloud
that reflects the gaze

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.450
of a knife between two pages.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.960
My eye listens to the
morning fingernail.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.320
And in this nest of nerves,
the wind that wakes me

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.020
is the caller of
a rhubarb's talk.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.950
Slow is putting one foot
in front of the other.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.630
At night, in the
forest of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.430
it resounds like solar flares
on the surface of the sun.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.820
My synapses sizzle
as the world thins.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.040
Now they are so
thin that they allow

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.760
me a seeing as silent as
a bone, and finding you

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.525
in the cold glass of the mirror.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.850
Water stays descended
without touching,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.550
leaves counted without
seeing the trees,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.785
glasses clean with carbon paper,
words shaken off my sleeves.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.770
The sky's black and
blue as I gather up

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.150
the pieces for your return,
shipment to a foreign country.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.810
Your breath has been kept
in a vase in expectation.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.230
From the blurry threshold,
you come closer.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.860
You up to now without a world.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.420
The shadows are useless, the
light space without walls.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.170
What marvel rises
up to my mind when

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.200
I graze the tendon, the
bone of your finger,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.750
the sinew on the windowsill?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:30.170
The path is made of
husks, fire, bread, milk.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.900
There are words
left in the fire.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.780
The suitors are Braille.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.360
Eyes the distance between
my memory and your breath."

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.240
Two more poems, because I want
to take space for the others.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.750
This one is from
this collection,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.830
The Guest in the Wood.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:58.440
They came out in 2013.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.970
I'll read both the Italian and
English version of the poems.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.040
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:25.880
"You show me your wounds,
like a soldier, your battle

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.000
against another you
consuming your eyes,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.040
bones, skin, who cut
your tendons a while ago,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.152
the cord that holds you,
diver who wants to resurface."

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.910
And today, I had the pleasure
to see Emily Dickinson's room.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.380
I'm quite a fanatic.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.330
And the last collection came
out in the US a couple of years

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.930
ago.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.400
One section is
dedicated to Emily,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.530
and is now kind of a
member of the family.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.780
Sort of like, you know,
grand-grandmother or something

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.060
like that.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.910
Actually, the book in the first
section is about Paul Celan,

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.980
and I read some
fragments yesterday.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.230
The central section is about
my grandfather, the third

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.147
about Emily Dickinson.

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:13.680
So it is indeed part of
the family at this point.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.520
And the section is called
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]----

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.640
"with ink-stained feet
photographs-- a dialogue

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.410
with Emily Dickinson."

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.250
I basically imagine myself
seated in a corner in her room

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.370
in Amherst, even though the
real stuff is here at Harvard.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.570
You know that.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.450
The table, and the chair,
and all the little objects.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.990
And kind of observing
what she was doing.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.060
But when I was done
with this section,

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.788
actually, I thought I loved
these two people so much

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:43.080
Paul Celan and Emily Dickinson.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.940
What about having them meet?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.140
Something, obviously,
given they were born

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.630
in completely different times.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.390
But who cares?

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.120
That's my book, so
I do what I want.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.820
And therefore I have them meet.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.010
So the title is actually
in English, also.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.860
The Italian poem is "Impatient
of the Fewest Words."

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.310
and that's taken from
a letter that Susan.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.070
You know, the-- everybody
knows who Susan is in the life

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.750
of Emily Dickinson,
I have to say--

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.790
and sent to Emily
saying, "you're

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.020
impatient of fewest words."

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.240
And that really belongs
also to me as well.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.730
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.170
"Standing on the threshold,
my eye in your hand,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.560
your tongue on my ear
so we know one another

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.370
by touching each other,
because my eye is grainy

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:56.230
from the strain, your tongue
is still sand-papered.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.860
If the board gives way,
if the voice flounders,

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.350
right here in the air is the
word branch that holds us up."

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.658
Thank you.

00:20:06.658 --> 00:20:09.592
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.080
- Good afternoon.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.840
I'm really honored,
thankful to be here reading

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.690
with these wonderful poets.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.600
Marta, thank you for
bringing us all together.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.770
And thanks to everybody--

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.990
Sean and everyone at
the Radcliffe Institute

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.240
for making this possible.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.283
I'm going to read five
poems, and I'm not

00:20:37.283 --> 00:20:39.200
going to say anything
about them because we're

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.825
going to have this
great chance to have

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:43.280
a conversation afterward,
other than that I

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.040
hope they speak to this theme.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.550
I'll begin with a poem
from the place of my birth

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.160
which I've just come back from.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.850
Actually right
before coming here.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.770
"Psalm for Kingston."

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.580
If I forget thee, oh Jerusalem.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.080
Psalm 137.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.000
City of Jack Mandora?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.950
Me no choose none.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.040
Of Anancy prevailing
over a mongoose

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.770
by the rat, puss, and dog.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:21.200
Anancy, saved by his wits
in the midst of chaos

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.170
and against all odds.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:29.390
Of all the big boy stories
told by peacock-strutting boys,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.950
hush-hush, but loud enough
to be heard by everyone

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.440
passing by the yard.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.760
City of market women at
half way tree with baskets

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.950
atop their heads, and planted
in front of their laps,

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.910
squatting or standing
with arms akimbo,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.110
su-suing with one another,
clucking their tongues,

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:58.160
calling in voices of pure sugar.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.330
Come, dudu.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.030
See the pretty bag
I have for you.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.320
Then kissing their teeth
when you saunter off.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.020
City of school
children in uniforms

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.315
playing dandy shandy and brown
girl in the ring, (SINGING)

00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:15.560
tra, la la, la la, (NORMAL
VOICE) eating bun and cheese

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.050
and bulla and
mango, juice sticky

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.340
and running down their chins,
bodies arced in laughter,

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.700
mouths agape, heads thrown back.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.500
City of old men with roomy
eyes, crouched in doorways

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.570
on verandas, paring knives
in hand, carving wood pipes

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.610
or peeling sugar cane.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:44.000
Of younger men pushing carts
of oranges and roasted peanuts,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.740
calling out as they walk
the streets and night

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:55.730
draws near; of coconut
vendors with machete in hand.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:01.970
City where power cuts left
everyone in sudden dark,

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:08.390
where the kerosene lamp's blue
flame wavered on kitchen walls,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.980
where empty bellies
could not be filled.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.840
Where no eggs, no
milk, no beef today,

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:25.370
echoed in shantytowns, around
corners, down alleyways.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.290
City where Marley
sang (SINGING) 'jah

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.470
would never give the
power to a bald head'

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.650
while the bald heads reigned.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:41.060
Where my parents chanted
down Babylon, 'fire!

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:41.870
Burn!

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.560
Ja!

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.910
Rastafari!

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:50.360
Selassie I.' Where they
paid weekly dues saving

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.780
for our passages back to
Africa, while in their beds,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:04.310
my grandparents slept
fitfully, dreaming of America.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:10.150
City that lives under a
long, memoried sun, where

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.870
the gunmen of my
childhood are today's

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:19.640
dons, ruling
neighborhoods as fiefdoms,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:27.140
where violence and beauty
still lie down together.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.660
City of my birth,
if I forget thee,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:41.000
who will I be singing the Lord's
song in this strange land?"

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:46.970
"Dear History."

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.030
"I could tell when my
parents stopped believing.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.140
Marcus, Marley, Manley.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.770
Their gods deserted
them, leaving

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.150
little to wring
between their hands.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:10.850
After a time,
revolution's light dims.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.620
Ideals get exchanged
for smaller needs.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.020
Milk and bread.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.070
The crumbs of peace.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.130
In the final days,
everyone tried

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.520
to explain what had gone wrong.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.980
Politicians said tourists
would no longer come.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.300
Mummy and daddy said
slavery was the root.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.190
Granny said it was the
youth, killing each other,

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.880
running wild in the streets.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.370
The night before she and
papa left for America,

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.110
I prayed in the dark
of my room, but feared

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:04.170
my words could no longer
spiral up to something beyond.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.050
'We will come back for you.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.980
I promise,' they'd said.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:16.730
When piece by piece
my family fled,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:23.930
we didn't see the bargain
being struck to live in a place

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.785
where memory becomes
a synonym for home."

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.300
"Memory."

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.150
"I bruise the way the most
secreted, most tender part

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:50.630
of a thigh exposed
purples then blues.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:58.960
No spit shine shoes, I'm dirt
you can't wash from your feet.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:06.850
Wherever you go, know I'm
the wind accosting the trees,

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.540
the howling night of your sea.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.970
Try to leave me, I'll
pin you between a rock

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:22.940
and a hard place,
will hunt you even

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:30.330
as you erase your tracks with
the tail ends of your skirt.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:36.690
You think I am gristle,
begging to be chewed?

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.970
No, my love.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:47.110
I am bone; rather, the sound
bone makes when it snaps.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:52.195
That ditty lingering
in you like ruin."

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:06.710
Lucea, Jamaica, at the
Hanover Infirmary, 1996."

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.690
"What I saw there,
I could not carry.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:16.140
She lifted a sheet
revealing her abscess.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.530
I was a young woman
then, traveling

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.280
towards some notion of home.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:30.210
But a sheet had been lifted,
and abscess revealed.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.320
I'd hoped I might
meet myself, traveled

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.840
home with some notion of finding
the girl I was in braids.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.990
I'd hoped to meet
this younger off

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.380
on a coastal road
bridging towns,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.160
but another girl
with braided hair

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.770
waved each morning I arrived.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:02.810
A crossroad between
tourist towns, Lucea,

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.930
is a place you could miss.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:13.160
Arriving each morning, I
thought if I looked enough,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:19.540
I'd find not an idea,
but the place itself.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.720
Coming to a part of my
country I didn't know,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:32.720
I looked long to find liquid
pools in opened flesh,

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.250
coming to a country
I thought I knew.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:43.340
A young woman, liquid
and open-fleshed.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.955
I saw there what I
could not carry."

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.170
And this is the last
poem I will read,

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:58.300
which is in honor of
Marta, who also once

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.265
was a singer as I. "She."

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.030
"She could sing the
blue out of water.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.730
She could sing the
meat off a bone.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.730
She could sing the
fire out of burning.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.940
She could sing a
body out of home.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.180
She could sing the eye
out of a hurricane.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.930
She could sing the fox
right out its hole.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.530
She could sing the
devil from the details.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.520
She could sing the
lonely from a soul.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.940
She could sing a
lesson in a yardstick.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.600
She could sing the
duppy out of night.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.680
She could sing the
shoeless out of homesick.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.730
She could sing a
wrong out of a right.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.360
She could sing the
prickle from the nettle.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.440
She could sing the
sorrow out of stone.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.460
She could sing the
tender from the bitter.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.630
She could sing the
never out of gone."

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.722
Thank you.

00:31:01.722 --> 00:31:05.166
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.850
- Bonjour.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.330
First of all, I would like
to thank Marta and Sean

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.560
for having me here.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.950
It's a great, great pleasure,
and a great honor too.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.870
And then I would also like
to thank Cécile Guédon,

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.400
who is here and who
translated the texts you have

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.000
on the handout.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.120
And she did really a huge,
huge work to do that.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.240
So I really thank her for that.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.850
I always start with a free verse
poem called [SPEAKING FRENCH],,

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.585
which means something like
"The Narrow Hunting Trail."

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.170
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:32.460
And then I would like to
read four very short prose

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.510
poems that are very different.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:40.290
It's between prose
poetry and flash fiction,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.480
or flash poetical
fiction in a way.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.370
And they are also
translated by Cecile.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.720
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.190
Thank you.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.557
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.300
- Good afternoon.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.090
Evening.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.170
I'm so delighted to be here.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.040
I want to just echo
the thanks to Marta,

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.590
the appreciation of my
fellow or sister poets,

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:48.490
and thanks to Sean
and Hisa for making

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:53.230
this space available to
us and the hospitality.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.400
Thank you all for coming.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.070
I am going to read three poems.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:05.560
And two of them are from my
second book, the new black,

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.510
which was a lot for
me about belonging

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.580
and those kinds of issues.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.390
And this first poem is
from that collection.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.130
It is called "my life as china."

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.665
"I was imported.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.850
I was soft in the
hills where they found

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.150
me shining in a private dark.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.410
I absorbed fire and became fact.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.450
I was fragile.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:47.460
I incorporated burnt cattle
bones' powdered remains.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.650
Ashes to ashes.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:56.400
I was baptized in heat,
fed on destruction.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.970
I was not destroyer,
was not destroyed.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.590
I vitrified.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.580
None of me was the same.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.730
I was many.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.800
How can I say this.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.220
I was domesticated,
trusted, treasured.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.860
I was translucent but not clear.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.590
Put me to your lips.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.670
I will not give.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.880
I will give you what
you have given me."

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.690
This next poem is much
newer, more recent.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:46.930
I spent a semester in Paris
a couple of years ago now.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:54.940
And I love that city very
much, but I found myself,

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:00.460
as I think many of us
do, looking for a way

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.590
to feel at home
in a place where I

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.550
was spending nearly six months.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:13.480
This poem was inspired in part
by that search, you might say,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.350
and by some of the
work of Cy Twombly,

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:22.660
an American-born artist whose
work was being exhibited

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:28.200
at Centre Pompidou that spring.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.810
So there are three
sections to the poem,

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:37.490
and each section is titled after
one of Twombly's paintings.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.360
"ex patria."

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.625
50 days at iliam,
shield of achilles.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.080
a mythology begins
with a question

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.290
like who are we, where are
we, what is red, why paint,

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.220
why me, lord, why?

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.390
a person who knows all
the answers can only

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:08.490
borrow a mythology like
i'm king midas or i'm god.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.840
a painter can take a
mythology and remake it

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.710
so that it answers a new
question like romare bearden

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.670
asking odysseus who are my we?

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:26.490
and cy twombly asking
achilles why are we still you?

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.480
painting the eye of
the storm on a shield.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.510
cutting the trickster out
of black and blue paper

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.040
and lashing him with glue to
the mast of his last ship.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.060
The journey always rough,
some miserable god under land,

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.480
under sea always
looking for company.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.450
people always succumbing.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.960
the hero is the one who
comes home even if it's

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.110
by process of elimination.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.970
A playwright can
make a mythology ask

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.160
what's wrong with this song?

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.390
like suzan-lori parks asking
ulysses about coming home from

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:09.190
the war so why are you a hero
and why are you still coming

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.370
home from a war and
women die in wars, too,

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.440
even if it's not the
expected death and--

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.130
wait that's not a
question but it's still

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.180
a mythology if that's the
only thing she knows for sure.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.870
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:38.110
A mythology can ask why
is autumn so beautiful

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.090
and why is winter,
blight-stricken

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.160
as it is, so arresting?

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.660
a mythology, as opposed
to a young person,

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.010
can find autumn and winter
much more striking than summer,

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.360
sun-bleached summer, so
legibly the scene of happiness

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.070
that nothing else can
really happen there.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.320
A mythology can see
the blood in spring,

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.260
the stages of growth a
kind of violence the body

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.680
does to itself, it will
never be this way again

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.070
and yet it can't get on to
the next moment fast enough.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.270
A mythology can
ask why does spring

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.820
throw its arms out
with abandon even

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.980
when it's abandoning itself?

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.040
a mythology can
ask why is winter

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.910
so much greener than spring
even clouded in white?

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:32.960
the icicles trail as far down
the evergreens as they can

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.020
but they don't keep the wind
from brushing snow and sun

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.400
across the mountain
on the same day.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.330
The inferno is always
burning, men and women

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.490
going up in flames.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:51.070
a poet can ask, why do
daughters grow up by going down?

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.760
like rita dove asking
persephone you think he's hot?

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.110
[MUFFLED LAUGHTER FROM CROWD]

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.960
All the while, autumn is
answering the question

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.090
about gorgeous rotting.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:06.730
just magenta, green,
brown, pink, yellow, red,

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.940
violet, flying off the
mythological canvas.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:17.430
untitled-- a gathering of time.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:22.510
a mythology of time can
ask a subtle question.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.670
a sky blue can gather white
clouds right before your eyes,

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.680
holding them by
threads of paint,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.660
stringing us along so
that we miss the purple.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:37.780
the thunder is always farther
away than the whitening.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.100
a poet can grab a
mythology of time

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.370
that takes place over the dead
bodies of letter after letter.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:48.870
the tongue lays them to rest
and they cover, are covered by,

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.690
a sheet that falls
far from the tree.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.230
a cy twombly can
leave for rome at 29

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.050
and still die an
american artist,

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.550
a hero who doesn't come home.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.890
A photographer can
snag a mythology

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:09.810
to turn her back on it,
wearing black and steady gazing

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.570
from a question that's a
statement of the only thing

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:16.680
she knows for sure
like carrie mae weems

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.620
asking institutions
like the british museum

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:24.260
when and where I enter
showing that she's the answer.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.620
contrast, stark.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.340
the steps leading
in leading away.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.510
bright but heavy.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.600
the poet can ask a
mythology a question

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.560
like what is black in
the museums of paris?

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.450
and again the mythology
pierces the clouds.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:49.520
it thunders so loud but
so late that by then we've

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.580
forgotten we saw the lightning.

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.380
we saw the lightning.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.750
we saw it and it
was not subtle."

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:05.160
And I will close
with another poem

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.050
from the new black that is
in the form called a ghazal.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.800
It so directly related
to the theme of our event

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.280
that I won't say anything
about the content of the poem,

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.970
but you should know
that the form the ghazal

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:25.170
is an ancient Persian form.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:30.240
It's written in couplets, and
what connects the couplets is

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.050
a repeating refrain at
the end of each couplet. .

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.090
The first line of
the poem tells you

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.700
what the refrain is
going to be, and it

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.290
locks in at the end
of the second line.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.980
And so after that, at
the end of every couplet,

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.810
you know what's coming.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.130
Now the ancient Persian crowds--

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.410
and I do mean crowds--

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:52.140
who would come to
poetry readings

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.320
would figure out the
refrain and, you know,

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.530
sort of shout it along or
say it along with the poet

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.860
at the end of the refrain.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.250
I don't know if this audience
is up to that standard.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.040
But the form invites
it, I want to say.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.350
It's called "where
you are planted."

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:17.120
"he's high as a georgia
pine, my father'd

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.970
say, half laughing,
southern trees as measure,

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:29.410
metaphor, highways lined with
kudzu-covered southern trees.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:33.040
fuchsia, lavender,
white, light pink,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.090
purple; crepe myrtle
bouquets burst open

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.390
on sturdy branches
of skin-smooth bark.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.790
my favorite southern trees.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.680
one hundred degrees
in the shade;

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.970
we settle into still pools
of humidity moss-dark,

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.800
beneath live oaks.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.995
southern heat makes us
grateful for southern trees.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.560
The maples in our front
yard flew in spring

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.660
on helicopter wings.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.110
in fall, we splashed
in colored leaves,

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:15.780
but never sought sap from
these southern trees.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.180
frankly, my dear,
that's a magnolia,

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:23.850
i'd tell her, fingering the deep
green, nearly plastic leaves,

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:27.060
amazed how little a
northern girl knows

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.040
about southern trees.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.760
I've never forgotten
the charred bitter fruit

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.760
of holiday's
poplars, nor will i;

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.200
it's part of what makes
me evie; i grew up

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.920
in the shadow of
southern trees."

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.480
Thank you.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:05.360
- So this is just the beginning.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.470
I'm sure that we'll
all read these--

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:14.170
I know that I will read
all these wonderful poets,

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.950
but also read them
with a new ear.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.650
Having actually heard
the voices I think really

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:24.070
helps us to appreciate
the written word

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.320
with new resonances.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:32.200
So we're going to have a panel
discussion with our poets led

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:39.490
by Professor Lisa New,
who is a Paul M. Cabot

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.500
professor of American
Literature here

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.080
at Harvard where
she teaches courses

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.210
in American literature
from the Puritans

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:49.480
through the present day.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.500
Professor New is the
author of many books.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.720
starting from The
Regenerative Lyric--

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.950
Theology and Innovation
in American Poetry to more

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.980
recently New England Beyond
Criticism-- a Defense

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.610
of America's First Literature.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:11.650
But she's also active in many
other ways in disseminating

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:13.250
appreciation of poetry.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.840
She's the creator and
host of Poetry in America

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.990
and the director of
Verse Video Education.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.770
Since 2013, she has been
producing educational materials

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.410
on American poetry
for tens of thousands

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:31.000
of global learners of all ages.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.670
New created Poetry in America,
a public television series

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.780
and educational initiative,
to encourage engagement

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.230
with American poetry
beyond academic audiences.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.590
Guest interpreters have
included Shaquille O'Neal,

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:52.580
Bono, Cynthia Nixon, Joe Biden,
Herbie Hancock, Elena Kagan,

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:58.810
Robert Pinsky, Sonia Sanchez,
Bill Clinton, John McCain, Liam

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:05.240
Lee, Samantha Power, exonerated
prisoners, clergy members,

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:10.040
pickup basketball players, young
campers at a wildlife preserve,

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.640
and many more.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.630
So with that, I'd like
to welcome Professor

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.408
New and our wonderful poets.

00:55:17.408 --> 00:55:21.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.760
- Hello, everyone.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:46.940
Thank you all for that
beautiful, stimulating, rich

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.950
set of readings.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:53.630
Readings that indeed, as I
heard your voices and the music

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:57.350
in your voices, I
found myself trying

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:01.540
to alter the question I came
in with having just read you.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:07.190
But I think I'll see
if you alter it for me.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:12.320
What I found remarkable about
the four of you as poets

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:16.550
is that it seemed like you'd
been kind of conferring;

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:21.230
that you had some of
the same things in mind.

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:25.670
And we can talk in a
moment about if that's so

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.200
or why that might be.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.120
Is it our historical moment?

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.460
Is it-- what is it?

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:35.120
But I think that the
question it feels

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:40.180
to me that all of your poems
allow us to think about

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:45.100
is, who is an I?

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.740
What is an I?

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:56.800
And who is this voice that
travels between places

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:05.050
and may or may not have an
identity or a coherence?

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.010
There's a question
that I found myself

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:13.990
asking with this
theme in mind that

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.460
had to do with whether
rootedness is the same as

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.160
wholeness.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:20.660
Right?

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:29.940
in all of your poems,
there was a tendency

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.590
for things to blow to
smithereens, as we would say;

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:40.800
to fragment, like parts
of a Frankenstein monster,

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:47.190
or like a child detaching
from its mother.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:55.570
And so I've just thrown
some smithereens out there.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.180
And so here's a
question, and maybe you

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.810
could begin to talk among
yourselves and with all of us

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:08.730
with lines of your own
or each others' in mind.

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:13.820
And the question is, is
wholeness or rootedness

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:20.510
or integrity even a value
that you and your own,

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.440
each of your poetic
practices, are working toward?

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:36.530
It seems like there is a
story of separation that's

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:42.230
being told with as much
intention and passion

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:45.140
as a story of rootedness.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.740
And I'm wondering-- and I'm
going like this, but not

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.150
like this.

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:58.070
But this relationship of the
integral and the put-together

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:02.840
to the rooted and
maybe physical place

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.295
is one that I'm
feeling all of you

00:59:05.295 --> 00:59:10.250
as poets raising for
us, without being

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.980
too pedantic about this issue.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.110
It's a shame to use
a word like issue

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.720
after all the music we've heard.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.560
Yes.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.060
Would you--

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.880
- Sure, I can begin.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.190
I love what-- thank
you for that question

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.950
and for your work for
poetry, by the way.

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:32.840
I like the idea that rootedness
and wholeness are not the same.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.790
And that's at least
partly coming out

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.440
of my own experience
of it, which

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.560
is I have a great
longing for rootedness.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.200
And at the same time, it's
a dishonest one for me

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:42.860
personally.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.590
And I've seen that
from early in my life,

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:48.470
that fracturing of cells
has been so apparent for me

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.030
and made apparent to me by
forces such as migration.

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:54.860
I was even introduced
tonight-- thank you

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.740
for your introduction-- as
a Jamaican poet and then

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.270
an American poet.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:03.140
And those are both true, and
they also are not always--

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.300
they do not always
make me feel whole.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.160
So I will just
start there and say

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.380
there's a lot of reasons
for it in my autobiography.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.797
But then that's made me really
interested in this question

01:00:11.797 --> 01:00:14.990
of the self, and
the I, and how we

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.030
are trying to make
cohere something that

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.800
is at times for
each of us-- mine

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.710
are personal to my
racial identity.

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.750
You know, my immigration
and national identity.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.890
But I think that's the
sort of position many of us

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.250
face that this I is
something we're constantly

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.570
trying to make whole.

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:37.100
And also, if we're honest,
recognizing its disintegration

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.970
and its propensity
for plurality.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.010
And so I think
that tension for me

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.580
is what is most interesting
in art to explore.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.720
In life, I do have to
do grocery shopping.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.040
So I do have to be a
person who pushes a cart.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.850
But in the poem,
I like to expose

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.680
the fragments and the ruptures.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.200
And that's interesting
to me-- in the search

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.730
for wholeness at the same time.

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:07.610
- When you say pushing a
cart, so many of these poems

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:10.310
are also in motion.

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:12.860
And in motion and
in motions that

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:17.630
aren't necessarily simply the
motion away from a lost home,

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.980
but might be other
kinds of motion.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.810
I'm thinking about an arrow.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.965
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:24.965 --> 01:01:28.490
- A narrow trail, and
a mythological heroine,

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:33.770
or a sufferer of some kind
who makes their way along.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:34.550
- Yeah, exactly.

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:40.430
For me, how to be rooted in
the world go through movement.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:46.590
Like, the body is moving;
following a track or something.

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:49.130
And I totally agree with
this idea of tension,

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:53.900
because for me what I
seek is to participate

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.520
in a way in the world.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.810
To be rooted in the world.

01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:00.320
And there is big
tension between nature

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.040
and very contemporary
and everyday life world.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.390
That's why I'm looking for
images that can be raw,

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.600
and mythological, and
these kind of images,

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.060
but mixed all the time with very
contemporary and everyday life

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.290
images.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.180
That's why, for
example in the poem

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:27.260
I read, there is this image
of a woman who is just sitting

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:31.820
on a tree trunk eaten by
insects, and at the same time,

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.050
she just putting her
glass on the table.

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:39.800
So at the same time she
is in the forest in a very

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.410
archaic place, and
at the same time

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:50.270
she's in a home using very
everyday life objects.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.300
And for me, these
contracts, this tension

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:59.330
is a way to be participating
in the world in a more

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.330
complete way, I would say.

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.620
- Where motion--

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.320
- With motion, or every
time there is movements.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.660
Like, I get up.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.380
I sit.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.855
I play something.

01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:13.040
- And woman don't
get to be the movers.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.660
You know, traditionally.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.200
I mean, you give us a
mythological heroine

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.790
with weapons, and--

01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:20.410
I think

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.240
- But there is
also contrast here,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.930
because she's wearing
weapons, but at the same time,

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:28.220
she's wounded.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:28.720
- Yes.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.350
- So it's more complicated than
just wearing weapons and being

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.370
offensive.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.710
She will never
use these weapons.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.620
She will just at some
point leave them.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.420
In another poem, she
leaves them on the soil,

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.310
and they just mixed
with the soil.

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:46.190
And it's a way to be
participating in the world

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.570
also.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.640
So she's wounded and
she's wearing weapons.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.120
It's a kind of contrast.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.900
- And you too, Evie
are-- we're coming back--

01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:04.570
you too, Evie, are taking us via
Cy Twombly to the mythological.

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:05.310
- Yeah.

01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:12.380
I resonate so much with what
Irene was saying about tension

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.120
and what Shara was
saying about plurality.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:24.010
I think that my way of trying
to create a sense of home

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:30.400
in that space of
being abroad and not

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.460
seeing the things that
I'm familiar with as even

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.900
small signs of home--

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:44.210
it was to gather and
to collect people,

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:51.440
and to see African-American
culture as a myth making

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.890
practice, in a sense.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:59.800
And that I could participate in
that even from away from home,

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.850
a home that's
already complicated

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:06.800
as "my life in china" is
meant to indicate as well.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:13.190
But that sense of being
able to create something

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:20.360
with the fragments, and for
it to be enough at any moment,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.470
and to have to recreate
it at a different moment.

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.970
- It's quite
extraordinary thinking

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:31.160
about the that image of
the china that is being

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.160
burnt into its strength, right?

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.360
Vitrified.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:36.980
Vitrified?

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.930
Is that the-- right.

01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:44.090
And the way that resonates
with Irene's description

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:54.710
of a weapon-begirded heroine who
is also wounded and borne down.

01:05:54.710 --> 01:06:01.280
And that-- so we've been talking
about tensions, and double,

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.190
and doublenesses.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.140
And I was thinking you,
Elisa-- it's very rare

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.305
I get to sit with an Elisa who
has the exact same spelling.

01:06:09.305 --> 01:06:11.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.245
A kinship.

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:22.230
I was, as Evie was talking
about being in Paris,

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:26.000
I was thinking about you
visiting Emily Dickinson's

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.730
house in Amherst.

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:34.050
And about-- you both
make visits to artists.

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:42.470
To artists' homes, artists
whose own blown-to-smithereens

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:46.250
tendencies may resonate with.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.800
So would you talk, Elisa,
a little bit maybe about--

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.300
- Yeah.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:55.310
I agree also with what Shara
was saying about the many I's

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.040
kind of swarming like bees.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.405
And also true time.

01:06:59.405 --> 01:07:01.780
It wasn't just a matter of
space in different locations--

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.310
- Many eyes-- I'm sorry--

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.020
many I's.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.520
- Yes.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.090
The pronoun I.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:05.715
- You're right.

01:07:05.715 --> 01:07:09.010
The eyes swarming like
bees were really cool, too.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:11.820
So OK.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.220
This eye.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:13.880
- Absolutely.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.240
But also true, history.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.740
So this whole idea that Emily
Dickinson and Paul Celan meet,

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.600
and that I'm there with them.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.900
So they're all part of
one huge I-- capital.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.470
- And I, that is,
the I made out, the I

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.070
who goes to make you the poet?

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.340
- Yeah, exactly.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.510
Being there.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:35.600
And also, this idea
of the vertically, I

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.560
like it very much.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.080
Looking for the
roots of identity.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.970
You have this one poem.

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:43.890
My grandfather,
his name was Dante.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.545
So obviously, you have--

01:07:45.545 --> 01:07:47.680
and I come from
Florence, so you have

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.520
to deal with that eventually.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.990
And he worked in--

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.810
he was actually a technician,
but he worked in a mine.

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:56.930
So the whole idea of going
down looking for the roots.

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:57.898
So it came.

01:07:57.898 --> 01:07:58.940
It wasn't a silver plate.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.590
I could not not write that poem.

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:01.710
It had to be written.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.242
And it's in here.

01:08:03.242 --> 01:08:04.450
So that was very interesting.

01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:07.955
But then that's my very specific
history of a specific Dante,

01:08:07.955 --> 01:08:09.200
a very specific Eliza.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.340
But wait a second.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.860
I'm telling also another story.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.090
I'm telling a story about
looking for specific words.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:14.923
I'm telling a story.

01:08:14.923 --> 01:08:18.050
So it's not just
me is just sharing

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:22.250
this with the kind of search
that every writer does

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.430
for the precise term
that we're talking about.

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:29.300
Something being a precise
sound, a precise world.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.109
- And also, the precise place.

01:08:31.109 --> 01:08:38.840
I mean, we've been talking
about movement and disintegral

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.680
motions.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:46.609
But all of your poetries, all of
all of your poems that we heard

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:48.560
referred-- almost, anyway--

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.479
refer to particular places.

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:53.510
Homelands.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:58.700
Particular kinds of loss that
we're certainly aware of today,

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.810
as the whole world seems to be
on the move with its backpack

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:07.750
and its flu and
its broken bones.

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:14.569
And does-- could we
talk a little bit more

01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:17.540
concretely about place?

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.270
Because we've been
having a conversation

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:24.770
that's about selfhood
as it's composing itself

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:29.840
and decomposing in a
Frankenstein-y kind of way.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:39.010
And yet, there are real claims
that home makes on us for truth

01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:41.450
telling of various kinds.

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:42.029
- Yeah.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:46.060
I actually am thinking
right now about--

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.640
you mentioned at the beginning
it seemed like we had

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.250
conferred, which we hadn't.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:55.750
But the confluences come
from Marta's project.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:10:00.490
And your question makes
me think about some

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:07.240
of our conversations about what
it means for women specifically

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:14.230
to be uprooted or displaced,
and the kinds of things

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:17.290
that we have at our disposal--

01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:20.650
sometimes
gender-constrained, but not

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.680
ever entirely, right--
but the kinds of things

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.320
that we have at our
disposal to recreate home.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.800
And one of those
things is language.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.220
And for me, the poem of
mine that's specifically

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.380
about where I'm from--

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:39.250
the south; specifically
Tennessee--

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:44.350
the language in that poetry
is as much the sayings

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:48.220
that we have or
even just the accent

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.940
that I can't help
reading it in is so much

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.370
a part of what defines
that place as much

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:58.510
as the trees that are the
visual markers of place

01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:59.950
that we more
readily think about.

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:02.470
- And those accents come
from outside the self.

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:05.238
They are yours as well, Shara.

01:11:05.238 --> 01:11:05.780
- Absolutely.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.660
I couldn't agree more
with Evie's comment

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.610
on how language is
a conveyor of place,

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.500
particularly when
you leave a place.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.630
And so the things
that are idiomatic

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:17.110
or the expressions that
you continue to hear

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:21.070
mark you as from a particular
geographic space, and even

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:23.260
a temporal space, as
you were commenting on.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.115
Because for example, in
the "Song for Kingston,"

01:11:27.115 --> 01:11:28.990
there's a lot of words
I would expect you not

01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:31.420
to know what those words mean.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.330
We're reading in English,
the two of us here.

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:37.510
And yet we're reading in
particular kinds of Englishes.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:42.010
So they are marked by
a sense of rootedness.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.590
And yeah, I think it's
a fascinating thing

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:48.400
to continue to think about how
place is actually real to me,

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.700
and also made not
real in the work.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.003
Once you fix it in the poem--

01:11:54.003 --> 01:11:55.420
and I don't know
if Evie or others

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.830
want to comment on this--

01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:58.330
it seems to me
that, for example,

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.010
the Jamaica that
I am constructing

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.830
in "Song for Kingston,"
that particular Kingston

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:05.750
is a Kingston that doesn't
quite exist anymore.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:08.560
So I just came back
from Kingston right now.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.380
That Kingston is different
than the Kingston of this poem.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.930
So there's something also
that's desirable for me

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.260
as somebody who lost a
homeland to always try

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.090
to be reconstructing in memory.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:21.610
Like "re-membering" the body
that you're putting back

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:25.370
together-- this place,
because I can't go back to it.

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:27.145
And it's sort of
the cliche, right?

01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:28.270
Of course we can't go back.

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:30.460
But poetry is this bridge.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.190
And language is this bridge.

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:36.940
- Which has always
lost its referent.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.000
Oh my gosh, I sound like a
French deconstructionist.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.314
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:43.017
But it's--

01:12:43.017 --> 01:12:44.725
- It's (FRENCH ACCENT)
difference, right?

01:12:44.725 --> 01:12:45.970
It's endless.

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:46.470
Right.

01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:47.827
Yeah.

01:12:47.827 --> 01:12:49.910
That's where my French
ends, so I look at you now.

01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:50.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.300
- I love-- I'm sorry.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.820
I'm so stimulated by this.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.910
You know, maybe it's
my fault. I began

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:59.830
by asking a question about self.

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:03.220
But to be using the
accents that you get,

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.250
and the language to
read to us in French,

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:10.180
and in your English
and Italian, we

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.650
don't get our accents
from ourselves.

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:15.220
We don't get our
languages from ourselves.

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.270
They come-- and they don't
actually come from the ground

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.990
either.

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:24.070
They come from
other human beings

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:28.242
who murmur and shoo-shoo.

01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:29.150
- Right.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.060
- But that resonate in the body.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.070
The body is the place.

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.170
So at least from me,
but I hear it from them

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:37.940
as well, I think the one
element that we have in common--

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.510
obviously, Marta
picked us for a reason.

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:46.150
But it could be there is also
an historical moment coming in.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:47.420
The sense that the fragment--

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:50.500
I mean, since we're
mentioning philosophers,

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.550
think about Benjamin, and the
importance of the fragment

01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:55.840
to reco--

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.670
I give you, present
the fragment,

01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:01.330
and I recreate my personal
little story around it.

01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:03.540
But then you, with the
very same fragment.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.720
But the common element
obviously is the body.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.990
The way the language
and the sound resonates.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:12.250
And the need that you have
to make sense of the world

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:12.790
out there.

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:15.220
So the languages is that.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.560
And this is, regardless
of what we write about,

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:22.450
this is really the urgency
that is behind writing these.

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:24.940
And that creates
the space place.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.370
That is, the room.

01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.720
The page in this specific case.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.650
- I'm thinking Elisa, about
your little postage stamp.

01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:36.680
The sit.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.850
Elisa's poems sit on
the corner of the page.

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:45.590
And the space arcs
around them as if--

01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:48.470
- Because I want the page
to become the room where

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:51.810
the writer and the reader
meet so that we can share

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:54.620
the space here, the
silence, so that something

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.220
new can be created.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.950
- But that longing
and that urgency, too,

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:07.440
is graphically represented on
the page that's just not full.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:07.970
- Yeah.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.840
Exactly.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.160
- I think it's probably
time to open up

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.470
to questions that people have.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:16.210
Questions.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.360
- Feel obliged to make
a comment because, I

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.526
have been named so many times.

01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:29.200
And I think it's incredible for
me, because I don't use word,

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.350
I use sounds.

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:34.470
But today, for the first
time, I heard all you four.

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:40.540
So the implicit connection
that I make with music,

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.430
you made with word.

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:44.530
And so the fact that--

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:50.260
so I see one specific thread
that is really dear to me.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.390
The fact that
movement and fragment.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:16:02.800
So the movement is the way in
which you connect the fragment.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.420
The fragmentation.

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:09.100
And the centrifugal movement,
it doesn't create distraction,

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.170
but it creates connections.

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:13.210
And so I think this
is what fascinated me.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:16.150
So also, my music is
made by fragments.

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:21.550
But the need, the urgency,
is to create a whole.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:24.620
And so what seems to be--
so I agree and disagree

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.780
with the fact that rootedness
and whole are not the same.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.280
But at the same time, they
refer to the same root.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.670
And they are participating
through the movement

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:39.060
to the same thing.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:44.050
So I'm not very good with
words, but I think it's that.

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:48.820
And what fascinated me for
all the poets that are here

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.852
is this ability to have this
singularity in the voice.

01:16:52.852 --> 01:16:55.060
And I was struck by the fact
that for the first time,

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.900
I heard Elisa Biagini saying
her poetry in English.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.470
And I didn't recognized her.

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:05.910
Because for me,
I hear what Chara

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:10.150
was saying that there is
something about identity,

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:14.420
and the identity as Italian
as American-Jamaican,

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.280
or a Tennessee, or French.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.560
So I hear that.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.520
And I identify the
sound with this voice

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.530
that is not just the
meaning of the words,

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.853
but this identity of the sound
that is carried by the voice.

01:17:29.853 --> 01:17:30.895
So it was not a question.

01:17:30.895 --> 01:17:32.680
It was more like a comet.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:39.544
But I wanted to integrate
my experience with you.

01:17:39.544 --> 01:17:42.420
- Thank you.

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.430
- Thank you.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.180
- I'm just going to
also make a comment.

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.160
- I don't think this
is either on so--

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:52.910
- Can you hear me?

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:53.590
- Come more close.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.090
Yes.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:54.640
Much better.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.280
- As a biologist, and when
you're talking about rootedness

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.440
versus wholeness,
I was thinking,

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.150
well, a route starts
as a single trajectory.

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:10.180
But then, of course, it becomes
diverse, and actually becomes

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.320
even larger than the crown.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.870
And I think that's in some ways,
that kind of encompasses what

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:18.190
to me a lot of your poems--

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:20.890
which were all beautiful,
and thank you so much--

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:21.781
we're saying to me.

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:22.864
I just wanted to say that.

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:31.000
- It's hard to ask
questions about poems.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.020
- This is daunting.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.760
It's a somewhat set of
theoretical concepts

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.740
we've been talking
about, so I can imagine

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.480
it would be a little daunting.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.170
Yes, please.

01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:43.640
- I have a pretty big voice,
so I'll try it from here.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.790
Can everyone hear?

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:45.642
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:47.370
- Good.

01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:55.010
I was intrigued by vitrification
through glass, mirror, windows.

01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:58.994
Almost each one of you had
some reference to one of those.

01:18:58.994 --> 01:19:00.986
Glass vitrification.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.978
Maybe you could talk a
little bit about that.

01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:04.472
How [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:10.448 --> 01:19:17.110
- For me, I mean, the image
of glass or verification

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:22.300
has something to do with the
impossibility of being totally

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.020
in the world.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.750
Like, something is resisting.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.230
You can see everything.

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.390
You can almost touch everything.

01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:35.200
But there is kind of borders
that you cannot totally cross.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.080
So I would say this is
why this image comes--

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.460
actually, it comes very
often in my poetry.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.640
Not that much in the
texts I read today,

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.420
but in my other texts
it's almost everywhere.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.690
So that's a nice question
because it's really

01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:55.770
something important for me.

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:57.480
- The metaphor of china--

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:02.160
so not exactly glass, but it--

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.100
I forget how I stumbled
onto it, although it just

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:10.860
feels like one of those
gifts from the universe.

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.750
But what made it
really powerful to work

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:21.360
with for me is the idea that
it's both fragile and strong.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.785
You can have something
glass or vitrified,

01:20:25.785 --> 01:20:30.420
a material like china
for hundreds of years.

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:34.250
Or you can-- one false
move, and it's gone.

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:42.940
And that kind of tension
is something that

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.397
drew me to it in that poem.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.650
- To me, yeah.

01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:52.500
I agree on the image of
specifically of the glass.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.500
And to me, it's also very much
connected with the precision

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.970
we're talking about.

01:20:56.970 --> 01:20:59.820
With the clarity of
vision; the precise word.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.305
Few words, but very precise.

01:21:03.305 --> 01:21:05.930
The kind of light that you get,
for example, with this weather.

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:08.700
So sharp with the snow.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.080
Yes, I'm cold.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.130
I'm insisting that-- no,
but it is very important.

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.450
I come from the country--

01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.090
but now we are all experienced
in traumatic things

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.490
politics-wise--
where there is a lot

01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.100
of talking, a lot of
talking, and it sounds like.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:23.850
And then, oh, no.

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:24.902
You didn't understand me.

01:21:24.902 --> 01:21:25.860
I meant something else.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:26.370
Like, no.

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:28.070
Words should be precise.

01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:30.780
If you are a writer,
you have responsibility.

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.500
Therefore, write-- and even
more if you're a politician.

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.020
So I want precision, clarity.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.209
Few words, but just with weight.

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:46.520
- I wish I had something
to add, but I'm

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.280
unaware of this
image in my work.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.830
So I'm sitting here and I
listen to what they've said,

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:53.767
and I think, that
sounds brilliant.

01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:54.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.400
Yeah.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.820
- But these are also all images
of a fearsome kind of strength.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.850
- Yes.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:08.393
- I'm a little bit afraid
to drink from that tea cup.

01:22:08.393 --> 01:22:10.710
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:14.040
And those honed weapons.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:21.180
And a militant kind of
clarity that I do think

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.190
has something to
do with the fact

01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:27.660
that we have four women
poets at this moment

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:35.940
writing poems that want to
be balanced on a knife edge,

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:40.950
and don't want to
be doctrinaire,

01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:44.130
and don't want to oversimplify.

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:46.800
Thank you very much.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.380
As you say, Elisa,
the public discourse

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:53.130
is so full of both
mush and simplification

01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:58.650
that there is a great
rigor that you all

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:01.770
seem to be striving for,
both by giving us heroines

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:05.700
of rigor and images of--

01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:11.610
that have the sharpness
of Boston weather.

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:15.540
Those of us, we embrace it.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.200
Yes, please.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.430
- Thank you so much
for your readings.

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.210
It's such a pleasure
to listen to you read

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:25.680
and to hear your voices embody
the works that you've written.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.930
My question is actually
about listening,

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:30.690
because I always think that
the difference between artists

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:34.140
like you and someone like
me who is not an artist

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.930
is that you have a secret
about how to listen.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:39.110
And I wonder if you could talk--

01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:41.640
this is a far less
erudite question.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.900
It's a craft question.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.650
I wonder if you
could talk about what

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:50.530
you listen to find your poetry.

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.030
Thank you.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.833
- I can start.

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:57.000
Thank you for that question.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.800
I think it's actually
quite erudite.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.640
I think it's a complex one,
sound, to try to parse,

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.030
and why you follow the
language you follow as a poet.

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:07.810
I trust my ear.

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:11.130
And I trust the ear
that actually speaks,

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.700
that hears what we speak
or any sounds in the world,

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.402
as well as the ear
that's in my mind.

01:24:17.402 --> 01:24:19.110
So I think of those
as two different ways

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.840
that I write poems.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.100
And but yes.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.490
I mentioned the
last poem that Marta

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:29.670
had told me she was the
singer once, as I was.

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:32.640
And I think that that's
why when I'm writing poems,

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.210
I'm also really
attentive to silence too.

01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:38.700
Not just the words,
but how much silence

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.650
there has to be for
those words to carry

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:44.610
the kind of power and weight
that they need to carry.

01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:47.850
And so all of that is
my response that when

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.640
I'm listening,
I'm trying to hear

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.460
all the different possible
silences as well as sounds.

01:24:57.364 --> 01:24:58.820
- Go ahead.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.320
- OK.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:24:59.820
Yeah.

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.570
So thank you for this
question, because I

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:06.740
would say my way to connect
to the world is mostly by ear.

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.710
So I listen everything,
everywhere, all the time.

01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:13.190
Every sound, every voice.

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:18.200
And I love languages and
listen to different languages.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.390
And I try to focus on
sounds like, for example,

01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.610
sounds of the nature
like in my poems.

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:29.360
But also, for example, I
enjoy so much the subway sound

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.510
in Paris, for example.

01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:31.960
It's extremely interesting.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.460
Yeah.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.360
Marta can tell it's
very-- lots of harmonics.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.100
Many interesting things.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.860
And I listen a lot, music.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.590
Lots of kinds of music.

01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:47.510
And it's really feeding
me every day to write.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:53.150
So classical music, but also
jazz, and rock, and even pop

01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:53.730
music.

01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:55.680
And yeah.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.420
And I totally agree with what
you are saying about silence.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:03.350
It's not often you can
listen to the silence.

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:05.300
It's very rare.

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:09.440
But in some places,
you have the chance

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.480
to hear sometimes
almost silence.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.830
Almost.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:20.690
And it helps also
a lot to find how

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:27.870
to settle a word into
the void; the void

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:29.190
or the emptiness of the page.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.540
- I would add to the
things that we listen to

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.840
or that I listen to
that inform my poetry--

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.710
so all of those things,
but also commercials.

01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:51.550
And just the most
degraded language

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:55.300
can become interesting when
you find a way to bring it

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.700
into a different context.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.300
So that's one thing.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.700
And I also think--

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.790
I mean, you also kind of
asked about how to listen.

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.760
And I don't know if you
were here last night,

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.150
but one of the poets who's
not present but is also

01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:13.420
participating in
Marta's project--

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.650
Solmaz Sharif-- she
has a poem that played

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:21.400
in which she has these lines.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.420
"I'm not sad.

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.100
I'm not sad."

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:28.590
And I'm bringing them
up to say that sometimes

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:36.020
what you have to listen for is
the information in the tone,

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.250
even if it's cutting
against the information,

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.560
the semantic information
of the words.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.920
And to just use your own
emotional intelligence

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.220
when you're listening.

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:51.270
- I totally share
all their visions.

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:53.800
I want to try to answer
with a short poem, if I may.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.840
- Please.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.240
- This comes from the
Paul Celan section,

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.790
so it has one line by him.

01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:03.840
"We speak darkness
that sticks to breath.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.880
We speak glass that
makes holes in paper.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.620
Listen with your mouth.

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:12.280
Look in the mirror
with your ear."

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.830
- That's dangerous.

01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:16.210
- Also thank you.

01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:19.630
This is an incredible pleasure.

01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:25.302
I am recalling from the
question of how do you listen--

01:28:25.302 --> 01:28:28.540
oh, hi.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:33.400
I'm recalling a snippet that I
heard when the poet Elizabeth

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.340
Alexander was being interviewed
by Krista Tippett, who

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.480
is a radio host.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.080
And Elizabeth Alexander
was telling over

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:51.460
the story of the rehearsal
for her reading a poem

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.830
at Barack Obama's inauguration.

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:56.670
But that was the next day.

01:28:56.670 --> 01:29:03.270
That day, she was just
practicing and popped off

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:05.880
a poem that she knew
very deeply by Gwendolyn

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:11.920
Brooks about onion frying in the
kitchen, and a set of things.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.230
"kitchenette building."

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.180
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.120
- Yes.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.360
- And Elizabeth
Alexander described

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.250
that she's just sharing this
poem that had become something

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:26.630
she knew so well.

01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:29.530
And at the end of
it, she realized

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:33.770
that the random
people in the mall

01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:41.210
had all stopped and
listened, and were clapping

01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:44.060
And so my question
for you is, has there

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.130
been an incredibly
powerful moment where

01:29:46.130 --> 01:29:47.760
you have read poetry?

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:50.117 --> 01:29:51.075
- It's a good question.

01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:55.050
This one.

01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:56.555
- And the mic was on.

01:29:56.555 --> 01:29:57.805
It was that kind of rehearsal.

01:29:57.805 --> 01:30:00.088
- It was one of those,
like, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:30:00.088 --> 01:30:04.188
And she described it as it
was people who were just

01:30:04.188 --> 01:30:05.992
going about their day.

01:30:05.992 --> 01:30:08.452
But it transformed [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:18.620
- I'm sure every day.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.140
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.280
We write inaugural poems often.

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:26.490
It's hard to answer
that question.

01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:30.090
I mean, I actually really
love reciting poems to people

01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:32.190
that I've memorized
other people's poems.

01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:35.220
So for me, there's a really
great pleasure in doing that.

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.330
And one that's coming to mind,
of course, is Elizabeth's.

01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:40.990
So I would say as
much as anything,

01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:46.740
I get great satisfaction and
joy out of sharing poetry.

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.580
Yeah.

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:50.640
Probably though, in terms of a
sort of transformative reading

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.330
for me, I would have to say the
first time I read in Jamaica.

01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:56.430
And a very unusual
series of events

01:30:56.430 --> 01:31:00.060
occurred in which I reconnected
with my father's family

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:04.740
after not having known
them for 20 years.

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.990
So that poetry could do that
was phenomenal in my life.

01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.420
But I don't know if
that's about the reading

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:16.590
or it's about just the
coincidences of time.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.810
- If I may.

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:23.930
Mine wasn't actually a reading.

01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:27.220
I do also installation
projects with my poems.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.120
And this one, I'd
asked a bunch of people

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.000
to tell me about themselves
through an object.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.310
And I wrote it, the
poem, on a pillowcase.

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:36.890
And then I hang the pillowcase
outside their windows.

01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:39.460
So people during
this small festival

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.460
were given a little map.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.605
So they walk around
this area of Florence,

01:31:42.605 --> 01:31:43.730
look up, and read the poem.

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:45.855
It would be very nice,
because they didn't know me.

01:31:45.855 --> 01:31:47.480
So I could just walk
around and listen

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.522
to what they were saying.

01:31:48.522 --> 01:31:51.080
And that was great because
the people were saying, oh.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:51.960
I like it.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:52.460
It's poetry.

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.060
I usually don't like poetry.

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.140
But this, I like it.

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:54.640
You know?

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.760
And kind of surprised.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.650
So that was very
nice, because it

01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:00.350
wasn't the usual crowd of
people that came for your book

01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:01.100
and such and such.

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:02.225
It was complete unexpected.

01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:05.280
People went to get
their bread, whatever.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.120
And so, walk the
dog, and like, oh.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.120
There's a poem up there.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:08.620
You know?

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.820
And that was very nice to
hide and listen to that.

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:16.330
- Yeah.

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.520
You set a really high
bar with your anecdote.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.610
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:23.110
So nothing like that.

01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:27.160
But I think I feel like I
have a lot of powerful moments

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.580
with poetry being shared.

01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:36.160
That's kind of a through
line in a low bar sense.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:40.750
One that comes to mind
from recent memory--

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:43.840
this is actually
another Paris story.

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:47.800
I read at the American
University there.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:54.830
And there's a poem I wrote
I think most immediately

01:32:54.830 --> 01:33:00.780
in the aftermath of the
Orlando Pulse shooting,

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:08.230
but that drew upon a
visit to a detention

01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:13.000
center in [INAUDIBLE],, just
outside of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.080
And brought that all the
way through a kind of global

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:26.330
look at places that become,
where their very names become

01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:29.780
sort of metonyms for violence.

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.058
Particular violent acts.

01:33:34.890 --> 01:33:39.090
And I've gotten
emotional reading before,

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:47.070
but it was the most, I think,
present, the most clear moment

01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:49.950
when I think
everyone in the room

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:52.700
was just in that same space.

01:33:52.700 --> 01:34:00.440
And that kind of collective
experience is one of the things

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.780
that I think poetry's great at.

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:09.440
- For me, I would say to connect
with what you were saying,

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.790
it was also after the
terrorist attacks in Paris.

01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:17.450
And I was really
feeling very bad.

01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:21.530
And when I'm feeling bad, I
just recite to myself poems.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.660
I know lots of poems.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:26.720
And I just think about texts.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.070
And I thought, OK.

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:30.020
I will have to go
teach tomorrow.

01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.480
And what can I do
with my students

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.040
to discuss what happened and
to comfort them in a way?

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.000
And I said, OK.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.930
What I would do
is to read poetry.

01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:47.570
So I search in all my books
authors that I would think

01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:49.850
could help my students.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.770
And I choose poems.

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:58.920
And I made a handout of maybe 10
poems that I found very strong.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.590
And then in the class, we
discussed what happened,

01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:04.710
and we read these poems.

01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:10.080
And it was just so strong
and so intense to share this.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.990
And many of the
students were crying.

01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:16.860
And they told me then
that he helped a lot,

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.930
because there were
poems speaking

01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:21.630
about violence, and
political violence,

01:35:21.630 --> 01:35:24.720
and all these kind of themes.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.810
So I think this was
the most intense moment

01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:29.070
I had with poetry.

01:35:32.650 --> 01:35:35.710
- So let me take
me the opportunity

01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:37.600
first to thank everybody.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.720
I'm going to ask one more
question, one last question.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.700
But afterwards, there is
a sort of modest reception

01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:49.210
where we can continue
our conversations.

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:52.570
So I'd like to everybody to
linger and speak individually

01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:56.050
with our guests.

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:58.540
The question I have is a
follow up one on question

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:04.090
that was just asked, and
it's about your experience

01:36:04.090 --> 01:36:06.100
performing your poetry.

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:11.950
So you write poetry, presumably,
in some sort of isolated ,

01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:16.130
space and personal space.

01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:17.340
And you imagine a reader.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.330
You imagine your
connection to other people

01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:22.440
is through reading.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.715
This is the most primal form.

01:36:25.715 --> 01:36:27.090
And then there
might be something

01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:30.590
in between that and the
kind of experience which

01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:33.030
was just mentioned, where
you might be performing

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:34.530
in a formal setting.

01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:37.380
The kind of setting
where you're reciting,

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.180
but it's not necessarily
a formal setting,

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:42.280
but people happen to be there.

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.150
And then maybe some of you had
also the experience of reciting

01:36:45.150 --> 01:36:50.040
on radio, and how the
differences in your connection,

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.690
direct connection to audiences,
shapes your reading of poetry.

01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:56.190
How you perform it.

01:36:56.190 --> 01:36:59.370
Or whether you find yourself
looking at the audience

01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:02.520
and then reading the same
poem in a different way,

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.380
just by looking at the
people who are there.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.340
- I am the designated beginner.

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:13.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:16.877
I start answering the questions.

01:37:16.877 --> 01:37:18.460
Yeah, I think that's
a great question.

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.670
And thank you for
having us here.

01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:24.640
I don't write poems
with anybody in mind.

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.290
So I do write them by myself.

01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:30.190
I write them to the dead, often.

01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:31.540
Or to the poem.

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.150
That's who I kind of think about
when I'm writing, I suppose,

01:37:34.150 --> 01:37:38.600
if I'm thinking about
anything other than syntax.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.580
So that's the truth.

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.620
But then when I'm in front of
people, and as I am right now,

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:48.460
I love people, and I
love to look at people,

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.310
and see them, and try
to have a connection.

01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:54.760
So that's what I try to do
then when I read the poem.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.630
I try to find the people
I'm reading to connect.

01:37:57.630 --> 01:38:01.180
But your question really makes
me think about last night

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.100
more so than radio.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:03.410
I've done that as well.

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:07.120
And then you think it's a
disembodied sort of person

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.460
you're trying to find, right?

01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:12.252
But Marta's-- you know,
what helped me a lot was,

01:38:12.252 --> 01:38:13.210
Marta was our director.

01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:14.090
We had rehearsals.

01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:16.340
This was very exciting for
me, because I don't usually

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.030
get rehearsals as a poet.

01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.780
And we had our
director, our composer,

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.630
who said something I thought
was exceedingly helpful,

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:25.000
which was to project outward.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.220
And so I think that maybe
is the truest thing I could

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.960
say that cuts across this.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.990
When I'm writing the poem,
I'm projecting inward.

01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:35.840
But then when I am giving
a reading or a performance,

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.520
to varying degrees, what I'm
doing is projecting outward.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.560
So thank you, Marta,
also for that,

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.750
because it helps to answer
this great question.

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:49.600
- I have a-- may I jump in?

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.810
So I now produce
television shows on poetry.

01:38:54.810 --> 01:39:02.730
And I'm fascinated by what
a resonant space the 24

01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:08.460
minutes that used to hold
situation comedies or the news,

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:14.130
what a very resonant space
24 minutes is for a poem.

01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:19.830
The resonance and the
tackiness does not

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:29.340
come from the delivery outward
from a poet to an audience.

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:34.050
And I think about that a lot.

01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.840
I think about this
form and format,

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.850
which is an ancient one.

01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:39.810
We deliver.

01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:45.300
The poet stands at the center
and delivers of herself.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:50.580
And I confess that I am
ambivalent about that form,

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:54.900
that format, especially with
this, and this, and this.

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.250
Sorry, Radcliffe.

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:59.220
Seems like gift
horse in the mouth.

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:05.050
But is-- we have grown very,
very accustomed to thinking

01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:07.770
what we should do with a
poem is look at the poet

01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:10.710
and watch the poet read it.

01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:15.750
For the larger
understanding of poetry,

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:18.090
I'm glad that there's TV.

01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:20.880
I can't believe I'm
saying that, but--

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.790
and radio.

01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:23.880
And I think we're
learning from how

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.900
we're all addicted
to podcasts how we

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:31.320
want to live just in our ears.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.820
This collective experience
has an importance we don't we

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.280
don't want to give up.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.520
But for-- I don't know.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.490
There's something about TV that
to me is like chamber music.

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:45.990
You know?

01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:52.200
It's like a very small recital
hall that works really well

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.850
for poetry.

01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:58.160
I try to try to make it work.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.470
And it's so different
than the internal looking

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:02.850
and the giving.

01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:08.620
Evie and I have filmed
together for television,

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.970
so we'll see what happens.

01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:12.260
- Yeah.

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:18.370
The evidence, the outcome
is still yet to be seen.

01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:19.240
It's so funny.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.390
I hear and resonate with
what both of you have said.

01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:26.350
But I guess since
I've been called,

01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:31.090
I'll just say that I'm very much
thinking about audience when

01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:31.700
I write.

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:37.150
I am writing to you all.

01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:39.310
There are the you
all that I know,

01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:44.260
and the you all that I know
will get all of my references.

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.540
And then the you all
that I'm wondering, OK.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.810
Are they going to go
to Google for this?

01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:52.570
How can I make them
want to Google it?

01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:56.350
You know, I'm very much
wondering what somebody

01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:58.090
is going to do with it.

01:41:58.090 --> 01:42:02.290
It's very much-- and I say that
as someone who doesn't, even I

01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:04.330
read a lot of I poems--

01:42:04.330 --> 01:42:08.050
I am from the south
and so forth--

01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:12.670
that's not always the
mode that I'm writing in.

01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.830
But I love to think
about audience.

01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:20.980
And I do think that
maybe the takeaway for me

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:23.030
is that all of these
different ways--

01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:27.640
you can't get a
poem in a bad way.

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:30.220
Tracy K. Smith, our
current poet laureate,

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:34.030
has a podcast now where she's
doing, like, five minutes--

01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:37.920
it's called The Slow Down--
five minutes, one poem

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.900
and her little
introduction of it.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.800
And every day, it
just downloads,

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.980
and you can just listen.

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.720
And it's got jazz
in the background.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.870
And it's just this, like,
escape from the world.

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:55.400
The kind of shows
that Elisa puts on

01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:05.320
are these gatherings, and
layers, and sort of webs--

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:10.960
I was saying this earlier-- webs
of reaction to a single poem.

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.460
This space where we are live--

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:15.380
I love to watch
theater, and so I'm

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:23.820
very much into the energy
I give you all from myself.

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:25.620
And take-- I draw on you.

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:29.220
If you sit there and are quiet
and don't say "southern trees,"

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.360
it matters.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.420
[LAUGHTER] It
affects the reading.

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.090
So yeah.

01:43:36.090 --> 01:43:37.080
Just all of those.

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.550
Thank you for just raising
that as a question.

01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:40.050
- Yeah.

01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:42.060
Great question.

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.590
- I think it depends, also.

01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:46.470
Because at times-- for example,
for the Emily Dickinson,

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.990
I had her in mind.

01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:51.750
So I was physically writing
these things thinking, OK.

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:54.450
Then I'm leave this
poem on her bed,

01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:58.110
and let's see what you're
going to think about it.

01:43:58.110 --> 01:44:00.540
And so same thing with
Celan in this case

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.370
was this dialogue with him.

01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:06.150
And then obviously,
they embody the other.

01:44:06.150 --> 01:44:07.560
- That's such an
important point,

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.560
that poets are talking
to their predecessors.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.990
They're talking to the
language that came before them.

01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.650
- Exactly.

01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:17.490
And they go back through
that language, right?

01:44:17.490 --> 01:44:18.760
And they come the others.

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:23.200
So it's the, once again,
everybody and the nobody

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.290
that we know she said she was.

01:44:25.290 --> 01:44:29.415
So it kind of shifts and moves.

01:44:29.415 --> 01:44:35.200
So once again, it's the fragment
that needs to be recomposed.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.890
- I would say that I don't
write for the audience.

01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:42.700
But as I write by ear,
I pronounce the texts

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:45.310
even if I'm alone
in my room, and--

01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:47.740
even more if I'm
alone in my room.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.230
I pronounce the
texts with loud voice

01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:56.200
and to try to experience
what you will experience.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.500
And what I love is then to
be surprised by the reactions

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.445
of the audience.

01:45:03.495 --> 01:45:04.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:04.870
- Thank you all.

01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:06.350
I think we're supposed
to drink wine now.

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.950
- Is there wine?

01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:07.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:07.450 --> 01:45:09.100
[APPLAUSE]
