00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.810
So I'm going to
multiply 16 times 27.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm going to do it using
something called an area model.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.060
And the whole point
of an area model

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.710
is to really understand
what's going on

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.970
in the multiplication process.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.620
So 16, you can represent
literally as 10 plus 6.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.370
This 1 is in the tens place.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.250
It represents one 10.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.280
So we can represent
that as 10 plus 6.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.850
Let me do the 6 in
that same green color.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.640
10 plus 6.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760
And let me mark
off 10 and 6 here.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.020
So this is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.770
So this part in
blue, that's the 10.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.150
So I'm representing--
I've gone 10 slashes,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.430
or I'm representing 10
boxes right over there.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.120
And then the 6,
which I want to do in

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.200
that green color, the sixth,
let's mark off 6 boxes.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.990
So 16 is this whole length.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.730
The blue part is the 10.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.280
The green part is the 6.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.020
The 10 comes from
the one in the tens.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.620
This is literally 1 10 and
this is literally 6 1s.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.640
Now let's think about 27.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.080
Well, we already know that
the 2 in the 10s place

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.780
is representing 20.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.955
So let's count off 20.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:36.537
So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15, 16 17,

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:38.290
18, 19.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.990
20.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410
So up until that
point right over here,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.830
this line right over
here has a length of 20.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.195
 

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:48.695
But we're not just
talking about 20.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.130
We're talking about 27.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.150
So it's 20 plus 7.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:03.550
So let's count off 7
here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.720
Now if we look at
the total number.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.440
So if we have 16 times 27,
the product 16 times 27, what

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.820
gives you the area of
a 16 by 27 rectangle.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.040
So let me draw that.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.040
So it's 16-- this
is a width of 16.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.120
Let's bring a little line down
right over here-- and then

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.105
the height of my rectangle,
the way I've drawn it is 27.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:33.670
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.990
This is l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.740
So the area of this rectangle
is going to be 16 times

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.620
27, the area of this
entire rectangle.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.410
Now, we could do is break it
up by parts, because it'll

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.740
be easier to compute, and we
can see what part of the area

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.690
those different
products represent.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.610
So, for example, we
can think about what

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.010
10-- so let me separate
out the sections.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.880
So let me draw it.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.440
So this section is 10 wide.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.580
And then let me draw
a section like this.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.740
 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.970
So we could figure out the
areas of each of these sections,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.860
and then the area of
the entire rectangle,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.450
which is going to
be this product,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.124
is going to be the area of all
of these rectangles combined.

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:21.790
So we could first
think about it-- well,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.730
let's think about
what 20 times 10 is.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.420
Well 20 times 10 is a fairly
straightforward thing.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.000
It's going to be 200.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.920
You could think of as 2 times
1, and you have two 0's there.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.100
Or you probably know
in your head 20 times

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.350
10 is just going to be--
you're going to add a 0 here.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.820
So it's going to be 200.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.580
So 20 times 10 is 200.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.100
And let me highlight that in.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.010
So you have-- that's
not the color I wanted

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.760
to use-- let me use
this blue right here.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.230
So that's the blue from the 10.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.140
Let me put some orange
in there from the 20

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.280
to make it clear that this
is the product of both

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.210
of those numbers.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.980
So 20 times 10 is 200.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.680
Now what's 20 times 6?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.430
Well 2 times 6 is 12,
plus you have this 0 here.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.610
So this right over here
is going to be 120.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.149
And it has the orange in it.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.959
 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.700
So this is a 20.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.783
And then let me put
some green in for the 6.

00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:26.330
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.470
20 times the 6.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.670
Now what's the area of this
section right over here?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.770
Well, it's 7 high
and it is 10 wide.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.210
So it's going to be
7 times 10 or 70.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.980
I'll have an area
of 70 square units.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.685
So let me do it in
this purple, and I'll

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.930
thrown some blue in there, too.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.730
It's kind of a fun art project.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.577
I'll throw some
blue in there too.

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:54.910
And then finally, what's the
area of this little section

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.840
right over here?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.830
It's 7 high and it's 6 wide.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.640
So it's going to be 7 times
6 or 42 square units of area.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.320
 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.490
Let me color it in.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.440
So I got some magenta
in there, and then I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.350
got some green in
there right over there.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.870
So what's the area of this
entire thing going to be?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.880
Well, it's going to be the
200 plus the 120 plus--

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.740
let me do it this way-- it's
going to be 200 plus 120

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.660
plus 70 plus 42.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.180
When you add that up, you get,
let's see, in the ones place,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.210
you get a 2.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.410
Then you get 2 tens plus 7
tens is 9 tens, plus 4 tens,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.850
is 13 tens, which is the same
thing as 3 tens and 1 hundred.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.460
And then this is a 4.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460
Did I add that up right?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.420
Let's see, this will be 11.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.336
Yup, that looks right.

00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:52.650
So this is 432.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.115
So this is going
to be equal to 432.

00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:00.990
And you might be saying,
hey, Sal, why did we

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.510
go through all of this business?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.110
I've seen before
that if I take 16--

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.630
I could take 16
times 27 like this.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.150
You probably learned
this type of a process.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.350
16 times 27.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.510
Then you say, OK, let's start
with the 7 in the ones place

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.250
and you do 7 times 6 is 42.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.540
 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.374
And you carry the 4.

00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:25.456
You're really just putting
the 4 in the tens place

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.560
because it's a 40.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.420
But right when you
did that 7 times 6,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.880
we essentially calculated
this right over there.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.500
And then when you multiply
the 7 times the 1,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.480
you really multiplying
7 times 10,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.740
and then you're adding
the 4 from the 42.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.490
So when you do the
7 times this 1.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.160
This is you're actually
calculating this area.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.150
And then when you
carry it when you add

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.514
this carried 4, and
put it right down here.

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:52.930
You're essentially taking the
sum of both of these things,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.710
because you're multiplying 7
times the 16 to get this area.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.167
 

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:00.000
So let's just do it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.120
7 times 1 is 7 plus 4 is 11.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.250
So 112, what you just
figured out right over here,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.020
is this area Right over here.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:18.360
So 7 times the 10 or the
70, plus 7 times 6, the 42.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.540
Now when you go
into the tens place

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.450
you've probably always
said, oh, you know,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.270
I just throw a 0 down there.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.310
But why do you throw
a 0 down there?

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.400
Because this 2 is
representing 10.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.850
So if you multiply 2 times
the 6, and you put a 12

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.262
and put a 2 down
and carry the 1.

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:35.220
That wouldn't be right.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.170
This is a 20.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.050
So that's why you
put the 0 there.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.300
So let's scratch this out
so we don't get confused.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.730
2 times 6 is 12.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.700
So we're used to carrying the
2 down here and carrying the 1.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.360
But notice we're really thinking
about 20 times 60 is 120.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.350
Just doing that we just
calculated that right

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.360
over there.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.440
And then we do 20
times 10 is 200.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.740
But then we had that
one from the 120.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.480
So this is going to be 300.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.300
So what we just did when we
multiplied the 2 times the 16,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.680
we just calculated
this total area.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.810
We did the 20 times
the 6 to get that.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.010
And then we had the 20
times a 10 to get that.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.780
When we did the 20 times
the 6, we carried this 1

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.150
into the hundreds place.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.110
And so we added it all
together and got 320.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.960
And then this step
right over here,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.770
you're literally just
finding the combined area--

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.460
the area of this plus the
area of that the area.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.240
So that's going to get us to---
we deserve a drum roll now.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.039
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.380
1 plus 2 is 3.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.872
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:08:45.872 --> 00:08:46.372
