NINA: Thank you all for coming.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.370
My name is Nina.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.440
And today we have Rohan Dixit to
present Engineering Calm Sensor

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.250
Driven Meditation technology
as part of the Talks

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.940
at Google series brought
to you by gPause,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.240
a community of
mindfulness practices

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.750
for well being change at Google.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.360
The last 10 years have
seen the growing acceptance

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.710
of mindfulness meditation
in mainstream science.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.870
Hundreds of studies
have now demonstrated

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.280
quantifiable physiological
effects of meditation

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.410
on heart rhythms, stress,
immune response, and more.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.240
In fact, it appears
the brain itself

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.010
changes both during
the act of meditation,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670
as well as after
repeated practice.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.670
We'll show you the
brainwave, heartbeat,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.690
and breath sensors
that can help you track

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.720
your mind during your day.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.780
For example, breathing patterns
are correlated with stress.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.260
And, in fact, many
forms of meditation

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.750
encourage watching
of the breath.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.600
A wearable respiration sensor
that gives you feedback

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.330
when you're stressed can
be imagined as a technology

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.170
assisted meditation practice.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.480
The coming ubiquity
of wearable sensors

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.880
make opportunities
for calm engineering

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.770
like this potentially
quite common.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.480
We'll show you the state
of the field today.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.410
Rohan Dixit is a
founder at BrainBot

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.770
and a former
neuroimaging researcher

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.690
at the Harvard MIT MGH Martino
Center and Stanford University.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.800
In a search for the ultimate
meaning of life, the universe,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.450
and everything,
Rohan quit his job

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.730
and bought a one-way
ticket to the Himalayas

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.410
where he lived with
Tibetan monks for a year

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.530
and recorded their brain
waves during meditation.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.610
This eventually led
to a meditation app

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.960
that uses a brain waves sensor
as well as a flower that blooms

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.940
with your calm brain waves.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.800
This summer and
fall, Rohan will be

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.890
creating a variety of
large art installations

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.010
that react to your
relaxed heartbeat,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.670
including a garden,
a 15 feet tall metal

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480
lotuses, and huge
murals that encourage

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.970
heart syncing between people.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.720
I'm thrilled to
present to you today

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.488
my former classmate and dear
friend of 10 years, Rohan.

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:12.883
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.950
ROHAN DIXIT: As Nina was
saying, my name is Rohan.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.970
And I'm the founder of BrainBot,
which is a group of three

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.540
or four friends who are all
interested in the intersection

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.720
between meditation and censors.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.700
So it's kind of an
interesting space.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.180
You can imagine that sensors
are something that's pretty new,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.280
especially wearable
sensors, whereas meditation

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.049
is something that's pretty
ancient and pretty old.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.840
So it's an interesting
kind of intersection

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.307
to be playing with.

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:42.640
And I want to talk a little
bit about the companies that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.660
are in the space now, the
sensors that are already

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.951
out there, and a little bit
about what we're working on

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.350
now.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.810
I'll try to keep it
short so that we have

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.100
a lot of time for questions.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.790
So like Nina was
saying, my background

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.890
is actually in neuroimaging.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.540
And I started kind of
studying the C-word.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.630
So the C-word in neuroscience
is Consciousness, actually.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.580
And it's been hard
for many years--

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.520
actually, decades-- to
study consciousness.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.185
It's kind of a taboo
subject, right?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.472
So the way that we do that
in the clinical context

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.846
and in neuroscience
in general is

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:21.290
to study things that
are very, very concrete.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.560
Alterations in consciousness
like, for example,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.485
people in a coma.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.110
You can imagine that
somebody in a coma

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.000
has some degree
of consciousness.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.610
You can poke them
or have some kind

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.960
of basic reflexes still intact.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.920
But their consciousness, their
sort of awareness on some level

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.720
is gone.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.200
So that's kind of a
window, an insight,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.660
into what consciousness is.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.914
So we study people
who are in comas.

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:45.330
We've studied people who were
under deep anesthesia, which

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.250
is a similar kind of situation.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.320
We have people who had
epilepsy-- temporal lobe

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.720
epilepsy-- and they tend to have
altered states of consciousness

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.302
during their seizures.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.010
So those are three
kind of short examples

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.970
of ways of studying
consciousness

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.660
that exist already in
the neuroscience world.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.590
But eventually I ended up in
Sara Lazar's lab at Harvard

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.580
studying people who
meditate and their brain.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.720
And so you can see
here on the screen

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.430
this is a monk who has a whole
bunch of sensors on his head.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.061
Those are called EEG sensors or
electroencephalography sensors.

00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:18.519
And basically what
they're doing is

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.893
measuring the
electrical activity

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:23.100
of the brain in real time
while the monk does things.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.620
So you can imagine asking
the monk to meditate

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.650
and recording the brain
waves before and after

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.140
and seeing what changes
actually happen.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.200
And it turns out that
the brain actually

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.610
does change during meditation.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.440
Both over the short term
and kind of the long term.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.760
So with these sensors,
you're able to pick up

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.920
on these changes that are
happening structurally and also

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.542
the changes that are
happening in real time.

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.750
So why is it that you might
want to study meditation?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.541
Meditation is kind of
a hokey thing, right?

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.760
It's kind of a woo-woo
or magical in a way.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.010
But the practices themselves
are actually quite simple

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.950
and really kind of boil down to
attentional training and self

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.050
inquiry in a way.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.560
So meditation often is
associated with the East,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.000
but I think this is kind
of an ancient trend.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.800
The idea of self
knowledge and self inquiry

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.110
was something that
Socrates was really into.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.744
Know thyself.

00:05:17.744 --> 00:05:20.160
And I think that's the basis
for a lot of forms of therapy

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.230
as well today.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.820
Kind of having self awareness
I think is how all of us

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.114
kind of grow as people.

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:26.780
The ability to
introspect into yourself,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.446
to see yourself in
different situations,

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:32.030
and to understand how you
react to stressors in the world

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.690
actually allows you to grow.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.040
And meditation actually
in part is that.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.320
It's building the ability
to kind of look inwards,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.550
to see your own body,
to see your own mind,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.200
and to watch yourself
with sustained attention

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.047
over the course of your life.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.130
So it turns out that just
like any other practice,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.507
for example, learning
juggling, if you

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:54.090
look at people who
learn juggling over

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.590
the course of three
to eight weeks

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.290
you kind of see
that there are areas

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.790
in the brain like in the motor
cortex that actually thicken.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.290
That is just called
neuroplasticity.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.510
It just seems be the case
that the brain actually

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.715
responds and grows in response
to repeated activities.

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:10.340
The same thing is
true with meditation.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.839
And so what we were
doing in the lab

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.030
was basically studying that.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.479
Trying to characterize how the
brain is actually changing.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.020
We found a lot of
interesting things.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.680
For example, it appears that
in as little as eight weeks

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.240
you can have measurable
changes in the brain in areas

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.770
that are associated with sense
of self and also empathy.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.700
Those are two aspects
of personality

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.680
that oftentimes are interesting
to play with and to develop.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.290
So that was my life as
a researcher in a lab.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.970
And I love it.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.990
I love research.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.020
And I'm kind of a nerd about it.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.760
But I found myself as we
were studying meditation

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.924
realizing that it was actually
a pretty beneficial thing.

00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:55.340
It seemed like the monks in
the long term meditation study

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.940
tended to be happier
people, just more relaxed.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.880
And I kind of wanted
that for myself,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.570
although I didn't
really feel it.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.809
So I decided eventually
to follow those monks

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.350
that we were studying
in the lab back

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.300
to the Himalayas
where they lived

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.915
to try to understand what
meditation actually was

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:12.980
and to do it for myself.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.650
And because I am a nerd, I took
a bunch of brain wave equipment

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.420
with me to try to
measure their brains.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.200
I thought I could
make a device that

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.600
would help me learn to
meditate without any

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.240
of the kind of
interface of words.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.550
When you try to explain how
to do something to somebody

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.010
you can only use words to
really describe what you mean.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.840
But the advantage
of using sensors

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.130
is that you can
actually map what's

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.650
happening in someone's body to
what's happening in your body

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.035
without the crutch of language.

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:41.910
So that was the idea.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.930
I took a bunch of brain
wave sensors with me.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.110
And I spent, as Nina was
saying, almost a year

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.910
traveling around through India
going to these monasteries that

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.410
are at the top of the Himalayan
mountains and meeting theses

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.270
monks.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.020
These monks are really
interesting people.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.910
I could probably tell you
stories for days about them.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.290
But what kind of
came out of that was,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.140
one, a deeper sense
for myself personally

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.165
of just what meditation was
and what it could do to you.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.540
These people are really, really
nice and really friendly.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.320
And I think some of that stems
in part from their practices.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.740
And, two, it kind
of led to this app.

00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:20.170
So when I came back from India,
some friends and I were kind

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.840
of looking at the data and we
realized that with a little bit

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.920
of machine learning you can kind
of pick out when somebody is

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.540
meditating and
when they weren't.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.929
So we sort of applied the state
of the art in neuroscience

00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:31.470
with a little bit
of machine learning

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.370
to basically interface with a
commercially available headset.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.659
This thing is about $100.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.460
It's the NeuroSky.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.789
And help people
learn to meditate

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.360
with a virtual
meditation instructor.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.300
So this app is in
the Apple App Store.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.110
I felt a little bit embarrassed
not having an Android app

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.762
coming to Google.

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:53.150
But soon hopefully.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.290
And it kind of does
some interesting things.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.970
So one of them is
just habit design,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.710
which is really boring and
simple, but actually really

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.237
important.

00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:03.320
I don't know if any of you
have tried to meditate.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.927
I've tried and
failed so many times.

00:09:05.927 --> 00:09:06.760
It's out of control.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.200
And part of that is just
the ability to build a habit

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.110
and to do it repeatedly.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.610
So some of what the
app does is just

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:17.000
simple kind of like this flower,
this plant grows in real time.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.059
And your goal is to kind of
keep it alive like a Tamagotchi.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.350
I don't know if you guys are
old enough or young enough

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.426
to remember what that is.

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:26.990
But basically it's
like a little device

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.300
that you keep in your pocket.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.150
And it was like a
little creature.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.240
You had to feed it and make
sure it was healthy and happy.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.781
And so this is kind
of the same idea.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:36.620
This is a plant you keep
alive with your meditation.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.120
One of the cool
things that we were

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.666
able to build in with
the brain wave sensor

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:43.165
was this kind of
realtime feedback--

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.495
the virtual mediation
instructor I was talking about.

00:09:45.495 --> 00:09:47.870
So in real time we're kind of
looking at your brain waves

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.770
and we're analyzing them.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.000
And when the app kind of
detects that your mind starts

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.400
to wander, it actually can give
you a short feedback queue.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.852
So this is a fun kind of example
of how that might happen.

00:10:00.852 --> 00:10:02.840
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.010
-Notice what's happening.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.352
Relax and gently reconnect
with your breath.

00:10:09.352 --> 00:10:10.032
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:12.240
ROHAN DIXIT: So what you
can see there is essentially

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.860
real time neuro
feedback, guiding

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.247
somebody through a meditation.

00:10:16.247 --> 00:10:17.580
You can do that through sensors.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.907
And it's just one example
of what you can kind of do.

00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:21.990
And this is another project
that we're working on.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.490
You can actually
pre-order this now.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.530
It's called the Lotus.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.039
It's kind of very similar to
the app in that it is a plant.

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.080
It's a flower that grows.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.700
But this is a physical thing.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.170
Some friends and I just kind
of hacked it together for fun.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.130
But basically the
idea is that it acts

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.064
as a meditation Pomodoro timer.

00:10:37.064 --> 00:10:39.230
I don't know if you guys
have ever played with this.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.940
But essentially Pomodoro timer
is kind of just an egg timer.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.670
You set it for, say, 30
minutes or 20 minutes.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.950
You start to work at
your desk, and when

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.270
the timer goes off it's
time to take a break

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.802
or do something else.

00:10:50.802 --> 00:10:52.010
So this is very similar idea.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.720
But it's actually
a flower and it's

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.240
integrated with biosensors.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.330
So the way that it works is
as you start to meditate,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.090
the flower picks
up the meditation

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.080
through the headset via
Bluetooth and blooms.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.650
So here's a little animation
of how that happens.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.135
[CHIMES FROM VIDEO]

00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:11.125
You see the headset.

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:12.540
It's sending data to your phone.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.540
And your phone is then
analyzing and determining

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.070
when you're meditating and
using that as a signal to bloom

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.017
this physical flower
that sits on your desk.

00:11:20.017 --> 00:11:21.850
Over time that flower
starts to close again,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.000
and that just acts as
a reminder to meditate.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.360
So that's another kind of
fun project you can do.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.696
It's very simple now
with these sensors

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:31.570
and with a little bit
of a single processing.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.050
So I wanted to talk a little bit
about some of the sensors that

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.760
are out there.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.170
We're talking about
engineering calm and sensor

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.450
driven meditation technology.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.749
So I wanted to introduce
you to some of the, I think,

00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:48.540
cutting edge and best
in class sensors that

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.022
are out there today.

00:11:50.022 --> 00:11:51.480
So this sensor is
called the Spire.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.300
You can pre-order
it I believe now.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.370
And they should start
shipping in the fall.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.810
But the Spire is basically
a respiration sensor.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.930
So essentially what it does is
it kind of clips into your belt

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.600
or into your bra, and
there's a little flex sensor

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.260
kind of built inside.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.900
And as you breathe the
Spire recognizes that you're

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.514
breathing and kind of
analyzes that on your phone,

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.430
and gives you a feedback
signal and determines

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.790
that your breathing
pattern seems stressed out.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.960
So you can imagine that
your body is all connected.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.460
Your brain, your
heart, your breath.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.730
These things are all
intimately linked in some way.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.930
And so almost like
a hologram, if you

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.410
look at any piece of your
body or any kind of aspect,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.110
any biosignal, you can see
reflections of other signals,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.620
as well.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.210
And so by analyzing the
breath, the people at Spire

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.970
have been able to find
a way to sort of get

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.125
at when you're stressed out and
the phone kind of buzzes you

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.500
when it determines that you're
either holding your breath

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.757
or the breath is
sort of indicative of

00:12:47.757 --> 00:12:50.170
a stressed or frustrated state.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.420
We actually hooked
this up to the Lotus

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.670
a couple weeks ago at a
consciousness hacking meeting,

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.600
which is meet up that
happens in San Francisco

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.120
about every month.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.865
And this is the emWave.

00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:03.090
So we just talked
about the breath.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.627
The Spire looks at respiration.

00:13:05.627 --> 00:13:08.210
The emWave is a product that's
been around for about 10 years.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.620
And I think it's
probably the best

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.240
kind of heart rate
or heart derived

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.777
meditation device out there.

00:13:15.777 --> 00:13:18.110
So I just want to kind of
talk you through how it works.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.140
You can kind of see based
on the screen there's

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.700
like a little box and a clip.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.150
That clip essentially
goes on to your ear lobe.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.930
And what it's doing
is measuring your HRV.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.150
So your HRV is Heart
Rate Variability.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.994
It's a signal that's embedded
inside of your heart rhythm.

00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:34.410
It's kind of an
interesting thing.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.240
And you can probably kind of
test this as you sit here.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.630
When you're relatively
relaxed and you breathe in,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.122
your heartbeat actually goes up.

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.080
People often have this
idea that your heartbeat

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.450
is pretty stable.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.409
It's actually not true.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.699
Your heartbeat is constantly
kind of going up and down.

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:51.260
And the way that it works is
on inhale your heartbeat rises

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.260
a little bit.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.360
You can kind of test, right?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.547
And on exhale your heart
beat kind of drops.

00:13:56.547 --> 00:13:58.630
So if you graph that over
time, what you're seeing

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.910
is basically on an inhale your
heartbeat goes up and an exhale

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.490
it goes down.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.370
And that kind of
sinusoidal rhythm

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.290
is what the emWave uses
to give you feedback

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.631
as to when you're relaxed.

00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:11.130
If you're not very
relaxed or you're

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.200
kind of frustrated or
tense, you're not actually

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.050
able to elicit that sinusoidal
wave when you breath in

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.276
and breath out.

00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:18.650
The way that the
emWave does that

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.130
is with a series of LEDs that
are on the side of this device.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.300
Basically as you breath in, the
LEDs go up, as you breath in,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.460
they go down.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.290
And you just kind of look
at that and try to relax,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.560
elicit that wave, which,
of course, is correlated

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.670
with your body actually
feeling less tense,

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.040
less stressed, and relaxed.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.680
So we kind of
riffed on that idea,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.010
the idea of heart
rate variability

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.790
or this kind of stress
signal inside of the heart

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.531
beat in this big installation
we're doing over the summer.

00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:51.030
So this is happening
at Burning Man.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.354
We got a grant from them to
do a big art installation.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:56.020
As Nina was saying,
there are these kind

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.570
of these 15 foot tall lotuses.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.852
And this is a mockup
and a rendering.

00:14:59.852 --> 00:15:01.685
We're building it now
out in American Steel.

00:15:01.685 --> 00:15:05.270
If anybody wants to help, you're
more than welcome to swing by.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.680
But basically the way that
this installation works

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.709
is by measuring people's HRV,
or Heart Rate Variability,

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.500
that kind of breathing
in and breathing out

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.450
signal of relaxation and
kind of correlating that

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.650
to the brightness of
a 15 foot tall Lotus

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.192
in the middle of the desert.

00:15:21.192 --> 00:15:22.150
Now, it's not just one.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.162
Like with the emWave
it's a single device.

00:15:24.162 --> 00:15:25.620
But the way that
this works is more

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.530
of an interactive,
collaborative thing.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.090
So why would you want to have
the HRV measured, the Heart

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.090
Rate Variability measured for
different people in a group

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.740
setting?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.077
It turns out there was
some research in 2013

00:15:38.077 --> 00:15:39.160
that came out of UC Davis.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.243
It was really interesting.

00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:42.570
So I read this and I got
of course very excited

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.200
because I'm a nerd
and I get excited

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.630
about this kind of stuff.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.250
And what it kind of
showed was that people

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.620
who are in a long term
relationship for a year

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.470
or more, if you put them
across from their partner

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.970
and just kind of have them stare
into their partner's eyes--

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.070
no talking allowed
for three minutes.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.935
It's kind of a long time.

00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:03.310
It's kind of crazy,
but if you're

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.380
measuring their heart rate,
they actually start to sync up.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.600
The Heart Rate Variability
of both of these people

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.607
starts to align and sync.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.190
And if you switch
that out to somebody

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.260
in the waiting room who is a
member of another couple-- so

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.600
two strangers-- that
syncing doesn't happen.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.564
So the interpretation
that the researchers had

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.480
was that the ability to
empathize with someone

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.160
allows you to somehow have these
subconscious cues that actually

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.530
lets you sync with other people.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.260
And so this art
installation is kind

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.830
of an experiment in empathy.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.090
Basically the idea is
the state of empathy

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.430
seems to allow you to sync.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.230
So what happens if we
measure that syncing process,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.410
give you visual feedback
almost mechanically,

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.710
and draw your body into
that state of syncing?

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.320
Do you then kind of have that
reverse mapping take place

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.544
where you then feel empathetic
towards other people.

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:54.960
It turns out that your body
and your mind are very linked.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.620
So if you force yourself into
a certain physiological state,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.840
oftentimes the mental
state is connected.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.990
And so that's the idea
of the installation.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.670
We're kind of riffing on that
as well in India over the fall.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.829
So basically this is another
big installation, a mural,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.530
that we're going to
do in Dharamsala,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.230
which is where the Dalai
Lama lives in India, and also

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.270
in Bombay, which is a huge
city, a bustling metropolis.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.619
And the idea here is
also very similar.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.160
You can see on the
screen it says,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.630
"There is a path from
your heart to mind,"

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.546
which is a Rumi quote.

00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:27.400
I'm working on this installation
with a really talented artist

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.170
named Shilo Shiv Suleman,
who is actually Indian.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.760
And the idea is
basically to allow people

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.230
to sync in a public space.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:42.120
It's kind of all based around
the idea of sacred spaces

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.870
in India, which are
often very public.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:44.930
And we're kind of
bringing that back

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.350
with a little bit of technology.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.880
So the idea is you touch
an illuminated hand that's

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.997
kind of set against the wall.

00:17:51.997 --> 00:17:53.580
And there's actually
a sensor embedded

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.820
in one of the fingertips.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.319
And that sensor measures your
heart rate and your Heart Rate

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:57.830
Variability.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.070
So as you start to
relax and breath deeply,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.810
the entire wall comes
alive with LEDs and lights.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.060
And there's a message that
says, find another partner,

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.394
and another hand that becomes
illuminated across from you.

00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:10.310
So then you have to find
somebody walking down

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.500
the street, they have to put
their hand against the wall.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.624
They have to breath deeply.

00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:16.020
When both of you do that
together and the syncing sort

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.450
of happens, then a
hidden message comes out.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.710
For example, there's a path
from your heart to mind.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.290
It's a fun little
project, but it

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.990
is kind of indicative
of the ability

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.610
to very quickly use
sensors and a little bit

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.200
of signal processing to make
an interactive experience that

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.590
allows people to engender
hopefully empathy.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.350
So we've talked about a couple
devices and a couple art

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:42.070
projects and just general ideas
around meditation and sensors.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.990
And this is something
that I think about a lot.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.870
The idea is, at
least in my own mind,

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.630
to find some sort of device
that I can wear that allows me

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.080
all the time in real time
almost ambiently to be aware

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.190
of my own stress levels and to
respond to that appropriately.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.260
So what you need
there is then a sensor

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
and you need feedback
of some type.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.830
So that feedback
could be visual,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.867
like the HeartMath, that
device with the LEDs

00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:09.700
that go up and down.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.494
You kind of have to
look at the thing.

00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:13.910
You see it's measuring your
heart rate and your Heart Rate

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.580
Variability, and you watch
as the LEDs go up and down.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.830
And that's visual feedback.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.370
But there are all kinds of
feedback that you could use.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.000
You can imagine
auditory feedback.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.208
We played with that, as well.

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:24.050
We kind of mocked
together a little sensor

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.510
that goes behind your ear
and kind of beeps at you

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.240
all the time when it
recognizes your heart beating.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.664
That's also not very ambient.

00:19:32.664 --> 00:19:34.080
And it's not very
wearable, right?

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.680
The ideal device
that kind of does

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.170
is, the ideal meditation
technology is probably

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.190
totally invisible, it's
socially acceptable,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.210
and it's wearable
throughout the day.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.230
And so with those as
design kind of parameters,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.390
we have wrestled a lot
with how to actually make

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.453
this thing work.

00:19:51.453 --> 00:19:53.202
And this is something
that we just started

00:19:53.202 --> 00:19:54.734
working on like a week ago.

00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:56.900
I wanted to show you guys
and get a little feedback.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.290
It's a little weird but
basically we have these sensors

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.230
and we're like, OK, where on the
body can we measure the signal?

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.170
So what we're
measuring now is HRV.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.540
It's a very easy
to pick up signal,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.790
much more so than these
brainwave sensors.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.875
And so we were trying to figure
out exactly how to measure it.

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:14.870
We looked at the wrist.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.120
That turned out to be difficult
for different reasons.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.240
It's hard to get a clean
signal from the wrist,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.960
as any of you who bought a
Basis watch probably know.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.790
It's actually not a
trivial thing to do.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.373
I think Google Wear and there's
a whole bunch of other sensors

00:20:26.373 --> 00:20:28.580
that are on the wrist.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.680
We tried basically
all parts of the body.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.495
It was pretty ridiculous
seeing us kind of pace

00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:36.050
these sensors all
over the place.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.500
But this is a process of
trying to find something

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.958
in the a space
where you don't know

00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.587
what the answer is beforehand.

00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:43.045
And then, eventually--
I apologize.

00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:44.045
This is my friend, Luke.

00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:46.690
He likes to take his
shirt off, god bless him.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.827
But this is actually a photo
that we took yesterday.

00:20:49.827 --> 00:20:52.035
And so we kind of, as I
said, just came up with this.

00:20:52.035 --> 00:20:55.455
This is essentially
a belt or strap

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:57.080
that you wear underneath
your clothing.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.500
And it's totally invisible.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.012
And you can kind of
see up in the top right

00:21:01.012 --> 00:21:02.720
that's a diagram for
a patent application

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.130
that we are submitting.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.680
And you can kind of
see it on his chest.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.920
There's a whole bunch of
different vibrating sensors

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.280
across a strap that
kind of looks like this.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.287
And so what happens is as your
HRV starts to kind of relax--

00:21:18.287 --> 00:21:19.870
and, again, just to
reiterate one more

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.925
time what HRV is because it's a
kind of a hard concept to grok.

00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:27.290
So what you're seeing
in this illustration

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.980
is basically a time
series in the lower

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.336
right of heart rate over time.

00:21:32.336 --> 00:21:33.960
And you can see that
it's kind of going

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.160
up and down a little bit.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.060
That was me walking
down the street.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.580
And then you can see me start
to breathe deeply and relax

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.080
and you can see how kind of the
rhythms start to get really,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.288
really sinusoidal and larger.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.020
So that large sinusoidal
rhythm, that's HRV.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.120
That's you being relaxed.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.703
And if you don't see
that, then you're

00:21:51.703 --> 00:21:55.390
probably not feeling super calm.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.263
So essentially what we did
was map that to an array

00:21:58.263 --> 00:21:59.165
of vibrating sensors.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.080
Similar to the way that
you look at the HeartMath

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.360
and kind of see the
LEDs go up and down,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.940
basically the central
sensor in the middle kind of

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.850
buzzes when you're at the
valley of this HRV rhythm.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.750
And as you inhale and
your HRV increases,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.330
the vibrating array comes alive.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.370
And kind of the feedback
extends across the entire band.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.905
And as you stop with your
breath and start to exhale,

00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:27.257
it comes back down.

00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:29.590
So what you get is what we
call this hummingbird pattern

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.800
where basically as you
inhale and you're relaxed,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.790
you feel on your chest
sort of this opening

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.250
and closing of vibration.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.240
It's totally ambient.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.860
It's totally hidden.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.792
And nobody knows
you're wearing it.

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:43.250
But what it does
allow you to do is

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.450
kind of be a little more
relaxed throughout the day.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.430
This is the kind
of design process

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.390
that we have been going
through to find a device that

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.510
allows you to basically have
meditation wearable wherever

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.510
you go.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.437
And so I just wanted to
show you very quickly.

00:23:01.437 --> 00:23:03.395
I think some of you may
have seen this already.

00:23:06.871 --> 00:23:08.870
But I just want to show
you a little bit of what

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.350
this wave looks
like and hopefully

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.230
a little demonstration
to close it out.

00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:16.604
So I'm a little
bit nervous, right?

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:18.520
I'm giving a talk in
front of a lot of people.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.262
And I tried to prepare for it.

00:23:20.262 --> 00:23:21.720
Maybe didn't do
enough preparation.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.949
Maybe this isn't
going as well I hope.

00:23:23.949 --> 00:23:25.240
You have all kinds of thoughts.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.440
All kinds of fears no
matter what you're doing.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.080
You always have doubts, right?

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.010
So you can kind of see that
reflected in the heart rate.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.770
That's pretty fast.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.320
That's a pretty high heart rate.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.040
And you can kind of see if
you just kind of look at it,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.380
every one of those
spikes is a heart beat.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.260
I'm wearing some sensors under
my clothes which of course you

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.920
can't see because
it's invisible.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.800
But this is my
heart in real time.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.970
So what I'm going to try to do
if you guys will bear with me

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.790
is try to elicit a little bit of
HRV by relaxing in front of you

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.180
on stage.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.850
So what will that look like?

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.700
What you should
see is that there

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.760
will be a period of
heart beats which

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.260
will start to be kind of
condensed faster, that's

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.760
my inhale.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.340
Because as you breathe in,
everyone's body-- yours, mine,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.020
everyone's-- your heart
rate starts to increase.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.300
And as you exhale your
heartbeat starts to decrease.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.035
So on my exhale you should
see those spikes start

00:24:19.035 --> 00:24:21.220
to get a little bit
further apart, right?

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.100
So let's do this.

00:24:26.582 --> 00:24:33.056
[BREATHING]

00:25:15.775 --> 00:25:17.650
So I don't know if that
was too subtle to see

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.190
or if I couldn't
relax, but that's

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.910
like a pretty good
example of how

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.635
you can use this thing in
real time in your real life.

00:25:24.635 --> 00:25:26.760
Because there are always
situations often scattered

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.670
throughout the
day where you have

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.630
to talk to your boss or you
have to talk to your girlfriend.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.060
So there are situations where
perhaps your stress level

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.700
will be higher than normal.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.100
It happens in every human
relationship, right?

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.930
And so to have the ability to
recognize when your body is

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.469
getting stressed out and to
actually gain control of that

00:25:43.469 --> 00:25:45.010
is actually a really
important skill,

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.300
because it allows
you to then face

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.210
the relationships in
your life and your world

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.050
in general with more calmness
and a little bit more empathy.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.120
So that's the idea behind
all of these sensors

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.824
and that's the goal of this
vibrating strap and the Spire

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:00.490
and HeartMath and all
these devices that

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.000
are in this space of
engineering calm and sensor

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.040
driven meditation.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.610
So I kind of want to let
this run in the background

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.830
and just take some
questions from you guys

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.430
if anybody has any.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.820
AUDIENCE: I was wondering how
far do you think we can go

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:22.000
and what do you think is the
direction which it might appear

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.090
to be available in terms of
providing feedback to people

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.547
that it becomes basically
something they're not aware of.

00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:30.880
I mean, something that is
just so physical they actually

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.160
get to totally built into
the whole biofeedback loop.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.710
ROHAN DIXIT: Yeah.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.456
So you used the
word biofeedback.

00:26:39.456 --> 00:26:40.830
And that's actually
what this is.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.324
Its biofeedback.

00:26:42.324 --> 00:26:43.740
So for anybody
who's not familiar,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.470
biofeedback is
basically when you

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.670
start to feedback to yourself
one of your own body signals,

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.250
you tend to gain
control over it.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.767
So that's kind of a weird
thing to say, but in the '70s--

00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:55.600
this is when this
research kind of started--

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.080
they used biofeedback on
college students who would

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.450
come into the research lab.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.033
So basically what they did was
put a little temperature sensor

00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:05.030
on their finger and tell
these college kids--

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.990
like 19-20-year-olds--
to raise the temperature

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.070
of their finger,
which is impossible.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.050
How can you do that?

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.860
But it turns out that if you are
actually monitoring that signal

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.390
and you're seeing
it in real time

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.710
or feeling it across
your chest, you actually

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.720
gain the ability over time
to move that signal yourself.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.660
This is the crux of
biofeedback and why

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.401
this is actually potentially
such a powerful space.

00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:31.900
So eventually what
you're able to do

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.483
is gain conscious
control of something

00:27:33.483 --> 00:27:34.775
was totally unconscious before.

00:27:34.775 --> 00:27:36.149
So in the case of
the finger tip,

00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:38.260
it's the ability to raise
your finger temperature.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:38.980
Not that useful.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.605
Kind of a cool party
trick maybe if you

00:27:40.605 --> 00:27:42.300
have a thermometer around.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.350
But in the case
of a signal that's

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.556
correlated with your stress,
with your inner state,

00:27:47.556 --> 00:27:49.180
if you gain control
over that, then you

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.170
gain the ability to
move throughout your day

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.825
and throughout your
world in a way that

00:27:52.825 --> 00:27:55.450
is much more calm and much more
open to what's happening around

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.450
you without getting
stressed out.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.572
And so my hope is
with all these devices

00:28:02.572 --> 00:28:04.780
after you wear it for a
little while you kind of gain

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.370
this ability to
control the process.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.159
And hopefully like training
wheels you just drop them.

00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:10.950
The idea is that you
should be able to gain

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.290
biofeedbacked control over
this by kind of feedbacking,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.455
if that is a word, these
sensors into your own body

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:21.697
through your sensory
stream and then drop it.

00:28:21.697 --> 00:28:22.780
You won't need it anymore.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.889
That's the hope.

00:28:23.889 --> 00:28:25.680
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
of your opinion, what

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.740
are the various advantages and
disadvantages of monitoring

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.120
the heart compared to the brain?

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.992
ROHAN DIXIT: Yeah.

00:28:31.992 --> 00:28:33.700
Like I said, I started
with neuroscience.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.330
And we actually started
with an EEG device,

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.900
which is really cool.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.320
And we do have a
product out there

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.495
that does EEG based feedback.

00:28:43.495 --> 00:28:46.120
But the problem with EEG is that
you can't wear it all the time

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.290
really.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.200
The signal itself
is very, very weak.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.620
It's very difficult to detect.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.740
And then any kind of movement,
like an eye blink, for example,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.120
just washes out
the signal totally.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.769
So realistically, in
the next couple years,

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:04.310
you're not going to
have a device you

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.840
can wear on your head that
gives you this kind of feedback

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.580
into your own mind that allows
you to do neuro feedback

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.250
or biofeedback through the head.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.300
Also it's kind of weird.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.580
I don't know if people
have kind of run

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.246
into this with Google
Glass to a degree,

00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:18.830
but there's some social stigma.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.780
Whether that's justified or
not is irrelevant at least

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.860
from our perspective.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.814
But there is a little
bit of hesitation

00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:27.355
around wearing
something on your head

00:29:27.355 --> 00:29:28.880
and it's very
visible, especially

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.170
if it's kind of like helping
you deal with anxiety or stress

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.140
or that sort of thing.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.950
And so we shifted to the
heart because the rhythm

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.770
itself is much easier to detect.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.290
It's been studied
for like 60 years.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.100
HRV is easy to
pick up relatively.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.280
Coming from an EEG background,
this is just awesome.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.930
And you can measure it
from under your clothes.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.480
And so I think
eventually hopefully

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.090
these devices kind actually
become part of our clothing.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.204
And I think that's
where it's going.

00:29:56.204 --> 00:29:57.620
But at least in
the short term, we

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.286
are focusing on the heart signal
because it's easier to measure.

00:30:00.286 --> 00:30:03.030
You can measure it from
places that are unobtrusive

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.810
and it's just much
more well understood.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.320
AUDIENCE: You know
a bit about-- I'm

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.110
actually interested not
just in meditation but I'm

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.660
interested in trying
to figure out how

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.180
to be able to manipulate focus.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.890
So obviously as a
software engineer

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.894
that's really
important in what I do.

00:30:25.894 --> 00:30:27.810
And there are times
during the day when I find

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.130
it very difficult to focus.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:36.840
And I'm trying to get an answer
of can I measure when either I

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.890
shouldn't focus now.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.400
I should go to the
gym and come back.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.120
Or whether I can
actually get myself

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.610
into a mind frame
of focus where I

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.460
can get things done quickly
and efficiently and correctly.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.890
And I think meditation
is a part of this,

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.750
but one of the things I have
difficulty distinguishing

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:59.510
is that my heart isn't moving
that much because I'm just

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.600
exhausted.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.650
And my brain isn't
actually moving either.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.330
And so that's sort of a state
of meditation maybe even focus,

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.830
but not moving forward
in terms of computing.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.350
And what I'd like
to do, as well,

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.240
is come up with
something, a practice

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.190
that helps me in my work in
addition to just being calm.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.900
And I'm curious whether or
not you see any distinction

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.500
between that and meditation.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.240
Whether there's
some other signals

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.630
that might be worth looking for
in terms of building something

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.419
to help focus.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:33.960
ROHAN DIXIT: That's
very interesting.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.310
Yeah.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.430
So meditation is a
pretty big catchall word.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.190
It includes practices
that let you relax,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.089
but also practices that
build your attention.

00:31:44.089 --> 00:31:46.130
And focus is another word
for attention, perhaps.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.380
It's tough.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.140
I mean, EEG is really the way to
go I think for building focus,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.990
in general.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.210
This is more sort of
relaxation in general

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:02.940
and allowing yourself
to not be anxious.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.040
Yeah.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.800
So in terms of building
your own ability to focus,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.830
I mean this is probably
pretty common advice,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.360
but people tend to have
patterns throughout the day.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.140
For example, right after lunch
is oftentimes not a great time

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.400
to try to focus.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.971
The human mind itself, you
probably have encountered this,

00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:22.970
if you take a break from
programming for a while

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.820
or from any skill, you kind of
lose the ability to sustain it

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.995
over a long period of time.

00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:28.120
And you build that back up.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.660
It's just a skill
like any other.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.240
So one way that might
be nice in terms

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.670
of finding our your rhythms
is just to track a little bit.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.170
I don't know if you
already do this.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.290
But even a simple
spreadsheet kind of help.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.580
AUDIENCE: I've got a thing with
an app on my phone to do that.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.350
But I was interested in
perhaps connecting that

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.900
with sensor data so
that I can basically

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.780
take that sensor data
for my own personal self,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.650
be able to track
patterns in that,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.230
and also connect it
with constant feedback

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.140
back to myself every hour
or so how are you feeling

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.390
and maybe train it that way.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.140
ROHAN DIXIT: Yeah.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.570
You could totally use
one of these EEG devices.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.192
Like, for example, our
app Sunlight Meditation.

00:33:09.192 --> 00:33:10.650
It's kind of a
session based thing.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.350
You sit down.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.020
You train your focus for
a certain amount of time

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.511
and then you take the thing off.

00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:17.010
But it does give
you a ton of graphs

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.240
afterwards in terms of
what your attention was

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.940
over that period of time.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.740
It tracks that over
days and weeks.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.310
So you can actually start to
see some trends in that way.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.310
And all that data is fully open,
so you can export it and slice

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.240
and dice it however you see fit.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.796
That might be one thing to do.

00:33:32.796 --> 00:33:34.670
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about whether you

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.080
have done any research for
using these kinds of devices

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.725
for people who have
depression or memory loss.

00:33:44.725 --> 00:33:50.992
That meditation would help
them to getting better.

00:33:50.992 --> 00:33:51.700
ROHAN DIXIT: Yes.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.575
It's a good question.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.760
So meditation does actually
provide-- at least in studies

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.600
that have been undertaken
thus far-- some resilience

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.980
to both anxiety and depression.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.210
The mechanism for that is
not totally understood,

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.170
but it seems to be the case.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:14.830
So if you're able to kind
of control your attention,

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.249
you kind of decide to a
degree what you think about.

00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:19.040
And most people that
suffer from depression

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.574
suffer from this
ruminative loop.

00:34:20.574 --> 00:34:22.699
This is what it's described
like in the literature.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.312
Basically that's like a
very obscure and obtuse way

00:34:25.312 --> 00:34:27.520
of describing just negative
thoughts that kind of run

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.630
through your head.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.500
Negative self talk.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.080
Everybody has that to a degree.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.320
But oftentimes people that are
depressed can't turn it off.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.560
And to a degree that's a
selective attention problem.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.449
So if you can train
your attention

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:41.404
to focus on whatever
it is you like,

00:34:41.404 --> 00:34:43.320
then you can probably
move your attention away

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.670
from those thoughts
and towards things

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.550
that are more positive
and beneficial to you.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.135
So meditation, if
you think of it

00:34:52.135 --> 00:34:53.510
in terms of
attentional training,

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.159
just builds your
attentional muscle.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.150
So I think that is how
it does actually offer

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.300
some benefits with depression.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.190
You also mentioned memory loss.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.739
Memory is like a several
interacting subsystems

00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:07.280
in the brain.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.760
So I'm not an expert, so
I'm probably not the person

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.040
to talk to you about it.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.730
But I think it is the case
that intentional training can

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.790
improve your short term memory.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:23.605
So not to tout
meditation as a panacea,

00:35:23.605 --> 00:35:24.980
but I think it
does actually help

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.630
to a degree with memory loss
and certainly with depression.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.100
AUDIENCE: So do you know
the kind of research

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.100
done with people who
selected a group of people,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.880
for example, with depression
with this training compared

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.490
with people who have not
been using this technology

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.519
to see the difference?

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:48.310
ROHAN DIXIT: Right.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.210
I think there are probably
a dozen studies that

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.880
have looked at that
now in relatively

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.304
well controlled ways.

00:35:55.304 --> 00:35:56.970
So usually what you
do is try to compare

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.170
people who learn mindfulness
usually through this course.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.490
And most hospitals
now, there are maybe

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.080
450 hospitals at this
point around the country

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.190
that offer meditation
as training

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.412
for people with anxiety and
depression, also chronic pain.

00:36:10.412 --> 00:36:12.370
And the way they do that
is through this course

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.520
called MBSR, or Mindfulness
Based Stress Reduction.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.110
It's about an eight week course.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:21.600
And it kind of guides you
through learning meditation.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.750
And I think that has
been shown to be quite

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.170
efficacious with depression.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.820
So, if you like, I
can get your email

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.075
and send you some of those
studies if that's helpful.

00:36:29.075 --> 00:36:29.616
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:29.616 --> 00:36:30.360
My name is Alex.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.930
And I missed the consciousness
hacking in San Francisco.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.280
So I'm so excited to come today.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.060
So I've been reading
your stuff since then.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.940
And I was really
interested in that

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.830
because you studied with monks.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.690
I was wondering what
your thoughts were

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:53.590
that is this almost a result
of contemporary society

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:58.040
that there's so much external
stimuli that we need a device

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.330
or that we need some
kind of hardware now,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.780
some kind of biofeedback,
whereas for the past 5,000

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.280
years, monks were
able to do it just

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.770
through training the brain?

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.350
Like it's just
something I wasn't

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.880
quite able to form the
question like how I wanted,

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.120
but could you speak to that?

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.750
ROHAN DIXIT: Sure.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.770
That's something I
think about a lot.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.665
The amount of sensory
input we have on a day

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:24.320
to day basis in terms of
distractions is out of control.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.240
Like it's probably never been
seen in human history before.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.240
I mean checking your
email, Twitter, Facebook.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.430
There's just
constant distraction.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.210
And to a degree that's being
facilitated by technology.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.960
So it's a little bit ironic
to use that same technology

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.460
kind of approach to get
you out of that loop.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.780
Perhaps that's the way to do it.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.370
I think in years
past probably people

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.500
were able to sustain
their attention

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.990
for longer periods of time.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.580
And that's probably a factor
of having less input and less

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.490
distraction in general.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.840
So I do feel that
technology now has a role

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.800
to play in bringing us back to
the ability to pay attention,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.386
not only to things around
us in terms of focus,

00:38:07.386 --> 00:38:09.010
but also to pay
attention to ourselves.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.530
And I think that's where a
lot of self growth happens.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.530
That's what I'm
really interested in

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.970
because that's where a lot of my
growth personally has happened.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.940
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned biofeedback.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:24.820
Have you given any thought
to active direction

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.450
of the person using the device?

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.565
So, for example, there's
one device out there

00:38:28.565 --> 00:38:32.070
I think it's called
Respirator which uses music.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.780
And it slows down
the music in response

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.850
to where it thinks you're going.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.390
But it sort of encourages
you to go there.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.850
I don't know what
class of device

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.980
that is, but is that something
you're interested in?

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.545
ROHAN DIXIT: It is.

00:38:46.545 --> 00:38:48.670
And, yeah, we have thought
about that a little bit.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.460
So what you're doing basically
is guiding someone a little.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.050
So over time as you're
listening to the music that's

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.340
being generated
by your breathing,

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.910
if I understand that
device correctly,

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.930
you're sort of building an
association between the music

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.030
and your state of mind.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.150
At least your breathing
pattern, right?

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:16.310
So just like anything else, like
smells of your childhood say,

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:19.320
the ability to smell like fresh
baked chocolate chip cookies

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.080
can remind you of
mom instantaneously

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.540
and a whole suite of memories.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.250
So if there's a
certain music that's

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.190
generated when your
breathing is calm

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.840
and then you play that music
back to somebody, most likely

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.130
you are able to shift
them into that state.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.910
So by playing with
their current rhythm,

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.765
like this is my heart rhythm.

00:39:38.765 --> 00:39:41.140
If I'm feeling it
vibrating against me,

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.080
say that's one of
the modes where

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.930
that we've built where
kind of the chest strap

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.590
constantly vibrates
at every heart beat.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.630
It's not super useful, but it is
useful in the sense of guiding,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.210
which is why I built it.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.240
The idea would be my
heart rate is starting

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.490
to go up a little
bit, maybe too much,

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.760
and the sensor is
reading when my heart

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.260
beat is happening and
then sort of slowing it

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.500
down a little bit.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.130
So the feedback that I'm used
to getting on every heartbeat

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.740
is delayed a slight amount.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.900
And so I feel the
vibration as if I

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.310
had a slightly slower heart
beat than I really do,

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.730
which then guides me towards
a state of a slower heartbeat.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.760
So there's a ton of interaction
I think that is possible there

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.740
through biofeedback.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.550
And it's funny that it hasn't
really been explored much.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.440
But I think that's partially
a factor biofeedback becoming

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.040
popular in the '70s, promising
a little too much too soon,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.497
and not having the computing
power to really wear

00:40:32.497 --> 00:40:34.330
these things around
with you, which is where

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.912
the true benefit I think comes.

00:40:35.912 --> 00:40:38.120
You may be familiar with
these neuro feedback clinics

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.060
and biofeedback clinics.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.390
They're all over the country.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.840
You basically go to
an office, sit down

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.510
for like an hour and a half
once a week or once a month

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.750
and pay $100 or $500
or whatever and try

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.630
to gain some biofeedback
knowledge that way.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.310
But I think now
that the devices are

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.170
much smaller and portable
a lot of these applications

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.560
may become pretty commonplace.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.540
AUDIENCE: You say that people
in long term relationships

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.927
can synchronize
their heart rates.

00:41:03.927 --> 00:41:05.510
I thought that was
really interesting.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.540
And I was wondering if you know
the direction of the causality

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.300
there?

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.790
Do people who
spend a lot of time

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.590
together learn to
synchronize their hearts

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.600
or do people who are unable to
synchronize their hearts have

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.540
relationship trouble and break
up before a year has passed?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.920
ROHAN DIXIT: That's
a fair point.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.722
And I don't think
anyone knows the answer.

00:41:26.722 --> 00:41:28.430
But what people did
notice in that study,

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.840
in particular, which I
guess is all I can speak to,

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.280
is that in general when they
looked at the sort of direction

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:41.290
between the couple in terms
of who was actually syncing

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.400
to the other, I
mean-- you can imagine

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.070
that there are sort of like
two metronomes happening--

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.320
and what they found
was that in general one

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.560
member of the couple tended
to sort of see or empathize

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.350
or perceive the
other's oscillation

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.320
and sync to them,
rather than them both

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.954
coming to some sort of
inbetween 50/50 sort of split.

00:42:00.954 --> 00:42:02.370
And in general
what they found was

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.600
that the women in
the relationship

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.290
tended to be able
to do that to a much

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.110
greater degree than the men.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.702
So that may have some kind of
insight into your question.

00:42:12.702 --> 00:42:14.160
AUDIENCE: As a
follow up, are there

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.420
any other kinds of relationships
where this happens?

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.980
Like could you use
it to predict who

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.590
would make compatible co-workers
or astronauts on a mission

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.082
to Mars or something like that?

00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:24.540
ROHAN DIXIT: I
think it's possible.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.847
And the only time I've seen
this study before-- it's

00:42:26.847 --> 00:42:28.680
a pretty recent phenomena
that hasn't really

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.210
been studied much-- was with
I believe family members.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.460
This was a study out of Spain.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.219
And people were doing this
fire walking exercise where

00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:39.510
there was a bunch of coals
and one member of the family

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.280
jumps up and kind of
walks across the coals.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.780
And what they found was that
members of their family,

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.200
even watching them
do that, tended

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.980
to synchronize with the
HRV of the person who

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.020
was doing the fire walk.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.760
So it seems to be the case that
in any close relationship kind

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.565
elicits that.

00:42:55.565 --> 00:42:58.470
But I think it's
too early to tell.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.010
AUDIENCE: So going back
to studying the monks

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.310
and going into the meditation.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.800
So how do you know that that's
correlated with brain signals

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.767
and not just relaxing the
forehead muscle or something?

00:43:13.767 --> 00:43:16.100
ROHAN DIXIT: How do we know
that what is not correlated?

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.040
AUDIENCE: That going in to
meditation in the signal

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.930
that you saw off the
EEG is not correlated

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.215
with relaxing a muscle versus
what's actually coming out

00:43:27.215 --> 00:43:28.220
of the brain?

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.030
ROHAN DIXIT: Sure.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.420
So EEG has been studied for
like maybe like 100 years now.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.260
And that is a problem that
every EEG study runs into.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.760
And so there's kind
of a whole suite

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.990
of just standard techniques
to get rid of muscle artifact.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.990
It looks a lot different
than brainwave activity

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.470
in terms of the
frequency response

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.971
and also the amplitude
of the signal.

00:43:47.971 --> 00:43:49.470
So, in general,
people build in what

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.770
are called artifact
reject algorithms,

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:57.810
just muscle basically signal
rejection that kind of tries

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.060
to see if there is in fact
forehead muscle activity or eye

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.000
blinks or whatever
and reject them.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.470
So that's one way
to do it, another

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.791
is-- I think that's probably
a good enough answer.

00:44:09.791 --> 00:44:12.290
There's a ton there actually
in terms of the algorithms that

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.397
are used to do that.

00:44:14.397 --> 00:44:17.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:21.865 --> 00:44:24.787
--what we can expect from
consumer based hardware.

00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.735
Like, you mentioned
the NeuroSky sensors.

00:44:26.735 --> 00:44:30.631
Can we actually get an
interesting signal from that

00:44:30.631 --> 00:44:34.266
or do we have to go with
something much more fancy?

00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:36.390
ROHAN DIXIT: That is a
great question and something

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.500
that we've struggled with a lot.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.967
So the NeuroSky is probably
the cheapest EEG device

00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:43.050
that's ever been released.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.560
It's a single sensor.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.112
And it's pretty noisy.

00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:48.820
I mean, coming from
a research background

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.040
where we use higher quality
research grade rather

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.940
than clinical grade EEG, the
signal is almost night and day.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.960
To get any kind of useful
signal out of for example

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.965
a NeuroSky is an incredible
feat of signal processing

00:45:02.965 --> 00:45:03.840
and machine learning.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.700
And we're helped by the fact
that in meditation usually

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.860
your eyes are closed
and you're pretty still.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.520
So basically what
we have found is

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.710
a kind of subset of
what you can measure

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.460
in terms of brain
activity and an activity

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.043
that allows you to
do that pretty well

00:45:20.043 --> 00:45:22.930
and get a relatively
good signal.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.360
There's a device
coming out pretty soon

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.112
called the Muse which I
think is just now fulfilling

00:45:28.112 --> 00:45:28.820
their pre-orders.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.160
And that's a much more
high quality device.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.340
I think it's five sensors
or six rather than just one.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:40.009
But I think for at least for
the foreseeable short term

00:45:40.009 --> 00:45:41.550
future, a lot of
these consumer grade

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.090
EEG devices are
going to be much less

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:49.650
high quality than your passive
electrode kind of clinical EEG.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.150
All right.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.420
Thank you very much.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.770
[APPLAUSE]
