00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.600
Hey folks, I’m Phil Plait and this is Crash
Course Astronomy. You know, I can’t think

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
of any object in the sky that’s captured
our imagination like Mars has. The Red Planet

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
was once thought to be the god of war, and
in more modern times has been the setting

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.709
for a zillion science fiction novels, movies,
TV shows, and more. And now that we’ve gone

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:24.920
there, landed there, roved there, it’s become
far more than a simple background for an alien

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.030
invasion story: It’s become a world, a place…
and maybe, one day, a destination.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.520
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and
the outermost of the terrestrial planets;

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.300
that is, ones that are rocky and similar in
size to Earth. It orbits on average a little

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.540
over 200 million kilometers from the Sun.
That puts it outside Earth’s orbit, and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.300
it never gets much closer to us than about
60 million kilometers. It’s colder than

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.340
us, too, with an average surface temperature
of about 60 below 0 Celsius. It’s not a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.540
terribly big planet; it’s only about half
the size of Earth. Still, when it’s closest

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.620
to us in space it shines brightly in our night
sky, a red beacon glowering like an angry eye.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.320
No doubt this is why ancient civilizations
associated it with war! But it turns out Mars

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.480
isn’t red because it’s bloody. It’s
red because it’s rusty. Literally.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.299
That red color you see comes from fine-grained
dust on the surface, almost like ruddy talcum

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.869
powder. The dust is rich in iron that’s
oxidized, forming rust. The dust coats a lot

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.040
of the surface, giving it a butterscotch or ochre
coloring, and also gets blown into the atmosphere.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.159
A lot of the surface of Mars is also grey
volcanic rock called basalt, and together

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.250
with other minerals gives Mars its overall
reddish look.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.470
We can get a decent view of Mars from Earth
using telescopes, but small features are maddeningly

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.680
difficult to tease out.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.009
The idea of a clement environment on Mars
stuck with us, though… at least until the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.600
1960s and 70s, when we started send probes
to the planet. They did not see a lovely,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.860
habitable world: Instead, what we got were
photos of a dry, dead, forbidding planet.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.850
The surface geography of Mars is weird. There’s
a huge dichotomy between the northern hemisphere,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.690
which is mostly smooth plains, and the southern,
which is cratered, hilly highlands. Apparently,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.720
Mars suffered a tremendous impact from an
object hundreds of kilometers across eons

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.960
ago. It left behind a vast basin near the
north pole of the planet, which filled with

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.940
lava. Topographic maps show the northern hemisphere
has much lower elevations than the southern,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.510
and can be depressed by several kilometers.
Walking from the south to the north pole is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.200
essentially all downhill!

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.910
Another large feature is the Tharsis bulge,
a huge plateau that’s home to the four biggest

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.530
volcanoes on Mars, and the largest volcanoe
in the solar system: Olympus Mons. Mars doesn’t

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.300
have plate tectonics today, but there’s
evidence it once did. Tharsis was probably

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.300
over a hot spot, a plume of hotter material
rising up through the planet’s mantle. That’s

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.400
what may have created the bulge, and as the
plate slowly moved the plume punched through

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.750
the crust to create the chain of three smaller
(but still huge) volcanoes.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.780
But the grandest of the surface features on
Mars is easily Valles Marineris; a canyon

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.569
discovered when the Mariner 9 probe orbited
Mars in the 1970s. It’s a gigantic crack

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.140
in the surface of Mars 4000 kilometers long,
200 kilometers wide, and 7 kilometers deep.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.540
That’s 10 times longer and 10 times wider
than the Grand Canyon! Unlike the Grand Canyon,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.040
it wasn’t carved by water; it may have formed
when the Tharsis bulge rose up, creating the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.209
valley as a radial crack in the surface.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.239
Mars, like Earth, has polar ice caps. Both
are mostly water ice, several kilometers thick,

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.390
but they get seasonal coatings of dry ice,
frozen carbon dioxide, that covers them from

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.010
1 to 8 meters thick. This happens in their
respective winters; in the summer, sunlight

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.640
thaws the CO2, turning it directly into a gas which then
blows away from the pole, generating fierce winds.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.530
Speaking of which, Mars has an atmosphere,
but it’s thin. Pressure at the surface is

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.489
less than 1% of Earth’s, and the air is
mostly carbon dioxide. In fact, as much as

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.340
a third of the Martian atmosphere freezes
out every winter to coat the polar ice caps!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.250
The air doesn’t provide much of a shield
from asteroid and comet impacts, so the surface

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.959
is heavily cratered—and it still gets hit
today. The space probe Mars Reconnaissance

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.199
Orbiter has been circling Mars so long, it’s actually
seen new craters from fresh impacts on the surface!

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.999
However, the atmosphere is substantial enough
to interact with the surface. Winds blow seasonally,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.040
filling craters with the ubiquitous dust.
There’s also sand on Mars, made of eroded

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.740
basaltic rock, so it’s grey. The wind blows
this into beautiful dunes, including series

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.980
of parallel ridges in crater floors, and barchan
or horseshoe-shaped dunes.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.600
Mars also gets dust devils, towering vortices
of wind similar to tornadoes. These dust devils

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.750
have been seen from orbit, and when they blow
the red dust around on the greyish basaltic

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.200
plains, they can leave behind incredibly complex
and beautiful curlicues.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.400
One of my favorite recent discoveries about
Mars is that it has avalanches! There are

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.599
lots of cliffs towering above the surface,
and in the spring, when buried frozen carbon

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.639
dioxide thaws, it can dislodge material, creating
tremendous cascades of rock and dust. Several

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.490
of these have been caught in the act by orbiting
space probes.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.830
Mars has two moons: Small, potato-shaped rocks
named Deimos and Phobos. Both are tiny; Phobos

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.409
is about 25 kilometers across, and Deimos
just 15. Both look very much like asteroids,

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.529
and may indeed have been captured by Mars
from the nearby asteroid belt. To be honest,

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.060
though, it’s not clear what their origins
are.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:31.879
Phobos orbits Mars only 6000 km over the surface,
and it moves so rapidly in its orbit that

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.689
it orbits faster than Mars rotates; from the
surface it appears to rise in the west and

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:42.159
set in the east. Tides from Mars are altering
its orbit, slowly lowering Phobos closer and

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.559
closer to the surface. In a few million years,
it’s expected to drop low enough to actually

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:51.789
enter the atmosphere and impact the surface.
That’ll be really exciting to watch

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.229
…from a safe distance.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.729
Incidentally, from some locations on the surface,
the moons can be seen to transit the Sun,

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.549
passing directly across its face. The rovers
on Mars have taken lots of pictures of these

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:03.040
events, which is pretty cool.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.279
So Mars has rocks, air, weather, and volcanoes…
but what about water? If it has frozen water

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.919
at the poles, what about the rest of the planet?

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.439
We know there’s water ice at the mid-latitudes
of Mars; some recent small asteroid impacts

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.939
have white area around them; underground deposits
of ice splashed out by the impact. There’s

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.169
no strong evidence of liquid water on the
surface of Mars right now though. Some crater

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.479
walls collapse a bit and have dark channels
running down them, which look like they could’ve

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.660
been carved by flowing water, but there are other
possible sources too, so their cause still isn't certain.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.719
But in the past, things were different. Mars
was once very wet. There’s tons of evidence

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:44.009
for flowing water on the surface long ago,
including dry river beds, dry lakes, sedimentary

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:48.920
layers, and minerals we know need water to
form. There’s even evidence Mars had oceans.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.199
But that’s all gone now. What happened?
It’s not clear. Billions of years ago Mars

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.919
was almost certainly warmer and had a thicker
atmosphere. But for some reason, its internal

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.119
dynamo shut down, and its magnetic field disappeared.
This left it vulnerable to the solar wind,

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:08.990
and over billions of years the Martian atmosphere
was eroded away. The water went with it.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.530
This raises another obvious question: If it
had air and water, could it have had life?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.679
That question wasn’t taken terribly seriously
just a few decades ago, but now we’re very

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:23.339
interested in it, enough to spend a lot of
money sending probes to Mars to look at what

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:28.240
conditions for life are like now and once
were in the past. It’s still an open question,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.740
and we know life on Earth got its start not
long after the surface cooled. Mars is smaller

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.270
and cooled more quickly after its formation,
so it’s not crazy at all to wonder if life

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.130
formed there, even before it did here.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.750
Intriguingly, the Curiosity rover detected
simple organic molecules in a rock sample—this

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.640
doesn’t mean there’s life, but it means
the ingredients were and are there. It also

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:54.270
detected a brief spike in methane, a volatile
gas that can be produced by life… as well

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.190
as by other, geologic processes. The evidence
we have right now is maddeningly vague,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.260
but we’re just starting out. Give it time!

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.740
Mars isn’t the same planet it used to be.
But that doesn’t mean it’s off limits.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.400
Getting to Mars is hard—over half the missions
sent there have failed—but not impossible.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.500
We’ve had amazing successes, including orbiters,
landers, and rovers. I’d say we’ve learned as much

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.540
about the Red Planet in the past couple of decades
as we had in all the centuries of study before them.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.560
Still, all we’ve sent are robots. They’re
good, and relatively inexpensive, but they’re

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.720
slow. They can only cover so much ground.
A human could do as much in a week as a rover

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:34.680
could in years… but humans are fragile.
We need water, air, food; we aren’t terribly

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.829
tolerant of radiation or vacuum.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:40.810
But the idea of sending people to Mars isn’t
as nuts as it might have once been. We’re

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.660
getting better at building rockets, and the
tech needed for human exploration of Mars

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.940
is being developed now. There are even discussions
about landing sites, and where to build bases.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.200
One interesting idea is to use lava tubes—underground
caverns created by ancient lava flows, where

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:59.429
the top of the flow cooled and created a roof.
We know these exist on Mars because we’ve

00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:03.899
seen holes in the roofs, called skylights,
openings to the cavern below. This would provide

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:08.519
shelter from solar radiation, protection from
weather—Mars can get some pretty nasty dust

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:12.479
storms in the spring—and could be sealed
up and filled with air. From there, a lot of the

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.760
planet could be explored, and in a few years we'd once
again dwarf everything we’ve learned up to that point.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:22.839
I can’t say when this’ll happen—20 years
from now, maybe 30 or more—but it’ll happen.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.120
Eventually, there will be life on Mars. And
it’ll be us.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:30.360
Today you learned that Mars is smaller and
colder than Earth. It has polar ice caps,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.460
and lots of rusty dust covering its surface.
It also has the solar system’s largest volcano

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.860
and valley. It’s dry now, but once upon
a time was much warmer and wetter, with a

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.670
thicker atmosphere. It may even have had life.
