a little bit not so much about financial

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:24.459
a little bit not so much about financial
 

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.939
a little bit not so much about financial
education but more and more thinking

and we needed to make sure that that
 

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.160
and we needed to make sure that that
replication involved apples to apples

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.170
replication involved apples to apples
 

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.890

part of this study and I think there

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360
part of this study and I think there
 

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.779
part of this study and I think there
were 5,000 of them or 3,000 and there's

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:23.789
were 5,000 of them or 3,000 and there's
 

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:25.159
were 5,000 of them or 3,000 and there's
something like that we knew that a huge

something like that we knew that a huge
 

00:28:25.169 --> 00:28:26.360

and we thought well you're measuring the
 

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.560
and we thought well you're measuring the
impact of money you're gonna hand them a

as an example when I was at Columbia in
2004 in 2002 2006 my field one of my

know we know that these clients have a
 

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:11.210
know we know that these clients have a
lot of issues whether it's their mental

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220
lot of issues whether it's their mental
 

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.039
lot of issues whether it's their mental
illness they're homeless and you know

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:20.670
then address some of these issues
 

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.240

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.720
I think that's how you do it you stare
them with something helpful and then you

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:46.730
them with something helpful and then you
 

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.620
them with something helpful and then you
sucker-punch them with something

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:48.630
sucker-punch them with something
 

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.839
sucker-punch them with something
long-term helpful that's not the

00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:50.849
long-term helpful that's not the
 

00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:52.750
long-term helpful that's not the

regularly regularly provide so I was
 

00:56:17.849 --> 00:56:20.030
regularly regularly provide so I was
just wondering where whether there have

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040
just wondering where whether there have
 

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.560

great now we're very excited about it
 

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.720
great now we're very excited about it
so so when you take a look at that I

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:08.730
so so when you take a look at that I
 

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.190

think it's our very first report where
we sort of lay out our quick lessons and

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.030
we sort of lay out our quick lessons and
 

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.970
we sort of lay out our quick lessons and

it's about finding the intersections of
 

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:20.750
it's about finding the intersections of
sectors that that get that their stress

research for the past ten years in

00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:10.919
research for the past ten years in
 

00:58:10.919 --> 00:58:12.289
research for the past ten years in
developing countries primarily

00:58:12.289 --> 00:58:12.299
developing countries primarily
 

00:58:12.299 --> 00:58:15.380
developing countries primarily
sub-saharan Africa so it's just really

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:15.390
sub-saharan Africa so it's just really
 

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.329
sub-saharan Africa so it's just really
interesting to listen to the to the

00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339
interesting to listen to the to the
 

00:58:17.339 --> 00:58:18.319
interesting to listen to the to the
us-based

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:18.329
us-based
 

00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:20.719
us-based
trajectory of how this is unfolded

00:58:20.719 --> 00:58:20.729
trajectory of how this is unfolded
 

00:58:20.729 --> 00:58:22.489
trajectory of how this is unfolded
because you've pointed to many

00:58:22.489 --> 00:58:22.499
because you've pointed to many
 

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.380
because you've pointed to many
similarities that are taking place in

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:24.390
similarities that are taking place in
 

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:27.229
similarities that are taking place in
Africa as well for example the distrust

00:58:27.229 --> 00:58:27.239
Africa as well for example the distrust
 

00:58:27.239 --> 00:58:30.739
Africa as well for example the distrust
of banks the myth that poor people don't

00:58:30.739 --> 00:58:30.749
of banks the myth that poor people don't
 

00:58:30.749 --> 00:58:33.319
of banks the myth that poor people don't
have any money to say don't want to save

00:58:33.319 --> 00:58:33.329
have any money to say don't want to save
 

00:58:33.329 --> 00:58:36.169
have any money to say don't want to save
but what we found in the research is

00:58:36.169 --> 00:58:36.179
but what we found in the research is
 

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:40.069
but what we found in the research is
that low-income people save a save a

00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079
that low-income people save a save a
 

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:41.629
that low-income people save a save a
higher proportion of their income

00:58:41.629 --> 00:58:41.639
higher proportion of their income
 

00:58:41.639 --> 00:58:43.699
higher proportion of their income
compared to middle income people so

00:58:43.699 --> 00:58:43.709
compared to middle income people so
 

00:58:43.709 --> 00:58:46.009
compared to middle income people so
that's very interesting my question to

00:58:46.009 --> 00:58:46.019
that's very interesting my question to
 

00:58:46.019 --> 00:58:49.339
that's very interesting my question to
you is really exciting yes my question

00:58:49.339 --> 00:58:49.349
you is really exciting yes my question
 

00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:53.149
you is really exciting yes my question
is we do research and as you mentioned

00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:53.159
is we do research and as you mentioned
 

00:58:53.159 --> 00:58:55.489
is we do research and as you mentioned
the the difficulty in working with banks

00:58:55.489 --> 00:58:55.499
the the difficulty in working with banks
 

00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:57.379
the the difficulty in working with banks
we don't really have an incentive for

00:58:57.379 --> 00:58:57.389
we don't really have an incentive for
 

00:58:57.389 --> 00:58:59.719
we don't really have an incentive for
the banks other than reminding them of

00:58:59.719 --> 00:58:59.729
the banks other than reminding them of
 

00:58:59.729 --> 00:59:02.509
the banks other than reminding them of
their corporate social responsibility so

00:59:02.509 --> 00:59:02.519
their corporate social responsibility so
 

00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:04.370
their corporate social responsibility so
I'm wondering you know like what

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380
I'm wondering you know like what
 

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.499
I'm wondering you know like what
strategies you might have in working

00:59:06.499 --> 00:59:06.509
strategies you might have in working
 

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:08.919
strategies you might have in working
with banks and how how do we kind of

00:59:08.919 --> 00:59:08.929
with banks and how how do we kind of
 

00:59:08.929 --> 00:59:11.599
with banks and how how do we kind of
present a long-term business case I mean

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:11.609
present a long-term business case I mean
 

00:59:11.609 --> 00:59:13.429
present a long-term business case I mean
this is probably a longer session no I

00:59:13.429 --> 00:59:13.439
this is probably a longer session no I
 

00:59:13.439 --> 00:59:15.549
this is probably a longer session no I
it's a great I have an answer for you

00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559
it's a great I have an answer for you
 

00:59:15.559 --> 00:59:19.759
it's a great I have an answer for you
when one of the our first research

00:59:19.759 --> 00:59:19.769
when one of the our first research
 

00:59:19.769 --> 00:59:23.120
when one of the our first research
studies was on the marketplace of the

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:23.130
studies was on the marketplace of the
 

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.969
studies was on the marketplace of the
unbanked and we did something beyond the

00:59:25.969 --> 00:59:25.979
