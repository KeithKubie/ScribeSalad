00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
Making a movie is a strenuous process that
can take a toll on even the greatest of filmmakers.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.750
They spend so much time analyzing each frame
for a long period of time, that they’re

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
just happy to get it out to the world. But
if they looked at their final cut one last

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
time before sending it off, they may have
been able to catch one last mistake. Here

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.340
are Screen Rant’s 10 continuity fails in
popular films.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
Spider-Man

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.539
Peter Parker undergoes a tremendous physical
transformation when he’s bit by a radioactive

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.070
spider, and it takes some time getting used
to his new abilities. When he’s testing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
out his web slinging powers in his bedroom,
he accidentally makes a lamp crash against

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
the wall. When Aunt May knocks on the door
to investigate the noise, that same lamp is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460
perfectly intact in the next shot. Since director
Sam Raimi had just shown it being destroyed,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.100
you’d think he would have noticed this.
Chalk it up to the dangers of shooting out

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.539
of sequence.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.539
The Avengers

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.640
Halfway through The Avengers, SHIELD’s helicarrier
is attacked by a brainwashed Hawkeye under

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.719
the control of Loki. It’s an exciting set
piece that kicks the film into gear and leads

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.990
to the Avengers assembling to save the world.
Even gravity couldn’t handle it all. When

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.530
Nick Fury tells Iron Man the helicarrier is
falling, a display Tony Stark is looking at

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
reads 15,000 feet. A few minutes later when
Fury looks at his own display, it says 18,000

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.119
feet. Which one is it really?

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.340
That’s left up to the viewer.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.850
The Dark Knight Rises

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.280
Bruce Wayne loses his fortune after Bane forges
stock trades using Bruce’s finger prints,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.150
and apparently Gotham City lost several hours
of time. When Bane and his henchmen arrive

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.310
to the stock exchange to complete their task,
it is clearly midday and light outside. But

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.259
once they leave with hostages on their motorcycles,
it’s become pitch dark – even though they

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.320
only needed 10 minutes for the transaction
to take place. It is true that Batman action

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.659
looks a lot cooler at night, but when a director
like Christopher Nolan is involved, audiences

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.079
expect more consistency. There’s no logical
explanation for the drastic time shift.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
Star Wars

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.049
Audiences will always remember the first time
they saw Star Wars’ climactic Death Star

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.049
trench run. It’s a sequence that still thrills
to this day. One of its most tense moments

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.290
is when Darth Vader thinks he has Luke dead
to rights, but he misfires and hits R2-D2

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.099
instead. After the blast, the shot cuts directly
to R2, but the little droid seems 100 percent

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.569
fine. It isn’t until after Luke lands back
on Yavin that we see the effects of the impact,

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.200
with oil spilled all over R2’s body. The
special effects budget was tight on the original

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.239
film, so maybe they didn’t have time to
get a new shot.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.270
Back to the Future

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.930
Marty McFly has to make sure his parents get
together in 1955, or else he’ll be erased

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.780
from existence. He uses a picture of him and
his siblings to see how long he has until

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.069
time runs out. Things are in dire straights
during the Enchanted Under the Sea dance,

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.959
as Marty begins to fade from the photograph.
It was such an important item, but Robert

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.489
Zemeckis had a tough time keeping track of
it. In the long shots featuring Marty playing

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.220
with the band, the picture is nowhere to be
seen. It’s only in Michael J. Fox’s close-ups.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.239
Jurassic World

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.700
Moviegoers, and Chris Pratt’s Owen, found
it ridiculous that Claire spends the entire

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.150
movie running around the dinosaur amusement
park in high heel shoes. It seemed impossible

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.950
that she could survive the chaos wearing them,
but she did. Claire even found time to go

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.560
shopping for a new pair. While the shoes get
dirty as the movie progresses, they’re squeaky

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.440
clean when she arrives at the t-rex paddock
to unleash the original t-rex. When she leads

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.530
it to the Indominus rex, the shoes are once
again dirty. Since there was a line of dialogue

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.599
dedicated to the footwear, you’d think they’d
pay more attention to it.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.090
Star Trek Into Darkness

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.400
When Kirk gets the Enterprise taken away from
him, he’s rightfully bummed out and decides

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.860
to spend his night getting drunk in a bar.
And he must have ordered quite a few rounds,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.299
because the amount of beer in his glass changes
depending on the shot. When Admiral Pike comes

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.750
to check on Kirk, the young captain’s mug
is either full or almost empty. It’s an

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.470
obvious case of blending takes to complete
the scene, but since Kirk’s glass is in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.030
the foreground of the shot, it would have
been nice if its levels were consistent. Kirk

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.290
liked to party, but not this hard.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.290
Argo

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.450
The fateful moment in Ben Affleck’s Oscar
winner comes when the group is searching for

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.620
a screenplay to make their fake movie. Tony
Mendez stumbles across a script called Argo,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.049
which has black vinyl covering and gold lettering.
It’s the perfect one for the CIA’s mission,

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.750
and Mendez was so excited, he must have ripped
that recognizable cover right off. In the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.640
very next shot, as Mendez brings the script
out to his friends, the cover is missing.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.320
Perhaps this is why Affleck got snubbed for
Best Director?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.959
Goes to show that even Best Pictures have
imperfections.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.380
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.340
At the end of the first film in the epic trilogy,
the Fellowship has been splintered. Frodo

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.270
decides it’s best for the group if he goes
to Mt. Doom on his own, but his trusted companion

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.560
Sam is determined to go with him. As Frodo
begins to paddle away, Sam – who can’t

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.840
swim – runs into the water after his friend.
Sam begins to sink to the bottom, and Frodo

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.120
has to pull him out to save his life. Turns
out, Sam’s clothes were magic, since they’re

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.190
dry when Sam is back on the boat. Fans were
too caught up in the emotions to notice, but

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.290
it’s hard to miss.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.310
Casino Royale

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.460
As 007 enters a poker tournament, he has to
create a password for the bank account to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.710
deposit his winnings. The film reveals that
he chose “Vesper” as the password, after

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.740
the love of his life he met on the mission.
However, the film depicts Bond typing something

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.419
completely different. When he starts to enter
the password at the casino, the first key

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.160
he hits is 5, which typically has the letters
J, K, and L. Vesper contains none of those

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.280
letters, so did Bond just change the password
at some point during the game?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.289
Anything’s possible for a super spy.

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.820
So what do you think of our list?
