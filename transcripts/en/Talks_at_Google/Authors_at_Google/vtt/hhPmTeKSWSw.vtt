00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:09.730
MALE SPEAKER: How
many people here are

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.660
entirely new to meditation?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.780
OK, cool, a few.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.810
How many people here are new to
compassion and heart practices

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000
flavor of meditation?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.520
OK, cool.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.390
How many people are
horrified and scared

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.900
at the idea of sitting
for 45 minutes straight?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.894
It's OK to be honest.

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:34.762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.500
SHARON SALZBERG:
Sitting where you are.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.735
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so there
were two brave people

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:41.770
who raised their hands.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.610
I'm going to guess that there's
probably like a 3x or 4x shame

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.020
reduction factor.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.662
So what we might
do is we might--

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.120
SHARON SALZBERG:
We'll break it up.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.500
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
break it up a little bit.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.170
We'll do 20 minutes
of one flavor

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.090
and then 20 minutes
of another flavor

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.664
and leave the option for
Q&amp;A if people want to.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.330
But if there's no
questions, we can also

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.105
just hold the Q&amp;A until the end.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.023
So does that work for everyone?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.550
All right, that sounds cool.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:13.800
All right.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.914
You want to jump in?

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:15.830
SHARON SALZBERG: Sure.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.130
Hello.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.280
Thank you again for
this invitation.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.690
It's so great to be here.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.720
MALE SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.760
SHARON SALZBERG:
Makes me very happy.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.820
And for Lindsey, who
put in so much work,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.180
I'm sure, to make it all happen,
and to all of you for coming.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.740
So what we thought we
would do was really

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.200
what was just described.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
I'll give a very,
very brief overview

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.540
of different kinds of
meditation, and we'll do one,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.260
and we'll take a break and
see if you have any questions

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.420
or comments in that break.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.130
And maybe not.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.710
And then we'll go on
and do the other kind,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.450
and then we'll just have fun
together and dialogue and being

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.350
together, and further questions.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.450
So I went to India to
learn meditation in 1970.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.034
I'd taken an Asian
philosophy course

00:02:09.034 --> 00:02:11.070
in the university
I was going to,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.910
and the university
also had a program,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.490
like an independent
study program.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.870
And if you created a
project that they liked,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.740
you could go anywhere
in the world.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.870
And I had this kind
of strange desire

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.940
to learn how to meditate.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.000
So I created a project.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.083
I said, I want to go to
India and learn mediation.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.890
And they said OK, so off I went.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.540
I came back in 1974 with the
encouragement and, actually,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.790
insistence of one of
my teachers to teach.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.100
So I came back as a teacher.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.470
So that was really the
beginning of many things.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.330
And in those days, one never
heard the word mindfulness.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.920
And if you said you
were-- as I would

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.767
in some social
situation-- people

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:56.850
would say, what do you do?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.100
And I'd say, teach meditation.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.850
It would be kind of
like, ew, that's weird.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.910
Which is very,
very different now.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.160
So there are lots of ways
of slicing and dicing

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.710
and categorizing
meditation practice.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.270
I always think of meditation
is a skills training,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.950
and primarily in three
different qualities.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.280
One is concentration,
so that we're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.220
less scattered or
distracted-- less fragmented.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.160
We feel more of a sense
of presence and wholeness

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.780
and focus.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.080
One is mindfulness
itself, which feels

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.110
like the word of the hour.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.340
Classically, it means
a quality of attention

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.510
so that as we pay
attention, our perception's

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.320
not so distorted by bias.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.570
We're not laying on so many
preconceptions or old fears

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.730
or assumptions, and
we can get much closer

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.680
to our experience in that
way, without so many veils

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.030
intruding.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.380
And therefore, mindfulness
is considered the basis

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.420
for insight or wisdom, because
we can get so much more

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.430
connected to things as they
actually are when we're not,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.240
for example, taking the present
moment's experience of it's

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.517
difficult and projecting it into
a seemingly unchanging future,

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:19.100
like, what's this terrible thing
going to feel like in a week?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.060
It's going to be
worse, you know?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.630
And so on.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.690
So that's really the
skill of mindfulness.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.370
And then compassion
and loving kindness

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.550
is like the third great
skill of meditation,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.060
and it is considered a
skill, which is often

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.710
in the West considered
kind of peculiar.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.320
It's a little bit kind of cold
or mechanistic in some ways,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.290
we think, like the idea
of training and compassion

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.080
is just offputting.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.010
And I don't know if
it's that we tend

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.391
to think of
compassion as a gift,

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.015
and you've either got it or you
don't, and if you don't, you're

00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:52.900
out of luck.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.375
Or it's like a seemingly
spontaneous emotional response,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.450
and there's nothing you can do.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.260
But another way of looking
at it from the point of view

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.540
of meditation is
that compassion is

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.890
like an emergent property
of how we pay attention.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.890
And if we shift the way we pay
attention-- so, for example,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.900
we're not overlooking someone
or looking through them

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.570
or discounting
them, we're actually

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.660
looking at them-- then because
of that different quality

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.740
of attention, there will be a
different sense of connection,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.000
and therefore, compassion.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.600
So it, too, is a kind
of attention training.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.270
So in terms of the
larger ways of practice,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.470
there's some practices
that really are largely

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.180
about cultivating mindfulness,
where our goal is not

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180
to have a particular
experience at all,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.650
but to change our relationship
to whatever experience comes up

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.655
so we're more present,
we're more aware,

00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:55.280
we're more balanced, and there's
more insight that can develop.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.389
And that's the first practice
that we're going to do.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.430
Many of you, I'm sure,
are very familiar with it.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.820
A very classic
practice where you

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.200
start with awareness of the
breath, which is certainly

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.920
not the only way to
lay a foundation,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.470
but it's such a
common way in part

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.054
because as my early teachers
would say, first of all,

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:18.470
you don't have to
believe anything

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.610
in order to feel your breath.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.670
It's not tied to any kind
of dogma or faith tradition

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.980
or lack of faith tradition.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.400
If you're breathing,
you can be meditating.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.130
And then as one teacher said-- I
always found it very charming--

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.530
he said the breath
is very portable.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.230
So, you know, we come together.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.590
It's like a formal,
determined sitting.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.020
OK, now I'm going to come
together and sit with people.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.120
And we get used to
coming back to the moment

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.490
and coming back
to ourselves using

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.660
the vehicle of the breath.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.450
And then you're
at work, or you're

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.330
in traffic, or whatever it is.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.810
You have that
means of returning.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.710
And the other set
of practices, which

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.470
we'll do next, while they
involve, to a certain degree,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.860
the development of
mindfulness and a greater

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.690
clarity about our
experience, I call them

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.870
sort of like the stretch.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.070
And that is the
sense of realizing

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:26.080
that our attention can be highly
habituated in certain ways,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.640
and we're just going
to see what it's like.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.760
It's like an experiment.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.670
We're going to see
what it's like when

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.430
we step outside the confines
of that ordinary way of paying

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.230
attention.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.990
And that's that whole group of
concentration practices based

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.510
on compassion and love
and kindness and so on.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.770
They're not meant to be
pretentious and weird and

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.920
phony, which is
often the feeling.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.140
Like, ew.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.130
That's a little offputting.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.390
But in truth, I think
they're pretty radical,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.960
because it's like taking
some risks with our awareness

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.260
in ways we don't necessarily do.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.190
So, for example, if you
think about that person

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.220
you normally look right
through, because they

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.890
don't count in some way,
what happens when you look

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.105
at them instead of through them?

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.480
Or if you're the kind of person
who at the end of the day

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.430
is looking back at
yourself through the day,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.670
and you pretty well only
remember the mistakes you made,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.030
and the things you didn't
do really perfectly,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.520
and what you could have done
better, let's just say--

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.049
AUDIENCE: I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.940
SHARON SALZBERG:
No one ever does.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.210
And then the stretch
is not to pretend, oh,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.159
I had a perfect day and did
everything magnificently,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.549
but not to be limited
by that, right?

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.660
To include also, wow, I
have that to be grateful,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.615
or I did that well, or
there was that goodness

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:51.270
in what came my way, right?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.040
So both sets of practices--
the mindfulness practices

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.520
that help bring us closer to our
experience and those practices

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.580
which are like experimenting
with awareness--

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.880
are based on inclusion.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.190
We include experiences
in a field of awareness.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.251
We include more and more beings
in a field of connection.

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:10.750
OK?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.330
So rather than my saying
more, we'll practice some,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.090
and then we'll get
into some discussion.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.690
So all right.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.410
Don't look at that
clock, whatever you do.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.434
AUDIENCE: The clock is a test.

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:29.850
SHARON SALZBERG:
So to begin with,

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.010
we're going to do a
sitting based primarily

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.305
on mindfulness practice.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.570
And interestingly
enough, the core value

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.570
of this kind of practice
is said to be balance.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.270
Unlike other pursuits
we might engage in

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.810
or other endeavors
we might have,

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.195
where we get into a
kind of acquisitive,

00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:53.810
almost grabby kind
of mode-- like, well,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.690
if I have a great sitting,
I can leave at the break.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.440
Instead, the work is to bring
our system into greater balance

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.390
with the belief that
out of that balance

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:10.170
will come the insight and the
growth and awareness and so on,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.755
so that some of that balance
is experienced right away

00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:13.490
in our posture.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.060
You want some
energy in your body.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.470
You want to see if your
back can be straight.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.240
But like so much energy.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.400
You're really hypervigilant
and you're so uptight.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.500
You also want to be
relaxed, but not, like,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.880
so relaxed that you're
way slumped over

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.620
as though you
couldn't care less.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.510
So see if you can feel
your way into what

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.985
feels like a balanced posture.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.940
And you can close
your eyes or not.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.550
However you feel most at ease.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.380
If your eyes are open, they
can also be a little bit open.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.460
You can find a spot
to rest your gaze.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.610
Let it go.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.480
And if you get really
sleepy, as sometimes happens

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.070
with your eyes closed, you
can also just open your eyes

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:57.980
and continue on.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.610
Very often, we start
by listening to sound.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.460
It's a way of
relaxing deep inside,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.799
allowing our experience
to come and go.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.340
And of course, we
like certain sounds

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.960
and we don't like others.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.830
But we don't have to chase after
them to hold on or push away.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.330
Just let them come, let them go.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.560
It's like the sounds
wash through you.

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:18.790
And bring your attention to the
feeling of your body sitting.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.240
Whatever sensations
you discover.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.690
Bring your attention
to your hands.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.080
See if you can make the shift
from the more conceptual level,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.210
like of fingers, to the
world of direct sensation,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.305
picking up pulsing, throbbing,
pressure, whatever it might be.

00:13:10.305 --> 00:13:13.167
You don't have to name
those things, but feel them.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.930
Now bring your attention to
the feeling of your breath.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.910
In this system, it's just
the normal, natural breath,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.515
wherever you feel
it most distinctly.

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:51.740
You don't have to try to make
the breath deeper or different.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.050
See if there's a place where
it's strongest for you--

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.400
maybe at the nostrils or
the chest or the abdomen.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.730
If you find that place, you
can bring your attention

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.780
there and just rest.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.740
See if you can feel one breath.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.980
Without concern
for what's already

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.230
gone by, without leaning forward
for even the very next breath.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.900
Just this one.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.070
If you like, you can use
a very quiet mental note,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.884
like in, out, or rising,
falling to help support

00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:40.050
the awareness of the breath.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.940
But very quiet.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.060
So your attention
is really going

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.370
to feeling the breath
one breath at a time.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.100
And if sounds or images,
sensations or emotions

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.690
should arise, but they're
not all that strong,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.010
if you can stay connected to
the feeling of the breath,

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.390
just let them flow on by.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.430
You're breathing.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.852
It's just one breath.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.282
But if something
is really strong,

00:15:46.282 --> 00:15:51.610
and you get lost in thought,
spun out in a fantasy,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:56.760
or you fall asleep,
you get really

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.400
disconnected from the
breath, don't worry about it.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.930
We say the most important
moment in the whole practice

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.380
is the moment after
you've been gone,

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.800
after you've been distracted.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.830
That's the moment where the
training actually takes place.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.200
We practice letting go gently.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.780
We practice beginning again.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.390
Maybe you have to do it
again 10 seconds later.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.195
Doesn't matter.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.100
We let go.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.590
We begin again.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.070
Just shepherd your
attention back

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.140
to the feeling of the breath.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.470
And if you have to do
that a few billion times

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.600
in the next few
minutes, it's OK.

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:09.790
Isn't that amazing
that no matter

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.560
what happens, we can
always begin again?

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.430
Maybe you went far far, far
away for a good long time.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.080
It's OK.

00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:24.030
It's what one of
my teachers called

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.080
exercising the
letting go muscle.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.000
We practice letting go,
and with a full heart,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.580
not feeling diminished or
that we failed, we start over.

00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:26.256
[CHIMING]

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.220
SHARON SALZBERG:
That's my new bell.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.331
I had to use it.

00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:46.080
It's so beautiful.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.490
OK, do you have any questions
about anything you experienced,

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:59.680
or anything I said,
or any comments?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.230
And then we'll go on.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.050
Yeah?

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:03.966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:12.330
I was wondering if you could
talk to us a little more

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.806
about Di Pama and [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.450
SHARON SALZBERG: OK,
so the question was,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.280
since I had used the phrase
my teacher or my teachers,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.040
especially I had one teacher--
this woman named Di Pama, who

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.950
was not famous, and she
was not a celebrity.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.980
Somebody wrote a book about her.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.660
The second version of it, I
think, is called "Di Pama."

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.410
And it was very interesting,
because unlike some teachers,

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.420
she was most remarkable,
really, for her presence.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.670
And so it was a little hard
to write a book about her,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.320
because you didn't have the
illuminating sentence that

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.160
changed your whole life or
something that you really

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.030
wanted to be able to share.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.230
But it was just, like, wow.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.900
She was the most loving
person I ever met.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.650
Di Pama was one of
my early teachers.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.780
Di Pama is a nickname.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.150
It means deep is mother.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.140
And she was the person,
actually, who told me to teach.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.625
She's the reason that
I became a teacher.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:30.410
She was most impressive to me,
really, because of her story.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.040
She was a woman who'd been
through tremendous suffering

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.210
in her own personal life.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.400
She'd been put into an
arranged marriage when

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.010
she was 12 years old,
and she and her husband

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.890
actually fell deeply in love.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.880
And then they didn't have
children for about 18 years.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.570
And then they had
three children.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.630
Two of her children died.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.430
And then one day, her
husband died really suddenly.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.370
He just wasn't feeling well,
and he died by that evening.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.230
And she still has one
daughter, Dipa, to raise.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.860
But she was completely
grief stricken.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.060
She just went to bed.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.857
She couldn't get out of bed.

00:25:06.857 --> 00:25:08.940
And they were living in
Burma, because her husband

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.190
had been in the civil service.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:18.100
And the doctor came to see
her, and he said to her,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.550
you're actually going
to die of a broken heart

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.350
unless you do something
about your mind.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.700
You should learn
how to meditate.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.835
And she got up out of bed and
she went to the retreat center,

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:30.570
and she learned how to meditate.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.690
And when she emerged,
it's like she'd

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.260
taken all of that suffering
and all of that pain

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.690
and she'd turned it
into enormous compassion

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.430
for everybody.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.820
And she was just the most
loving, amazing person,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.550
because she knew for all of us,
our lives can change on a dime,

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.090
and there was no one left
out of her sense of love

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:58.254
and connection, in a very
ordinary kind of way, you know?

00:25:58.254 --> 00:26:02.300
Like, oh, did you
have enough tea?

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.040
Would you like some more tea?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.500
And the lack of
self-preoccupation

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.580
was so remarkable, because
I'd often look at her

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.580
and think, well, if I'd
been through what you've

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.670
been through, would I care
about someone else's tea?

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.120
Maybe not, you know?

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.100
But she'd used all that
in a beautiful way.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.380
So when she told me
to teach, it was 1974,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.500
and I went to say goodbye
to her in Calcutta.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.680
I was coming back for
what I was absolutely

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.260
convinced was a very brief
return to the United States

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.710
before I went back to India
to live the rest of my life

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.130
there being a student.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.270
And she said, when you go back
to America, you'll be teaching.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.245
And I said, no I won't.

00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:42.370
And she said, yes you will.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.825
And I said, no I won't.

00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:44.950
And she said, yes you will.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.280
And I said no I won't.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.790
And then she said two things
that were really extraordinary.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.130
One was, she said, you
really understand suffering.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.930
That's why you should teach.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.210
And I had never thought
of like the personal pain

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.790
I had gone through as having
been a credential for anything,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.282
really, you know?

00:27:02.282 --> 00:27:03.615
You really understand suffering.

00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:04.630
That's why you should teach.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.030
And then she said, you can
do anything you want to do.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.750
It's just you're
thinking you can't do it

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.450
that's going to stop you.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.092
And I left her room
thinking, no I won't.

00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:19.199
And I came back to the US
and began teaching and more

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:21.490
invitations would come and
more invitations would come,

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.610
and one day we established
this retreat center

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.750
in Massachusetts.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:30.540
And somewhere after
that, I thought, oh, I

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.250
guess I'm not going back
there to live after all.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.640
I guess I live here now.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.655
Anybody else?

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.580
Maybe I'll use her, which is a
wonderful feeling, thank you,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.295
as the introduction for the
loving kindness meditation.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:12.780
Because I think also,
in this society,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.907
we can think of kindness
and loving-- loving

00:28:14.907 --> 00:28:16.240
kindness is a weird word anyway.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.450
We don't necessarily use it.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:23.230
But even compassion,
as weakness.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.350
I mean, someone told me
if you google compassion,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.120
very quickly,
fatigue will come up.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.000
Compassion fatigue.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.809
We think of kindness often
as a secondary virtue.

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:36.350
It's like, if you
can't be brilliant,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.445
and you can't be courageous,
and you can't be wonderful,

00:28:39.445 --> 00:28:40.741
eh, be kind.

00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:41.240
You know?

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.450
It's nice.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.280
It's not great, but
it's good, you know?

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.700
It's good enough, kind of.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.540
But I think of somebody like
Di Pama, and it's great.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.050
It's a great, great
thing to encounter

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.380
that kind of caring energy
from somebody, where you really

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.300
feel they're not in
it for themselves.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.850
They're just wanting to help or
be there or be present, or just

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:12.970
energetically, that
field is so amazing.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.869
And I don't think of her
with a kind of scorn,

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:18.160
like, eh, you couldn't do
anything else with your life,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.380
so you became loving, you know?

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.110
It's like, it's a very different
quality of appreciation

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.720
that I think we actually
do have when we think maybe

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.720
about people we've
encountered or so on.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.520
So one of the problems
with mindfulness practice

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.440
is the word, and the words
that get associated with it,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.570
like accept things
the way they are.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.440
You going to be
with your experience

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.835
without judgement that can sound
so passive and so complacent,

00:29:48.835 --> 00:29:52.320
like you're just going to
sit there no matter what.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.340
And so it takes a
real exploration

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.960
to understand it's a
dynamic, vital relationship.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.460
Like, once I was
teaching somewhere,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.560
and I started the
instructions in the same way.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.270
Like, sit and listen to sound.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.345
And somebody immediately
raised their hand

00:30:07.345 --> 00:30:09.720
and said, well, what if it's
the sound of the smoke alarm

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.219
I hear?

00:30:10.219 --> 00:30:12.870
Should I sit here and be mindful
of the sound of the smoke

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.570
alarm, or should I get up?

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.210
And I said, I'd get up.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.980
But just hearing the words, I
want to accept things the way

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.610
they are, can sound a little
dull, you know, like that.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.930
And of course, there
are tremendous problems

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.445
with words like loving kindness,
and kindness, and compassion.

00:30:29.445 --> 00:30:33.530
And I think it demands that
same kind of exploration

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.920
and experimentation to get a
deeper sense of what's meant.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.890
I think of loving kindness
as an acknowledgement--

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.780
a very deep acknowledgement--
of the connection that exists.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.422
It doesn't mean that
you like somebody.

00:30:46.422 --> 00:30:48.380
It doesn't mean you're
going to take them home.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.088
It doesn't mean you're
going to give them

00:30:50.088 --> 00:30:54.040
all your money, or any money.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.210
It means this almost like
bone deep acknowledgement

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.510
that our lives have something
to do with one another.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.860
And so many things bring
us to that understanding.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.610
Certainly, environmental
consciousness brings us there.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.610
Even epidemiology
brings us there.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.870
Economics brings us there.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.645
What happens over there
doesn't nicely stay over there.

00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:16.050
It ripples out over here.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.550
And what we do, it
matters, because

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.485
of those waves of connection.

00:31:20.485 --> 00:31:22.130
It's just the nature of things.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:27.500
And so it's not always
pleasant, but it's true

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.100
that our lives have something
to do with one another.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.620
And the lead lived of that,
the heart's response to that,

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.990
is what we mean by
loving kindness.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.330
It doesn't mean you're forcing a
certain feeling or emotion that

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.050
isn't really there at all.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:51.370
It's more that sensibility, that
real, real sense that everybody

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.600
counts.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.455
Everybody matters.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.430
Maybe my favorite expression
of loving kindness

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.640
came when I was teaching
in Washington, DC.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.610
It was in this rented space
which was an elementary school.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.250
And they had the
rules of kindness

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.520
on these sheets of
paper along the wall.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.044
And my favorite, favorite
rule of kindness-- it

00:32:12.044 --> 00:32:13.960
was things like respect
everyone on the inside

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.870
and on the outside.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.730
But my favorite
rule of all of them

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.100
was, everybody gets to play.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.780
Everybody gets to play.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.640
Everybody is not my best friend,
but everybody gets to play.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.340
So that's very much the
sense of loving kindness.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.040
And we practice in
the way I described--

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.900
not forcing a feeling or trying
to pretend you feel something

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.335
you don't, but kind of
stretching our awareness

00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:39.730
to pay attention to the
people we usually ignore,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.620
to consider the good
within ourselves instead

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.340
of only the mistakes we've made.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.760
We kind of play with our
awareness in various ways

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.790
to see what might then
follow in the nature of care

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.330
and compassion.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.746
So in this practice, instead
of centering our attention

00:32:58.746 --> 00:33:00.120
around the feeling
of the breath,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.610
we center our attention
around the silent repetition

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.960
of certain phrases.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.290
The phrases may not be
the most predominant thing

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.200
in any given moment.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.450
That's fine.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.440
You may have a very
strong sense of the being

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.770
you're offering
loving kindness to.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.480
You may have an emotion,
or not, coming up.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.290
But the phrases are
like the bottom line.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.055
It's what we can
keep returning to,

00:33:23.055 --> 00:33:26.140
to have a place to
rest our attention.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.909
And the phrases are the
conduit for our attention.

00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:32.200
It's the way we're paying
attention in a different way.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.960
The phrases are words,
and therefore they're

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.410
going to be imperfect,
so I usually suggest

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.860
to people, choose good
enough phrases so they're not

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.625
bothering you.

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:49.800
Even if they don't seem
absolutely perfect,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.410
the idea is to choose phrases
that are kind of general so

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.700
that you're not constantly
thinking, like, what about you?

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.780
Maybe happy?

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.080
Well, I don't know about you.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.050
Like, you get really
lazy when you're happy.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.550
Maybe content.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.030
No, content's even worse.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.860
It's just like, because
the power of the practice

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.380
is going to be from
the gathering of all

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.650
of our attention behind
one phrase at a time.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.840
We want to keep
things simple, right?

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.030
Again, it's like
letting go and returning

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.360
is the movement of the practice.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.520
And that's how it develops,
through paying attention

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.255
in different ways.

00:34:27.255 --> 00:34:31.260
The construct-- the grammatical
construct of the phrases--

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.170
is usually may I and may you.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.414
May I be happy, may I be
peaceful, may you be happy,

00:34:37.414 --> 00:34:39.000
may you be peaceful.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.310
Some people don't like that.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.139
It sounds too much like
pleading or imploring.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.360
One of my friends
told me-- she told me

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.236
it was the hortatory
subjunctive part of speech,

00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:52.610
and she said it's like, you
hand someone a birthday card,

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.401
and you say, may you
have a happy birthday.

00:34:54.401 --> 00:34:56.099
May you have a great new year.

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:56.765
It's a blessing.

00:34:56.765 --> 00:34:58.330
It's a giving.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.380
It's actually a
generosity practice.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.306
It's gift giving.

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:04.110
We're giving ourselves
that quality of energy.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.830
We're giving someone else
that quality of energy.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.090
OK, so the basic bookends
of doing the practice

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:14.230
are starting with
yourself, and ending

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.890
with the extension of loving
kindness to all beings

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.990
everywhere to all of life.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.990
And what you do in the
middle might be different

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.372
all the time.

00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:23.080
Maybe you have a friend
who's in trouble,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.300
so you want to include them.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.020
Or someone you feel
very grateful to,

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.550
and you want to include them.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:28.550
Or whatever it might be.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.770
So I'll guide you through
just one variation

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.860
of the many possibilities
of doing it.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.830
So again, if you
sit comfortably,

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.375
and you can close
your eyes or not.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.296
Let your energy
settle into your body.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.130
See if there are three
or four phrases that

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.660
work for you as that
sense of gift giving

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.990
for yourself, and
ultimately for others.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.770
Common phrases are things
like may I be happy,

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:12.965
may I be peaceful.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:28.100
May I live with ease, which
means in the things of day

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.040
to day life, like
livelihood and family,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.805
may it not be a struggle.

00:36:32.805 --> 00:36:34.880
May I live with ease.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.270
May I be happy.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:40.008
May I be peaceful.

00:36:40.008 --> 00:36:41.820
May I live with
ease, or whatever

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.985
phrases you want to use.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.620
And just gently repeat
them over and over again

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.660
with enough space
and enough silence

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.870
so that it's a rhythm
that's pleasing to you.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.990
All kinds of feelings
may come and go, or none.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.560
It doesn't matter.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.330
The power of the practice is
in that complete wholehearted

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.510
presence behind one
phrase at a time.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.620
Now think of somebody who is
like an embodiment of loving

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.400
kindness and compassion.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.380
Maybe you've met them.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.410
Maybe you haven't.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.180
Maybe they exist
now or historically

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.100
or even mythically.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:45.601
And imagine that being offering
loving kindness to you.

00:38:45.601 --> 00:38:48.310
Now put yourself in the
position of the recipient.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.340
And again, all kinds
of feelings may come.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.770
You may feel embarrassed.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.330
You might feel entitled.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.830
All kinds of things.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.630
But let them wash through you
as you steady your attention

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.020
on the repetition
of the phrases.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.530
Maybe it's that
being or someone else

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.060
comes to mind who's been
like a mentor for you,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.130
a benefactor for you.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.780
They've helped pick you up
when you've fallen down,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.566
or maybe they've
inspired you from afar.

00:40:14.566 --> 00:40:16.790
And if someone like
that comes to mind,

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.860
you can bring them here.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.895
Get an image of them.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.210
Say their name to yourself.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.150
Get a feeling for their
presence and offer

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.800
the phrases of loving
kindness to them.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.890
Give them that same gift.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.780
Again, even if the
words are imperfect,

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.885
it's OK, because they're the
conduit for the heart's energy.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.700
And then a friend.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.100
The first friend
who comes to mind.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.650
Bring them here.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.190
Again, you can get
an image of them,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.800
or say their name to yourself.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.870
Get a feeling for their
presence and offer

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.436
the phrases of loving
kindness to them.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.930
And then everybody here,
including yourself.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.140
May we be happy.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.250
May we be peaceful.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.150
May we live with ease.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.106
Or whatever phrases
you may be using.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.080
And then all beings everywhere.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.000
All people, all
creatures, all those

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.955
in existence near and
far, known and unknown.

00:46:38.955 --> 00:46:47.032
May all beings be happy, be
peaceful, live with ease.

00:47:54.624 --> 00:47:55.620
SHARON SALZBERG: OK.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.590
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.798
SHARON SALZBERG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:57.798 --> 00:47:58.830
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.530
Thank you so much.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.370
Does anybody have any questions
about how the practice went,

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:09.067
and then we'll just pass
this around as needed?

00:48:09.067 --> 00:48:09.900
SHARON SALZBERG: OK.

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:13.630
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:20.039
I get the basic
idea, but I always

00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:23.983
had this nagging question which
is that-- especially if you're

00:48:23.983 --> 00:48:26.761
talking about creatures
instead of just humans, well,

00:48:26.761 --> 00:48:29.010
some creatures are going to
be eating other creatures.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:29.310
SHARON SALZBERG: I know.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:30.685
AUDIENCE: And so
they're not both

00:48:30.685 --> 00:48:32.270
going to be happy
at the same time.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.840
SHARON SALZBERG: I need to
repeat the question, right?

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:43.280
Yes, so the question was kind
of a discomfort at the offering

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.710
of loving kindness
to all beings,

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.809
because it's basically
illogical, that especially

00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:49.350
when you're offering
loving kindness,

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:52.580
say, to all creatures, since
creatures eat other creatures,

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.080
they're not all going to
be happy at the same time.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.560
That is totally true.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.465
Sometimes I think of loving
kindness practice as landing us

00:49:00.465 --> 00:49:01.840
right in the center
of a paradox.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:09.370
And sometimes I think of
it as it's meant, really,

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:15.600
to the arena of transformation
of loving kindness practice is

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.390
our field of intention.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.030
It's how we are relating
in terms of inclusion

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:25.280
and exclusion, in terms
of noticing or ignoring,

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.740
in terms of opening
or shutting off.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.940
So that's the transformation,
and so that's our test.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.400
It's not easy, and it's
not going to happen.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.570
But nonetheless, our
own commitment in life

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.440
is to include
rather than exclude,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.610
and to recognize the
suffering of beings.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.450
That is a part of nature.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.980
It's a part of life.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.130
And to ourselves, not
be causing more harm,

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.370
to the best of our
ability, and so on.

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:02.130
And also, it brings us to what's
a really exquisite balance

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:06.010
that's often talked about
between, say, loving kindness

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.900
and compassion on the
one side, and just

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.570
equanimity on the other.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.690
It's like, yeah, this
is the way things are.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.490
And there's a kind
of poignancy in that.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:24.520
in that I often
say and feel it's

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.470
too bad it's not my
universe to control,

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.320
because it might be
better if it were,

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.570
or at least I think it would be.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.470
But it's not.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.290
Whether it's an immediate
situation-- one on one

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:44.214
with a friend or colleague,
or it's kind of more

00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:47.116
a global look at the
nature of things.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.690
We want beings to be happy,
and we can't make it so.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.770
And yet we need to
do what we can do.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.410
That's not a call for passivity.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:02.330
But what we do needs to
be done in that context

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:03.820
of understanding, you know?

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.185
You can't make it so.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.690
Yeah.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.084
Do you want to--

00:51:23.289 --> 00:51:27.726
AUDIENCE: You use
the same-- is it on?

00:51:27.726 --> 00:51:29.698
MALE SPEAKER: We'll just
repeat the question.

00:51:29.698 --> 00:51:31.177
AUDIENCE: You used
the same phrases

00:51:31.177 --> 00:51:34.135
as you progressed through
the different categories

00:51:34.135 --> 00:51:36.083
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:37.832
Is that a suggestive
practice or would you

00:51:37.832 --> 00:51:40.051
alter those for a
particular [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.280
SHARON SALZBERG:
So the comment was

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.530
that I had used the
same phrases as we moved

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.510
through different
categories, and so is

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.600
that the suggestion,
or would you alter them

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.710
as different beings
come to mind?

00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:00.820
Well, here's a balance point,
which is very interesting,

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.780
I think.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.580
In any meditation,
there's a balance

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.906
that's talked about between
tranquility and calm

00:52:06.906 --> 00:52:09.830
and concentration
on the one side,

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.910
and alertness and
energy and kind

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:15.059
of aliveness on the other side.

00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:16.850
And we're always working
with that balance,

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.190
because we want both.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:20.440
We want to be more
tranquil and calm,

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.120
but not so tranquil and
calm that we're in a stupor.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.600
And we want to be alert and
interested and connected

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.450
and learning and
investigating, but not

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.300
so much so that we get
agitated and restless.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.970
So in every technique
and every method,

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.670
we work around that balance.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.920
And especially sometimes in
loving kindness practice,

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.440
because it's so active, and
because these are real beings,

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.910
and relationships
are complicated,

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.980
I tend to encourage
a lot of work

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:55.830
on the kind of tranquility,
calm, concentration side,

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:58.600
because there's almost nothing
easier in that practice than

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.112
to go off with a lot
of energy and a story.

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:04.660
Like, well, I thought
you were my benefactor,

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.940
and it worked for a while, but
then I remembered that one time

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.190
when I called you and you
weren't really there for me.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:11.630
So maybe you're
not my benefactor.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.592
Maybe you're my difficult
person, you know?

00:53:13.592 --> 00:53:15.050
Maybe you're in
the wrong category.

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:16.258
I don't have any benefactors.

00:53:16.258 --> 00:53:17.800
Oh no, I'm so forlorn.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.190
You know?

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.800
It's very easy, because
relationships are complicated.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.580
We're complicated.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:30.030
And so we're bringing that
right into the meditative arena.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.620
And so it's not to the
exclusion of having

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.220
that aliveness
and kind of spark.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.970
It could never be.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:43.470
But I just think it's good
to have a sense of structure

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.090
and simplicity that we
can keep returning to.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:49.429
And so that would argue
for the same phrases,

00:53:49.429 --> 00:53:50.970
so you're not sitting
there thinking,

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:52.160
what was my phrasing again?

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.484
And yet, sometimes, someone
will come to mind and almost

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:58.900
bring their own
phrases with them.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.580
So you just switch.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:05.912
It's not going to be one
of those agitated sessions.

00:54:05.912 --> 00:54:06.412
Yeah.

00:54:17.154 --> 00:54:17.820
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.778
SHARON SALZBERG: Hello.

00:54:18.778 --> 00:54:20.260
AUDIENCE: Thanks. for coming.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.759
So, when you talked
about the comparison

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.800
between loving kindness
mediation and mindfulness

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.822
practice, do you find that
the difference between the two

00:54:29.822 --> 00:54:33.662
is different end goals
in mind, or strictly

00:54:33.662 --> 00:54:36.696
personal preference, or
when there is a good time

00:54:36.696 --> 00:54:38.067
to use one compared to another?

00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:39.650
SHARON SALZBERG: OK,
so the difference

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.760
between mindfulness practice
and loving kindness practice,

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.740
and do they have
different goals in mind,

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:48.910
or just different kind
of styles of practice?

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:53.340
And when is a good time
to use one or the other?

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.290
They are actually designed for
different goals in many ways,

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:01.895
but not to the complete
exclusion of the other.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.530
It's almost like
there's a primary goal,

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.960
and then there are all
those attendant results

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.210
or consequences that
will come along.

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:13.665
So the primary goal of
mindfulness practice

00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:18.910
is said to be insight or wisdom.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:22.500
When something arises in us, and
we're not struggling against it

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.630
right away, there's more
chance for learning, right?

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.140
And at the same time, if
something arises in us,

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.109
and we're not falling into it
completely right away-- like,

00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:34.150
I'm such an angry person.

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:35.700
I will be forever.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.430
There's a lot more
room for learning.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.175
So mindfulness is all
about relationships,

00:55:40.175 --> 00:55:43.160
and it's establishing a
relationship to our experience

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.090
so that insight can flower.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.520
One of the things we
have insight into,

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.120
just because it happens
to be the way it is,

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.280
is connection or
interconnection.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.120
The way we perceive self
and other and us them

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.360
we see as a construct.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.210
That's an insight.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.230
We see that we do live in
an interdependent universe.

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:10.090
That everybody does
matter, even if we

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:14.520
don't like everybody
or anybody, that we

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.970
live as part of a network
as well as an individual.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:18.850
That's true.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.100
And so the more
we see that, just

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.660
in the course of
developing insight,

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.670
the more loving kindness
will come all by itself.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:31.240
But you may also have insights
into all kinds of other things.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.365
And that's really what
the mindfulness practice

00:56:33.365 --> 00:56:34.277
is designed for.

00:56:34.277 --> 00:56:35.860
And loving kindness
practice is really

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:42.700
designed to-- first of all,
it's an antidote to fear.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:52.460
And it's about
inclusion in attention,

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:56.070
and really broadening
the way we pay attention.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.620
What do we pay attention to?

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.220
Who do we pay attention to?

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.370
What's the quality
of that attention?

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:11.710
And the primary one
purpose of it, or benefit,

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.780
will be the experience
of loving kindness.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:19.760
It's really a
different way of being.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.345
It's like, just as an
example, friends of mine who

00:57:22.345 --> 00:57:25.250
are performers tell me
that one in particular

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.430
had terrible stage fright.

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:32.190
And so she would commonly
get up on the stage,

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:35.854
and she'd look out
at those people who

00:57:35.854 --> 00:57:37.520
she knew were just
sitting there waiting

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.520
to judge her mercilessly,
and really be afraid of them,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.521
and really dislike them.

00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.145
And then she get more
and more uptight.

00:57:44.145 --> 00:57:45.970
And so there was this
huge sense of, like,

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.320
the other is out there
just waiting to get me.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.410
So she got in the habit
of getting up on the stage

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:53.810
and doing loving
kindness practice.

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:56.940
And then it was different.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.310
It wasn't that she got sloppy
or didn't care anymore,

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:06.470
but there was almost a sense
like, OK, we're here together.

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.969
And I know that
even if one makes

00:58:08.969 --> 00:58:10.510
a mistake in that
kind of atmosphere,

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.540
it's different, right?

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.200
It's a different
sense of connection.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.699
It's a different
sense of community.

00:58:16.699 --> 00:58:20.950
So that would be where loving
kindness practice goes.

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:23.789
Along the way, there's
a lot of insight.

00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:26.080
It just happens because you're
paying attention, right?

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.970
And you're also
stretching your attention,

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:35.450
so you see, ooh, I didn't know
that I had this power of love,

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.680
or I didn't know that
this was arising in me,

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.330
and I pulled back because
I was so embarrassed.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:48.430
Or I didn't know that this
person who I really don't like

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.720
is not just the enemy.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.210
I used to spend all my time
when thinking about them going

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.250
through the same
list of their faults.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.685
It wasn't like I
found new faults.

00:58:57.685 --> 00:59:01.280
It was just the same list
again and again and again.

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.230
Look what happens when I
actually broaden my attention.

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:08.110
I still think they're not that
great in all those arenas,

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:08.850
but look at that.

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:10.350
There's also this.

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:11.110
Or what if this?

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:15.220
Somebody told me
this story after I'd

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:19.230
written my most recent
book about work,

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:30.460
and she said that she got into
the habit of starting meetings

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.200
just by silently looking
at everybody in the room

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.250
and reminding herself,
you know, everybody here

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:36.980
wants to be happy.

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.640
Everybody actually
wants to be happy.

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.200
They might have different
definitions or ways

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.990
of approaching it, but everybody
actually wants to be happy.

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:47.336
So it's something like that.

00:59:47.336 --> 00:59:48.710
So certainly,
there are insights,

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.460
and we utilize them from
loving kindness practice.

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.780
It's just the main
emphasis is different.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.180
And I think it's
great to do both.

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:57.680
You know?

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.160
It's not like an either/or
in terms of methodology.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.270
A lot of people do both,
and they just experiment.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:08.000
These days, when I sit,
which is every day, which

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.225
we can talk about, my
practice-- my formal practice--

01:00:13.225 --> 01:00:14.950
is really mindfulness practice.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:18.830
But I have a commitment to
do loving kindness practice

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.000
whenever I'm waiting.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.070
And I count every mode of
transportation as waiting.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:26.000
So every airplane,
every taxi, walking down

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.250
the streets of New York.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:33.800
I silently keep repeating
those phrases for myself,

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.920
or for someone I'm encountering.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.740
And it's so much more
fun than what I'm usually

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.190
doing on an airplane,
whatever that is.

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.860
And it's a whole
other way of being.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.840
And you think about
all those times

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.070
during the day when we just
kind of filling in the time,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:56.040
and think about not doing
that, but actually doing

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.360
some loving kindness practice.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.345
There are lots of ways of
bringing them together.

01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:03.639
Do you want--

01:01:03.639 --> 01:01:05.680
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we
can jump into some others.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.440
And for part of this
more conversational part,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.932
about the application of
this kind of meditation,

01:01:12.932 --> 01:01:14.390
it's really important
that you guys

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:16.430
feel comfortable sort of
joining in the conversation.

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.055
So if you want to
take the conversation

01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:19.840
a certain direction, feel free.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.255
And we can do that.

01:01:22.255 --> 01:01:23.880
But I'd like to throw
one more question

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.960
in about the actual mechanics
of the practice itself.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.490
I've been on heart
practice retreats,

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:33.810
and there was someone
in the corner who's

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.565
getting over some
childhood trauma

01:01:35.565 --> 01:01:36.940
and really having
a breakthrough,

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.470
and very obviously being
really emotional about it.

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.790
I think it's easy to have an
expectation with this practice

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:45.420
of having a strong
emotional response.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.630
Can you speak to the
idea of what should one

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.600
expect while you're
doing this sort of thing?

01:01:52.016 --> 01:01:53.390
SHARON SALZBERG:
The question was

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.950
what should one expect
while doing a heart

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.970
centered practice?

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.670
Well, I think that's a
fascinating question anyway,

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:03.950
and I think it's
crucial in terms

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:06.790
of being able to
continue a practice.

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:11.090
So I said that when I
first came back from India,

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.560
if I'd be at some
social situation,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.470
people would say to
me, what do you do?

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.060
And I say, I teach meditation.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.620
They'd kind of go, ew.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.390
Well, nowadays, the single
most common response I hear

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:26.190
is, I'm so stressed out.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:28.270
I could use some of that.

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:32.810
Or, I hear, what I
find very amusing,

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:34.310
my partner should
really meet you.

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:37.690
They could really
use some of that.

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:41.680
Or I hear, I tried it once.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.790
I failed at it.

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:43.760
I tried to meditate.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.860
I couldn't do it.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.580
And they then describe
obviously what

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.030
they expected to have happen.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.200
I failed at it, because I
couldn't stop my thinking.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.670
I couldn't have only
beautiful thoughts.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.086
I couldn't keep
sleepiness at bay.

01:02:56.086 --> 01:02:58.210
I couldn't stop
from being restless.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.756
Whatever it is.

01:02:59.756 --> 01:03:03.630
And from the point of view
of meditation, none of that

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:04.422
is why we meditate.

01:03:04.422 --> 01:03:06.046
You're not going to
stop your thoughts.

01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:07.779
You're not going to
make your mind blank.

01:03:07.779 --> 01:03:09.820
You're not going to have
only beautiful thoughts.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.050
But you can change your
relationship to everything,

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:13.550
right?

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:15.940
That's the power we have.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.900
And to beautiful experiences, to
painful experiences, all of it.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.560
And so with loving
kindness, there's

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.440
its own set of expectations.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.260
Either I should have beautiful
feeling and wonderful,

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.790
I should float away, I
should forgive myself totally

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:38.920
by this afternoon, I've put in
20 minutes, it should be over,

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:44.320
or I should have this
kind of huge catharsis.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.170
I should feel this kind of
gooey, light, warm feeling

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.047
toward everybody.

01:03:51.047 --> 01:03:52.130
And it's especially funny.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.960
My first book was called
"Loving Kindness,"

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.670
and it's all about doing
loving kindness meditation.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:01.010
And after that, people used
to say to me, what's it

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:06.300
like to love everybody all
the time without exception,

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.155
without hesitation?

01:04:07.155 --> 01:04:08.960
And I go, huh.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.600
I mean, I wrote a
book on it, but it

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.220
doesn't mean I'm perfect at it.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.560
And so those
expectations are very

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:24.200
important to acknowledge, to
recognize and bring forth.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.450
And I guarantee you you
can do loving kindness

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:34.730
practice in an ardent,
useful, transformative way,

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.565
and not have any
emotion happening.

01:04:37.565 --> 01:04:39.470
You really can.

01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:42.760
It's not that it
never happens, but I

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.830
see from my own experiences
and from teaching thousands

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.680
of people, this
kind of practice--

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.890
it's something deeper
than the level of emotion.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.820
And sometimes it will
translate as emotion,

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.930
and sometimes it won't.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:01.350
So my signature story about
loving kindness practice

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:06.610
is the first month we moved into
the Insight Meditation Society

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.180
in 1976.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.450
We didn't have any
programming for a month.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:13.275
So those of us who
were there decided,

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:15.930
oh, we'll just sit ourselves.

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.455
And I'd always wanted to do
loving kindness practice,

01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:20.580
and I'd always done it a
little bit here and there,

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.860
but never systematically.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.300
So I had a month, and I knew
you started with yourself

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.750
and then you moved on
to these categories.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.350
So I spent the whole first week
doing loving kindness practice

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:32.545
for myself, and I felt
absolutely nothing.

01:05:32.545 --> 01:05:35.724
It was a completely dreary week.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.640
And then at the end of
the week, several of us

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.610
had to leave suddenly,
because something

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:42.072
happened to a friend
of ours in Boston.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:43.905
So I was getting ready
to leave the retreat,

01:05:43.905 --> 01:05:45.446
and I was up in one
of the bathrooms,

01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:49.190
and I dropped this big jar of
something on the tile floor,

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:51.730
and the jar just went
down and shattered

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.710
and stuff went everywhere.

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.080
And I noticed the first
thought that came up in my mind

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.180
was, you are really a
klutz, but I love you.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:03.460
And I thought, look at that.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.170
You could have
given me anything,

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.640
and I could not
have honestly said

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.450
something was happening
during that week,

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:10.330
but something was happening.

01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:12.260
And I've seen
thousands of times.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.260
Which is one of the reasons
it's difficult for people

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.550
to continue their
meditation practice

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.420
is because I think
we tend to look

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.580
at the wrong place for results.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.570
We need to look
at our lives, not

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:25.890
necessarily at that
20 minute period a day

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:30.230
where we may not have the great
breakthrough, or float away,

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:31.269
or whatever it is.

01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:32.310
But we will be different.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.830
MALE SPEAKER: So
let's talk about

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.640
the practical applications
of compassion.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.430
So does compassion
make you a sucker?

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.330
What about assholes?

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:50.102
SHARON SALZBERG: Do I
need to repeat that?

01:06:50.102 --> 01:06:52.397
MALE SPEAKER: No.

01:06:52.397 --> 01:06:53.980
AUDIENCE: This means
the YouTube video

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.370
might get a parental warning.

01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:58.020
SHARON SALZBERG: Oh, OK.

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.190
No, it does not
make you a sucker.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:07.740
That is of great interest to
me, having this conversation,

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.064
because that, of course, is
what we think-- that you're

01:07:10.064 --> 01:07:12.230
going to be too nice, you're
going to give too much,

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:14.730
or you're going
to get exhausted.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.635
But I think a very
rigorous investigation,

01:07:16.635 --> 01:07:20.050
and certainly in a
personal experiential level

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.060
of compassion shows us
it's not the same thing

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.660
as being devastated by
someone's situation,

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.230
because then we're
just exhausted.

01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:32.510
We have nothing to give, right?

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:36.440
Years ago, I was teaching in the
Soviet Union, when it was still

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.850
the Soviet Union, and I'd
gone with my friend, Joseph

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:43.910
Goldstein, and a tour group--
because you couldn't go apart

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:46.336
from that in those days.

01:07:46.336 --> 01:07:48.060
And every afternoon,
Joseph and I

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.180
would disappear, instead of
going to look at some museum,

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:56.637
and we'd go to someone's house
to teach with a translator.

01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:58.345
And I was talking a
lot about compassion.

01:07:58.345 --> 01:08:02.380
And I noticed that
every time I did

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.220
that, I'd just get
a sense of a really

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.170
funny feeling in the room.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.570
And finally, I said
to the translator,

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:11.580
when I say compassion,
what do you say?

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.710
And they said, oh, it's this
state where you feel like,

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.000
broken by the
suffering, and nearly

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.689
destroyed by the
suffering, and it's

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:22.510
like someone has
taken a giant stake

01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:24.566
and driven it
through your heart.

01:08:24.566 --> 01:08:26.149
And I thought, well,
no wonder there's

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.646
a really funny
feeling in the room.

01:08:27.646 --> 01:08:29.229
MALE SPEAKER: That
seems very Russian.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.300
SHARON SALZBERG: Yes,
it is very Russian.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.960
But we can go there
and imagine that that's

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.500
compassion, where that
is more like devastation.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.090
Or we can think, oh, I'm just
going to give in too much.

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:42.550
I'm going to be too nice.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:46.290
So the way we usually
distinguish it

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.731
is going back to
what I said before,

01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:51.189
that loving kindness
and compassion

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:52.565
affect our field of motivation.

01:08:52.565 --> 01:08:54.890
It's why we do things.

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:59.319
It isn't necessarily going to
determine what we do, right?

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:02.479
We might be coming
from a genuinely

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:06.170
loving and compassionate
place, but our sense

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:08.819
of discernment in a
particular situation,

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:12.399
in a particular context, might
be that we need to say no.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:13.590
We need to be fierce.

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:16.620
We need to be kind of intense.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.204
And that's going to be
based on wisdom, you know?

01:09:20.204 --> 01:09:21.850
It's like our best
guess of what's

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:23.968
most appropriate
in that context.

01:09:23.968 --> 01:09:26.134
But we don't have to be
coming from a hateful place.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.100
MALE SPEAKER: A big
part of practice

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.810
is working on yourself,
and certainly, something

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:42.036
we hear from people that
take some of the classes

01:09:42.036 --> 01:09:43.160
we have here is, like, wow.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.725
It's a really amazing class.

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:46.850
And then sometimes when it
seems like when I go out

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.029
into the world,
it's an environment

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:52.097
that's a little hostile to that.

01:09:52.097 --> 01:09:53.680
Particularly with
regard to compassion

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.770
practice, what are your thoughts
around the work with yourself

01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.100
as it relates to other people?

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.560
Like, for instance, if
there's an impedance mismatch

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.379
between you and the
people around you,

01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:06.920
how do you skillfully
negotiate that?

01:10:13.087 --> 01:10:14.670
SHARON SALZBERG: You
mean in the sense

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:19.247
that people are not
responsive to your compassion?

01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:20.080
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.450
Or for instance,
you're operating

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:25.490
in a compassionate way, and
then maybe the group mores

01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:28.037
are less compassionate.

01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:28.870
SHARON SALZBERG: OK.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:32.710
So what about if you're coming
from a compassionate place,

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.320
and the kind of culture
you're operating in

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.570
is not so much that way?

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:42.180
It happens, doesn't it?

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:47.000
I think we can-- again, going
back to what I was just saying,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.510
I think it's clarifying
our intention, which

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:53.660
doesn't have to become the
lowest common denominator.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:11:01.440
We don't have to live as driven
and confused as the people

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.150
around us may be.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:07.320
And yet, there's more or less
skillful means of expression

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.450
that we do the best we
can to develop as skillful

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:15.350
a way of communicating
as possible.

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.440
So instead of saying, you're
all losers and you have no heart

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:24.410
and you're pathetic, there might
be a better way of saying that,

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:30.780
and really being very
truthful about that, but not

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.560
in a way that is [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.250
So for example, one of the
things I think about these days

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:46.460
is I really believe we live more
and more in a culture of being

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.610
taught that you will feel
better about yourself

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:52.274
by demeaning others, and that
if you can put others down,

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.440
you're going to feel better.

01:11:56.590 --> 01:12:00.020
Years ago, a friend and I were
watching the Winter Olympics,

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.630
and this couple got up and
executed this dance on ice.

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:08.580
And then, the
instant they stopped,

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.740
it seemed like without
even drawing breath,

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.280
the commentator barked
out, lacks artistry.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.285
And my friend I were like,
rolling on the floor.

01:12:16.285 --> 01:12:18.250
It was like, give me a break.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.360
These people just
danced on ice, you know?

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.900
That's not easy.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.390
But it's just, that's how it is.

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:31.160
And I don't think we need to buy
into that, because the more we

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.850
live like that,
the more alone we

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.920
feel, threatened by
someone else's success,

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.485
even if it's not taking
anything away from us.

01:12:38.485 --> 01:12:40.440
Like we're in
endless competition,

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.300
not just with people we're
competing with or against,

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.660
but we're constantly in this
state of feeling ripped off

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.162
by what someone
else is enjoying.

01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:53.580
And it's not that fulfilling
or happy a place to be,

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.680
and we don't need
to buy into it.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:01.420
But we don't need to be
condemning in a sort of nasty

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.800
way, like, I am the one who
understands how to speak

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.252
to people, whereas
you people don't.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:10.710
But it actually
makes a difference.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:15.100
I really believe in
a phrase I learned

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:20.070
from this group of women who
were running domestic violence

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:24.970
shelters that I was teaching,
where they themselves came up

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:28.320
with this phrase, a
culture of wellness,

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.395
that they wanted to start
to try to bring forth.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.625
And I think it
makes a difference.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.690
MALE SPEAKER: One of the things
about meditation practice

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:44.790
is that it can be really
useful during times

01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:47.582
of emotional distress
or difficulty.

01:13:47.582 --> 01:13:49.040
And I think that's
also the hardest

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.880
time to practice
in a lot of ways.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.190
Like, let's really get
focused and pay attention

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:59.625
onto the degree of misery
I'm experiencing right now.

01:13:59.625 --> 01:14:02.000
Any thoughts on being with
the practice during that time,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.980
and in particular, any role
that compassion practice might

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.750
play in those sorts
of situations?

01:14:10.232 --> 01:14:11.940
SHARON SALZBERG: Let's
look at the degree

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.481
of misery I'm
experiencing right now.

01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:15.059
That's great.

01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:16.350
I think there are a few things.

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:21.250
One is that's one
reason why I think

01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:26.120
it's good to practice
in ordinary times.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:32.020
It's like building up resources
and strength and capacity.

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:35.190
I was once interviewed for Good
Housekeeping Magazine, which

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:36.800
if you'd ever see
my house, you would

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.480
find as amusing as my friends.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.810
It was really funny.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.050
And my part of the
interview didn't make it

01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:45.550
into the magazine.

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.990
Not because they saw my
house, but it just didn't.

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:50.820
So the question
was something like,

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:55.140
how do you use mindfulness
in a time of complete crisis?

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.710
And my answer was-- it was
one of those experiences where

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.690
you just hear words
come out your mouth,

01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:03.012
so what I heard come out of
my mouth was, I wouldn't wait.

01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:04.660
Like, don't wait.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:09.840
Sometimes people do, and
even then, it can be useful.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.570
But if you're just
having the ordinary day,

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:16.630
ordinary pressures,
whatever it might be,

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:22.480
that's the time to really be
building all of those skills.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.540
Because you'll use them in much
more difficult times, and even

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:31.300
much more joyous times to
appreciate them and really

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.470
be there for them.

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:34.800
And so don't wait.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.310
And if you have waited,
or you feel overcome,

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.585
even if you've gotten
experience and practice,

01:15:40.585 --> 01:15:43.930
I think compassion
practice is a perfect thing

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:45.930
to do in those times.

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:50.910
Because it's very difficult
to extend compassion

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:52.240
toward ourselves.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.840
That feels like weakness.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.510
Like, somebody I was
teaching recently somewhere,

01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:00.124
and I think even
that moment, like,

01:16:00.124 --> 01:16:01.540
if you're doing
breath meditation,

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.120
where you have to let go of
the distraction and come back

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.870
is a moment of
compassion for yourself,

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:09.640
and forgiveness for yourself,
so you can start over.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.747
And somebody really
objected to that,

01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:13.580
and they said, well,
that's just being weak.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.950
And if I forgive myself,
it's like giving myself

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:19.880
permission to do it again.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.260
But I don't really think so.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.950
I think if you do a kind
of thought experiment

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:29.410
about what that's like, you
make a mistake, you realize it,

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:32.720
you feel the pain or
discomfort of that,

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.720
you resolve to be different,
you let go, you go on.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.280
That's one thing.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.390
And to just go over it and
over it and over it and over it

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:43.530
and over it and over it
is not a really useful way

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:44.960
to have energy to go on.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.750
So I don't know that it's going
to help us accomplish anything.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.570
MALE SPEAKER: Your new book
is called "Happiness at Work."

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.350
And certainly, if you've seen
any of the studies or metrics

01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:00.770
around happiness
in the workplace,

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:04.690
it's sort of a book
that needed writing.

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:07.310
One of the things that
is interesting to us,

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:09.060
and by interesting to
us, I mean something

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.990
that's hard and
challenging for us,

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:14.232
is the concept of
detaching from work.

01:17:14.232 --> 01:17:16.690
I think a lot of people that
work here are very emotionally

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:19.700
invested in the work we do.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.510
And I think working
here feels a lot

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:24.420
like working at
NASA in the 1960s.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.850
Like, being at a
very special place

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:30.250
and time doing really cool work.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:36.180
And it's not sustainable to be
doing email at 10:00, 11:00 at

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.840
night.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.550
What's your take on the way
that practices can actually

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:42.945
support detaching
from work, even

01:17:42.945 --> 01:17:44.070
if it's work that you love?

01:17:45.615 --> 01:17:47.240
SHARON SALZBERG: I
think, first of all,

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.330
if it's work that you love,
you are very, very blessed.

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:55.750
It's a tremendous
blessing in one's life.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:18:00.910
And still, we just need
some repose, you know?

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.272
Because in fact, we
are not our jobs.

01:18:04.272 --> 01:18:05.980
I put that in the
book, which is actually

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.172
called "Real Happiness at Work."

01:18:08.172 --> 01:18:12.500
And when I started doing
interviews for the book,

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.470
people were very
confounded by that.

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:16.920
Kind of like, what do you
mean, we're not our jobs?

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.850
Just like when I describe
myself at those parties,

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.810
somebody would say,
what do you do, right?

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:28.012
Which is what we say instead
of what makes you happy,

01:18:28.012 --> 01:18:32.486
or what was your favorite
experience of the week?

01:18:32.486 --> 01:18:35.070
It's like, what do you do?

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:38.740
We're all taught to
identify with that role.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:43.850
And it's great to be invested,
and I think to really care.

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:46.550
And it's not all that we are.

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:54.070
And so I think even just
ritualizing whatever

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:56.710
it might be-- it's like the
great experiment of life.

01:18:56.710 --> 01:19:02.060
I'm not going to check
email after whenever.

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.900
I just quoted Linda Stone
in coining the phrase email

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:12.130
apnea, which is
very interesting.

01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:13.880
Check it out next time
you're doing email.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.060
Are you breathing?

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.930
Isn't it interesting
that there's actually

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:24.110
a thing like that, where our
breath can get so shallow when

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:28.080
we're doing email that we are
barely breathing, with all

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.460
the attendant
consequences of that?

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.950
Ritualizing pauses.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:36.150
Stepping back.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:39.870
Taking a breath during the
day, or periods of time

01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:45.494
where we're not constantly on,
just to have a better balance.

01:19:45.494 --> 01:19:47.160
MALE SPEAKER: Something
else in the book

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.580
that I thought was really
relevant to this group

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.800
is also the idea, or maybe
the myth of multitasking.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.880
What ways do you
think mindfulness

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:04.620
can support being involved less
in-- it's called multitasking,

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.924
but fast and inefficient
context switching.

01:20:07.924 --> 01:20:09.340
SHARON SALZBERG:
Ooh, I like that.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.915
Fast and inefficient
context switching.

01:20:11.915 --> 01:20:14.060
Well, as I'm sure
you know, studies

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.700
show that, in fact,
when we're multitasking,

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.450
we're not that
effective and efficient,

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:20.550
which is why we do it.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:23.360
We think it's really
going bring us far.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.190
And I think one of
things about mindfulness

01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:27.670
exercises that you can
bring into your workplace

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:31.360
or into your life is that
they can seem very simplistic,

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.910
but they actually work.

01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:37.850
Just like ritualizing
that pause or that moment

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:40.070
before taking action.

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:45.340
Like, when I was first living
in India, nobody had a job,

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.380
and people weren't
raising families then,

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.210
and we weren't really
doing anything.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:54.440
But still, it was
not that easy to have

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.215
a practice during conversation
or in the visa office

01:20:58.215 --> 01:21:00.960
or whatever it was.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.150
And so we would always ask our
teachers, what should we do?

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:08.670
And the recommendations I
thought were so simplistic.

01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.390
Like, feel your feet
against the floor,

01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:15.195
or take a breath before you
respond to the visa officer.

01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:17.970
And I'd think, that's so stupid.

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:21.000
But actually doing it
makes a difference.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.860
Look at that.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.856
Things like Thich Nhat
Hanh's famous suggestion,

01:21:25.856 --> 01:21:27.605
don't pick up the phone
on the first ring.

01:21:27.605 --> 01:21:30.585
Let it ring three
times and breathe.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:33.790
It's not going to take
such a huge amount of time,

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:37.970
but it just helps you come
back, and then you start again.

01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:41.990
So in terms of mindfulness
and multitasking,

01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:43.780
it might be just
one thing, you know?

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:47.580
Like drink a cup of tea or
coffee, and just do that.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.915
It's not going to take forever.

01:21:48.915 --> 01:21:52.100
You don't have to worry about
not getting your list done.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.772
But rather than drink the cup
of tea and check your email

01:21:54.772 --> 01:21:56.980
and be on the conference
call and have something else

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.310
going on at the same
time, take a few moments

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:03.660
and just do that fully,
and see what happens.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.190
AUDIENCE: As a follow
up to one or both

01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:09.080
of those last
questions, we talk a lot

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.255
about getting into flow
experiences at work,

01:22:11.255 --> 01:22:13.796
and you end up getting totally
absorbed in what you're doing.

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:16.212
And it almost seems like
that's a very different skill

01:22:16.212 --> 01:22:18.860
and a different experience
to being mindful.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.615
And I'm wondering is there
such a thing as too much flow?

01:22:22.615 --> 01:22:25.662
How do you balance
flow and mindfulness?

01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:26.495
MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hm.

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.840
SHARON SALZBERG: So how do you
balance flow and mindfulness?

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.920
I think they're
actually connected

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.670
in that mindfulness doesn't need
to be, and as it's practiced,

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:44.180
it doesn't need to be so labored
or stylized or effortful.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.690
It really becomes
this kind of flow.

01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:50.390
And I also think that
sometimes what we think

01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:56.140
is flow is just kind
of a distraction

01:22:56.140 --> 01:23:01.420
if it's not born out of a
kind of attention or interest

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.690
or some powerful passion
for what we're doing.

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:07.700
Then, you know, we're
just kind of drifting,

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.340
but we think it's--

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:15.890
Like, we often use this example
as a joke of a typical 5

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:19.529
or 10 or 15 minutes
in a meditator's mind,

01:23:19.529 --> 01:23:21.820
where you're sitting, and
maybe you're with the breath,

01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.622
and then you think, I wonder
where I should go for dinner.

01:23:26.622 --> 01:23:28.080
And then you think,
well, you know,

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.120
it would be good to
get a vegetarian meal.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.860
I mean, I spent
the whole afternoon

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.029
meditating, and after all--

01:23:36.029 --> 01:23:37.570
And then you think,
you know, I think

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:39.649
I'll be a vegetarian
from now on.

01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:42.190
That would be really healthy,
and it's better for the planet,

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.520
and it's more in line
with my moral values.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.190
And then you think,
you know, it's

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:49.610
hard to be a vegetarian
without really knowing

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:52.430
how to be a good
cook, because you

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:53.740
have to eat out all the time.

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.720
You don't get good food.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.660
So I better really
learn how to cook.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.550
And then you think, what time
does that bookstore close?

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:04.700
Maybe I can run
there and I can buy

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.140
all these vegetarian
cookbooks, and then I

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.592
could be a great vegetarian
because I'm a great cook.

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:12.550
And then you think, while
I'm in the bookstore,

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.570
I think I'll go to
the travel section,

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:17.530
because I need to find a book
to plan my next vacation.

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.460
Like, should I go to Mexico?

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:20.550
Should I go to Canada?

01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:21.580
Oh, I know.

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.270
Now I'm a vegetarian
and I meditate.

01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.350
I'll go to India.

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:28.200
And we kind of wake up walking
down the streets of New Delhi,

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.865
and the last thing
remember thinking

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:32.560
is, I wonder where I should
go for dinner, right?

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.010
So we've kind of
floated away on that sea

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:37.840
of associative thinking.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.900
But it's not really the
same thing, of course,

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.740
as a flow state, which is
much more completely unified.

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.670
And so we need mindfulness,
I think, almost

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:50.800
to know the difference.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:56.790
And mindfulness will move
into that more and more.

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.511
AUDIENCE: So is this working?

01:25:05.511 --> 01:25:06.302
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:09.373
AUDIENCE: So I guess
during periods of my life,

01:25:09.373 --> 01:25:11.345
I've had a couple
periods of my life

01:25:11.345 --> 01:25:15.289
where I've been much better
about mindfulness, and even

01:25:15.289 --> 01:25:18.740
[INAUDIBLE] short periods.

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:23.350
And one of my concerns I've had
is that it sort of cultivates

01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:28.160
this level of what I call
softness in myself that almost

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.970
doesn't feel like it has
a place in my work life.

01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:34.070
Like, almost that
sort of softness,

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:36.610
if I was to bring
it to my work life,

01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:41.350
I'd feel very vulnerable in
a way that doesn't feel OK.

01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.350
So I'm wondering if that
makes any sense to you,

01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.650
or if you have
any advice for how

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:49.556
to navigate that
potential fear I have.

01:25:49.556 --> 01:25:51.139
SHARON SALZBERG: So
you feel that kind

01:25:51.139 --> 01:25:54.882
of softness or vulnerability
in terms of relationships

01:25:54.882 --> 01:25:59.880
with others, or that you
would be too revealing?

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.320
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think that maybe

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.900
based on models I see around
me, it just seems so different.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.800
And some of the way I
sometimes want to carry myself

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.340
seem so different from
what I see in pop culture

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.020
and what I see in
other companies,

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.888
for example, that I
just feel abnormal.

01:26:19.888 --> 01:26:22.278
It feels like it would
be abnormal to bring

01:26:22.278 --> 01:26:23.310
that kind of tone.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:27.125
I try to anyway,
but I don't know.

01:26:27.125 --> 01:26:31.150
I guess it's a fear that I have
based on a cognition of what's

01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:35.890
expected in the
modern work world.

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:39.490
SHARON SALZBERG:
Well, I think, yes, it

01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:42.620
can be really, really
tough, and for people

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:46.830
who work here, obviously,
you're very lucky, you know?

01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:52.310
But I think it's
also interesting.

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:54.120
Sometimes it's
interesting to be brave

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.050
and just to see what
happens, and how much of it

01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:00.390
is our own apprehension
and how much of it--

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:02.600
again, things need
to be expressed

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.760
as skillfully as possible.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:10.220
But sometimes, I mean,
I've seen that situation

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:17.160
in different kinds of settings,
and in some surprising ways.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.910
Sometimes there is actually
gratitude that happens.

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:23.785
I mean, again, not
if you're preachy,

01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:32.960
and not if you're losing an edge
of creativity or engagement.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.650
But you don't have to.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:39.510
You can be coming from
a different place.

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.770
And I've just seen
lots of times when

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:44.450
someone in a group,
a collective,

01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:48.990
is really grateful for
somebody pointing out, like,

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:51.310
just the being.

01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:54.333
Maybe we don't have to do that,
or I don't have to do that,

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:57.295
or I can't bear to
do that, you know?

01:27:57.295 --> 01:28:01.820
In some way, I'm going to
have to try it in this way,

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.990
or try this direction.

01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:05.360
That's how things
change, really,

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.460
is, I think, by one person
being able to be authentic

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.870
in some way.

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:16.520
MALE SPEAKER: To
add to that, also,

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.120
I think that being vulnerable
and displaying vulnerability

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.790
is something you can play with
from a leadership perspective.

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:28.920
Strategic use of vulnerability
can be really powerful, right?

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:35.280
You don't want to come over like
a shambling wreck, you know?

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.170
But to actually let
someone behind the scenes,

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:42.170
even in a leadership position,
is extraordinarily powerful

01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:43.740
if you do it strategically.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.930
So advice would be, look for
opportunities to, particularly

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:50.850
with people you feel safe for,
to play with that edge, right?

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:53.910
And you may find out
that the censorship

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:55.220
is coming more from inside.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.700
Like, the call is
from inside the house,

01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:00.690
rather than what the
reaction of other people

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:01.670
would necessarily be.

01:29:06.152 --> 01:29:07.534
I got a fun one.

01:29:07.534 --> 01:29:08.450
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:09.908
MALE SPEAKER: So
one of the reasons

01:29:09.908 --> 01:29:12.520
why I'm so grateful that Sharon
is spending the afternoon

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.500
with us is if you look
at what's going on with,

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.080
like, mindfulness and
meditation and some of you

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.440
may be going to Wisdom 2.0 this
weekend, or saw Time Magazine,

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.580
or maybe even friends or
relatives are you asking

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.930
about this thing, if they
know you're into it--

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.040
it wasn't always that way.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.610
It's a really recent phenomenon.

01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:34.760
And one of the things I'm
very grateful for for Sharon

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.430
is she's one of the OG,
original gangsters, who

01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:44.700
took these practices in the late
'60s, early '70s, and thought,

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.500
wow, these might
actually work in the US.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:52.330
And I think, actually, to arrive
at that conclusion in 1971

01:29:52.330 --> 01:29:54.720
is sort of a hell of a thing.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.910
And especially to be here.

01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:58.540
So could you have imagined?

01:29:58.540 --> 01:29:59.670
It's 1971.

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.660
Everyone's wearing bellbottoms,
sideburns, big hair, that one

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.920
day, that mindfulness would
be sort of the buzz word?

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.920
And what do you think are
the positives of that,

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.711
and what are some of
the negatives of that?

01:30:11.711 --> 01:30:13.120
And how does it feel?

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.377
Like, what's that like?

01:30:15.377 --> 01:30:17.710
Oh, and also, thank you for
doing that whole bringing it

01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:18.210
here thing.

01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.972
SHARON SALZBERG: Oh,
yeah, you're welcome.

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.620
I got a new phrase.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.332
OG.

01:30:26.332 --> 01:30:27.040
MALE SPEAKER: OG.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.471
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah, OG.

01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:30.870
Original gangster.

01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:33.180
Wow.

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.320
No, I never, ever, ever
would have imagined.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.010
None of us did.

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:40.480
And I have to say, honestly,
that our coming back-- well, I

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.900
told you the story about Di
Pama telling me to teach.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:48.190
It wasn't like we had a
strategic plan, or even much

01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:49.020
of a vision.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.030
We-- Joseph Goldstein,
Jack Kornfield,

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:56.500
and I began teaching
together, and we

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.596
would respond to
invitations, and somebody

01:30:58.596 --> 01:31:00.220
would write and say,
I can get together

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.310
some friends and a cook.

01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:02.995
Will you come teach a retreat?

01:31:02.995 --> 01:31:04.190
And we'd teach that retreat.

01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:05.670
And at the end of
the retreat, we never

01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:07.295
knew if there would
be another retreat.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.026
And then another
letter would come.

01:31:10.026 --> 01:31:12.100
And one day, someone
else suggested

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.680
we start the retreat center--
the Insight Meditation

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.400
Society-- and we did.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.900
We moved in on
Valentine's Day of 1976.

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:22.770
And honestly, our mantra
for the entire first year

01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:24.830
was, we can always
close in a year.

01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:26.300
We'll just close it in a year.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.040
If it doesn't work, and no one
wants learn how to meditate,

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.590
we'll just close it in a year.

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:32.050
And we couldn't get a mortgage.

01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:37.999
The property, which, have any
of you been there, by the way?

01:31:37.999 --> 01:31:38.790
AUDIENCE: In Barre?

01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:40.620
SHARON SALZBERG: Yes.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.710
It's a great retreat center
in Barre, Massachusetts.

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:46.104
And it's a big building.

01:31:46.104 --> 01:31:47.770
It was an [INAUDIBLE]
when we bought it,

01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:50.450
so it's kind of like this
institutional building that

01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:54.790
can sleep about 100
retreatants plus staff.

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:57.486
About 20 staff people.

01:31:57.486 --> 01:32:00.570
And 80 acres of
land, and it cost us

01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:05.750
$150,000 in 1976,
which we didn't have.

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:08.930
So we raised $50,000.

01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:10.730
The Fathers of the
Blessed Sacrament,

01:32:10.730 --> 01:32:13.410
which were running it, they
gave us a $50,000 mortgage,

01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:15.310
and we couldn't get a
mortgage from the bank.

01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:17.510
So these three people
had to personally cosign

01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:20.844
a loan for the money
for the other $50,000,

01:32:20.844 --> 01:32:23.010
and so they didn't like it
much when we kept saying,

01:32:23.010 --> 01:32:24.150
we can close it in a year.

01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:25.983
We can just close it
in a year, because they

01:32:25.983 --> 01:32:28.599
would have lost their money.

01:32:28.599 --> 01:32:29.390
But we didn't know.

01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:30.650
I mean, there was no sense.

01:32:30.650 --> 01:32:33.610
And it really wasn't strategic.

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:36.130
The practices had meant
so much to each of us,

01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:38.990
and it seemed like an
the important thing

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:42.425
to try to convey, and
retreats were tiny,

01:32:42.425 --> 01:32:44.720
and we were grateful
anybody showed up.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.320
And very slowly, things
really began to change.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.170
I never would have
imagined this.

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.510
And I think it's great.

01:32:55.510 --> 01:33:00.970
I think that if people are going
to reach for something to try

01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:05.050
to make their lives better,
or the situation around them

01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:07.530
better, like, why not, you know?

01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:09.900
It's a series of skills.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:14.440
And I am very method oriented,
as you can probably tell.

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.100
And one of the
reasons is because I

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:17.750
think that's what sets us free.

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:21.110
It's like, the method is
what we can do on our own,

01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:25.680
and really develop and cultivate
this kind of understanding.

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.712
And I think it's terrific.

01:33:27.712 --> 01:33:29.045
And it's going to be everything.

01:33:29.045 --> 01:33:38.540
It's already everything,
from ashtrays to whatever.

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.140
It's everything.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.690
And there are
people who are going

01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:44.972
to practice for all kinds
of different reasons.

01:33:44.972 --> 01:33:46.680
I mean, that was an
interesting question,

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.060
which we started
talking about earlier.

01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.989
When I wanted to learn how to
practice, I was 18 years old.

01:33:51.989 --> 01:33:53.780
I was going to school
in Buffalo, New York,

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.090
and I had to get
myself to India.

01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:01.580
So that was a strong motivation
to really learn a practice.

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.740
I had done a lot of internal
work just in getting to India,

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.495
and moving.

01:34:07.495 --> 01:34:09.210
I'd never even
been to California

01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:10.680
when I went to India.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.780
And these days, you
don't have to have

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:16.815
that kind of really
intense motivation.

01:34:16.815 --> 01:34:19.750
You just have to
go to a bookstore

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:22.655
or have a friend
who heard about it,

01:34:22.655 --> 01:34:24.020
or worked in a certain place.

01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.720
And it's going to be different.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.802
So it's very intriguing just to
see how we'll it will evolve.

01:34:29.802 --> 01:34:31.670
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:35.110
So speaking of bookstores, some
of the folks from the East West

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:37.420
Bookstore in Mountain
View are in the back,

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:41.196
and they have copies of
Sharon's book available,

01:34:41.196 --> 01:34:42.320
as well as some other ones.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.110
And it's my understanding
that in addition to

01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:48.380
offering this wisdom in
the form of dead trees,

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:52.700
that you can also purchase
electronic versions

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.060
for your readers there.

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.888
So if that's of interest
to you, it's right there.

01:34:57.888 --> 01:34:58.804
With that--

01:34:58.804 --> 01:34:59.971
SHARON SALZBERG: I think so.

01:34:59.971 --> 01:35:01.845
MALE SPEAKER: So, hey,
thank you all so much.

01:35:01.845 --> 01:35:03.680
It was really great
to have an opportunity

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.460
to spend an afternoon of
practice and chatting.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.040
And I hope it was
valuable for you.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.400
And thank you very much,
and thank you, Sharon.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.030
Thank you, Lindsay, for
putting this all together,

01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:16.980
and thank you guys for coming.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:26.318
