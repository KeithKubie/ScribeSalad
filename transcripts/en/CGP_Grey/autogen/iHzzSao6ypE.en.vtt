00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
 To crash on a crossroad, 

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.700
 You are always faced with the underlying traffic problem. 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.680
 In the green light, the first car gives gas, then the other, 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.940
 then the other, then the other and then you, 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.460
 just to get to red. 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.540
 If the cars would give gas at the same time 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.380
 you could go out. 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.320
 Coordination - not the cars - is the problem 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.460
 because we are monkey guitars with immediate reaction in time 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 and brief attention. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.360
 Even if we take everyone to break the gas in 3-2-1-Now 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.680
 it would be challenging. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.040
 This lack of coordination limits how many cars can cross a crossroads 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.200
 and when no one supports one another, 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.700
 the city's street network is blocked, and it requires a perennietÃ  to be solved. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.540
 In general, the more crossings are equated with more non-coordination, which equates to more traffic. 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.580
 This is the reason for the major highways: No crossroads. 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.460
 Divide and join, Yes. Crossroads, No. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.399
 No stops, no coordination problems, no traffic. 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.639
 Well this is the theory anyway. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 Cruises outside a car park would turn the problem back. 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.940
 And again, because the human reaction limits how many cars can go out 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.260
 when the color of the traffic light is changed 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.600
 But even without intersections, there would still be traffic on the highway. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240
 Traffic can simply be displayed. 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.520
 Let's take a highway with happy cars. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.440
 until a chicken crosses the road. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.860
 The driver who looks at it curbs a little, 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.380
 the driver behind him does not notice it immediately and stops a bit more than he needs. 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.220
 the driver behind him does the same thing until someone stops completely. 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 and, see, the cars that are approaching the highway should also stop. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 Although the chicken has long since disappeared, it has left a shadow of the crossroads on the highway. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 This is what happens when you are stuck in full-time traffic thinking, 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.120
 "There must be a cluster of dead before" and suddenly, the traffic ends 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.060
 without any downside in the way, to make it easier for you to be a good man. 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.860
 You simply pass through the shadow of the intersection, 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 the cause of which has disappeared over time. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.140
 And when this shadow crossroad moves. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 It's really a traffic snake that crawls in the street 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.520
 eating the cars coming to an end. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 In a circular road, a single car slows down 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 will launch a "Ouroboros" traffic that would last a lifetime, 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.340
 even when there is no problem with the road. 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.880
 If drivers could co-ordinate to give gas and to divide them simultaneously, 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.860
 could drive the car easily. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.160
 But they can not, so traffic gets stuck there. 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.040
 On the highway, the traffic snake grows if cars are eaten faster than pulled out, 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360
 and they shrink if it is pulled out faster than they are eating, 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.500
 disappearing when the last car gives gas before the other car stops. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.820
 Now, in many lanes, there is no need for chicken to block. 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.760
 A driver crossing limbs quickly with cars very close behind, is enough 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720
 the traffic is born, a snake who lives for hours and leaves. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 It is this fast pass that makes drivers behind to restrain and continue a zinzhir reaction. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.620
 But we can * make the traffic snake a little bit by changing the way we drive. 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820
 Your goal as a driver is to stay at the same distance from the car ahead 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.420
 just like the car is back all the time. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.510
 Tracking is a problem. Not because it causes more accidents but 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.069
 because as a trainer you can continue a traffic snake if the driver pauses. 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.989
 Always in the middle! 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.209
 This gives you more time to prevent over-braking 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.540
 also gives the driver back time. 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.640
 And when it comes to traffic, 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.299
 this rule would make all cars take the snake with speed. 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.440
 This is the simplest solution, changing people behavior, 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.860
 maybe by distributing this video to show how and why traffic is happening, 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 why the pursuits are a problem, and how we can work together to make the best ways. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.020
 end 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.560
 except, yes .. 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.800
 to express the desire that people are better than they are, is a terrible solution 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.580
 Forever. 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.780
 Instead, what works is a structured solution, 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.450
 which is fixed what cars without a driver do, 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.070
 cars without a driver can simply be programmed 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.520
 to stay in the middle and to give gas systematically. 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.500
 They will just do it 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 The more cars without a driver at a crossroads, the crossroads become more efficient. 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 An uninterrupted lane with cars without a driver increases the lap time. 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 hmm, not really! 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.980
 Even if we exclude people from the street 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.300
 we can completely escape from the crossroads. 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.419
 However, a traffic light is simply a driver for a road to communicate with other drivers 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.579
 on the other, weak and rude. 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.380
 Red means "Do not run away now, we're coming through the crossroads" 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.640
 Green means "You can continue" 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.400
 But drivers without a driver can talk to each other at the speed of light, 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.220
 with those coordinates, no need for traffic lights. 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
 As with the highway, the best crossroads are without crossing. 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.990
 People will never ride correctly. 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.880
 At intersections, the underlying problem is traffic 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.720
 that you see unfurled, like everything, are people. 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.340
 So the simplest solution to traffic is: 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.260
 Do not have monkeys driving the car. 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.240
