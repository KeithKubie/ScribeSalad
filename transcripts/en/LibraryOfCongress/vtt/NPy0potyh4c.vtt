00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.570
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.790
to our topic in preservation
series.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.130
I'm Fenella France, chief
of the Preservation Research

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.620
and Testing Division
and we're delighted

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.750
to have you here today.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.290
The presentation today is The
Digital Restoration Initiative:

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.900
Reading the Invisible library.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600
And our speaker is
Dr. Brent Seales.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.070
Brent is a professor and
chairman of the Department

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.620
of Computer Science and
the director of the Center

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950
for Visualization and
Virtual Environments

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.360
at the University of Kentucky.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.760
His research centers on computer
vision and visualization applied

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630
to challenges in the
restoration of antiquities,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.600
surgical technology,
and data visualization.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.130
In 2012-13, he was a Google
Visiting Scientist in Paris,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.710
where he continued work
on the virtual unwrapping

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.930
of the Herculaneum scrolls.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.890
In 2015, Brent and his team
identified the oldest known

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.330
Hebrew copy at the book of
Leviticus, which is carbon dated

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.980
to the third century C.E.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.120
And this has been a very
significant discovery

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.930
in biblical archeology.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.470
It's particularly
interesting because one

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.380
of the things we
find in conservation

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.630
and preservation is
integrating new technologies

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.920
as a very important part of what
we can do particularly as we try

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.700
and do those noninvasively.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.280
So I'd like to hand
over now to Dr. Seales

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.900
to give us a presentation.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.510
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.190
[ Applause ]

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.920
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: Thank
you, Fenella, and thank you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.480
to the Library of Congress
for the invitation to come

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.240
and speak to you today.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.750
It really is a pleasure
to be here from Kentucky,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.370
and when people look at the
slide and I begin my talk,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.450
often they wonder, where
is Kentucky exactly?

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.350
I'm not going to show you a map.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.800
The other thing people
wonder is,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370
what is the digital
restoration initiative?

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.910
That's what I'm going
to tell you about today.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.610
Before I start my talk, I'd like
to welcome the remote audience

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.910
and thank you for joining.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.720
And I also would like to
thank one of my sponsors

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.660
at the University of Kentucky,
Lee and Stacie Marksbury

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.390
for their kind support.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.460
In fact, the invisible
library, what I'm going to talk

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.800
about today is a phrase that
I coined from an article

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.130
that was published
in the New Yorker.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.220
And that article was a
retrospective of work

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.400
that I had began two decades
ago at the British Library.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.320
And here's a picture from that
era when really we were talking

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.160
about the digital library which
was about digitizing collections

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.960
and making them available
on something

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.260
that was new at the time.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.090
We called it the World Wide Web.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.480
And now we think of the
internet as being the place

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.110
where glorious digital editions,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.380
similar to the one
we implemented

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.730
in the 1995 Macintosh can
be available for scholars,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.870
researchers and the general
audience to be able to view

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.920
and enjoy and do scholarship on.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.330
This was the beginning of my
odyssey into the digital library

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.740
which then became for me
the invisible library.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.030
And I'm going to tell
you the story of that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.060
and how I became
interested in some

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.770
of the most profoundly damaged
parts of the invisible library.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.590
An example here is shown
from the collection in Naples

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.250
in Italy from the Villa of
the Papyri at Herculaneum.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.200
This library discovered several
hundred years ago is the only

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.860
classical library ever
discovered in situ

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.230
and contained many thousands of
manuscripts that were carbonized

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.800
and damaged in the
form that you see here.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.000
The retrospective that was
written in the New Yorker,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.390
I won't ask for a show of hands
of how many of you read it.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.490
Some of you did, I see.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:24.400
Had a really wonderful review
of-- all things Herculaneum.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.220
And the reporter John Seabrook
took the time to go through many

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.880
of the details of Herculaneum.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.910
But I'm going to spoil the
end of the piece for you.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.190
John ended the piece by saying,
by quoting one of my colleagues

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.970
who said, "I do not expect this
scroll would be read during

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.270
my lifetime.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.290
And he closed the lid of the
small box with both hands,"

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.830
that box containing
one of those scrolls,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.160
"his shoulder slumped
in defeat."

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.930
I hated this ending.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.500
When I read this
ending, I almost--

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.580
I was in the living room with
my family, I almost wept.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.490
And so I had read it and
weeping, I invited John

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.560
out to the University of
Kentucky so that I could talk

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.240
to him over bourbon
drinks and the racetrack

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.640
which is what we do at
Kentucky, and I asked him.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.200
And of course we
had a lovely time

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.030
and John was really
just writing the story

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.140
about how hard it is actually
to read this material.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.370
And as he followed my team
along and wrote the article,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.460
he did sense that, you
know, we were struggling

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.620
because it is a hard problem.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.990
And one of the things
that I want you

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.240
to understand today is
the timescale of the quest

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.770
that I have been on to be able
to read some of this material

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.410
and convert the invisible
library to the visible one.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.890
And I also want you to
understand some of my optimism

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.490
about why I think we're on the
verge of being able to do some

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.680
of the most interesting
material.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.800
I am fundamentally a--
an optimistic person.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.410
And my mom pulled out from our
archives and you at the Library

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.200
of Congress will appreciate
the idea of my mother creating

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.140
for me an archive of the
Buffalo Evening News from 1969.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.060
She pulled out the paper
that she saved for me

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.960
about the land--
the moon landing.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.960
And I pulled that out just a
few months ago and opened it up

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.980
and remembered how I felt, you
know, in that era being inspired

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.180
by what we could do, that
we could engineer a way

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.480
to actually walk on the moon.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.960
So I'm going to start with a
prologue about inspiration.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.930
When I began this
work in the late 90's,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.520
this idea of converting
the invisible library

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.610
into the visible library, and
I hadn't given that words.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:00.510
Early in my work, I was sent a
letter from an unknown person

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.510
who had found evidence of
my work in the literature.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.510
Her name is Cheryl Seacrist
and she lives in this area.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.110
And Cheryl found
that I was doing work

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.590
on digital restoration.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.370
And she said to herself, well,
you know, I have something

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.670
that needs to be restored.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.920
So, she cold called me and she
actually sent me the artifact.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.680
And I'm showing you a
picture of that artifact.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.370
It was a one-page letter.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.160
And it had been faded so
the text was not legible.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.980
I took the letter to my lab
and this was prior to the time

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.350
that we had the sophisticated
equipment that we have now.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.980
And I know Fenella will
understand when we talk

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.240
about spectral imaging
and special light sources,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.980
we just didn't have those
things at the time in the lab.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.020
We also didn't have the kinds of
sensors we needed to do imaging.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.450
We did have flatbed
scanners though,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.780
that were incredibly precise
and very high resolution.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.140
And I started to
play with this letter

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.840
and found the transformation
in the color spaces

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.120
that were available
that allowed me

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.890
to highlight exactly the place

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.840
in that flatbed scanner scanned
image that would bring out some

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.670
of the text, giving me a handle
on a process for restoration.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.400
And so we put a team
together and I had, by hand,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.750
a team of students
walk through the data

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.090
and do a complete restoration.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.740
Now what had really intrigued me
and the reason why I bring this

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.030
to you now, what really
intrigued me about this is not

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.740
that we were being able to
bring text that was invisible

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.340
to the visible place but
that the text represented

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.640
a narrative.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.780
And I was really interested
in what the narrative was.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.820
I mean I had in my hands
evidence of a story

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.250
but I couldn't read the story

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.470
until we solved the
technical problem.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.940
"Dearest Cheryl Ann.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.240
Hello, my little darling.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.540
How are you this evening?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.840
Fine I hope."

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.920
It turned out that this letter
was from a father who is

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.890
in the World War II Pacific
Theater on a landing ship tank.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.330
It was from him to his daughter

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.240
and his daughter Cheryl
was the one who ended

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.610
up sending me the letter to see
if I could do a restoration.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.390
How wonderful it was
when we read the letter

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.380
to realize Frank closes the
letter, "Be a good girl.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.350
Oceans of love and kisses.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.820
Please write soon."

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.780
Of course, I think Cheryl
might have been three.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.080
"Love, your daddy Frank."

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.650
And, you know, what
a beautiful image.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.790
He is looking at an ocean

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.080
and it doesn't really
look so kind, right?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.710
It's the World War II Pacific
Theater that he writes oceans

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.250
of love because he's
thinking about his daughter.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.540
So all of this really
resonated with me

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.160
and provided the
inspiration, as I now look back,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.820
for the approach to some pretty
profoundly damaged materials

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.040
that I now call the
invisible library.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.420
On the left, you see
an ancient manuscript--

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.770
medieval manuscript actually
from the cotton collection

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:11.600
at the British Library,
left unrestored, damaged.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.670
Most of the volumes in the
collection were restored

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.320
and I'll show you in a
minute what they looked like,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.810
that restoration.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.420
On the right, you
see court documents,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.000
probably Ming Dynasty.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.220
These are in the archives at
the National Palace Museum,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.810
museum in Taipei, Taiwan.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.420
And of course, you have the
iconic Herculaneum scrolls

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.720
of which there are probably 2

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.540
or 300 now still remaining
unopened, little time capsules

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.560
from the classical era
representing the possibility

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.780
of who knows what if we
could only read them.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.190
And I will also talk today
about what Fenella mentioned

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.570
in the introduction which
is the scroll from En-Gedi,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.340
the scroll having come to me
through no fault of my own

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.850
from three years back
and turned out to be one

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.700
of our biggest successes.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.870
So the roadmap for my talk
is to first inspire you

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.750
with the textual so
that you understand

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.380
that not only can we
recover readable text

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.800
but we can recover
text to the degree

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.970
that we can understand
narrative and do scholarship.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.620
And I'm going to give you
a flavor of the technical

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.740
so that you can understand
exactly why this is a hard

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.620
problem and what's changed in
the last 10 years to be able

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.960
to allow us to solve
this problem.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.880
And then I'll finish my talk
by speaking a little bit

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.150
about the collaborative
which turns out to be one

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:40.850
of the most crucial pieces
of the puzzle to be able

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.310
to read the invisible library.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.720
So let me start with digital
restoration part 1, pages.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.360
In the mid 2000s, I had
the chance to do a project,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.130
the Marciana Library,
in collaboration

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.160
with Harvard University, the
Center of Hellenic Studies

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.180
which is right here
in Washington D.C. ran

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.790
by Harvard University.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.610
And the project was to
capture a digital copy,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.590
make a digital facsimile
of the "Venetus A"

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.760
which is the oldest complete
copy of Homer's Iliad.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.450
And of course you know
the story of Iliad

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.690
because we saw the
movie with Brad Pitt.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.770
And those of us who are computer
scientists use that as the way

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.940
to solidify our education
of the classics.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:36.050
Prior to the in facsimile, we
made in 2008 of the "Venetus A",

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.750
there was one other facsimile.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:45.520
It was 1908-- early
1900's, either '01 or '08,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.700
photography done by an Italian
by the name of Comparetti.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:56.030
And this image you see is the
quality of that facsimile.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.240
When I show you on top of that
the quality of our facsimile,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.950
not only is it better in color

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.780
because the original facsimile
was black and white photography,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.440
but it is also better
in resolution.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.100
Both of those features,
color and resolution,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.410
end up providing scholars
with so much more information.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.530
So the facsimile simply as
photography that we were able

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.010
to make advanced the field

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.750
because scholars could
take both the color

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.230
and the high resolution
and the fact

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.270
that we could digitally
disseminate this.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.900
Globally, we actually negotiated
a creative commons agreement

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.310
for the information
we collected.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.950
Allowed for a never before--

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.450
a facsimile that was richer

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.450
than had ever been done
before on the "Venetus A".

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.510
So, again, here you see a
section of the decoration on one

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.480
of the pages, it is a medieval
manuscript and then you see,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.020
as a layer that I fade up
the corresponding result

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.100
from our facsimile and you
see how much better it is.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.380
Now, a few surprising things
came out of this work.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.290
Not only was I getting my
bearings and what it meant

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.740
to do digital restoration
but on the left,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.820
you see in Comperatti's edition,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.080
there is actually more
information available

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.850
and visible than in ours because
in the intervening 100 years,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.520
things actually disappeared.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.650
And we were actually
surprised by that.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.810
I don't know why now that I look
back on it but I just thought,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.300
well, it's better imaging and so
we'll always have better results

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.690
but some things disappear.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.500
And so the comparison
between the two,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.810
and this as I play this
fade from one to the other,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:48.640
will show you as a set of
layers how you can compare the

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.690
information that is available
in one and the other.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.110
One thing I learned is that
when an artifact has been imaged

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.970
over time, it's really
important not to get rid of any

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.020
of those examples but to
try to find a coherent way

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.500
to put them all together.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.050
So we began to think
in terms of pages,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.640
not just sequentially
representing a manuscript

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.990
but temporally, right,
representing a manuscript

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.450
as it has been photographed
over time, and try to find a way

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.830
to put those together.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.360
And we developed
some infrastructure

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.950
to be able to do that.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:28.290
Second thing with regard to
pages in that era that we began

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.470
to develop was the idea
of digital restoration,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.240
which is to imagine that
after you've taken an image

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.780
of something that's
badly damaged,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.630
you can without risk start
to envision the possibility,

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.980
and here I'll highlight a
damaged region and I will blow

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.030
up this region for you to see.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.980
You can imagine the possibility
of a digital restoration,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.430
maybe by an artist or by a
scholar who really understood

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.860
from the data what
really was there.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.350
And there's no risk at all
to the object to be able

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.860
to view this as a
layer, as a page.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:11.150
And it can be very
interesting scholar--

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.850
for scholars to be able
to play around this way

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.520
and it can also be
very entertaining

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.570
to imagine what should have been
there, what maybe was there.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.820
But one thing that it's not is
risky because it's all digital

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.110
and the original artifact is set
aside so that's it's protected.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:35.820
Wouldn't it be nice if in every
case we paid a little more

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:42.290
attention to the physical, you
know, disposition as oppose

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.580
to letting, you know,
certain restorers run free.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.670
Sometimes, you know,
it's a lot safer

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.220
to do the digital restoration.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.960
So let me just summarize
this by saying

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.500
with pure manuscript pages,
I began to develop this idea

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.040
of comparisons over time, pages
that have been taken over time,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.900
put together to be compared
and the visualization

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.990
of that using some technology
like the registration

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.180
of pages so that they align.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.670
And I want to point to before I
move on, one of the key results

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.490
from this era by my research
team and others having

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.820
to do with registration.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.650
So here's an example of a
photograph of a fragment

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.530
from the Dead Sea
Scroll collection

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:36.030
and a second photograph
taken at a different time

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.450
with a different camera
from an earlier era.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.890
And if I go back and forth
between these two images,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.140
you'll see that the text
doesn't line up at all.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.690
If you focus on the text,
the scale is different.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.040
Some text is more visible
in this ultraviolet shot,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:00.080
infrared shot than it is visible
in the visible light shot.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.240
And so we undertook the idea

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.410
of registering these together
based on just the text.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.550
And so now I'm going to show
you the algorithm running

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.160
to do the registration.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.810
Registration became a core
technology for us and others

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.910
in putting together
things that have been taken

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.620
at different times with
different devices over time.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.200
So what's happening in this
video is first we're seeking a

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.860
rigid transformation that tries
to match the text from one image

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.690
onto the text of
the other image.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:34.200
When that fails, we do
a nonrigid registration

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.510
which deforms nonrigidly the
text of one on to the other.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.850
And then when I fade back,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.840
you'll see that the
text matches exactly.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.990
And what we discovered
in using registration

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.160
as a core technology is that
if you focus on registration

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.700
around things like the text
which is the key thing,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.500
then you can look at how other
things have changed over time

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.540
that becomes a really
powerful way

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.730
to reconcile the diachronic
part, that part over time

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.620
of a collection as
it's been photographed.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.690
OK, so this takes me
to the second part

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.060
of reading the invisible
library, which is the fact

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.100
that not everything
we photograph is flat.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.930
In fact, it's far from flat.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:20.460
It's almost impossible
unless you're Comparetti

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.420
on the Piazza San Marco in 1908

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.540
where you've been given the
permission to slice the binding

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.160
from the book, and you've
been given the permission

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.740
to press each one of
the pages between glass,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.700
you've been given the permission
to use the bright sunlight

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.500
on the plaza so that the
lens can capture the best

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.800
possible image.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.970
So in that case,
things are pretty flat.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.550
But in the case for the rest
of us in the modern era,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.340
at the Library of Congress
for example, it's not going

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.950
to really be possible to
take a manuscript like this.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.180
And this is one of the
restored manuscripts

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.480
from the cotton collection.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.930
And what you see here is the
original parchment, the vellum,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.810
having been inserted
into paper frames.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.950
Paper and the vellum deform
at different rates over time

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.040
and they cause this
cockling to occur.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.860
It happens naturally.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.180
And that cockling means
that when you photograph

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.910
that page assuming that it's
flat, it creates deformations

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.320
in the letter forms, right?

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.310
And even in those squares that
were drawn around the boxes,

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.730
right, those are
no longer boxes.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.750
It becomes really hard to remove
the ambiguity of whether that's

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.570
in the manuscript itself or
whether that deformation is part

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.350
of the fact that the
manuscript is wrinkled.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:47.580
So we began to develop a way to
capture not just the photography

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.590
but also the shape of
every manuscript page

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.520
as we did the digitization

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.520
that shape helping
us do the next step

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.320
in digital restoration.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.420
So here you're seeing our
early version of a system

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.080
that allowed us to capture
the shape of every page,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.030
reconcile the shape
with the actual image.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.200
And then following
the capture of that,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.220
do what I call digital
flattening.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.360
And the digital flattening
allows us to take the page

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.960
as it sat and then
run a simulation

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.210
to render what it would like
had we been able to iron it out.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.690
It's sort of digital ironing.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.920
Pioneered this in the mid to
late 2000s as a way to try

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:36.780
to recover the shape problem as
opposed to just the photography

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.840
so with layers and
pages, we worked on ways

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.970
to amplify the image then
we started working on ways

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.560
to recover and restore
the shape.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.870
And of course you see this
is all done without risk

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.850
to the real object premised
on the idea of being able

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.980
to capture more information
at digitization time.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.320
So flattening allowed us to
get at pages that were more

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.620
than just photography

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.870
but included the shape
3D representation

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.300
and then the visualization
of that either as 3D

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.280
or as 3D then flattened so
that you could see the layers

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.580
and make the comparison.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.840
Here, let me show you
an example in practice

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.520
from the cotton collection
and then ultimately applied

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.620
to the Chad Gospels which
you can find online.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.070
If you'd like to talk
to me afterwards,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.340
I can send you the link where
you can try the entire archive

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.990
in the creative commons
for noncommercial use

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.760
at the internet archive
and at our website as well.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.010
Take a look at the
photography on the left.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.050
You see that because
the page is not flat,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.520
that line at the
bottom is not a line.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.820
And then once it
has been flattened

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.990
that becomes a line even
without that being a constraint.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.250
And then if I show you an
off access view and toggle

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.820
between that off axis
view and the 3D view,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.730
you can see the result
of the flattening

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.670
where the lines no longer
crawl up over the hill

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.490
because we've removed
the cockling.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.020
And we've done it
digitally as a restoration.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.980
So what you're seeing here
in my work are examples

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.730
of moving toward two things.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:18.540
A complete framework for
digital restoration and the idea

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.960
that when you collect data, you
do more than make a facsimile.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.700
What you're really interested
in is doing data collection.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.140
A facsimile is a
byproduct of that.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.700
And what you collect, say
you collect spectral imaging,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.390
you can make an RGB
image from that.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.970
But it's really the
spectral block,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.380
the data that you're
interested in.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.220
And we noticed this
trend, others did as well,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.550
and we started talking about
beyond digitization, right,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.570
working instead toward
the complete capture

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.160
of all the characteristics
of a proxy of an object.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.720
All right, so this brings me to
the place where now we can talk

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.980
about complete unwrapping and
how you might approach something

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.100
in the invisible library
that looks like this.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.910
OK, I wasn't introduced to
the Herculaneum collection

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.270
as a child nor did I
study at university.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.920
History for me as a
computer scientist went back

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.100
to the 1950s.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.870
Prior to that, I know

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.910
that a volcano did explode
in the bay of Naples.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.960
And I have since of course
learned of the history.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.300
Also I am now not ignorant
of it but, you know,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.750
prior to my mid 2000s work,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.500
I really didn't understand the
significance of the collection

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.000
from Herculaneum,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.700
how significant these
manuscripts are

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.720
that they were discovered
at all.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.260
That they remained after
a volcanic explosion is--

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.080
continues to be a
miracle, but also the fact

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.040
that all prior attempts

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.910
of physical unwrapping
generate this kind of damage.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.660
This kind of damage
was finally halted

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.690
in the mid '80s and early '90s.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.460
And that halting created
an opportunity for me just

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.920
as I came on the scene and the
opportunity was might there be a

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:11.200
way to do the unwrapping but
do it completely digitally

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.470
as a restoration rather than
assume that there is going

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.140
to be a physical
restoration process

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.250
that will allow this to happen.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.740
So what I would like to show
you now is the first example

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.950
of me ever having tried that
on an example that I concocted.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:33.060
OK, so having latched on to
this idea after the progression

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.310
of taking photographs and
then rubbing out wrinkles

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.910
and thinking through well,

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.490
how could you do
complete unwrapping.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.880
I became familiar with imaging
technology that was being used

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.050
in medicine called
tomography which allowed you

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.670
to get a non-invasive
representation

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.510
of an object without opening it.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.870
Three-dimensional all the way
through completely non-invasive

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.170
and the machines
that were available

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.770
at the time were medical.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.300
So I made a proxy and I put
it in the machine at the--

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.270
in the basement of
the medical center

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.310
at the University of Kentucky.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.060
I guess this is when everyone
else was worried about Y2K

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.640
and apparently I was not.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.670
I was thinking about this.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:21.000
I want to show you the
data in its entirety.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.170
And in playing the data,
I want you to understand

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.050
that you're seeing
the axial view.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.940
So I-- this is a piece of
canvas, it's rolled up,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.230
and you're seeing that
canvas played as a movie edge

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:37.300
on with slice near you as
the first frame of that movie

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.250
and then slices as you go down
the roll as the movie plays.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.650
So you can think about looking
at the end of a jelly roll

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.440
as a deli slice or
takes a piece off.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.690
And that's kind of what
this data looks like.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.850
Let me point out that there are
flashes on the canvas surface,

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.540
that's where the ink is.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.070
So now that you've seen all
the data, you should be able

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.770
to tell me exactly
what it says, right?

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.770
Well, I couldn't for sure,

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.700
although we constructed
the object.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.830
But once we used our
software to convert the data

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.450
from the way it came
from the scanner

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.230
into a complete
three-dimensional model

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.740
that we could then unfurl, just
a follow on example of rubbing

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.890
out wrinkles digitally.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.740
This simulation allowed us
to be able to take that data

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.390
in its original form
and then put it

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.280
into a form that was readable.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.800
And we dubbed this
process virtual unwrapping

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.590
because what we were doing
is unwrapping something

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.340
that was totally in 3D so
that it could be viewed again

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.630
as a two-dimensional image.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.930
So now if I asked you what
do you see in this image,

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.790
you'd probably will say to
me a bunch of wavy lines

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.980
and I have no idea why you put
that on this original artifact.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.100
And, yeah, I don't really
know why I wrote these

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.400
symbols either.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.970
We got paint from a paint
store and made this proxy

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.030
so that we could understand how
the different paints would show

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.910
up in the imagery and if we
could do complete unwrapping.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.440
So first example, we were able

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.490
to do a complete virtual
unwrapping from data that came

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.250
from a medical grade
tomography machine.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.700
So I began working toward
Herculaneum by building a set

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.440
of successively more
challenging examples

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.960
and more interesting
text on those examples.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.750
So here is some quotes from
the Iliad, "Two fates bear me

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.480
on to the day of death.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.500
If I hold out here
and I lay siege

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.040
to Troy my journey home is
gone, but my glory never dies.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.070
If I voyage back to
the fatherland I love,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.700
my pride, my glory dies.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.830
True, but the life that's
left me will be long."

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.180
So which do you want?

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.130
Well, I want them both.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.640
And we spent a lot of
time in Jessamine County,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.230
Kentucky trying to
add to the mix

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.030
of our examples carbonization.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.330
Because I was worried

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.610
that carbonization fundamentally
would change things

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.010
in our ability to image
and then do unwrapping.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.630
So we burned a number of these
examples until we figured

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:22.930
out how to do a vacuum
evacuated carbonization process.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.630
And once we did, we were able to
run a complete example through--

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.710
this is the data from
one of those examples.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:34.660
You see a lot more spirals,
you see the ink signal

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.440
on the surface of the papyrus
available as brighter spots,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.760
and I'll show you an
example from that.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.580
Since we scanned
this in sections

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.820
to get higher resolution
than was available

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.410
with medical grade scanners
focused on a single letter form,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.390
and that single letter form

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:59.140
after the data is virtually
unwrapped looks like that.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.210
Which inspired us to believe
that even through carbonization,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.530
it's probably going to be
possible to see ink virtually

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.740
through this process
of virtual unwrapping.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.790
So the framework was set and
the examples led me to believe

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.770
that process of scanning
using tomography,

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.120
probably x-ray based, but
really any kind of method

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.910
that would provide a
volume noninvasively

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.340
that captured the would
be the starting point.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.000
Then this idea of segmentation,
which is a technical term

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.500
but it's the idea of finding
exactly where the layer is

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.690
that has writing and then
building a representation

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.210
around that, and then finally
the visualization of the result

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.420
by doing some kind
of unwrapping.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.060
That became the pipeline
and the framework as early

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.230
as the mid 2000's for
what we want to do.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.410
Now at this point sometimes
even I am a little confused

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.340
with the visualization of
what this data looks like.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.190
So I would like to play
for you with audio,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.340
a video that reenacts an
example so that you can get it

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.740
in your mind how
virtual unwrapping,

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.920
all of these steps,
actually works.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.220
So, I'd like to play this now.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.350
&gt;&gt; [Background music]
For thousands of years,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.650
people have written on scrolls.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.390
The scrolls can contain
historical records,

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.120
religious texts or
stories but many

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.740
of them have been
damaged over time.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.790
For example, the En-Gedi scrolls
found near the Dead Sea were

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.550
in a building that
had burned down,

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.750
leaving this scrolls charred,
blackened and wrinkled.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.230
But since the En-Gedi
scrolls, [inaudible] is opened.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.980
How can we ever unlock
their contents?

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.950
There is in fact a way to read
scrolls without damaging them.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.980
Imagine for a moment that a
baker has two types of dough.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.440
The white dough represents
papyrus

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.980
and the red dough
represents ink.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.800
Using the red dough, the
baker can create a pi symbol

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.100
on the white dough.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.550
When the baker rolls
up the dough,

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.710
the pi symbol is
obviously no longer visible,

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:10.160
just like when papyrus
is rolled up.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:19.100
Imagine the effects of time and
the environment are this oven,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.910
baking the pastry
for a thousand years.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.920
If the pastry was still soft,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.520
the baker could simply unroll
it, but now it will break

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.820
and the information
will be lost.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.120
The baker can however slice the
pasty and decode the message

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.920
from the traces of red
dough in each slice.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.090
[ Music ]

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.020
Using sophisticated
technology, it is now possible

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.680
for the scrolls to
be digitally unrolled

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.110
without ever damaging
the scroll.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.340
It's important for damaged
scrolls containing unique

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.100
ancient information
to both physically

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.400
and digitally preserved.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.530
There are many ancient scrolls
but they're too damaged to read

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.510
that likely contain historically
enlightening information.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:09.240
[ Music ]

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.300
Digitization and virtual
unwrapping allow us

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.510
to view this otherwise
inaccessible information.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:31.070
[ Music ]

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.370
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: I'd like
to specially acknowledge my son

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.140
Jessie who did the stop
motion animation as a project

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.440
in high school for that.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.110
And that very last sequence
actually took five hours.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.750
So does that help?

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.820
Does that help give
an intuition, yeah?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.700
So the x-ray basically gives
you that without having

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.970
to do the actual slicing and
then the rest is all software.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.960
So you can imagine how
excited I was to go

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.880
to the Institut de
France, make the approach

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.960
to Monsieur [foreign
language] who was

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:09.430
at the time the Secretary
of Perpetual of the Academy

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.380
of inscriptions et
belles-lettres

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.350
which is the academy that is
interested in the classics.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.550
And seated, he granted
me the permission

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.340
with my collaborator
Daniel Delattre on the right

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.380
and the librarian Madame
Pastoureau on the right,

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.960
Daniel on the left, madam
pastor on the right, to go ahead

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.760
and scan two intact Herculaneum
scrolls that happened to be

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.690
in the collection at
the Institut of France.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:42.910
They have six papyri from
the Herculaneum site.

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:48.050
They were required by
Napoleon, I believe--

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:53.300
in fact, I'm sure they were a
gift to Napoleon and they ended

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.340
up at the Institut of France.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.570
Four of them were unwrapped.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:03.400
And so they are in fragmentary
state but two were intact.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.700
And we believe that the time

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.790
that by scanning them using
the best tomography of the day

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:15.390
and employing one these three
ideas, either a shape change

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:17.360
or perhaps some impurities
in the ink

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.470
or maybe even a multi-power
trick

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.150
where the x-ray would allow us

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.210
to use different power
settings to see contrast.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.350
That using one of those
methods we would be able

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.860
to push the data completely

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.670
through a virtual
unwrapping pipeline.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:37.780
And here you see Madame Fabienne
Keru who was the conserver

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.260
at the time handling
one of the scrolls.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.340
And as an aside,
I want to tell you

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.280
that there were some
surprising things that occurred.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.160
Well, they were surprising
to me at the time

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.570
because I I'm naïve.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.030
I continue to be naïve.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.520
And I thought that the hardest
part would be scanning the

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.560
scroll and then processing
the data.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.480
But in fact, the hardest part
was protecting the scroll

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.120
so that we could scan it at all.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.080
And we did that in the end
by creating a custom-fit case

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.290
that the scroll could be
put into because it needed

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.440
to be turned on its end to be
able to do a gentle pirouette

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.450
in the machine we had
to do the tomography.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:27.790
So in order to create that case,
we scanned the exterior shape

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.260
of the scroll, made a model.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.060
And because we didn't have
3D printing at the time,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:39.500
we used an artist and the model
to cast a mold and that mold

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:46.950
from plaster to injected
polyurethane cut down

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.490
and then seated with the base.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.560
And I'm not really proud
of that plywood base.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.670
That was a prototype.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.560
Ultimately-- And you see one of
the scrolls being formed fitted

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.010
into the shape that
we have there.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.670
Ultimately, we created
these nifty cases

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.550
that the conservators
agreed were a great way

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.040
to not only transport but also
to be able to scan the scrolls.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.510
And that process took six
months, back and forth

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.380
with our designers to Paris.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.150
You can imagine how mortified I
was to have to go back to Paris,

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.920
each time, time and time again.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.780
But our goal was to capture the
data and we did that in 2009.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.110
This is the first radiograph of
Herculaneum scroll taken in--

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.440
at the Institut of
France on site.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.910
And you'll the seam and the
radiograph going vertically.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.730
The dark mass is
the scroll itself.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:47.830
You see some of the texture of
the polyurethane as it was cast

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:52.810
and then you also see the
sophisticated closure mechanism

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.830
on the top of the container

00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:01.000
which is the rubber band
holding the case together.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.720
And here is what the
reconstructed slice looked like.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.470
In fact, let me play this
for you as a movie, OK?

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.250
So this is no jelly
roll, all right?

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.790
This is no piece of dough
with one big pi waiting

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.760
for you to decipher it, OK?

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.150
I want you to take this in
and imagine me watching this

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:32.070
and imagining how my software
is going to find every one

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.540
of those layers automatically

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.090
and then do the virtual
unwrapping

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.060
of every one of those wraps.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.360
And I'm sure right now
you're counting those, right?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.660
You're counting how
many there are.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.870
You can't tell exactly how
many there are, is that right?

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.670
Yeah, so we-- I freaked out, you
know, when-- because in the lab,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:56.040
I was doing what's
on the lower right.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:01.060
And the reality of
Herculaneum turned

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:06.710
out to be a lot more
tortured and challenging.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:11.850
So we had the permission to
capture the data and we did.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.960
We had what I believed
was a complete pipeline

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.260
for processing.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.560
And I still believe

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.100
that pipeline is
exactly the right way

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.640
to approach the problem.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.540
But we were not able at the time
in 2009 to segment the writing.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.590
We were not able to
actually solve this problem.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.900
So this brings me to the second
to the last part of my talk

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.860
where I'm going to talk about
the miracle that occurred.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.970
You know, whenever we
get in trouble, right,

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:47.230
we expect an actual miracle to
occur and sometimes it does.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.750
Sometimes it actually
does occur.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.620
I love this quote from one
of my favorite radio programs

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.100
so "This American Life" with
Ira Glass who interviewed Teller

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.420
of "Penn &amp; Teller",
the math magicians.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.880
And Teller said, "You can't
look at a half-finished piece

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.030
of magic and know
whether it's good or not.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.520
It has to be perfect before you
can evaluate whether it's good.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.070
Either it looks like a
miracle or it's stupid."

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.000
You know, when I heard this
interview I thought actually

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.570
that characterizes
virtual unwrapping for me.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:23.620
Because until the magic
occurred, I had been walking

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.110
around with a half-finished
trick, right?

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.360
We hadn't actually
completed the job.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.190
We had data that was good
and we had a pipeline

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.980
that we believed would work,

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.440
but we hadn't pushed
everything all the way through

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.950
and so the trick was incomplete.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:47.000
And when a trick is incomplete,
yeah, it looks stupid, OK?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.090
So, how stupid did it look?

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.540
Well, I don't know how many

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.390
of you have Googled your
name and an adjective.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.030
Just pick an adjective
and see what comes up.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.570
If you Googled my
name and stymied,

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.550
and then you just hit
I'm Feeling Lucky,

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.430
you will find always and
forever probably this article

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.590
about how we weren't making
progress on being able

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.360
to read these scrolls
and that was true.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.710
I wasn't able to
argue with that.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:18.630
We were at an impasse until the
scroll from En-Gedi came my way

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.920
through no fault of my
own three years ago.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.110
So I want to talk to you about
that scroll and why it was

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.820
so significant in helping
me complete the process

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.220
of virtual unwrapping.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:36.510
In 2015, I met Pnina
Shor who is the head

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.750
of the Dead Sea Scrolls Project

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.220
at the Israel Antiquities
Authority.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.270
And I met her there because
she had agreed to give me

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:50.960
on disc all of the data that
she had scanned of this scroll

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:57.210
that had been found in an
obscure location, the synagogue

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.770
on the shore of-- the
western shore of the Dead Sea

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.530
in a town named Ein Gedi and
had been found 50 years ago.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.000
It was so badly damaged
that no one was able

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.130
to do any physical restoration.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.500
She on her own accord with a
team scanned it and was unable

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.700
to make any sense of
the data and so agreed

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.020
to give me the data and let
my team take a crack at it.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:25.270
I'll always be grateful to
Pnina for giving me a shot.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.740
Because in the intervening time,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.360
our software become a
lot more sophisticated.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.260
We worked on the data
after she gave it to me.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.710
And when she called for an
update, I really thought nothing

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.950
of going ahead and sending her
what our current progress was,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.940
because as you see being
played in this movie,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.840
our software had matured to
the place where we were dealing

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.910
with real data and we were
working daily on algorithms

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.240
that would help us
improve our ability

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.470
to take really sophisticated
data similar to Herculaneum data

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.480
and convert it into
completely unwrapped results.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.640
So I'm going to go ahead
and forward past the rest

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.600
of this video and show you the
first image that we obtained

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.670
from the En-Gedi data.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.660
And you could see in this
draft image some problems, OK.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.200
On the lower right
you see the smearing

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.810
from our incorrect algorithm
at virtual unwrapping,

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.850
where we were creating some
smearing and some stretching.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:28.630
But you can also
see very clearly

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.320
that there is obvious writing

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.550
and we were able to
see that writing.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.580
And it turns out that Pnina
was able to read that writing.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.980
I sent her the draft
and she said,

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.310
in an email to me afterwards,

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.650
Brent you won't believe what
groundbreaking discovery

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.950
you've made.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.250
It's still all hush
hush because we want

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.390
to have a press conference
about it next week.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:52.800
Which of course that was

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.190
when the image I
sent her was a draft.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.420
And then she went on to say what
we've deciphered is the first

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.900
chapter of the book
of Leviticus.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.200
After the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.790
this is the earliest
bible ever found.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.810
We already have it carbon dated
to the sixth century which turns

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.440
out to be a misreading,
it was third century CE.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.480
And if that's not enough,
it's the first time a bible,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.060
a Hebrew bible was been found
within an excavated synagogue.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.770
So, it turns out that
it was a big discovery.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.730
All they needed was the kernel
of what we had done up until

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.240
that point to be able to read
it because it was a known text.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.310
And we did have the press
conference the next week.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:32.960
So probably the first
time Skype ran for an hour

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.170
without actually
crashing, but you see me

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.470
on the background being
projecting from my office

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.700
at the University of Kentucky
with my team behind me

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.480
like little angels whispering
the right answers into my ears.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.060
And you see in front
in Jerusalem Pnina Shor

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.870
on the left, Sefi Porath,
the original archeologist

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.420
who pulled it with his own
hands from the ground who came

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.140
out of retirement for that
moment, and on the right,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.950
David Merkel who did the scan.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.130
So let me tell you a
little bit about this scroll

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.600
and show you our result, and
then I'll complete my talk.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.080
On the shore of the Dead Sea

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:14.710
in the early '70s was
discovered an ancient synagogue,

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.290
it was Byzantine.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.010
And it is now a national park.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.210
So you can go there and you
could see the synagogue.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.770
It looks like this.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:25.620
It's a beautiful mosaic
floor covered by a tent.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.930
And in the floor was
found the holy ark.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.230
And in that holy ark is

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.600
where the En-Gedi
Scroll was discovered.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.100
It was so badly damaged
that it was not possible

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.130
to identify anything about it.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.700
But Sefi, the archeologist
always believed

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.550
that it could hold significance.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:46.850
And so he told me personally

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.150
when we did the press
conference,

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.450
he actually thanked me.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.960
He said, "I didn't know if in
my lifetime we would ever solve

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.260
this mystery."

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.870
But let me show you
now the second video

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.250
that actually has audio
which will explain

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.560
to you the complete unwrapping
process on the En-Gedi Scroll.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.490
&gt;&gt; Virtual unwrapping begins

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:08.370
by acquiring a three-dimensional
volumetric scan

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.270
of the damaged manuscript.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.260
This scan produces a set
of cross-sectional images

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.770
that show the internal
structure of the scroll.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.520
When viewed as a 3D object,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.480
one can clearly see the
individual layers of the scroll

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.880
that any text on the surface

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.400
of those layers is
obscured from view.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.290
In order for a readable version
of the scroll to be produced,

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.860
these images must be passed

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:33.360
through our virtual
unwrapping pipeline.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.500
First, we capture the 3D shape
of the layers of the scroll

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.760
in a process called
segmentation.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.210
On the left side of the
screen, the software moves

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.030
through the scroll image
by image tracing the shape

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.330
of a single scroll back.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.670
On the right, we see the 3D
model that this produces.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.940
Next, we extract the
ink from the data

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.850
in a process called texturing.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.890
Using the 3D shape
generated by segmentation,

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.460
our software makes another pass

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.170
through the scroll this time
looking for very bright pixels.

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.030
Bright pixels indicate
regions of dense material.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.950
In this case, inks
made with iron or lead.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.050
We now have a single
wrap of the scroll

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.630
with the text shown
clearly on its surface.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.660
However, because the surface
is curved, it's difficult

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.100
to read all of the text
from one viewpoint.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.400
The flattening stage

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.300
of a pipeline converts
this textured 3D surface

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.450
into a flat plane so that the
text can be more easily read.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.020
To produce the best results,

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.430
these three steps must be
performed on one small section

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.130
of the scroll at a time.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.940
As a result, we end up
with several texture images

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.660
that must be merged together.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.960
This merging process creates
a single consolidated image

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.460
that shows the full text.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.700
Using this pipeline, we have
restored and revealed the text

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.690
of five complete wraps
of the En-Gedi Scroll.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.090
The two distinct columns

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:53.000
of Hebrew writing
revealed the scroll

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.610
to be the book of Leviticus.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.500
This marks the En-Gedi
Scroll as the earliest copy

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.330
of Pentateuchal book
ever found in a holy ark,

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.610
a significant discovery
in biblical archeology.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.250
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: And I'd
like to give special thanks

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.740
to my daughter who
did the voiceover.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.510
The price was right on that deal
and also, you know, I miss her

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:19.390
and so I'm reminded of her
when I hear her voice now.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.660
Somebody after my talk asked
me is your daughter OK thinking

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.540
that maybe, you know,
is it memorial

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.420
and I said, no, no she's fine.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.320
She just lives in
California, you know?

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.890
When they go off to
California, you know.

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.080
So here you go.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.240
This was our complete
unwrapping, five wraps,

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.510
fully readable text,
known text pushed

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:42.810
through the entire pipeline.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.160
The miracle occurred and now
the magic trick actually looks

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.340
like-- it doesn't look
stupid anymore, right?

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.530
Because it's complete
and we pushed

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.650
through the entire pipeline
and refined each section

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.640
of the pipeline to
the point we're now--

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.830
we think that we're
actually ready not only

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.050
to solve the technical
part of virtual unwrapping

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:07.050
for most materials but also
to provide those materials

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.660
as scholarship to scholars
who can then use the quality

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.460
of our result to do, for
example, biblical scholarship.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:17.140
And let me tell you that we did
that with the En-Gedi Scroll

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.450
and this is why it's
significant.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:24.720
This dating in terms of
biblical scholarship occurs

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.670
between the period of the Dead
Sea Scroll second temple period,

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:34.010
scroll from En-Gedi at 300 C.E.
and really the next witness

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.270
which was 6 or 700 years later

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.700
where Cairo Genizah
gives evidence

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.040
of the Masoretic
text being settled.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.240
And so there was some
question about how early

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.970
that Masorete text goes back
into the unsettled first

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.940
and second temple period.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.560
The scholars told
me all of this.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.260
I am not a biblical scholar.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.280
But look at what
we were able to do.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.040
We wrote a biblical
scholarship paper together.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.670
Michael Segal and Emanuel
Tov, giants in the field

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.900
of this area, with
me as a co-author,

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.050
and the reason why they
allowed me to be a co-author is

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.140
because the image they
used does not exist.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.070
The image that they used
is the result of a piece

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.190
of software that
we wrote, right?

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.020
It's completely generated
virtually.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.770
It's not a photograph, right?

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:26.070
It's not the result of
physically unwrapping anything.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:30.280
And so we were able to take that
image at a quality high enough

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.510
that a paleographer and a
biblical scholar could print it

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.570
out and create basically
what they would do

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.820
with the photograph
of an open fragment.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.910
And then because they could
see all the letter forms,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.190
do paleography, a
complete transcription

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.550
and biblical scholarship.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.770
So from the pages
to the flattening

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:53.150
to the complete 3D unwrapping,
you see the progression

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.740
of this work to the place
where now I could talk

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.310
about my rousing conclusion,

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.590
which is what I'm calling
reference amplification

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.390
and the use of what we all
have heard off in the news

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:07.540
in the last several
years machine learning.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.370
Now I want to tell you why
machine learning is really

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.200
important because
conventional wisdom,

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.350
which is almost always
wrong, which somehow I seem

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.700
to always adopt, right,
tells us a few things.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.710
It tells us that well, that
scroll was probably a fluke,

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:26.340
Seales got lucky, that's for
sure, there is obviously metal

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.920
in the ink so that you could
see the signal really easily.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:34.240
So this probably isn't
going to have any relevance

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.520
to Herculaneum because we
all know there is no metal

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.170
in the ink et cetera, et
cetera, conventional wisdom.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.650
Also conventional wisdom
also tells us, you know,

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:43.010
why couldn't it be Genesis?

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.330
You know, why did it have
to be-- just as an aside.

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:49.430
Well, it's true that there
was metal in the ink.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.050
We don't know exactly
the composition

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.340
because we analyzed
everything non-invasively.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:59.070
But if you take a look at
the signal in this figure

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.510
from our paper, you
can see really bright

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.860
where the Hebrew letters are,
meaning, you know, very dense,

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.900
lots denser, right, than
the surrounding material,

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.650
the animal skin.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:13.010
So how do I answer that
conventional wisdom?

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:17.100
I mean for the longest time, I
also believed this statement.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.420
Carbon ink is invisible
in tomography.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.720
I don't know.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.680
Those of you who know
may have heard that.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.580
But, you know, we
were doing some work

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.570
at a high energy
physics facility.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:37.110
And whenever I hang
around bright people,

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:39.280
they raise me up, right?

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.610
Does that work for you?

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:46.010
I don't know if I actually get
smarter or I just act smarter

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.140
because they're all
smart, right?

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.940
But, you know, we
started working together

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.130
and I started thinking, really?

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.430
Carbon is not visible?

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.390
I mean, why is everything
else visible in some way,

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.760
shape or form but carbon ink
on carbon is not visible?

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.330
I just don't get that.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:02.990
So we ran some numbers and
I started to think about it.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.160
So I went back to my
kitchen and we started

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.080
to do some experiments.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.520
I got out the iron gall, the--

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.360
not the iron gall,
the carbon black.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.490
I ruined a few utensils.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.050
And I made some patterns.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.130
And, you know, I really gobbed
it on because I thought,

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.790
you know, I'm going to
see what's going on here.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.290
And then we got a little
bit more sophisticated

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:26.020
with some test patterns
in papyrus

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.320
and some other real materials.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.260
And we started to do a
systematic study instead

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.770
of just relying on
conventional wisdom.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.130
And guess what we found.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:38.070
Of course carbon is
visible in tomography, OK?

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.370
There it is.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.690
Carbon on paper.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:43.230
On the left, you
see that the carbon

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.510
and the paper looked
very similar in density

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.160
because they're about
the same at that energy.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.480
And on the right, you see that
the paper is much brighter

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.590
than the carbon at
the other energy.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.870
And we can actually look at
this, different energies,

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:59.630
different contrasts
between the two.

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.180
Then I did an experiment
with some students,

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:07.260
where I asked them to write up
some-- make up some proxies.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.810
And this student decided--
Allie decided that she was going

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:18.200
to put carbon black on papyrus--
excuse me, on parchment.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.870
We hadn't really
done that before,

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:22.940
carbon black on parchment.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:27.340
Most of the ink we've seen
on parchment are in Gaul.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.330
So she did that.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.030
And she scanned it.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.410
And she ran our tool
to unwrap it virtually

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:36.690
and then she showed
us the result.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.400
And there was a delta in Carbon.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.840
Why can you see it?

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.130
It's supposed to be invisible
in tomography, right?

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.180
Well, we did a little
bit of work and found

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.180
that what's actually going on
is that you can see the carbon

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.130
but you have to have the
right resolution and you have

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:57.160
to tease it out from
the underlying pattern

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.450
of whatever the structure
is that the carbon is on.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.900
If it's on papyrus, you end
up with this fiber pattern

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.820
that is really hard
for your eye, you know,

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.220
to see the difference when
there's carbon on there.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.850
Papyrus has that fiber
structure but parchment doesn't.

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:19.600
And the reason that Allie was
able to see the carbon ink

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.590
on the parchment was because
the parchment was really smooth,

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:25.450
right, and then you get
that carbon on there,

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.100
you could see it straight away.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.530
So we actually started
to do some experiments

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.870
where we took carbon
ink on papyrus

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.810
and we developed a framework
for being able to tease

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:41.250
out what you can't
see with the eye.

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.550
And we used machine
learning to do it.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:43.850
And I'll be showing you one

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.820
of the first examples
and then I'll finish.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.830
On the left you see
a test pattern.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:52.140
Six, 5, 4 at the top is six
codes, five codes, four codes.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.800
Real scientific, right?

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.170
On the right, you see the
tomography to give you a sense

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.640
of what you can see with the
naked eye and what you can't.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.920
On the left column with six
coats, you can actually see,

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.340
there's enough density
that the carbon is visible.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.860
But as you get down to only four
coats, you can't see it anymore.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.520
What we hypothesized was that we
could train a machine learning

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.050
system to understand the
patterns in the carbon

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.920
that you wouldn't be able
to see with the naked eye.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.340
And here is the result from
that first experiment showing

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.620
that the machine learning system
is able to amplify the ink

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.820
in that fourth column even
though you can't pick it

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.240
out with you eye.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.130
And here is the triptych
that shows you on the left,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:38.570
the original pattern for
column 4, the training sample,

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:41.240
and then the amplification
on the right.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:45.600
So I call this reference
amplified computed tomography.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.280
And the idea is that you
use a set of examples

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.030
of what the ink looks like
in tomography to train

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.920
up a huge scale machine
learning system

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.930
that it can detect
subtleties in the tomography

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:03.180
that you cannot see
with your human eye.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:06.260
Reference amplified computed
tomography is actually now

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.170
for me a wholesale change

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.220
in the way I believe
tomography should be treated.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:15.060
In fact tomography is not
for you, it's not for me,

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.140
it's first for the
machine learning system

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.550
which amplifies what you want

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.510
and then the result
is for you and for me.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.580
Here is an example
on a real fragment.

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:30.920
The photograph on the left
shows you a lunate sigma

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.010
from Herculaneum.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.490
It's real carbon ink
from Herculaneum.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:39.210
And on the right you see a
volume render of the tomography.

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:43.120
And I don't think that you
can probably see the ink.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.190
Because we looked at that
and thought we'd failed, OK?

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:49.410
Now this is what
the data looks like.

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.740
And as the bar goes
left to right,

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.750
you see on the right what
the slices look like.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.350
It turns out you can't
really see the ink

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:57.650
in the slices either.

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:59.530
You know, you'd like to be
able to see those bright spots

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.920
like I showed you in
my early examples,

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.220
but we just don't see that.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:08.030
But what we do have are
lots and lots of fragments

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:10.630
from Herculaneum that are open

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:13.340
and they have visible
text on the front.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:18.220
That visible text we believe can
form for us a reference library.

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.790
The reference library from
machine learning so that

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.700
when we scan, what those
look like in tomography,

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.540
we can leverage that to
build a neural network,

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.610
evolutional neural network,

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.610
to be able to amplify what
the tomography actually looks

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.070
like for ink.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.530
Here's the example.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:39.390
The lunate sigma
with the green box,

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:45.260
the green box being right here,
shows the size of the test

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.710
that we give to the
machine learning system.

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:49.570
That little section we
say, take a look at that

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.080
in the tomography, that's
where we think ink is.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.600
And then we also move that
box around and say, OK,

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.490
here's a spot where
there's no ink.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.220
That's where we know
there's no ink.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.310
So, we have a training
system that says here's ink,

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:03.720
here's no ink, learn
the difference.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.890
We actually do that on
a tenfold experiment

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.570
which is the lower right.

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:09.960
Ten sections, we drop one out,

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.950
train on nine, classify
onto one.

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.260
Because we don't have a
full reference library yet,

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:18.750
this is the tenfold experiment
that simulates being able

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.970
to have a bigger
reference library.

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.680
Let me show you the result

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.390
of having done the machine
learning to classify ink.

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:34.430
Here's the original data
and here is an amplification

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.630
of the ink using the
neural network we trained,

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:41.330
pure carbon ink from
Herculaneum.

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:45.530
OK, now as we turn on the
result of the classification,

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:46.830
you see that the classifier

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:50.570
at about 80% precision
recall is able

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:54.110
to get a pretty good
estimate of that lunate sigma.

00:59:54.110 --> 01:00:01.200
OK. So here is the triptych that
shows you the reference photo,

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.530
the amplified result, and
the original tomography.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.330
With machine learning being
the instrument that we use

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:11.030
to defeat conventional
wisdom and pull

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:15.020
out very subtle signals
in tomography.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:18.010
So I have numbers here
and if you'd like to talk

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:21.980
with me afterwards
about precision recall,

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.890
the way we structured
the network,

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.950
how many test examples
there were,

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:29.670
convolutional neural networks
on 3D, we can talk about that.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.290
But what I want to do is
to show you a quick example

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:35.200
that I worked up
over a larger text

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.600
to show you what it would
look like if we could get 80%

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.400
or 90% precision recall on
carbon ink in a real text.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.690
So there is the text
in its glory

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.230
and here is what it
would look like at 50%,

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:57.670
60%, 70%, 80% and 90%.

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.500
Now if we push that back into
a volume and I've blown this

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.530
up a little bit so
that you can see

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:09.320
that the fibers really do
confuse the ability to read.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:17.470
Fifty, 60, 70, 80 and 90%
and then the reference image.

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:24.290
We believe that if the
weakened take open fragments

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:27.640
and get a neural network to
do detection at between 80%

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.670
and 90% precision recall, we'll
be able to read any kind of ink.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:36.280
Are there plenty of things
that fall under this category?

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.580
Well, yes.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.060
Let me say that the invisible
library is extensive.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.260
It includes all kinds
of surprising thing

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.820
that you may never
have heard of even

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.310
if you're not a computer
scientist.

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:50.670
For example, there's a
manuscript from Jack London

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.760
in the Huntington Library in
California that was badly burned

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.750
in the earthquake,
1906 in San Francisco.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:03.100
And now it's carbonized but it
was probably written in an ink,

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.490
in a variety of inks that
would respond really well.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.110
For example, the
Franklin papers.

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:12.180
Manuscript that was
discovered on a cadaver

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.460
from the Franklin Expedition,

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.710
search for the Northwest
Passage, all sailors lost.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:20.670
Cartonnage.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.290
Lord knows there's
cartonnage everywhere, right?

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:26.320
And inside that cartonnage there
may be original manuscripts.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.850
And of course the
enigmatic Herculaneum scrolls

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:33.890
which I hope someday
we will read.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.660
So now to my epilogue
and to conclude my talk,

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.020
I'd like to say that
collaboration is the key

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.570
and the glue to making
all of this work.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.000
I've talked about the textual

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.330
and I've talked about
the technical.

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:47.080
So now let me just say a
word about collaboration.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.970
Our most recent project
at the Morgan Library was

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:55.910
to take tomography and
apply it to this manuscript,

01:02:55.910 --> 01:03:00.860
the Morgan M910 which is an
early Egyptian Coptic Acts

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.020
of the Apostles.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.910
It's unable to be
opened or restored

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:09.430
because the damage
inside is profound.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:13.820
And let me say that in
approaching this project,

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.290
you see the manuscript
in the center.

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:18.910
I'd like to identify the people
involved to make this happen.

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:23.820
We have conservators
led by Maria Fredericks.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.760
We have a manuscript
scholar Paul Dilley

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.810
at the University of Iowa.

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:33.230
We have engineers
from Microphotonics

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:37.480
who graciously donated
to my team the scan time

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.440
that we needed to
do the project.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.520
We have a research specialist
Christy Chapman who's

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.270
in the audience today.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:48.450
We have a computer scientist too
as my staff member, Seth Parker.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.530
And we have of course
the media who share

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:54.490
with us the ability
to tell stories.

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:57.660
And let me tell you that
telling stories is a big part

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.960
of what it's about.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.080
It was the beginning of my
motivation because the narrative

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.360
of the story is the thing
they were actually all

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.250
after in the end, isn't it?

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.670
So if I put that on a diagram
for you and in leave it

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:13.320
in French so that we all
understand how collaborative we

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.780
have to be.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.920
Yes, I still try
to learn French.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.060
I would like to conclude my talk
by thanking you for listening

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.180
and asking if you would like
to ask me any questions.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.980
Thank you very much.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:35.070
[ Applause ]

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:37.530
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So we're
going to take some questions.

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.770
I'm going to ask
Brent and that he

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.670
or I will repeat your questions

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.870
so that the external viewers
can actually hear the question.

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:51.710
So we will rephrase it to
how he would like to answer.

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.270
&gt;&gt; Even though we're in
Washington, I'd be happy

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:55.120
to rephrase the question
into one

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.470
that I can answer so, questions.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:13.720
&gt;&gt; So, just to clarify a
point that I'm not sure

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.380
if I completely understood.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.990
The machine learning--

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:24.650
the computer is learning to
identify ink from non-ink or--

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:25.950
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: Yup.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:27.280
&gt;&gt; -- or character
from the non--

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.580
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales:

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.550
So the question is what exactly
is the machine learning doing

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:31.850
in this case.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:35.980
And my answer is your
instinct which is, yes,

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.890
the machine learning is helping
us classify ink from no ink.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:41.190
Now other applications

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.880
of machine learning help you
recognize higher level things.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.340
There is work being done to
recognize the letter forms,

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.220
do OCR, that kind of thing.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.520
What we're interested

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.600
in tomography is purely
amplifying a very weak signal.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.000
And so we're doing
machine learning

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.330
at the level of ink, no ink.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.630
Yes.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:03.800
&gt;&gt; Have you and the machine
[inaudible] machine learning

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.220
exercise, have you just tried
filtering the background given

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:13.200
that the paper or the substrate
has particular frequencies

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:18.430
to as-- presume what the
machines is learning is doing,

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.620
is filtering out certain kinds
of features, characteristic

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.310
of the background but you
could directly filter--

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.610
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:26.910
&gt;&gt; Have you tried to--

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:29.340
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: So let
me rephrase the question.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:32.430
The question is why don't you
just use conventional techniques

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.070
and filter out the background

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.810
which would then give you
the foreground signal.

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:38.330
And what we're doing is
using machine learning

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.950
as the mechanism for
doing exactly that.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:43.630
And the reason why we need
so sophisticated a tool is

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:46.490
because the variation
in the fiber structure

01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:49.690
of the papyrus masks
the weak signal

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.180
of the carbon fairly profoundly.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.560
And we haven't found a
direct way to be able

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.900
to capture that signal.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.950
But through millions of examples

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:00.560
in a supervised learning
setting, we have been able

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.260
to capture that signal.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.960
And this is something
that other approaches

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.040
in machine learning
have discovered.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.080
Ultimately, we may
discover a pathway

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.660
for doing what you're
suggesting right now.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.330
The machine learning
framework is our way

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.630
to be able to capture that.

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:16.930
Yes.

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.100
&gt;&gt; Is it worth considering
to further

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.430
or not the many other
layers of En-Gedi?

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:26.190
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales:
The question is so what

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:29.490
about En-Gedi is there
are continued work going

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.230
on for the other
layers of the scroll.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:35.330
We worked on or other
artifacts from En-Gedi.

01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:38.810
The scroll we worked on
was completely unwrapped.

01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:42.130
So five wraps, that
was all we had and all

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:43.910
of the visible text is there.

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:46.560
And that data is
publicly available.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.680
So anyone else who
would love to jump in

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.740
and refine our results
is welcome to do it.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.860
They can download
all of the data.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.470
There is other information.

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.550
There are other artifacts
from En-Gedi.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:01.390
And to my knowledge, no one
yet has approached the rest

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:04.990
of the set of artifacts
from En-Gedi

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.590
and I'm actually
dying to do that.

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.420
One of the barriers,
you might ask,

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:16.280
if I might pose a question
for you is funding.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.870
Because these things are very
old and they're going to be fine

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:22.530
if we don't do anything
so you need funding

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:23.910
to be able to do something.

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:25.450
So when funding appears,

01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:27.970
then this work I
believe can continue.

01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:39.950
Any other questions?

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:44.760
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if
you could comment on some

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.440
of the challenges with the
Herculaneum scroll and the kind

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.690
of advances in modern technology
that you think are going

01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:55.250
to help you eventually
unwrap that.

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.060
It's seems like resolution
I think may be one

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.360
of those issues.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.660
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: Yes.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.440
So the question is can I comment
on the Herculaneum question

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.020
and what may have changed
or what's necessary in order

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.730
to advance that and your
intuition is exactly right.

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:12.670
Resolution is crucial
and we've discovered

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.450
that there is a sweet
spot in the resolution

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:19.330
that we think we need to be
able to capture everything.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.610
And too high a resolution
is not good

01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:23.650
and to low a resolution
is not good.

01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:26.490
We are now capable of being able

01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:28.970
to capture the correct
resolution.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.630
But another thing about
Herculaneum is access.

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:36.990
Because despite the fact
that I negotiated access more

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:40.710
than a decade ago to the
collection in France,

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.760
it's still extremely difficult
at the four institutions

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.210
that hold this material to work

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:48.430
on this material
collaboratively.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:52.640
For obvious reasons, it's
incredibly sensitive material,

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.150
difficult to handle,
there's always risk, right?

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.200
So-- And funding
is always an issue

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.180
and people are committed
to other projects.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:05.710
So, all those things play a
role advancing the agenda.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.010
Yes?

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.550
&gt;&gt; Can you-- Do you
have any confidence

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:14.090
that the technology can
differentiate a carbon-based ink

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:18.620
from an ink that contains metal
such as copper, iron, or lead,

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.620
or others that may be
is sort of possible?

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.920
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: So
do I have any confidence

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.100
that we can differentiate among
different kinds of inks in,

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.400
for example, tomography?

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.540
And my answer is, I believe that
reference amplified tomography,

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.540
using a classifier like
machine learning will allow us

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:41.290
to create libraries for
everything that we'd like to see

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.420
and then we will be able
to classify the difference

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.480
between those inks, yes.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.780
And I believe that
there are going

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.730
to be other tomography-based
applications

01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:50.890
for doing exactly
this kind of thing.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:53.930
You're going to see an explosion
of it in the next five years.

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:55.550
Yes, you had a question.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.490
&gt;&gt; You were talking
about collaborations

01:10:57.490 --> 01:11:00.400
and I remember reading that
there was a, I don't know,

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.880
if it's similar but
an unwrapping

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.860
of Herculaneum scrolls
project at the Vatican.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.770
Were you involved with that too?

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:12.130
I remember there was an
Italian scientist and actually,

01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:14.020
I'm not sure if it was
Herculaneum scrolls

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:19.900
but it was a carbonized scroll
that they were trying to unwrap.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.200
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: Yes.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.850
So the question is what about
other work, perhaps the Vatican

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.530
or an Italian team
working on Herculaneum.

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:32.170
So my answer is that, yes, I'm
actually gratified by the fact

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:34.190
that after the two decades

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:39.160
of work I've been building this
miracle or magic trick, right,

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.260
others are beginning to
work in the same area.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.900
And there are advances
being made by other teams,

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.150
one at Cardiff and
some Italian groups

01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:50.020
who have access to the material.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.850
So what I'm hoping is that
as we all advance the field

01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:56.360
of reading the invisible
library, right,

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.690
what we will do together
is share good information

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.060
and build a standard for
how we report things.

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.670
I didn't talk about this in
my talk, but let me just say,

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:08.670
when I report to you
something inside an artifact

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:14.430
that you cannot see and you will
never open, who do you trust?

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:19.510
How do you know that the En-Gedi
text is actually Leviticus?

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.900
I mean I scanned it, right?

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.550
I say that I-- my team
developed it from software.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.630
It's actually really, really
important for the community

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:31.690
and peer review to develop
a standard for the review

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:35.820
of these claims so that we
can be open about what is

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.350
and is not a letter form,
what is and is not a text.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:41.190
OK. Very, very important.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.080
And if you go and read
my paper in science

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.840
on the En-Gedi Scroll, you
will see at the end of my paper

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.580
that I devote an entire section

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:55.300
and then I released all the
information from our work

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.790
for third-party review, to try
to lead by example and say,

01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:01.920
you know, it's important, so.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.020
&gt;&gt; I have one offside
question [inaudible], which is,

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.640
how is the technology evolving?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.940
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales:
Offside question,

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.140
how is the technology evolving?

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.870
Thank you for that question
and for staying with us.

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:23.360
Yes. So there are three
different ways I see evolution

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.040
happening at the scanning level.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.770
We see things that
used to be done only

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.690
in high energy physics
facilities,

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:33.840
like phase contrast
tomography now available

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.720
in desktop lab units, making
them available to hospitals

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.730
as well as libraries
and museums.

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:42.360
So the evolution of scanning
technology continues.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.080
Terahertz imaging is also
another nascent technology

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.410
that's moving forward.

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:50.690
Second thing is that we see
machine learning as a tool.

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:53.720
And even though we might
not know how to tease

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.810
out a classifier in
a conventional way,

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:58.620
we can use machine learning
and millions of examples

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.580
and still make progress without
fully understanding necessarily

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.440
exactly what's going on.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.400
And the third piece of
progress is that collaborations

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.110
with museums and libraries
are becoming more open

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:14.280
to allowing scientists
to explore the corners

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.110
of their collection because
they realized there's value

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.830
in the invisible library.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:22.620
And so I see those as advances.

01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:28.010
&gt;&gt; What is just sort of a
ballpark figure of the cost

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.430
of imaging a codex this way?

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.730
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales:
So the class--

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:34.460
The question is what's
the ballpark figure

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.900
of imaging a codex?

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:41.360
And that depends on how
you arrange the logistics

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.430
of doing that.

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:46.200
If you're willing to take
your codex to a facility

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.280
where they are setup, the
cost is the scan time,

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.740
which can be under $1000.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.760
Now, if you need to transport
equipment, set it up on site,

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.000
hire staff to do
the collaboration

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.360
and then the scanning
on site, 10 times that.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.710
Now if you want to consider the
cost for the post processing,

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.080
I'm not sure what I would
charge you right now

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.360
to use my software
but-- I'm just joking.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.940
We're going to develop
our software to be

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.960
in the open source domain so
that anyone will be able to use

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.940
that software and so we
want that to be free.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.820
So we can inspire the invisible
library going to scale.

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.890
That's what we would
like to see happen.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:30.900
So we believe that right
now the cost is too high

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.690
but it will be driven
down by the fact

01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:36.010
that these scanners will
become more available

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.080
and we will have software that's
available to do this work.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.640
Last question?

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.510
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
Last question.

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:57.570
[ Inaudible ]

01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:58.870
&gt;&gt; W. Brent Seales: Yeah.

01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:02.120
In fact, we're-- so the question
is taking differentiation

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.720
of inks a step further
and looking

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.970
at layers, mixtures, chemistry.

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:12.270
So two things tangled there,
one is x-ray fluorescence, XRF,

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:16.450
gives a complete
characterization

01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.800
of the elemental composition.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.550
And people-- And instrumentation
is moving toward being able

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:28.140
to do more of that in 3D
almost tomographically.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.150
Using reference amplification,
we believe we can get

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:35.460
at a better discrimination
of things but probably not

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.400
to the degree that you can
use something like XRF.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.540
But we have characterized ink
as sort of thin film analysis.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.460
That was actually
our inspiration.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.320
I come from Lexington, Kentucky
with long heritage with Lexmark,

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.720
a printer division that
originally started with IBM,

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.280
and that printer
division does nothing

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.190
but characterize how
ink goes on to paper.

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.940
And so you can see some of
that inspiration as well

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.950
in our thinking about
ink on papyrus

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:07.350
as thin films being deposited
and understanding it that way.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:09.090
Thank you very much
for that question.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.510
And thank you very much
for your kind attention.
