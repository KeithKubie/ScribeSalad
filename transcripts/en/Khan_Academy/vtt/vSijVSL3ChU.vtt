00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:01.873
- [Voiceover] What I hope
to do in this video is,

00:00:01.873 --> 00:00:03.743
start with a exponential expression

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:05.916
that's in a fairly straightforward form

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.944
and then turn it into
one in a hairier form.

00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:10.370
And let's actually just do it.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.994
I'll show the initial expression

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:14.597
and then the form that I want
it in, or that we want it in.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:15.797
And then we can talk a little bit about,

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:18.085
why would ever actually wanna do that?

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:22.311
So let's say my expression is 1/32

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:25.136
times two to the t power.

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:28.266
So this is fairly straightforward
exponential expression.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.094
But let's say we want it,

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:32.613
we want it in the form

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:35.274
A time B,

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:36.697
and this is where it's gonna get hairy,

00:00:36.697 --> 00:00:40.577
A time B to the t over 10 power,

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.506
minus one.

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.112
And so, you're probably
immediately saying,

00:00:44.112 --> 00:00:45.555
"Why would I ever wanna take something

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.301
"nice and simple like this

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.244
"and turn it into this beastly
thing right over here?"

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.457
And the answer is, when
you get into higher math

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:54.550
and you start doing your
physics and your chemistry,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.013
you're going to see, maybe, you know,

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:57.296
you got a result like this,

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:58.391
but then you look in your textbook,

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.727
or your professor, it
has a result like this.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.064
Just wanna know, "How do I
transfer from this to this?"

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:05.521
Or actually, sometimes when you transfer

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:06.557
to a form like this ...

00:01:06.557 --> 00:01:09.178
Obviously, I've just arbitrarily
written this form here.

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:10.764
But sometimes when you write it

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:13.060
in another form that might
even be a little hairier,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.595
it can give you an intuition
on the underlying processes

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.987
that that expression
is trying to describe.

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:22.141
So if you can take that
on a leap of faith,

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.197
let's actually try to do it.

00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:24.843
And, at a minimum, it's
gonna make you a lot better

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:26.774
at exponent properties.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:29.949
So see if you can rewrite
this in this form.

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.290
So I'm assuming you took a go at it.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.793
So let's try to do it together.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.069
So the first thing,

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.849
the first thing that I might wanna do is,

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:42.698
well, let's see if we can ...

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:44.648
Let's see. What would I wanna do?

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:46.578
The first thing I wanna do is,

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:51.064
take this t and get it into a t ...

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.987
let's get it into a t over 10.

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:55.551
So, to do that,

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.705
we essentially just need to multiply by 10

00:01:57.705 --> 00:01:59.168
and divide by 10.

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:02.175
So let's multiply by 10,

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.552
and then also divide by 10.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:07.254
Then we haven't changed the value up here.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.428
So we can rewrite this,

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.414
we can rewrite this as

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.022
1/32

00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:19.110
times two

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.402
to the ...

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:23.512
So let me circle t ...

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:25.258
Do this in a different color.

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:30.235
T over 10,

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.553
t over 10

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:34.503
times 10.

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:38.405
Times 10.

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:39.643
All right. So we got a

00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:42.732
t over 10 over here.

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.397
But then I have this times 10.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.856
So how do I deal with this?

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:48.238
Well, one thing that I can do ...

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:50.269
Let me actually just write
this the other way around.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.793
Let me write it as,

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.621
let me write it as

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:57.117
10 times t over 10.

00:02:57.117 --> 00:02:59.249
10 times

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.404
t over 10.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:02.967
So hopefully what I just did here

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.207
isn't a huge stretch here.

00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:06.990
I just literally multiplied and divide by,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.021
divided by 10, times this t over 10.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.688
But when I write it this way,

00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:13.024
an exponent property
might jump out at you.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.665
If I have, if I have

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:17.271
a to the b,

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:19.163
and then I raise that to the c,

00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:20.301
that's going to be a

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.211
to the bc.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.116
Or, another way around,

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:25.169
a to the bc is going to be a to the b

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.281
to the c.

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.817
And so, this piece right over here,

00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.585
I can rewrite it as

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.311
two to the 10th,

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:35.988
and then raise that

00:03:35.988 --> 00:03:38.832
to the t over 10 power.

00:03:38.832 --> 00:03:42.001
To the t over 10 power.

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:42.997
Once again, two to the 10th

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:44.745
and then raise that to the t over 10,

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:45.943
that's gonna be the same thing

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:49.457
as two to the 10 times t over 10.

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:52.728
And of course, we still have
the one over 32 over here.

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:55.208
One over,

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:56.955
one over 32.

00:03:56.955 --> 00:03:58.012
I'm tempted to write that

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.309
as two to the negative fifth power,

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.543
but I won't do that just yet.

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.063
So let's see. What's
two to the 10th power?

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:06.810
Actually, let's just, let's just keep it,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.820
let's just keep it as
two to the 10th power,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.202
just for simplicity right now.

00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:11.154
Later we can,

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:13.553
you might know that that's gonna be 1,024.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.682
But let's just, let's
see what else we can do.

00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:17.764
So we know this is going
to be some num- ...

00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:19.876
Actually, let me just write out as 1,024.

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:22.070
So we have one over 32

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.256
times 1,024

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:28.571
to the t over 10,

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.585
to the t over 10 power.

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:31.883
So it seems like we're getting close.

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:34.495
If there was no minus one here,

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:35.958
we're essentially done.

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.258
But now there's this minus one.

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:38.977
So how do we deal with that?

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.273
Well, we can do a
similar type of strategy.

00:04:41.273 --> 00:04:42.999
We can subtract one,

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.930
and then we could add,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.250
and then we could add one.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.895
Then we're not actually
changing the value.

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:50.090
Just as we multiplied
by 10 and divide by 10,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.797
we're not changing the value up here.

00:04:51.797 --> 00:04:53.829
If you subtract one and
add one to the exponent,

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:55.859
you're not changing its value.

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:57.546
And so, what is this going to be?

00:04:57.546 --> 00:04:59.699
We wanna leave this minus one here.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.427
But we wanna get rid of,

00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:04.189
we wanna get rid of this plus one somehow.

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.404
And here, we just have to remind ourselves

00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:09.656
that, if we have a to the b

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:13.131
times a to the c,

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:14.430
that's going to be equal to

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.827
a to the b plus c.

00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:19.298
If you have the same base, multiplied,

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:21.235
same base raised to different exponents

00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.109
and you multiply them,

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:23.857
you could just add the exponents.

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.502
And so you could also
go the other way around.

00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:27.472
If you have a to the b plus c,

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:29.138
you could break it up into a to the b

00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:31.048
times a to the c.

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:34.096
So, this business right over here,

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.005
this business right over here,

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.603
this is 1,024 to the

00:05:38.603 --> 00:05:40.407
t over 10 minus one,

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.298
plus one.

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.431
So we can break this up as,

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:46.544
we can break this up as,

00:05:46.544 --> 00:05:48.169
1,024,

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.390
1,024 to the t

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.748
over 10 minus one,

00:05:53.748 --> 00:05:55.210
that's this part here,

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.013
and then times 1,024 to the one.

00:05:58.013 --> 00:05:59.090
Times ...

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.654
Let me make this in a different color.

00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:02.930
So, let's see green.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.048
So this right over here.

00:06:04.048 --> 00:06:07.847
So times 1,024

00:06:07.847 --> 00:06:09.309
to the one power.

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.463
That's this one power right over here.

00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:13.068
And of course, we still have

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.816
the one over,

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:17.091
the one over 32.

00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.533
All right. So now we're really close.

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:21.007
We have the 1,024 to
the t over 10 minus one,

00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:22.676
we have t over 10 minus 1.

00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:24.340
And now we just have to simplify.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.132
We can rewrite.

00:06:25.132 --> 00:06:26.718
This is going to be equal to,

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:28.098
this is going to be equal to,

00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:29.845
we can just bring the 1,024,

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:32.102
1,024 to the first
power, that's just 1,024.

00:06:32.102 --> 00:06:35.593
So that's going to be 1,024

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.038
over ...

00:06:37.038 --> 00:06:39.009
I can put all these commas here if I like.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.317
1,024 over this 32.

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:45.038
Let me do that magenta color.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:47.334
Over this 32

00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:48.776
times ...

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:49.955
home stretch.

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:51.438
Times,

00:06:51.438 --> 00:06:54.790
times 1,024

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.946
to the t over,

00:06:56.946 --> 00:06:59.464
to the t over 10

00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:01.048
minus one power.

00:07:01.048 --> 00:07:02.999
And now we could just simplify this.

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:05.010
You might recognize 1,024,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.321
we already saw, that was the same thing

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:08.070
as two to the 10th power.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.396
32 is the same thing as
two to the fifth power.

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:14.967
So two to the 10th divided
by two to the fifth ...

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.467
Actually, this is another
exponent property at play here,

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:19.214
although you could just
divide the numbers.

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:22.139
If you have a to the b

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.440
over a to the c,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.579
this is going to be equal to

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:27.240
a to the b minus c.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.234
So this is going to be

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.206
two to the 10 minus five,

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:32.268
over this whole thing.

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:34.525
This whole thing right over here.

00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:35.805
And this thing ...

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:37.572
See, I wanted to do that
in a different color ...

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:39.645
This thing is just

00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:42.245
going to be two to the fifth power,

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:43.483
or 32.

00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:45.231
So this is going to be 32

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.618
times 1,024.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:51.016
We were in the home stretch here.

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:53.819
1,024

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.765
to the t over 10 minus one.

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:57.740
So once again,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.002
normally in our lives,

00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:00.544
we like to make things simpler,

00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:01.986
and I'm a big advocate of that.

00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:03.390
It's a good life philosophy.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.974
But this is a case where we really did

00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:06.112
make it more complicated.

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:07.939
We started with 1/32

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:09.850
times two to the t ...

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.624
Actually, we could have ...

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:12.166
Well, there's other ways we
could have written that ...

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:13.404
And we turned it into this thing

00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:15.498
with this somewhat hairier exponent.

00:08:15.498 --> 00:08:17.347
But it's a useful skill to have

00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:19.276
because you might get a result like

00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:20.477
what we originally started with,

00:08:20.477 --> 00:08:22.792
and then someone else might
get a result like this,

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:23.725
and it's very important to realize,

00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:25.669
"Hey, you actually go the same result.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.132
"They're just different ways of expressing

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.208
"the same exponential expression."
