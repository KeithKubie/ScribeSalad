00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.739
I’ve seen a lot of women with earphones
to their bellies playing Mozart to make their

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:04.739
baby smarter.

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:08.990
But, it got me wondering, can a fetus in the
womb even hear anything?

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.500
Hi guys, Lissette here for Dnews.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.289
In utero, a fetus' auditory system starts
forming at around the 18th week of pregnancy

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.250
and becomes functional at around the 25th
week.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.750
At this point, the fetus is thought to be
able to perceive sound.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.800
In fact, the period from 25 weeks of gestation
to 6 months of age is critical to auditory

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.890
development.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.010
This is when the neurosensory system is trained
to perceive and differentiate sounds.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.950
In other words, unlike your eyes, your ear
requires exposure to sound in order to fully

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.989
develop, so early exposure to sounds can be
beneficial.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.690
But this doesn’t mean fetuses can hear in
the same way we do.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.510
Because they are in their mother’s body
- sounds coming from the outside are somewhat

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.510
muffled.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.960
High frequency sounds have trouble passing
through the mother’s abdominal walls, tissue

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960
and fluids.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.090
So, fetuses are more able to perceive lower
tones, and of course those that are louder.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.969
Yet, despite this filter, many studies have
found that, that just days after they’re

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.450
born, babies can distinguish their mother’s
voice from other female voices, and even prefer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.159
their mother’s native tongue.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.640
But some Moms choose to add classical music
to this equation.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.189
This trend is known as the “Mozart effect”
and has sparked a lucrative industry with

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.110
thousands of CDs being sold to parents with
the promise of making their babies smarter.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
But, there is actually little evidence to
support this claim.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.510
In fact, even the researcher behind the paper
that spurred the commercial madness has come

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.570
out and said that her findings were "grossly
misapplied and over-exaggerated."

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.729
However, there is some evidence that music
is better than random noise.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.950
In fact, a 2013 study conducted by researchers
at the University of Helsinki found that babies

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.040
- who were played Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
(and other tunes) in utero - were able to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.880
recognize the melody when they were tested
at 4 months old.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.530
The researchers monitored the babies' brain
activation with an EEG while they played different

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.549
sounds, and those who'd been played the melody
in utero had higher levels of brain activation.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.830
The researchers argue that “extensive prenatal
exposure to a melody induces neural representations

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.380
that last for several months”.The jury is
still out on whether this constitutes true

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
learning, but it’s clear that music influences
neural patterns.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.000
What’s more, another study suggests that
prenatal exposure to music can impact neonatal

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
behavior.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.660
In a clinical study of more than 250 infants,
researchers found that infants whose pregnant

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.860
mothers were exposed to music, scored higher
on 5 of the 7 areas of the Brazelton Neonatal

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.820
Behavioral Assessment Scale.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.440
These babies performed significantly better
when tasked with following an object with

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.390
their eyes, responding to animate vs inanimate
objects and how quickly they recognized that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.610
an object was familiar.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.290
Those are a pretty big deal to babies.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.110
So there is definitely some evidence to support
that early exposure to music helps with fetal

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.440
development, but more research is needed;
and no studies have conclusively found that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:31.920
when babies are in the womb, Mozart is any
better than Bieber.
