00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.040
To wrap up this lesson, I really want
you to think about what you've learned

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.970
and what you might do next.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.530
Metrics from user behavior and
feedback from users are critical

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.270
if you want to improve the product and
forge ahead.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.050
As you reflect on data, you may want
to plan additional design sprints.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.390
We actually did this at Udacity
to rethink student support.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.850
A design sprint can be a great way
to make changes to the product.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.580
You might also discover that
you've chosen a poor metric, or

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.390
that you're not retaining users.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.260
If so, then you might want to
rethink your key metrics or

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.159
alter the original idea.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.080
Ultimately, it's up to you to iterate on
a product, or reimagine a product, so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.440
that way,
you build something users love.
