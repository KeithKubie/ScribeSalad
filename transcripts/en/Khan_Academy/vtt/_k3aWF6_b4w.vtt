00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.880
Welcome to Level 4
multiplication.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.415
Let's do some problems.

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:11.580
Let's see, we had 235 times--
I'm going to use two different

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.330
colors here, so bear
with me a second.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.295
Let's say times 47.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.210
So you start a Level 4 problem
just like you would normally

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.960
do a Level 3 problem.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.070
We'll take that 7, and
we'll multiply it by 235.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.350
So 7 times 5 is 35.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.640
7 times 3 is 21, plus the
3 we just carried is 24.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.790
7 times 2 is 14, plus
the 2 we just carried.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.050
This is 16.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.570
So we're done with the 7.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.400
Now we have to
deal with this 4.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.250
Well, since that 4 is in the
tens place, we add a 0 here.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.710
You could almost view it as
we're multiplying 235, not by

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.300
4, but we're multiplying it
by 40, and that's why

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.500
we put that 0 there.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.320
But once you put the 0 there,
you can treat it just like a 4.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.990
So you say 4 times
5, well, that's 20.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.850
Let's ignore what we
had from before.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.190
4 times 3 is 12, plus the 2 we
just carried, which is 14.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.820
4 times 2 is 8, plus the 1 we
just carried, so that's 9.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.010
And now we just add
up everything.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:40.580
5 plus 0 is 5, 4 plus 0 is 4, 6
plus 4 is 10, carry the 1, and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.680
1 plus 9, well, that's 11.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.230
So the answer's 11,045.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.160
Let's do another problem.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:57.830
Let's say I had 873 times-- and
I'm making these numbers up on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.800
the fly, so bear with me-- 873
times-- some high numbers--

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.230
90-- and I'm doing them in
different colors, just so you

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.970
hopefully get a better
understanding of what

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.130
I'm trying to explain.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.595
Let's say 97.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:15.960
No, I just used a 7.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.705
Let's make it 98.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.660
So just like we did before, we
go to the ones place first, and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.660
that's where that 8 is, and
we multiply that 8 times 873.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.080
So 8 times 3 is
24, carry the 2.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.100
8 times 7 is 56, plus
2 is 58, carry the 5.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.420
8 times 8 is 64, plus
the 5 we just carried.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.480
That's 69.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.580
We're done with the 8.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220
Now we have to multiply the
9, or we could just do it as

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.840
we're multiplying 873 by 90.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.170
But multiplying something by 90
is just the same thing as

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.320
multiplying something by 9 and
then adding a 0 at the end, so

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.505
that's why I put a 0 here.

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:04.740
Let's say 9 times 3-- well,
first, just to clean up

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.720
things, let's get rid of
what we had from before.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.950
We say 9 times 3 is
27, carry the 2.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.600
9 times 7 is 63, plus the 2
that we just carried is 65.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.350
Carry the 6.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.490
8 times 8 is 72, plus
the 6 we just carried.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.040
That's 78.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.720
And now we just add again.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.680
4, 8 plus 7 is 15, 1 plus 9
plus 5 is 15, 1 plus 6 plus

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.170
8 is also 15, and 1
plus 7, that's 8.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.470
So the answer, hopefully-- I
don't have a calculator in

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.760
front of me-- is 85,554,
assuming I didn't make

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.890
any careless mistakes.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.910
Let's do one more problem.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.670
I think it'll hit
the point home.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.530
The next problem I'm going to
do, you can almost do it as a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.630
Level 5 problem because I'm
actually going to multiply two

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.180
three-digit numbers, but it's
really the same thing, and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.770
hopefully, you'll
see the pattern.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:11.740
So let's say I had 234 times--
and I'm going to use three

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:23.150
colors now-- let's say 643.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.030
So first we do the 3, which
is in the ones place, and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.950
we multiply that times 234.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.310
Well, 3 times 4 is
12, carry the 1.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.570
3 times 3 is 9, add the 1.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.620
That's 10, carry the 1.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.880
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.730
Well, that's 7.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.970
And then we've done the--
I think I've made a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.960
mistake someplace.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.440
Let me see.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.880
3 times 4 is 12.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.020
Oh, no, I think that's correct.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.440
I was confusing myself.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.020
OK, now we're ready to do the
4, or the 40, and since it's a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.010
40 because it's in the tens
place, we put a 0 right here.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.000
We say 4 times 4-- well, let's
clean up this stuff at the top.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.310
I always forget to do that.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.110
4 times 4, well, that's
16, carry the 1.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.130
4 times 3, well, that's 12,
plus 1, well, that's 13.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.680
4 times 2 is 8, plus
the 1, well, that's 9.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.940
And now we're done with the
4, or the 40, depending on

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.520
how you want to view it.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.810
Now we're ready for
the 6, or the 600.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.120
Since it's a 600, we put
two zeroes here, and we

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.170
just treat it like a 6.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.110
Let's clean up what
we did before.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.220
So 6 times 4 is
24, carry the 2.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.500
6 times 3 is 18, plus
2 is 20, carry the 2.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.710
6 times 2 is 12, plus 2 is 14.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.470
And now we add it all up.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.680
2, 6, 7 plus 3 is 10.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.140
14, carry the 1.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.000
1 plus 9 is 10, carry the 1.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.780
That's 5.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.090
That's 1.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.680
I hope you can see.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.870
I hope it's not falling off
the screen, the answer

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.700
I get is a 150,462.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.660
I think you're ready
now to try Level 4

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.640
multiplication problems.
