DAVID: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.170
Thanks for coming.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.710
I first heard about the
Shalva band back in November

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.330
when they came to my
community for a concert,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.280
and I was amazed by
their musical talent,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.760
I was inspired by
their personal stories.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.390
I went to the show expecting
to see an amateur performance

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480
and instead I was very moved
to hear a talented band

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.280
with a very professional
presentation.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.530
And that was an experience
that really changed the way

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.450
that I thought
about and understand

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.244
inclusion and accessibility.

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:34.660
That's really all
the introduction

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.410
that this band needs.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.430
Its certainly all
the introduction

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.630
that I'm going to give.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.740
I'm going to ask
that everyone please

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.720
shut off your cell phones,
put them on silent,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.130
close your laptops.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.500
I want to introduce
Kalman Samuels who's

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.750
the founder of Shalvo, who's
going to give us a minute

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.890
or two of background
on the organization.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.380
And then we'll
hear from the band.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.192

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.780
KALMAN SAMUELS: Good afternoon.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.830
It is a total privilege
to be here at Google,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.980
and I want to think
David and everybody

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.960
who has made this possible.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.350
Just to give you Shalva
101 for two minutes.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.470
I'm a Canadian from
Vancouver, Canada.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.220
Went to Israel when I was
18 on my way to France.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
Stayed, became religious,
and my beautiful wife, Malki,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.480
and our second child, Yossi,
at the age of 11 months

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.750
had a medical issue that
developed and-- well not--

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.400
let's say that again.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
There was a medical
procedure that went bad,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.100
and he became blind and deaf.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.740
And people asked my wife to
think about putting him out

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.220
of the house because he
was very, very challenging.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.784
And my wife would
cry at night and say,

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:48.700
God I am never putting
Yossi out of the house.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.180
But if you ever decide
to help our Yossi,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.820
I'm going to dedicate my
life to helping other mothers

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.160
with their challenges.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.150
At the age of eight,
unexpected, Yossi

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.680
had a breakthrough to
communication via a teacher

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.669
in the deaf school who was
deaf herself, and spelling

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.949
the word of palm of his
hand over and over again,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.080
the five Hebrew letters
for the word table

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.640
or [SPEAKING HEBREW].

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.180
Yossi suddenly lit up, and
she, in her words, said,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
he just had his
Helen Keller moment.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.774
So she turned to me.

00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:23.940
She said, it's payback time.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.850
I know exactly
what I want to do.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.600
I know how you want
to help other mothers.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.880
It took me three
years to find anyone

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880
who would buy into her dream.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.060
We opened with five children
with cognitive disabilities.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390
Malki did everything
except for a professional

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.350
and a few volunteers.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.970
And it grew in ways that we
could never have foreseen.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.520
Today, we serve over 2000
people a week from birth,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.180
including mothers
who just gave birth

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.250
to babies they
weren't expecting,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.650
and all the way through
to independent living

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.210
in the community and seniors.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.110
The band is yet
another dream that we

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.130
began 11 years ago
and no one could have

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.220
expected where they have come.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.180
These are young adults.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.480
These people have the
respect of now making

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.970
a living through their music.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.660
And for them to be
playing here at Google

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.490
is, in my mind, the ultimate
statement about inclusion,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.700
about integration,
and that, I believe,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.100
is the measure of any program--

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.040
whether or not we can
get them into a situation

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.310
where they can fulfill their
dreams in such a manner.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.364
So without any further ado,
I'd like to introduce the band.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.350
And now I have a new job.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.105
I wrap teabags at our workshop.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.160
David, the guy who works
with him, brings the tea.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.040
We prepare it.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.550
We put it in tea bags, and
then we wrap it in box,

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.350
and we sell them in
the Shalva gift shop.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.679
As you see, I work
with the band as well.

00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:25.639
I've performed all
over the world--

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.732
London, Mexico, and now I'm
here in New York at Google,

00:34:28.732 --> 00:34:29.940
and it's a lot of fun for me.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.622
So thank you very much.

00:34:31.622 --> 00:34:34.037
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:39.362 --> 00:34:41.070
DAVID: Shai, can you
tell us a little bit

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.500
about where and how the
band has been a bridge

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.060
across different cultures?

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.820
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.770
SHAI BEN SHUSHAN: First
of all, hello, everybody.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.440
Thank you, David, that
you bring us to here.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.280
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.110
INTERPRETER: Special
thing about this band

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.401
is that it shows the world
that everything is possible.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.200
To see them at first,
when people didn't really

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.850
pay attention to
them, and now they're

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.355
performing everywhere, every
day, in front of all people.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.410
It's one of the things
that excites me most,

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.100
to see that people don't
look at their disabilities,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.990
but at their talent,
their abilities,

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.440
and their professionalism.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.023
SHAI BEN SHUSHAN:
Thank you very much.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.530
DAVID: There is no center
like Shalva in the world.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.750
It's the largest
center of its kind.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.820
And, Dina, I'd like to
hear a little bit more

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.820
about what you
love about Shalva.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.480
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.120
INTERPRETER: The truth is that
I love many things at Shalva.

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.015
Shalva first of all is a family.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.250
When you hear Shalva you
think it's an organization,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.070
but when you walk in you
feel it's something else.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.425
I came 5 and 1/2
years ago to Shalva.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.004
to volunteer with
kids with disabilities

00:36:53.004 --> 00:36:54.170
and help them through music.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.590
And through Shalva, I
am fulfilling my dream.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.450
It built my confidence.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.490
Being with my friends and
with the band director,

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:24.440
Shai, that love me and
support me and strengthen me,

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.634
give me strength.

00:37:26.634 --> 00:37:27.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.986
DAVID: I don't want to take
much time away from the music.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.370
Googlers, if you are
interested in more stories,

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.950
you certainly can stay after
the show for a few minutes

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.901
while the band
will still be here.

00:37:38.901 --> 00:37:41.150
I hope that you're finding
this as a great opportunity

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.820
to experience inclusion
and accessibility

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.640
in a positive and inspiring
way, to think differently

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.790
about challenges, achievement,
bravery and acceptance,

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.420
and to appreciate the greatness
that can become possible

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.730
through motivation
and hard work.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.330
This is a world where people
are people first and foremost.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.770
We are united by our humanity
rather than separated

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.260
by our differences, and
The Shalva Band very much

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.065
encompasses that
aspect of our culture.

00:38:06.065 --> 00:38:07.440
If you have
additional questions,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.030
feel free to linger afterwards.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.613
Otherwise, we'll go
back to the music.
