1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
[inaudible] trans part of this all fit
in because I remember years ago when

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,100
people would say, when I, when everyone
started saying the LGBT community,

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:14,900
I remember thinking,

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,490
I have no more insight
into the t part of this,

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,350
then a straight CIS gendered heterosexual
male. Would, you know what I mean?

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,060
I just,
I don't,

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,100
I maybe I have somehow slightly a
little more inherent empathy by being an

8
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,650
outsider at some level,
but I don't have any more knowledge of it.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,480
And now it seems like the Trans issue
has almost superseded all of the other

10
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:44,300
issues at least in the last
year. I mean everywhere. Yeah.

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,000
Everywhere you go there's, you know, every
time I opened the Twitter search bar,

12
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:51,550
it's another trans story or someone's
being fired for this joke or that or the

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,360
other.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,000
What do you think happened there that
catapulted this so quickly and what are

15
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,550
the issues around it that were kind of
afraid to talk about right now? Yeah,

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,100
it's a really complicated fraught topic.
I think trying to get you, I think like

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,680
the legitimate issue about trans is
there are people who are trans or field

18
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:15,640
trans and they want their rights respected
and that's totally legitimate and

19
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,120
good for them.
And raising awareness about that is fine.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,720
There's a much larger group of people
who I think are using trans issues as a

21
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,660
kind of wedge to destroy,
uh,

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,960
the gender binary or to kind of muddy
the waters or basically as a weapon to

23
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:39,241
beat up evolutionary psychology
or evolutionary biology
to say there's no such

24
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,400
thing as sex.
Really.

25
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:46,300
There's no such thing as biological
sex or sex is totally dissociated from

26
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,560
gender,
etc. When someone says that,

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,510
and the next time someone
says that on Twitter,

28
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:52,450
what's the answer that the
person watching this should give?

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,620
That maybe Twitter is not
the best one for it? I mean,

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,760
male and female or evolved strategies
that exist because over thousands of

31
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:09,541
generations they were like the
paths to successful reproduction.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,320
Um,

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,320
if you're not clearly male and functioning
as a male or you're not clearly

34
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,440
female and functioning as a female,
you're your genetic dead end.

35
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:25,441
So selection hammers
against any ambiguity there.

36
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,830
So it's not surprising that the vast
majority of humans alive today clearly

37
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,200
identify as one sex or the other.
Um,

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,570
that doesn't mean everyone should,

39
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,180
it doesn't have any kind of
moral implications about that.

40
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:45,181
But just descriptively it means there is
a gender binary and it evolved for good

41
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:46,954
reasons.

42
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,170
And everyone who teaches biology hopefully
knows this and it shouldn't be that

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,470
controversial right now.

44
00:02:56,471 --> 00:03:01,471
If we want to like genetically engineer
people and use and whatever to destroy

45
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,500
the gender binary for the
22nd and 23rd centuries,

46
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,550
we can do that. We could
talk about that. Um,

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,650
I don't have any particular
attachment to the kind of male,

48
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,130
female dichotomy ethically.
Um,

49
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
but I think descriptively it's really
important to kind of accept it and to go,

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,060
if it's here,

51
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,061
it's valuable to understand
and we shouldn't necessarily
try to pretend it out

52
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,160
of existence,
um,

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,830
or pretend that we're doing it in
the name of Trans Rights, right?

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,960
You can have trans rights without
saying there's no such thing as sex.

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,460
So this gets to the heart of what I
think is really happening in this country

56
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:48,821
right now,

57
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:53,821
which is everything has become politicized
to the point that the experts in the

58
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:58,630
field seem afraid to talk
to you right now are,

59
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,270
are taking a risk by talking
about these issues. Yeah.

60
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,440
Are you seeing this across the board?

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
Are you seeing this amongst colleagues
if fear to talk about these things? Yeah,

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,863
absolutely.

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,150
Now the vast majority of people like at
my university don't really touch upon

64
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,300
anything that's particularly politicized,
right?

65
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,010
They're just teaching civil
engineering or law or um,

66
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,060
immunology or whatever.

67
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,510
And most of that isn't
really politicized yet,

68
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,840
however yet is the key word
that. Right, right. Okay.

69
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,400
I mean you get a little bit bit about
what's the gender representation in

70
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,990
certain fields, but in my
department, in psychology,

71
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,890
you do get almost everything
having a kind of political edge.

72
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,300
And I have colleagues who are
frightened to teach certain classes.

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,340
Like I teach psychology of
human sexuality and I'm,

74
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,390
I'm pretty upfront outspoken about
what I cover and what my view is,

75
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:03,061
but a lot of my colleagues will not touch
it with a barge pole because there's

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,550
so much risk that students will just get
upset about one little thing you say.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,240
Yeah. And complained to a dean and
then you'll get called into the office.

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,240
And, um, so what would
be that type of thing,

79
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:20,370
but beyond what you just said about the,
and the evidence of,

80
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,420
of gender differences,
what,

81
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:28,090
what are the other types of things
that just talking about are scaring the

82
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:28,924
academics?

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,970
It's very awkward to talk about sex
differences in any mental traits or

84
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,560
motivations or preferences. It's hard
to talk about sexual coercion, rape,

85
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,050
pate, rape, harassment, stall gang,

86
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,250
etc. That was being incredibly
difficult one at college. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,770
Um, it's hard to talk about,
um, aggression in general,

88
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:55,630
either between individuals or between
groups and how that relates to sexuality.

89
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,500
Like why hunter gatherer tribes go to war,
right?

90
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,250
It's not typically about land or food,
it's about women.

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,690
And that doesn't fit the kind of
Marxist picture of prehistoric warfare.

92
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,100
Right.
And then if you talk about stuff like,

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,750
um, pregnancy, childcare, parenting,

94
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,380
are you being,
you know,

95
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
overly pro natalist and sort of family
values for talking about that stuff?

96
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,470
Is that alienating to certain students
who might be homosexual or infertile or,

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,530
or adopted kids or whatever?
Um,

98
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,351
but you see,

99
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,030
it's so interesting because I obviously
hear these types of stories from

100
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:45,130
academics all the time,
not only in here but,

101
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,960
but online and people email me all the
time and it's like, God, we've failed.

102
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:53,380
I mean, the university really
had failed at that point.

103
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,760
Like if you're afraid to talk about child
rearing because that might upset a gay

104
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:02,740
person. Yeah. Jesus. I mean,
what's left at that point?

105
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,780
It's so frustrating and it means
I feel bad for the students.

106
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:13,330
But I also feel bad for the parents
who are often footing the tuition bill

107
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,930
because the parents have faith that if I
send my kid to a state university and I

108
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:24,190
paid tens of thousands and tuition
and they take a course on topic x,

109
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,360
like human sexuality,

110
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,860
that they're going to get professors who
are willing to profess to say what they

111
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:32,680
really think and often
and not getting that.

112
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,540
So there's a kind of bait and switch
where universities are pretending to be

113
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,520
these bastions of free speech
and inquiry and, and honesty.

114
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,530
And in fact,
um,

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,920
everyone's kind of running scared and
these kids are not getting our best

116
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:55,180
insights. They're paying the money,
but we're not delivering the service.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,220
How much of an infection, not just
in the classroom, do you see this as,

118
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,450
but I think,
correct me if I'm wrong,

119
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:04,240
I think you've written around 110
published papers. Is that right?

120
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,780
Did I get the exact number right? Is it a
hundred more or less? More, more or less?

121
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:09,130
You lose count anything at some point.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,660
I'm sure you're well aware
of the Peter you led hoax,

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,440
that it's not just what's happening in
the classroom that's causing the chaos,

124
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,220
but it actually may be what's happening
before that related to all of these

125
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:24,580
papers that at certain
disciplines basically have,

126
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't think I'm all the rest of waiting.
They almost have no standards. Yeah.

127
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,400
At this point that that has got to be
just incredibly frustrating for someone

128
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:37,960
that actually has published some things
legitimately. It's kind of frustrating,

129
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:41,320
but I can see you don't get frustrated
easily. But I'm like, it doesn't matter

130
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,670
bug me as much as maybe it
bugged some other people.

131
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,650
Partly because I spent a
lot of my undergraduate, um,

132
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,840
years taking courses on critical
theory and I read a lot of dairy,

133
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,700
dawn Foucault and,
and all those French dudes.

134
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:01,701
And one reason I loved those courses is
it was so easy to get an a by writing a

135
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:08,431
kind of bullshit paper using the right
terms and ma using sufficiently obscure

136
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:14,970
syntax. Right. That, so
I know that game. God,

137
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,080
that's real. Very well. It's
really real and it's great fun.

138
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,620
I understand the appeal of that stuff.
It's just,

139
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,960
I can't imagine spending my adult
life doing nothing about that.

140
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,620
And that's what's happening
in a lot of the humanities.

141
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,210
So it like if,

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,000
if those folks want to
do that and get paid,

143
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,810
typically not a very good
salary to do that. I don't,

144
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,210
it doesn't really viscerally offends me.

145
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,030
The only dangerous when is when they
turn into activists and they give people

146
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:54,310
like me grief based on not
understanding what I do.

147
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,080
Well, I would imagine a lot of
bitches then leaks into your classroom

148
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,930
and then, and all bets
are off. It's weird.

149
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:05,440
It doesn't actually leak in. Like
when I teach human sexuality, right.

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,490
The kids have a sort of vague,
um,

151
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,370
political correctness that
they've absorbed mostly in
k through 12 public school,

152
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:18,160
I think.
But if you actually ask them,

153
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,510
have you had any courses
on gender feminism? No.

154
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,450
Have you heard of any of these leading
figures from critical theory or history

155
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:32,500
of feminism or even history of gay rights?
I know nothing about.

156
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,410
So it's not like they've
been indoctrinated,

157
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,800
at least not in big state schools,

158
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,340
but they've kind of soaked up
some stuff from high school.

159
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,830
I think that influences how
they interpret everything.

160
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,680
So as two guys

161
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,190
wearing, might I say very nice
shirts right now is shiny,

162
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:57,960
terrible shirt and a shiny blue shirt.
Let's talk about evolutionary aesthetics.

163
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,990
Toll people don't talk about aesthetics.
Yeah that much.

164
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,340
But you think that sort of the things
we're looking at in the west or maybe not

165
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,280
as exciting as they should be and
that there's a problem there, is that

166
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,700
fair to say?
Yeah,

167
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,330
I've been really into art for a long
time and I think art and beauty are

168
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:15,500
important,
um,

169
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,640
particularly to places
people live and work.

170
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,260
And I think as humans we kind of
deserve the best from artists,

171
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:28,400
interior designers, stylists, whatever,

172
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:32,630
architects that make our
lives as pleasant as possible.

173
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,390
And I think basically
ever since about 1910,

174
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:39,920
art in architecture has failed and has
not done a very good job of delivering

175
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,150
visual environments that are actually
humane and appealing and enjoyable and

176
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,450
that kind of promote
mental and physical health.

177
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:54,400
What happened around
19 modernism, man, um,

178
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,300
if you look at the way
domestic architecture worked
up until about that period,

179
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,020
it was all sort of human scale
and arts and crafts and um,

180
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,700
there are places you'd want to live where
you didn't have to be educated into a

181
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,290
particular elite notion of what a house
should be in order to appreciate it.

182
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Right? And then you get the bow
house, international modernism,

183
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,890
white structures, crisp hard lines, um,

184
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,740
bad acoustics.

185
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,860
And suddenly that becomes
the fashion right?

186
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:38,861
And that becomes what people think
or is the future and nobody likes it,

187
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,670
but it's kind of imposed
top down by the elite.

188
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,090
You must live like this,
like it or not.

189
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,770
Is that top down from the elite or is
that just that often those things are just

190
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:53,830
easier to build probably and cheaper to
build or maybe that's the same. Actually

191
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,140
the irony is like you
could have taken cheap,

192
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,700
easy to build reinforced concrete
structures and built a lot of all,

193
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:08,701
some cheap houses that were okay or
you could do the traditional route,

194
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,550
but instead of what you get is every
house must be distinct and must have its

195
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,760
own shape and there can't be any,
um,

196
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,010
standardization.

197
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,380
So the houses end up being expensive and
experimental and hard to maintain and

198
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:26,650
they leak and everyone's miserable.
Um,

199
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,840
so they're not really serving the needs
of the, the people at large. They're just

200
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,020
great for architect egos.

201
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,680
Yeah.

202
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,830
It's interesting because I just spent a
couple of months bouncing through a lot

203
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,550
of different countries in Europe and
especially on most of these countries

204
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,420
because the history goes back so far.
You seem incredible architecture.

205
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,770
You see eating,
you know,

206
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:52,480
I'd see chairs that were 150 years old
and like the woodwork that would go into

207
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,700
it in the craftsmen shit.
And it was like,

208
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,700
I don't think we could do this
today or if we could do it today,

209
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,310
this would've caught,
this chair would be in our dollars.

210
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,330
It would be like a 6,000, $500
chair, where back then, you know,

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,290
this is what a guy did.

212
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,740
It took them a couple of days and he could
sell it and earn a wage and it's like

213
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,500
we've just, the economics of
everything had gotten out of whack.

214
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,210
Yeah.
And like nice table here.

215
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,070
Um, this slash probably slide it on
the table right when you walked in.

216
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:19,840
So I know you mean it.

217
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,940
Yeah. Um, I've made a few pieces
of furniture in my day and that's,

218
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,970
that's pretty cool. But yeah, it
was a visual art in particular. Um,

219
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:32,971
the economics mean like abstract painting
just is so much faster to do than

220
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,760
representational painting,
right.

221
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,850
If you're a young aspiring artist and
you want a career and you want to give

222
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,750
your gallery a certain flow
of work that they can sell,

223
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,730
it's a lot harder to do that.

224
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,210
If you're doing representational
paintings that take a hundred,

225
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:53,330
300 hours than an abstract
work that takes a 10th of that.

226
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,740
So the economic pressures are
also in that direction. Yeah.

227
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,710
Um, but people have, um,

228
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,290
kind of voted with their feet and like
they don't like elite abstract art.

229
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:14,170
They don't like conceptual art. Um, it's,

230
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,620
I like the word the right word.
They or are, they just don't,

231
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,360
they just don't know where
it's conditioning or it's
that we all like to like

232
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:23,160
what everybody else likes

233
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,433
sort of thing.

234
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I think everybody knows that that
kind of supposed to enjoy going to,

235
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,620
like while we're visiting the city,

236
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:36,160
we should go to the contemporary art
museum and they get there and there's a

237
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:41,161
bunch of terrible video art and there's
a bunch of very puzzling conceptual art.

238
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,250
And they read the little descriptions
on the walls and they go,

239
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:50,230
it just makes no sense cause it's
written by an art curator for other art

240
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:55,150
curators. And it's all completely
alienating. And that's,

241
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,170
that's sad because it means they're being
told this is the highest expression of

242
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:03,700
your culture,
but it's completely inaccessible to you.

243
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,190
So what,
uh,

244
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,340
what do you look at that gives you some
excitement or can still sort of renew

245
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:13,940
your spirit, let's say? Well, there

246
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,570
is a movement of kind of neo
traditionalism and, and art where there's,

247
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,290
there's certain places like New York
Academy of Arts that are actually teaching

248
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,830
students how to draw and
paint and sculpt and,

249
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,430
and do the sort of traditional,
um,

250
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,730
skills that people associate with art.
Um,

251
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,450
it's just a little hard
to get a foothold in the,

252
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,200
like the New York or London gallery
system if that's the kind of work that you

253
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,850
do.
Um,

254
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,070
but my hope is that like
the bay area billionaires,

255
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,970
we'll start collecting that stuff. Um,
I think the Chinese aren't market is,

256
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,360
has got a real thirst for
good representational art
and I think that's going to

257
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:00,150
start to dominate the
art world pretty soon.

258
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,540
So what's the evolutionary
need for good art? I mean,

259
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,000
what's the psychological, I
mean, I know you're, you're okay.

260
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:10,360
There's an expression of something
that can't quite be said,

261
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,820
but what's like the
driving force behind that?

262
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,960
So yeah, on the one hand there's, why do
we bother to make art? On the other hand,

263
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,510
why,
why do we like certain kinds of art?

264
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,650
And there's been a lot more research
on why did we like certain kinds of

265
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,710
patterns and colors and forms
and compensations and whatever.

266
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,340
But there's no sort of unified theory of,

267
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,660
of aesthetics.
In fact,

268
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:42,661
I would say there's more
good stuff published on that
topic between about 1817,

269
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,600
1920 than since.

270
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,100
Cause that's when people were
sort of there inspired by Darwin.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,040
Evolutionary aesthetics was a field.

272
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,750
There were dozens of books published on
it and then modernism came and everyone

273
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:58,584
forgot all of that.

274
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,950
How could this be connected to the
earlier topic, which is sexuality.

275
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:07,910
So for example,
my gay male friends generally speaking,

276
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,370
have a much better eye for art
or for style or for fashion.

277
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,090
Yeah. You know, you could get away
in that crew. You know what I mean?

278
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,400
Like you've got a nice blanket on,
you got an make shirt like that.

279
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,120
You know what I mean? Like, I mean that
is a compliment. Like where Jay, again,

280
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:26,420
just broadly speaking,
it's like my straight guy friends,

281
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,650
all kinds of wear big shirts and they
don't know exactly how to do their hair

282
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,580
and their,
you know,

283
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,530
so there's some connection between
sexuality and artistic vision.

284
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,090
I think that's absolutely true.

285
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,590
And it's not what you would predict from
first principles. It's really weird.

286
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,570
If you look around at other species,

287
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,190
the males are typically
much more ornamental than
the females. They have the,

288
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,900
the amazing plumage and
they do the incredible songs
and dances and the females

289
00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:00,460
are usually kind of drab and,
and not that aesthetic.

290
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,900
The power birds that make these
incredible kind of installation works.

291
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,910
That's all the males. Then you get
to humans or at least American males,

292
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,000
American straight nails.
And it's like,

293
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,890
can't you even find clothes that fit?
We'd like colors.

294
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,360
That is the big shift work.

295
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:23,590
And like what is up with your house?
You know?

296
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,750
And when I did the,

297
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,080
you're in Peter's until 2 million copies
to tell people to clean their room.

298
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,143
Yeah.

299
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,760
So I have no idea why gay men have
better taste than straight men.

300
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,670
I think that's a fascinating,
there's some,

301
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:42,210
there has to be some
something going on there. Um,

302
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,400
but I think men can level up obviously
cause like British and European men

303
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,060
aren't as hopeless.
If you grow up a young man in Italy,

304
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,810
you kind of absorb some ideas about
style and even the British um,

305
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,970
kind of aristocrats landed,

306
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:04,971
gentry class have a certain look that
it's a bit traditionalist but at least

307
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,430
there's taste.

308
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
I don't know if he's
going to quite make sense,

309
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:15,010
but where we almost getting there say
10 years ago with the rise of the metro

310
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:16,510
sexual.
Yeah man,

311
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,530
it's sort of crashed because I guess
maybe it relates back to what you said at

312
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,630
the beginning about where
we are more puritan.

313
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,110
So where there was this idea there
was this like mocking of them like Ah,

314
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,540
they're just gay but don't want to
admit it. Or something like that.

315
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,490
And that whole thing seem to crash.

316
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,880
Like there was this little brief window
where straight guys were like dressing

317
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:36,580
better had cooler haircuts or something,
something there.

318
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,970
Well, even five years ago when I lived
in New York for a little bit and uh,

319
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,190
hung out, hung out a lot in
Brooklyn, there was sort of,

320
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,660
that was peak hipster in
Brooklyn and the guys there,

321
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,400
the straight guys put a lot of effort
into grooming and haircuts and authentic

322
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:59,350
style and this or that is in fashion.
And I thought this is really cool.

323
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:04,000
This is like a Europeanization
of male taste and culture,

324
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,640
but it was also very masculine.

325
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,270
It wasn't sort of like late seventies
disco culture or early nineties rave

326
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,270
culture or,
or burning man culture.

327
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
You sort of more old school
masculinity school. Yeah.

328
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Like I want to go to a proper barber
and get proper haircut and like it's all

329
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:29,230
flannel and boots and whatever
and I love that stuff. Um,

330
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,330
but I think it kind of had its moment

331
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,820
and evaporated on it.

332
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,500
They just priced themselves
out of the market and Brooke,
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,440
Or they just got all too busy on Twitter.
Well that it always comes back to that.

334
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,570
Let's talk a little bit about mate
selection. Regardless of your sexuality,

335
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,960
there seems to be this new thing right
now where if you're not open to dating,

336
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,750
absolutely anyone under any circumstances,

337
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:59,600
no matter how they look or how they
take care of themselves or whether they

338
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:04,220
brush their teeth or whether they have a
penis or a vagina or any combination of

339
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:07,340
anything that if you are
just open to anything,

340
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,240
there is a a pretty loud and growing
boys out there that is trying to frame

341
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:12,570
everyone as a,
as a pig,

342
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,820
which is the reverse of what choosing
a mate really has been about.

343
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,010
It's insane. I mean, for 500
I got you. I got emotional.

344
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,353
There were

345
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,800
500 million years,
right?

346
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:30,570
Our vertebrate ancestors
have been choosing the mates
selectively because that

347
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:35,571
is the highest stakes decision
any organism makes as who
do I recombine my jeans

348
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:36,930
with?
Right?

349
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,430
And so all the way through the coordinates
and the vertebrates in the mammals

350
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,560
and the primates,
you get,

351
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,360
particularly females being choosy
about, you know, who they breed with,

352
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:49,560
who sires their kids,

353
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,370
but then as fit as humans start doing
pair bonds million 2 million years ago and

354
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,860
the males start investing
more in offspring,

355
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,320
start forming longer term relationships,

356
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,790
then we also have incentives to
be choosy about our female mates.

357
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,130
And so this is the one domain where if
you have even a shred of libertarian in

358
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:18,780
you or you respect freedom
of association at all,

359
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,470
or you think it's okay to care who you
spend your life with and like what kind

360
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:28,440
of children you,
you create,

361
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,940
then mate choice should be
it kind of domain of freedom,

362
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,430
right? Like this is a good place to be
prejudice, so to speak, right? Yeah.

363
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,300
Like you should add some,

364
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,840
uh,
it should just be discriminating,

365
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,110
have judgment on taste and you can
always be open to the idea that maybe the

366
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:53,561
current set of criteria that I have maybe
could be nudged or improved or tweaked

367
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:57,890
or maybe I'm subject to
certain stereotypes and
maybe I could overcome those.

368
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,431
True,

369
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,750
of course people tend to get better at
may choice in their thirties and in their

370
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,584
teens.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,080
But for someone to start
lecturing you politically,

372
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,560
like you shouldn't be attracted to women.

373
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:14,600
You should be attracted to anybody or any,

374
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,620
any kind of being or in any
species and the age like,

375
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,760
no,
let please let me be attracted to,

376
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,270
I'm attracted to because
that should be like the,

377
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,450
the pinnacle of human freedom. Yeah. If,

378
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,750
if you don't believe in
freedom anywhere else,

379
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,030
you should believe in mate choice freedom.

380
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,330
It should be a fundamental
human right I think.

381
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,550
And where you get horrible
to tal in societies,

382
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,910
really infringing on mate choice freedom.

383
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:51,230
Like you're not allowed to
marry that person or you know,

384
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:54,230
you have to do an arranged
marriage to that person.

385
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,790
We kind of recoil at that and go,
that's horrible.

386
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,630
And yet in America we have busy bodies,

387
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,630
virtue signalers um,

388
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,340
telling us your may choice
criteria are too narrow.

389
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,430
So where

390
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,030
do gay people fit in all of this then
out of biological or an evolutionary

391
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:22,740
perspective, you've brought up the
point of passing on genes, man,

392
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,280
gay couples or gay people, whether
you're a couple or not. Don't do that.

393
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,230
At least biologically speaking.
Yup.

394
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,280
Um,
so what,

395
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,310
what do you make of that condition?

396
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,210
Is that even the right word?
And I'm going to get,

397
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,030
I'm going to get us both in trouble.
Probably just for me asking the question.

398
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,150
Let's call it a trait trait traits.
Pretty neutral. Okay. Alright. Trey,

399
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:43,984
it's pretty neutral.

400
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,331
Well,

401
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:49,331
here's the fascinating
thing about homosexuality is
people have been developing

402
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,960
or trying to develop series
of male homosexuality and
it's kind of evolutionary

403
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:57,110
origins and functions for 30,

404
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:01,730
40 years and there is no
good theory of it yet.

405
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,990
It's a complete mystery.

406
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,170
I've never seen any compelling
explanation of male homosexuality.

407
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,190
So, so what would be a compelling
compelling argument would be,

408
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,181
okay.

409
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:19,181
There's costs of being like exclusively
attracted to your own sex and therefore

410
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,010
not typically having as many kids,

411
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,640
but there's some countervailing
benefits of some sort,

412
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:31,270
maybe benefits to your extended family
or benefits to your group or something

413
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:36,570
else. But nobody can make
the math work enough to,

414
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,180
to kind of explain that. Um,
female bisexuality is much easier,

415
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,711
right?
You can go,

416
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:47,711
well as long as a woman is sometimes
attracted to men enough to have kids,

417
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,510
then also being attracted to women might
be no cost at all or it might even be a

418
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,610
benefit in terms of social networking,

419
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,100
making friends sex as a great
way to make friends. Um,

420
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,200
if a lot more males were bisexual,

421
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,390
that would be equally easy to explain.
Um,

422
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,460
it's exclusive homosexuality,
that's very hard to explain.

423
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,990
It certainly exists that exists at a,
you know,

424
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,180
a percentage that's much,
much higher than you can explain is just,

425
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:26,080
well, it's just mutations where it's
just maladaptive. That won't work.

426
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,850
So this is where I'll be Kinda
epistemically humble and say,

427
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,750
man, I have no idea. It's an,
it's a fascinating problem.

428
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:39,080
Maybe somebody will
crack it within 10 or 20.

429
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:39,590
Right.

430
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,200
It's interesting because if you were
coming at it from another perspective,

431
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,580
like a religious perspective,

432
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:48,380
let's say you would find that to be
a moral quandary that then you could

433
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:51,170
extrapolate that all sorts of
different judgements on, yeah.

434
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,240
But I can see the way you answered
it, it's like just is a thing. Yeah.

435
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,300
Maybe we'll get more data on it,
but it is,

436
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,030
but what do you make of the fact that
there are seemingly many more bisexual

437
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,260
women where,

438
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:06,470
I don't know any gay couple that wanted
the guys sneaking out at night to bang a

439
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,720
woman.
Never heard of that.

440
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,300
But you have heard of
obviously straightened couples
where the guy is, you know,

441
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,700
on the DL or whatever.
Yeah.

442
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,023
Yeah.

443
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,200
Well my girlfriend Diana Fleishman has
a whole theory of female bisexuality.

444
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:23,480
That's, that's to do with the
social networking benefits. Um,

445
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,840
but then the question is, yeah, why
don't the men do that too? Cause like,

446
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,270
okay,

447
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,590
if, if you're a guy and you
kind of swing both ways,

448
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:36,591
then like doing gay sex can be a
great way to make male friends also.

449
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,300
And it's,

450
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,660
well now I know we have our,
uh, our promo for the show.

451
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,980
And so in a way the quandary isn't
why do any male homosexual is exist.

452
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,910
The quandary is why aren't all
males and females bisexual?

453
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,600
And do you think some of that years from
now we might look back and go, Whoa,

454
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,010
that's just societal pressure.

455
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,750
It might be.

456
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,580
I think certainly there's a huge amount
of stigma against male bisexuals from

457
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:11,360
both sexes, but especially women. Um,

458
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,680
female bisexuality used to be stigmatized
maybe 30 years ago and not so much

459
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,470
anymore. Yeah. So it could change.

460
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,120
What are some of the
other topics that are,

461
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,180
that are really on your mind these days?

462
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,470
Let's hit up effective altruism.
Yeah, let's talk about that.

463
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,943
Um,

464
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,630
I don't know if you've had many guests
on talking about effective altruism,

465
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,370
but it's not a tight,
actually,

466
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,360
it's sort of my hot topic
of the last few years.

467
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,250
So it's a social movement
on moral movement.

468
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,700
It's some of the smartest
young people I've ever met.

469
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,530
And their basic goal in
life is do the most good.

470
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,740
They can based on reason and evidence
rather than sentimentality and virtue

471
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:56,974
signaling.

472
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,770
I've done a little bit of this sort of
in an ancillary way with some of the

473
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,690
libertarians that, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

474
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,650
And so the kind of major domains they
tend to focus on are things like how do we

475
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:12,340
get charities to be more effective at
reducing global poverty or promoting

476
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,540
global public health?

477
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,850
How do we overcome factory farming and
be nice to animals and promote animal

478
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:19,391
welfare?

479
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:24,370
And so a lot of the effect of altruists
are Vegan for ethical reasons.

480
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,190
And then a lot of them are focused
on just survival of the species.

481
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:35,191
How do we reduce existential risks to
humanity like nuclear war bioweapons,

482
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,580
um,
and artificial intelligence risks.

483
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,420
So maybe the most distinctive thing
they have is this kind of ultra longterm

484
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,650
perspective that's like,
we are just these transient little beings.

485
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,710
The thing that really matters
is what is humanity turn into?

486
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,400
How long do we last?

487
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,150
Do we colonize the universe or do we fail?

488
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,680
And folks who think most seriously about
that think it's actually that lasting,

489
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:15,910
minimizing existential risk that is
absolutely crucial and everything else is

490
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:17,500
just kind of fluff and bullshit

491
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,230
like the transhumanist who would sort
of fit within them. Is there a risk?

492
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:25,080
So I love this stuff
because I'm a Scifi guy.

493
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,490
Everything I mentioned
Philip k Dick before,

494
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:30,960
I mean every one of his stories or books
or about the inevitability of all of

495
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:32,900
these things.
Is there a risk though?

496
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:37,140
I'm always looking at what's beyond the
horizon instead of going on right now.

497
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,650
I don't really think there's a risk
unless like the vast majority of humans

498
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:47,480
became effective altruists there's already
so many people who are obsessed with

499
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,940
um,
you know,

500
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,970
diversity and equity and inclusion and
economic growth and all the ordinary

501
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:01,631
problems that politicians talk about
that that's covered this already.

502
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,180
A lot of smart people working on that.

503
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,910
The big neglected topics tend to be the
kind of science fictiony topics where

504
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:15,800
you need a sort of cadre of genius as BS,

505
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,970
right. To work on it when nobody
else is taking it seriously.

506
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,340
Yeah.
Well speaking of they ask me is that,

507
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,870
that's an interesting whatever we
wanted to get into it. That's a little,

508
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,480
a little controversial as well.
Um,

509
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,690
what is that all about?

510
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:35,130
That so many of the creators now or the
people that are coming out of the tech

511
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:35,341
world,

512
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:38,730
even though you can obviously make plenty
of arguments at the tech world is now

513
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,130
in his of implosion and

514
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,280
certainly not the creative
place it was say 10 years ago,

515
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,750
but that's so much creativity came out
of a world that had so many people that

516
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,880
were seemingly uncreated.
[inaudible]

517
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,200
I think it's fascinating.
Um,

518
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I sort of identify as moderately Osby
myself kind of high functioning asbergers

519
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,130
and I've written some stuff about how um,

520
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,690
neurodiversity issues like being asked
to kind of rub up against free speech

521
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:11,950
issues cause like can you explain
that over people who are asked,

522
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:16,040
we don't always do a good
job of understanding the
beliefs and desires of other

523
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,370
people and particularly what
they might find offensive, right?

524
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,540
So they might just say something
so they might just say shit.

525
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,090
And then these really surprised
that it was distressing to someone.

526
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,560
And so if you have a model of speech
that says you must never cause a fence,

527
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,650
that assumes you can anticipate
what will cause a fence,

528
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,230
and a lot of people can't anticipate
that because their brains don't work that

529
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,064
way.

530
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,240
So you either need to say, okay, as bs,

531
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,980
you can never say anything

532
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,530
or cut them some slack and say,

533
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,470
we understand you'll offend
people once in awhile,

534
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,610
but that's okay because that's
just, that's part of your deal, man.

535
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:03,450
I've never thought about this,

536
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:06,090
but does this somehow explain
what's going on in Silicon Valley?

537
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:09,600
Right now you have a bunch of people
who are somewhat socially awkward,

538
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,434
let's say,

539
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,730
created incredible technology
that allowed us to all connect,

540
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,760
but then when voices that are exposed,

541
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,730
I suppose that's a horrible way of
framing it within voices that are a little

542
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:24,960
out there or a little contrary or whatever
that might include us actually get

543
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:25,231
out there.

544
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:28,920
The only way they can deal with it is
to shut that voice off or something like

545
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:29,754
that.
Like,

546
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,910
which is why we're seeing
so much d platforming and
silencing and they're right.

547
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:37,440
They have to be overly systematizing about
it, that they have to be like, oh man,

548
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,274
I can't,

549
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,760
I can't navigate these gray areas if
I'm running a social media platform or

550
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,730
Patrion or whatever.
Right?

551
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,760
So I'm gonna just have a hard and
fast rule that says if I get enough

552
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:57,420
complaints,
I d platform that person or um,

553
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,043
okay.

554
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,450
I don't know the difference between porn
and erotica and just slightly sexy art.

555
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:07,740
So I'm going to say no
nipples or whatever.

556
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,550
That's a kind of asked be
response to getting blow back

557
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,380
from people were like, you don't really
know why they're upset. So in a weird way,

558
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:22,381
if you have a bunch of the creators of
Silicon Valley then are coming from that

559
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:27,310
world and then you suddenly bring in a
bunch of executives that come from the

560
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:31,810
social justice world that really shows
like a, uh, that's a match made in hell.

561
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:35,970
Right? It's just matter.
Anti matter. Yeah. It's, um,

562
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,620
it's terrible.
And

563
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,540
what I hoped would happen is that maybe
five or 10 years ago it seemed like,

564
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,230
Whoa,
like tech is dominating culture generally,

565
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:53,490
and tech is dominated by ASP ease.

566
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:58,491
So hopefully ask me values of being kind
of tolerant and eccentric and nerdy and

567
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,380
like getting weird little enthusiasms
that that would kind of trickle down and

568
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:09,970
create a more tolerant culture.
Is that what you would have predicted,

569
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:13,130
say 10 years ago? Yeah, really.
And instead you have the opposite.

570
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,840
You have the social justice activists
taking over and basically saying

571
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,110
all of that quirky freedoms that you,
you asked the people value,

572
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,880
we're going to legislate that away.
You can't have that.

573
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,660
Um, and it's, it's tragic.

574
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,980
I hope the pendulum swing swings back,
but um,

575
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,040
as long as the leaders of the social media
platforms don't have the guts to say,

576
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,860
look, this is our people. Um,

577
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,080
outspoken,
eccentric,

578
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,620
slightly socially oblivious
people and that's okay.

579
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,070
And the rest of you just have to
kind of suck it up and deal with it.

580
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,810
That's what they should be doing.

581
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,940
Yeah.
It's interesting.

582
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:06,690
I met the point with all of this and
you know how friends from Youtube and

583
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,340
Twitter and patriotic and the whole thing,

584
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,490
I'm really at the point of this where I
actually believe that that solution is

585
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,780
gone. I don't think it can come from the
top anymore. I really don't believe that.

586
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:19,560
I think that thing has become so corroded
that I would say the only way it can

587
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:23,520
come is now from the bottom and then the
people will basically rise up against

588
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:27,240
these things and I know that it's sort
of pie in the sky because what does that

589
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:31,260
even mean? Do we all sign off on the
same day? Do we all bet? You know,

590
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,310
whatever that means.

591
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:35,610
But I almost see that as the only
way to do this because they've had,

592
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,880
we've done everything else or,
or the governmental get involved in.

593
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,510
That certainly rings all the bells that
I'm not happy with on my libertarian

594
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,344
side.

595
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah. I, I think at least
in terms of universities,

596
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,010
the only solution to,

597
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,950
to some of the university problems is the
government actually saying at least to

598
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,470
the public universities that are in
principle bound by the constitution.

599
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,360
You guys have to obey the first
amendment or you lose federal funding.

600
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,760
I think that's the only leverage.
Yeah.

601
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,980
And I was really kind of hoping that
POTUS would do that at some point in the

602
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,470
last year or two and pretty
disappointed that he hasn't,

603
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,290
well, in a weird way he almost benefits
the more that they go against it. Right.

604
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,490
Because that feeds his base of yeah.
Aggrieved and politically correct. Yeah.

605
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,930
You know that they see political
correctness running amok. Yeah.

606
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,400
Something like that. Um, all right.

607
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:29,540
Before we finish up gimme gimme one thing
where at the beginning of 2019 right

608
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:34,400
now, give me one thing that we should
be sort of thinking about that we're not

609
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:35,380
thinking about now.

610
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,310
I love the thought experiment of like,

611
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:43,360
once Elon Musk succeeds and
we start colonizing Mars,

612
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,530
what,

613
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,030
what are the relationships and social
structures in the Mars colonies going to

614
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,860
look like?
I'm fascinated by this,

615
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,980
this issue like barred the
colonies going to be like

616
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,740
communist utopia is are they
going to be libertarian, um,

617
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,800
aspirational states?
Are they,

618
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,190
is everyone going to do
monogamous lifelong marriage?

619
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:12,100
Is it going to be crazy polyamorous,
kinky stuff?

620
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,350
I think it's great to think about
this stuff before we attempt it.

621
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,070
And I think Mars is going to
be this amazing experiment,

622
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,060
or like this colony gets formed based on
these social and sexual assumptions and

623
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:32,680
this one gets formed and this
one fails catastrophic Lee or,

624
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,730
or it's like,

625
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,350
it doesn't work well then often it's just
borrows the organization of this other

626
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:39,184
place.

627
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,470
So I think it'll be this incredible kind
of behavioral science laboratory and I

628
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:44,700
can't

629
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,660
where I say that's not too far from the
way the America we set up. Right, exactly.

630
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,150
To be those places of experiment.

631
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,420
Yeah. Um, it's, yeah,

632
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:59,000
it's the way the east coast was 200
and 250 years ago and I think, um,

633
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,380
the difference now is the colonies will
be able to communicate with each other

634
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:08,520
and with us and be able to measure
a bunch of outcomes and deliberately

635
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:09,354
experiment.

636
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,320
And I think we need to kind of get out
ahead of that and start like rereading

637
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,520
all of our classic science fiction and
figuring out how is this going to apply

638
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,350
for reals now,
now that we

639
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,170
do it. Yeah. Which is still related
to why you think art is important?

640
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,660
Because fiction's just as important.
I mean,

641
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,510
you realize it all lands that
eventually they figure it out.

642
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,140
They have their tea party and
then we blow them up like, yeah,

643
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,970
but they do beautiful art nouveau
like domes in the meanwhile.

644
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,260
Yeah. Jeffrey, I'm so glad we finally
did this and listen to it again for sure.

645
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,980
And if you want to see a
good combination of bright,

646
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,540
smart thought and snark on Twitter,
follow Jeffrey at primal Polly
