00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
From a recent trip to Japan, my home country, I brought back a little present.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.550
It's a traditional toy. A Japanese toy called "Kamifusen", which means paper balloon.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.420
[robot pumping air]

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.640
And as you can see, it's a balloon made of paper, and there's a hole in there, yeah?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.540
So the way you inflate this paper balloon, when you squash it, is to blow into this hole...

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.220
[Tadashi blowing up balloon]

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.060
And make it rounder. Okay, but there is another way to make it rounder.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.100
[balloon crinkles]

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.060
You can squash it, and then you can start tossing it around.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.200
[Tadashi hitting balloon]

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.060
You hit it from all sides at random... oops!

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.060
Now, when you hit something, don't you have the impression that you are denting it and therefore making

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.580
it less and less round and you're denting it, right, from both sides?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.200
But look at what's happening as I toss it and hit it from all sides. I'm doing it completely randomly.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.860
You can hit it quite hard.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.960
[Tadashi hitting balloon]

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.780
What was shriveled to a little crumple

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.700
is now getting rounder and rounder

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.220
and becoming more and more spherical.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.200
And look! I ended up with a round sphere.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.780
So, this is a really strange way of making something round by denting it repeatedly from all sides.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000
How does this trick work?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.020
I think the key to this behavior,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.890
which all Japanese children know instinctively, is really in the following behavior of the balloon. When I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.409
shrivel it to a little crumple,

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.439
watch what happens when I release it.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.189
You see, it starts fighting its way back...

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.689
...at least initially. It doesn't inflate all the way back of course, but it has some memory.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.758
And it wants to come back to where it started. It fights its way back as I said.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.680
[Brady] Why is it even doing that? What's causing that?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.189
That's... that's an interesting question. Um, I have to think about this.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.140
[laughter] Okay.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.150
So let's imagine the following toy model. Let's say that you have a state of this balloon, which is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.109
crumpled on both sides: on the left as well as on the right,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.680
and I'm going to strike this balloon at this moment.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.640
Pafff!

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640
From the left, let's say. What happens,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.420
to a good approximation,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.820
I think, is that the side that you hit gets over crumpled because I just hit it.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.920
You know, you introduce a lot of crumples.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.660
But the other side gets puffed out literally because there is this force which

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.060
Pushes it rightward. But, you see, then something interesting happens.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.540
That "fighting back" effect means that the left side which was over crumpled,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.160
starts fighting back, so it starts expanding to roughly the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.840
degree of wrinkliness that it had in the beginning, whereas the right hand side stays puffed out.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.860
So, per this cycle, you see, what happened is that

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.149
I increase the overall smoothness a little bit. The other side which got puffed out, whereas this side that I over wrinkled

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.109
fought back by itself. So, if you keep hitting it from all sides gradually you are making the thing rounder and rounder.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.049
So let's plot the evolution of the volume against time, and let's say in time

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.609
I'm hitting the balloon at various regular intervals. It doesn't have to be regular intervals.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.200
Okay. So the volume of the balloon starts like this and

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.320
as soon as I hit it, of course,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.640
instantaneously, I suddenly decrease the volume. I just shrivel it. So, a hit

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.220
gives you this dip. But then, the thing fights back.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
Yeah? This is the fight back. And then the next hit will decrease the volume.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.939
And then it will fight back, fight back and so on, and gradually it asymptotes,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.040
or it approaches this spherical shape

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.340
from below like this. So it never becomes completely spherical, but it grows like that. So I think there is a process of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.240
"grow, shrink, grow, shrink, grow, shrink, zig, zag, zig, zag" and then goes back then. That's why you can do this strange thing of

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.280
hitting it, or denting it, repeatedly, and yet the result outcome is that it becomes rounder and rounder.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.640
Okay, this will probably take a long time.
