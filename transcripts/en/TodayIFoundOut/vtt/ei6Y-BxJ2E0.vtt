00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:12.980
There 
are two aspects to this question.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.690
The first is temperature.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.920
Numerous studies throughout the last century
have shown that cold temperatures will not

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.730
increase your chance of becoming infected
by a cold virus.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.789
Now that’s out of the way, let’s attack
the second aspect.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.699
The fact that there is a “cold and flu season”,
and it does coincide with cooler temperatures.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.270
The analytical side of me needs to break through
some societal tendencies before this second

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.690
aspect can be evaluated.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.040
From my experience, when people get sick,
they tend to describe mild symptoms as “colds”

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.150
and severe ones as “the flu”.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.880
Unfortunately, you can’t diagnose an illness
simply by the perceived severity of symptoms.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.440
If any given group of people were exposed
to the same cold virus, many would have mild

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.670
to no symptoms, and some would have more severe
reactions.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070
The same can be said for flu viruses.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.190
The distinction between the two also gets
blurred by some people’s tendency to over-exaggerate

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.309
their symptoms.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.720
In truth, a person’s reaction to them aside,
these are two very different types of viruses.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.020
There are over 200 different strains of “cold”
viruses, mainly made up of rhinoviruses (up

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020
to 50%).

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.619
The average adult in the US will get 2-4 colds
per year.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.850
The average child will get 6-8.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.189
These types of viruses usually are associated
with mild symptoms.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.329
Up to 25% of infected people won’t show
any symptoms at all.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.219
Most won’t get a fever, and if you do, it
will be low-grade- around 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.689
Your Runny nose (thus rhinovirus) and cough
will tend to be mild.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.670
These viruses primarily won’t transmit through
the air.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.659
Instead, people become infected by coming
into direct contact with someone who has an

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.170
infection, or touch something that an infected
person touches.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.680
Influenza, however, is a much more sinister
beast, affecting approximately 10% of the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.549
US population every year.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.840
This virus tends to start with sudden onset
of a higher fever between 100-104 degrees

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840
Fahrenheit.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.640
It then progresses into chills, headache,
muscle aches and a loss of appetite.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.440
Flu’s can also lead to more serious conditions
like bronchitis and pneumonia.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.640
Those whose immune systems might be compromised,
like the elderly or chronically ill, are at

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.170
risk of death.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.890
Approximately 20,000 people a year die from
the flu, so maybe mom was right.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.260
You will catch your death!

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.840
So why the increase in these illnesses in
the winter?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.480
It seems this knowledge has been around for
many centuries.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.470
The word influenza comes from an older Italian
phrase “influenza di freddo” or “influence

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.760
of the cold”.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.060
The flu-season usually ranges from November
to March in the northern hemisphere (the coldest

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.310
months) and May to September in the lower.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.980
In fact, in tropical climates, there tends
to be extremely low incidences of flu and

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.650
certainly no true “flu season”.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.420
There are several contributing factors to
why cold temperatures increase influenza infection

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.790
rates, all of which seem to be well known
and promoted by health officials in numerous

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.910
publications.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.280
The most common is that people tend to stay
indoors when the temperatures get colder.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.710
This allows people to be in closer contact
with each other and therefore makes it easier

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.980
to pass the virus from person to person.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.440
Another contributing factor could be that
in large parts of the country children are

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.930
going back to school and interacting more
with their fellow infected.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.210
In fact, most epidemics can be traced back
to children.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.150
The answer to this riddle lies in how the
influenza virus reacts to temperature and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.150
humidity.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.620
The virus is extremely stable in colder temperatures,
41 degrees Fahrenheit optimally.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.850
The warmer you go, the less stable it becomes.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.430
Around 86 degrees, the virus isn’t transmitted
at all.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.010
Humidity also plays a very important role.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.480
Influenza is primarily transmitted on the
droplets from your respiratory tract (cover

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.840
your mouth when you cough kids!)

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.830
The more humid the environment, the more water
is available for those droplets to “pick

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.830
up”.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.110
The heavier the droplets become, the faster
they will fall to the ground and out of the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.180
way of our mucus membranes.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.340
In drier environments, those death droplets
hang around in the air longer for others to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.340
breathe in.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.930
In fact, one study showed that the virus was
best transmitted at a humidity of 20% and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.920
not transmitted at all once the humidity reached
80%.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.739
(And you thought moving to more tropical climates
when you get old and sick was just a bunch

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.739
of voodoo medicine!)

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.960
That same study showed animals transmit the
virus for a full two days longer at 41 degrees

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.490
F than they do at a room temperature of 68.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.820
The conclusion was that a person’s respiratory
tract is colder and therefore the virus can

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.110
be more stable inside your mucus membranes.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.720
So what does all this mean?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.520
You are no more likely to get a cold in the
winter then you are in the summer.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.740
The flu, however, is a different animal altogether.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.280
You are more likely to get this virus in the
winter.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.100
So just remember kids: wash your hands, cover
your mouth when you cough, and apparently

00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:07.760
move to Florida when you retire.
