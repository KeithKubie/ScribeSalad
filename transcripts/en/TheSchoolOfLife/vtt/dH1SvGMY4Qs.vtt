00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.620
We're hugely dependent on language 
to help us express what we really think and feel

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.600
but some languages are better than others
at crisply naming important feelings.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.780
Germans have been geniuses at inventing
long or what get called "compound words"

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.800
that elegantly put a finger
on sensations that we all know,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.220
but that other languages require
whole clumsy sentences or paragraphs to express.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.280
So, here is a small selection of the best
of Germany's extraordinary range of compound words.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.560
"Erkl채rungsnot"

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.380
Literally, a distress at not having an explanation,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.500
the perfect way to define what a partner might feel
when they're caught watching porn

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.720
or spotted in a restaurant
with the hands they shouldn't be holding.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.980
More grandly, "Erkl채rungsnot"
is something we feel when we realize

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.300
we don't have any explanations
for the big questions of life.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680
It's a word that defines
existential angst, as much as shame.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.840
"Futterneid"

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.720
The feeling when you're eating with other people

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.220
and realize that they've ordered something better
of the menu that you'd be dying to eat yourself.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.160
Perhaps you were trying to be abstemious.
Now, you're just starving.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.660
The word recognizes that we spend
much of our lives feeling

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.680
we've ordered the wrong thing,
and not just in restaurants.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.060
"Luftschloss"

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.760
Literally, a castle in the air, a dream that's unnattainable

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.600
A word suggesting that German culture
is deeply indulgent about big dreams,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.240
but also gently realistic about
how hard it can be to bring them off.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.400
"Backpfeifengesicht"

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.200
A face that's begging to be slapped

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.080
Generosity towards others is key but German
is bracing and frank enough to acknowledge

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.480
that there are also moments
when it's simply more honest to realize

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.700
we may have come face to face with a dickhead.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.320
"Ruinenlust"

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.780
This word shows German
at its most delightfully fetishistic and particular

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.560
meaning the delight one can feel at seeing ruins.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.080
Collapsed palaces and the rubble of temples put anxieties about the present into perspective

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.200
and induce a pleasing melancholy
at the passage of all things.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.880
"Kummerspeck"

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.180
Literally, "sorrow fat". A word that frankly recognizes
how often, when one is deeply sad,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.600
there is simply nothing more consoling
to do than to head for the kitchen and eat.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.160
"Fremdsch채men"

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.920
A word full of empathy that captures 
the agony one can feel at somebody else's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.040
embarassing, misfortune, or failing.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.340
A capacity to feel Fremdsch채men
is a high moral achievement

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.520
and is at the root of kindness.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.900
"Weltschmerz"

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.540
Literally, "world sadness". A word that acknowledges that we are sometimes sad, not about this or that thing,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.160
but about the whole basis of existence.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.780
The presence of the word indicates a culture
that isn't forcely cheerful, but takes tragedy as a given.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.940
It is immensely reassuring to be able to tell a friend

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.740
that one is presently lined under the duvet,
suffering from Weltschmerz.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.920
"Schadenfreude"

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.480
We're meant to be sad when others fail, but German will wisely accept that we often feel happiness, "Freude"

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.760
at the misfortunes, the "Schaden", of others.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.920
That isn't because we're mean,
we just feel deeply reassured

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.460
when we see confirmation that life is as hard
for other people as it is for us.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.340
We can thank German for having so many
of the right words to bring dignity

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.940
to our troubles and hopes.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.080
Learning languages, ultimately,
has little to do with discovering the world per se

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.080
It's about acquiring tools to help us get
a clearer grasp on the elusive parts of ourselves.
