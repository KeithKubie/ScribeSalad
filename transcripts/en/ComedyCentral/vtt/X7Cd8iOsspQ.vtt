00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.370
AND WE JUST BOUGHT
OUR FIRST HOME.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.138
SO WE WENT TO SCREWS.
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:07.140
- SWEETHEART, WHAT IS IT
THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR AGAIN?

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.442
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.077
- TED AND GWEN SAID THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR LIGHT BULBS,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.845
BUT I COULD TELL BY
THE VACANT LOOK IN THEIR EYES

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.714
THAT THEY WANTED
SOMETHING MORE.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.549
ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING
TO BUILD A SECRET ROOM?

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.051
- YES.
- NO.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.253
both: YES.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.522
[laughter]
- GREAT. FOLLOW ME.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.690
- JOE WAS AMAZING.
JUST SO HELPFUL.

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:25.092
SEE, HE HELPED US BUILD
A SECRET ROOM

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.560
THAT WE COULD REALLY
GROW WITH.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.362
I ALWAYS IMAGINED HAVING,
LIKE, A LOT OF CAPTIVES.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.797
- WHEREAS I HAD ONLY EVER
ENVISIONED JUST ONE CAPTIVE.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.599
- [chuckles]
WELL, I COME FROM A BIG FAMILY.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.868
- THEY WERE ALL MOLESTED.
- HEY...

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.436
WE MOLESTED EACH OTHER.
- OH--

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.071
- I WAS MOLESTED
AS A CHILD TOO,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.107
SO I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT
THEY WERE GOING AFTER.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.408
- IT'S SOUNDPROOF?
- UH-HUH.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.010
THERE'S ALSO A HANDLE
ON IT.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.645
- JOE WAS AMAZING ABOUT
ALL THE FINE DETAILS

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.213
AND PERSONAL TOUCHES

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.381
THAT WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF ON OUR OWN.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.615
- YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE,
DIRTY BLANKETS

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.284
TO MAKE THE PLACE LOOK SICK.
- MM-HMM.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.818
OR A DOOR THAT LEADS
TO NOWHERE.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.287
- ALL AT SCREWS'
EVERYDAY LOW PRICES.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.189
- ONE OF OUR FAVORITE THINGS
ABOUT JOE WAS THAT

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.524
HIS ETHNICITY
WAS NICE AND AMBIGUOUS.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.626
- LIKE YOU COULD
CUT HIM UP AND EAT HIM,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.128
AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE THE ORIGINS

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.496
OF THAT MEAT WAS FROM.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.097
- BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
YEAH, EXOTIC.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.799
- MM-HMM.
- IN A REALLY COOL WAY.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.434
- YEAH.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.570
- I'M FROM THE PACIFIC ISLANDS.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.406
ALL ALONG THIS BACK PART HERE--

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.807
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:15.576
I DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH VENTILATION
IN HERE.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.511
- SHUT YOUR PIG MOUTH!

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:21.782
- HEY. COME ON.
LET ME OUT OF HERE.
