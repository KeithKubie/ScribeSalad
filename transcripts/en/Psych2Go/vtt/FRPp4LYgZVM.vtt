00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.960
Being an old soul is hard. However, this is often overlooked because we're so good at internalizing our conflicts.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.320
To gain a better understanding of what an old soul is, you can watch our previous video, 10 Signs You're an Old Soul.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.120
It takes courage to be different from the crowd, and the path isn't necessarily easy.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.140
These are ten difficulties old souls can relate to.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.080
Number one: you're marginalized.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
Society doesn't know how you operate and because of that, they think you're overwhelmingly different.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.140
People don't always know how to handle differences, so instead of attempting to understand you, they ignore you.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.540
Being marginalized isn't actually a reflection of who you are, but a reflection of the fears of those who separate you from themselves.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.500
Number two: you're misunderstood.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.660
It's like you speak a completely different language from others. You feel like you have to explain yourself a little more because people don't understand where you're coming from.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.880
What you think is truthful and significant might not mean anything to others.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.420
To convey your thoughts and ideas, try using a creative outlet, such as illustration or photography, which are great methods of indirect communication.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.340
Number three: you have more existential crises than the average person.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.420
What happens when life gives you lemons? You're exactly the type of person to ponder over such questions and, consequently, you overthink.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.820
You start to become unaware of what life has to offer and lose yourself within that.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.500
On one hand, you have incredible insight and wisdom but, on the other, it might be downright chaos.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.480
Instead of drowning in your thoughts, let things happen in moderation and find your stability.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.880
Number four: your need for space can drive people away from you.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.160
Space is essential for you, and when you demand it, the people closest to you might take it the wrong way, creating massive misunderstandings.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.120
During such situations make sure to find a way to compromise.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.820
Number five: you feel lonely.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.700
With all the misjudgments you face, and the difficulties you go through, it can get lonely from the view up top, and you never really grow out of it.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.720
Loneliness follows you everywhere you go. Mostly because wisdom and a certain degree of isolation always go hand-in-hand.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.760
Number six: it's hard to find people similar to you.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.980
People often find you boring because you don't like hitting the bar like a normal young adult, or you'd rather stay in and watch a movie with a hot cup of tea instead of going out to a party.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.580
You struggle to find others who share the same, relaxing hobbies.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.080
Number seven: love seems impossible.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.220
The dating pool seems small and dim when you struggle to talk to a majority of the people available. As a result, you feel cynical when it comes to love.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.300
Making connections just doesn't seem worth it half the time, especially if you feel more rejected than accepted.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.000
If you want to find and build something real and long-lasting, you have to be honest about what you want.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.760
Number eight: your philosophical tendencies can be overwhelming.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.040
Your mind is constantly connecting every piece of information to one another.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.320
It's called webbed thinking, and while being able to create limitless possibilities sounds genius, your thoughts can became a mess, leaving you tangled and overwhelmed.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.060
Number nine: you forgive things to easily.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.920
You see things and understand what peoples' intentions are, never reading things just on a surface level

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:49.580
You dig and find reasons for why people are the way they are and, consequently, you have a great capacity to forgive, even for those who don't necessarily deserve it.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.520
Number ten: it's hard for you to participate in life.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.540
Instead of participating in events, you'd rather observe and analyze on the sidelines because it allows for your mind to roam.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.140
And as someone who values space, it's hard not to indulge in that.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.500
As it becomes a habit for you to watch instead of do, you find it increasingly harder to join in.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
You know you're missing out, but it's also hard to shut off your judgments against yourself.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.560
Remember, you're a work in progress, it's okay to be scared, but don't let yourself stop yourself from doing what you want.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.660
Do you consider yourself an old soul? If so, have you ever experienced any of these difficulties or have tips on how to overcome them?
