00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.130
The basic pairing rules of DNA, A to T and C to G, are determined by the

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.420
chemistry of these nitrogenous bases. In the DNA world, a single strand

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.990
of DNA can have any sequence that

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.660
it wants, any order of deoxynucleotides with any

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.860
order of nitrogenous bases. But a double-stranded

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.170
DNA must have a complementary strand or pair

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.480
opposite to it that has the right matching

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
nitrogenous base across from it. A complementary strand

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.160
of DNA is just a DNA strand that base pairs with another. So for example, this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.310
strand on the left has a complementary strand

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.010
across from it and the DNA strand here

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.980
has a complementary strand across from it. We

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.210
either refer to this as a complementary strand or

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.040
just a complement. What I want you to do now

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.405
is see if you can figure out which of the four

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:01.560
single-stranded molecules of DNA would base pair or complement with this

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.580
single stranded DNA here at the bottom of the screen. Just

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.880
imagine that you could take this sequence of letters and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.780
place it right on top of this DNA molecule here. Go

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.220
ahead and select the answer that you think is best and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.380
remember if you need help you can just use the base

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920
pairing rules in the right hand corner of your screen.
