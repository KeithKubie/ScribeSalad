unusual one today people have been

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350
unusual one today people have been
 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.140
unusual one today people have been
sending in calculators for me to unbox

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
sending in calculators for me to unbox
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.390
sending in calculators for me to unbox
which is very sweet of them I think some

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
which is very sweet of them I think some
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.530
which is very sweet of them I think some
people have calculators they think

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
people have calculators they think
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.690
people have calculators they think
should be unboxed by a professional and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
should be unboxed by a professional and
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400
should be unboxed by a professional and
it's very consider of them to send them

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
it's very consider of them to send them
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.580
it's very consider of them to send them
in so I'm going to go for the record of

going to do the scientific calculator

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
going to do the scientific calculator
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.150
going to do the scientific calculator
with cover we're going to do the home

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
with cover we're going to do the home
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000

and office scientific calculator or we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
and office scientific calculator or we
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579
and office scientific calculator or we
will do the Wilko scientific calculator

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
will do the Wilko scientific calculator
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.969

yep it's the Wilko so let's get into

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
yep it's the Wilko so let's get into
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.910
yep it's the Wilko so let's get into
that one let's pop this thing open using

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
that one let's pop this thing open using
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.230

unboxing I mean you know I like my

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
unboxing I mean you know I like my
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460

specialist tools but sometimes you just

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
specialist tools but sometimes you just
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.100
specialist tools but sometimes you just
need a multi-tool for everything and we

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
need a multi-tool for everything and we
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340
need a multi-tool for everything and we
are in ok in no time for instructions in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
are in ok in no time for instructions in
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.149

a speed unboxing is it a cover yeah okay

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
a speed unboxing is it a cover yeah okay
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710
a speed unboxing is it a cover yeah okay
it is it all it's got a little stand

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
it is it all it's got a little stand
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.569
it is it all it's got a little stand
that's nice and let's fire it up so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
that's nice and let's fire it up so
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.850
that's nice and let's fire it up so
we'll do a simple test to open all the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
we'll do a simple test to open all the
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.310
we'll do a simple test to open all the
way around it's a root 2 equals x root 2

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320
way around it's a root 2 equals x root 2
 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.100
way around it's a root 2 equals x root 2
equals 2 it works ok you can see how

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
equals 2 it works ok you can see how
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889
equals 2 it works ok you can see how
someone saw the calculator and thought

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
someone saw the calculator and thought
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200
someone saw the calculator and thought
this this would be a good one to unboxed

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
this this would be a good one to unboxed
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.319
this this would be a good one to unboxed
at this what a drab little kit there's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
at this what a drab little kit there's
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880
at this what a drab little kit there's
very little going on here in this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
very little going on here in this
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800
very little going on here in this
particular calculator and so I don't

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
particular calculator and so I don't
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899
particular calculator and so I don't
think it wants any further tests I'm

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
think it wants any further tests I'm
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550
think it wants any further tests I'm
impressed that someone had the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
impressed that someone had the
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.700
impressed that someone had the
enthusiasm to send it in but I mean it's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
enthusiasm to send it in but I mean it's
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580
enthusiasm to send it in but I mean it's
just it's not it's it's it's no gak Co

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
just it's not it's it's it's no gak Co
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.830
just it's not it's it's it's no gak Co
is what I'm trying to say here so we'll

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
is what I'm trying to say here so we'll
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850
is what I'm trying to say here so we'll
pop that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
pop that
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130
pop that
in the not particularly exciting pile

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140

just this maybe that's seven and I'm

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:19.430
just this maybe that's seven and I'm
 

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.460
just this maybe that's seven and I'm
going to divide to 1/7 and then multiply

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:21.470
going to divide to 1/7 and then multiply
 

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.320
going to divide to 1/7 and then multiply
by seven again so there you are an
