I'm gonna point out as well here that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270
I'm gonna point out as well here that
 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.090
I'm gonna point out as well here that
you know looking at this main screen

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100
you know looking at this main screen
 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.070
you know looking at this main screen
here as well you can see that we've

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080
here as well you can see that we've
 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.140
here as well you can see that we've
actually got an action bar which is

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150
actually got an action bar which is
 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.230
actually got an action bar which is
which is good but in this case I think

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240
which is good but in this case I think
 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.940
which is good but in this case I think
actually would make a lot of sense to

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950
actually would make a lot of sense to
 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.370
actually would make a lot of sense to
have an action bar which was perhaps

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380
have an action bar which was perhaps
 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.000
have an action bar which was perhaps
translucent because you've kind of got

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010
translucent because you've kind of got
 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.400
translucent because you've kind of got
this whole screen effect here where it's

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410
this whole screen effect here where it's
 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.630
this whole screen effect here where it's
it's sort of this immersive thing

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640
it's sort of this immersive thing
 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.360
it's sort of this immersive thing
completely custom controls the action

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370
completely custom controls the action

bar almost looks a little bit sort of

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110
bar almost looks a little bit sort of
 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.740
bar almost looks a little bit sort of
plunked on top so perhaps changing the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
plunked on top so perhaps changing the
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.120
plunked on top so perhaps changing the
color of your action bar to match the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130
color of your action bar to match the
 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.920
color of your action bar to match the
background or have a translucent action

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930
background or have a translucent action
 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.140
background or have a translucent action
bar will be a solution yeah let's have a

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150
bar will be a solution yeah let's have a
 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.140
bar will be a solution yeah let's have a
look at the recipe screens as you can

preparation of the dish what I would
 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.409
preparation of the dish what I would
suggest is that when you have a tablet

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419
suggest is that when you have a tablet
 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.810
suggest is that when you have a tablet
right there are the most probable use

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820
right there are the most probable use
 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.480
right there are the most probable use
cases someone using your app in a

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490

kitchen I might be sitting 3 to 4 feet

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370
kitchen I might be sitting 3 to 4 feet
 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.330
kitchen I might be sitting 3 to 4 feet
away from the tablet to the font size

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340
away from the tablet to the font size
 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.730
away from the tablet to the font size
and as it stands it's kind of a little

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740
and as it stands it's kind of a little
 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.999
and as it stands it's kind of a little
bit too small right yeah it is it's a

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009
bit too small right yeah it is it's a
 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.779
bit too small right yeah it is it's a
little on time in reading the text

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789
little on time in reading the text
 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.890

exactly what you want to really have is

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900
exactly what you want to really have is
 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.840
exactly what you want to really have is
so that you can set up a tablet on your

so that you can set up a tablet on your
 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.340
so that you can set up a tablet on your
kitchen bench probably a little further

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350
kitchen bench probably a little further
 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.020
kitchen bench probably a little further
away from the food and as you know

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030
away from the food and as you know
 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.750
away from the food and as you know
sources of heat and then then you would

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760
sources of heat and then then you would
 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.310
sources of heat and then then you would
want otherwise and so you really want to

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320

it at least I can't find it hmm from

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240
it at least I can't find it hmm from
 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.540
it at least I can't find it hmm from
here and what's interesting is that for

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550
here and what's interesting is that for
 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.600
here and what's interesting is that for
each step you can go in and edit it

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610
each step you can go in and edit it
 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.310
each step you can go in and edit it
sometimes that's not you like to deviate

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320
sometimes that's not you like to deviate
 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.800
sometimes that's not you like to deviate
absolutely yeah there's no recipe I use

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810
absolutely yeah there's no recipe I use
 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.930
absolutely yeah there's no recipe I use
that I haven't modified slightly you

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940
that I haven't modified slightly you
 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.129
that I haven't modified slightly you
know what else would be really nice here

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.139
know what else would be really nice here
 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:39.390
know what else would be really nice here
I don't know if there's any support for

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400
I don't know if there's any support for
 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.010
I don't know if there's any support for
it but to have the ability to add

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020
it but to have the ability to add
 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.170
it but to have the ability to add
pictures for each step I find that's

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180
pictures for each step I find that's
 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.600
pictures for each step I find that's
really useful if it looks the way it's

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610
really useful if it looks the way it's
 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.219
really useful if it looks the way it's
supposed to have I've done things the

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:47.229
supposed to have I've done things the
 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:48.839
supposed to have I've done things the
right way like when they say Brown at

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:48.849
right way like when they say Brown at
 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:50.610
right way like when they say Brown at
how Brown is it's supposed to be those

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
how Brown is it's supposed to be those
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.500
how Brown is it's supposed to be those
sorts of things would be really nice so

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.510
sorts of things would be really nice so
 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.850
sorts of things would be really nice so
a picture of the finished product and

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
a picture of the finished product and
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.469
a picture of the finished product and
also a picture of each step that's a

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479
also a picture of each step that's a
 

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:56.420
also a picture of each step that's a
great suggestion

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.430
great suggestion
 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.159
great suggestion
now you can capture it for motivation

00:07:59.159 --> 00:07:59.169
now you can capture it for motivation
 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.779
now you can capture it for motivation
absolutely well this is what I would do

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:00.789
absolutely well this is what I would do
 

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:02.310
absolutely well this is what I would do
right I would I would do the recipe and

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:02.320
right I would I would do the recipe and
 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.810
right I would I would do the recipe and
I would take a photo of each step so

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:03.820
I would take a photo of each step so
 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.730
I would take a photo of each step so
that I was able to see the process of

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:05.740
that I was able to see the process of
 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.260
that I was able to see the process of
going through and potentially even the

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.270
going through and potentially even the
 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.140
going through and potentially even the
ability to add a video you know if I

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.150
ability to add a video you know if I
 

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.670
ability to add a video you know if I
record the whole thing of how it all

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680
record the whole thing of how it all
 

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.010
record the whole thing of how it all
went

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020
went
 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.480

we've got Roman grain so what do you

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.490
we've got Roman grain so what do you
 

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.950
we've got Roman grain so what do you
think Roman if you had a chance to have

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960
think Roman if you had a chance to have
 

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.060
think Roman if you had a chance to have
a look at this up with youth what are

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.070
a look at this up with youth what are
 

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.730
a look at this up with youth what are
your thoughts from a UI perspective so I

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:20.740
your thoughts from a UI perspective so I
 

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.860
your thoughts from a UI perspective so I
haven't had a chance to take a full look

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:22.870
haven't had a chance to take a full look
 

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.020
haven't had a chance to take a full look
but just from looking at what's we guys

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.030
but just from looking at what's we guys
 

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.570
but just from looking at what's we guys
are showing now kind of the same common

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.580
are showing now kind of the same common
 

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.810
are showing now kind of the same common
problems that we see everywhere are

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:30.820
problems that we see everywhere are
 

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.730
problems that we see everywhere are
showing up in this app and they're not

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:32.740
showing up in this app and they're not
 

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.140
showing up in this app and they're not
really problems I mean it's just you

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.150
really problems I mean it's just you
 

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.730
really problems I mean it's just you
know I think probably the lack of a

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:35.740
know I think probably the lack of a
 

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.980
know I think probably the lack of a
tablet optimized UI and we're in some

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:37.990
tablet optimized UI and we're in some
 

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.990
tablet optimized UI and we're in some
tablet

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000

one thing I wanted to mention was just

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:40.319
one thing I wanted to mention was just
 

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.829
one thing I wanted to mention was just
on the very home screen I guess the top

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839
on the very home screen I guess the top
 

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:45.170
on the very home screen I guess the top
level screen that had that kind of

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180
level screen that had that kind of
 

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.559
level screen that had that kind of
massive dashboard um I just wanted to

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:48.569
massive dashboard um I just wanted to
 

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:52.220
massive dashboard um I just wanted to
make a shout out for for I guess against

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.230
make a shout out for for I guess against
 

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.629
make a shout out for for I guess against
dashboards and using dashboards

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:53.639
dashboards and using dashboards
 

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:55.460
dashboards and using dashboards
especially on tablets

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:55.470
especially on tablets
 

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.990
especially on tablets
there are lots and lots of different

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000
there are lots and lots of different
 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.800
there are lots and lots of different
ways you can you know show show kind of

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:00.810
ways you can you know show show kind of
 

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.980
ways you can you know show show kind of
a top level screen and some of those

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:03.990
a top level screen and some of those
 

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.360
a top level screen and some of those
ways are actually listed in are the

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:05.370
ways are actually listed in are the
 

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.790
ways are actually listed in are the
design guidelines under the app

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800
design guidelines under the app
 

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.369
design guidelines under the app
structure pattern so I definitely

00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:10.379
structure pattern so I definitely
 

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:11.869
structure pattern so I definitely
recommend taking a look there to see how

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:11.879
recommend taking a look there to see how
 

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:13.699
recommend taking a look there to see how
you can get away from a dashboard you

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:13.709
you can get away from a dashboard you
 

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:14.900
you can get away from a dashboard you
don't necessarily have to you know

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:14.910
don't necessarily have to you know
 

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.019
don't necessarily have to you know
completely remove the dashboard but one

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:18.029
completely remove the dashboard but one
 

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:19.429
completely remove the dashboard but one
thing you could do is potentially kind

00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:19.439
thing you could do is potentially kind
 

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:21.949
thing you could do is potentially kind
of include content right there so when

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959
of include content right there so when
 

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:24.019
of include content right there so when
you're showing the the big icons or the

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:24.029
you're showing the the big icons or the
 

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:26.030
you're showing the the big icons or the
big buttons to get into a section show

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040
big buttons to get into a section show
 

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.619
big buttons to get into a section show
preview over the content that you're

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:27.629
preview over the content that you're
 

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:29.059
preview over the content that you're
about to see when you tap into the

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:29.069
about to see when you tap into the
 

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.590
about to see when you tap into the
section so just one of the features

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600
section so just one of the features
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.740
section so just one of the features
alright some pictures and all the dishes

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:33.750
alright some pictures and all the dishes
 

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.199
alright some pictures and all the dishes
that you're trying to prepare that's

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:36.209

great
 

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:40.639
great
so let's let's go back to recipes and as

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:40.649
so let's let's go back to recipes and as
 

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:42.650
so let's let's go back to recipes and as
I was testing this application I tried

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660
I was testing this application I tried
 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.829
I was testing this application I tried
to add a new dish yeah at first I

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839
to add a new dish yeah at first I
 

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.720
to add a new dish yeah at first I
thought okay this at button represented

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:47.730
thought okay this at button represented
 

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.379
thought okay this at button represented
but it in said that's an easy recipe

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:51.389
but it in said that's an easy recipe
 

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:53.869
but it in said that's an easy recipe
right right but instead what I was

00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:53.879
right right but instead what I was
 

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:56.240
right right but instead what I was
looking for is hidden in the overflow

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.250
looking for is hidden in the overflow
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.730
looking for is hidden in the overflow
menu oh I say new recipes so I think it

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740
menu oh I say new recipes so I think it
 

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.819
menu oh I say new recipes so I think it
would be great you know to expose this

00:10:01.819 --> 00:10:01.829
would be great you know to expose this
 

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:04.879
would be great you know to expose this
feature on the action bar of their space

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:04.889
feature on the action bar of their space
 

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.559
feature on the action bar of their space
yeah definitely and I think there is

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:06.569
yeah definitely and I think there is
 

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.389
yeah definitely and I think there is
plenty of space on the action bar for

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399
plenty of space on the action bar for
 

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.129
plenty of space on the action bar for
that add recipe seems like it would be

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:10.139
that add recipe seems like it would be
 

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:12.530
that add recipe seems like it would be
one of the main features I wouldn't want

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540
one of the main features I wouldn't want
 

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.759
one of the main features I wouldn't want
to do within an app notice absolutely

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:15.769
to do within an app notice absolutely
 

00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:19.850
to do within an app notice absolutely
and let's have a quick look at shopping

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860
and let's have a quick look at shopping
 

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.910
and let's have a quick look at shopping
list so what you can have various

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920
list so what you can have various
 

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.410
list so what you can have various
shopping this associated with the

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420
shopping this associated with the
 

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.150
shopping this associated with the
recipes that we looked at so let's say

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160
recipes that we looked at so let's say
 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.710
recipes that we looked at so let's say
you've decided on what to cook for

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720
you've decided on what to cook for
 

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.720

dinner then you can quickly trance
 

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.030
dinner then you can quickly trance
transfer the list of items into your

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040
transfer the list of items into your
 

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.480

like is it a big thing for me and I also

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:47.910
like is it a big thing for me and I also
 

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.370

say that you know for this kind of apps

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380
say that you know for this kind of apps
 

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.980
say that you know for this kind of apps
where initially there's a bunch of data

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:51.990
where initially there's a bunch of data
 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.990
where initially there's a bunch of data
entry hmm you might want to think of

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000
entry hmm you might want to think of
 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.900
entry hmm you might want to think of
ways to make it easier for developed for

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:56.910
ways to make it easier for developed for
 

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.030
ways to make it easier for developed for
users right because I imagine if it

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040
users right because I imagine if it
 

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.550
users right because I imagine if it
becomes too cumbersome to enter a lot of

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560
becomes too cumbersome to enter a lot of
 

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.650
becomes too cumbersome to enter a lot of
text that you experience a lot of

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660
text that you experience a lot of
 

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.510
text that you experience a lot of
drop-offs so you may think of ways to

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:05.520
drop-offs so you may think of ways to
 

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.660
drop-offs so you may think of ways to
you know maybe support up scanning for

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:08.670
you know maybe support up scanning for
 

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.040
you know maybe support up scanning for
barcodes and stuff like that that

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.050
barcodes and stuff like that that
 

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.450
barcodes and stuff like that that
wouldn't make it a lot easier for

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:11.460
wouldn't make it a lot easier for
 

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.400
wouldn't make it a lot easier for
different for users absolutely or

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:13.410
different for users absolutely or
 

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.570
different for users absolutely or
alternatively you can have a lot more

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:16.580
alternatively you can have a lot more
 

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.740
alternatively you can have a lot more
pre-populated items and what people use

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:18.750
pre-populated items and what people use
 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.240
pre-populated items and what people use
just to pick and choose from an existing

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.250
just to pick and choose from an existing
 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.340
just to pick and choose from an existing
list that would be that will make the

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.350
list that would be that will make the
 

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.620
list that would be that will make the
user experience better yeah in fact you

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:24.630
user experience better yeah in fact you
 

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.390
user experience better yeah in fact you
know thinking is through actually the

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:26.400
know thinking is through actually the
 

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.740
know thinking is through actually the
way I would start to use this so right

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:27.750
way I would start to use this so right
 

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.050
way I would start to use this so right
now at home I have this big folder with

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060
now at home I have this big folder with
 

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.640
now at home I have this big folder with
recipes which I've pulled out of

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:31.650
recipes which I've pulled out of
 

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.650
recipes which I've pulled out of
newspapers and photocopied from people

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660
newspapers and photocopied from people
 

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.960
newspapers and photocopied from people
and printed out emails and so I'm

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:35.970
and printed out emails and so I'm
 

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.000
and printed out emails and so I'm
probably not going to want to enter all

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.010
probably not going to want to enter all
 

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.370
probably not going to want to enter all
of that in straightaway so my first step

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380
of that in straightaway so my first step
 

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.810
of that in straightaway so my first step
would just be to photograph each one

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820
would just be to photograph each one
 

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.390
would just be to photograph each one
just give it a title and then scan in

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:44.400
just give it a title and then scan in
 

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.650
just give it a title and then scan in
that the picture and then I can always

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660
that the picture and then I can always
 

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.630
that the picture and then I can always
go through and actually sort of populate

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:47.640
go through and actually sort of populate
 

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.930
go through and actually sort of populate
the field separately later we're getting

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940
the field separately later we're getting
 

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.820
the field separately later we're getting
the wrap we have 39 35 seconds left

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:52.830
the wrap we have 39 35 seconds left
 

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.680
the wrap we have 39 35 seconds left
today and we have a new probably haven't

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.690
today and we have a new probably haven't
 

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.300
today and we have a new probably haven't
got our gong to so we want to run out

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:56.310
got our gong to so we want to run out
 

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.060
got our gong to so we want to run out
the time just so we can have the Gong go

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.070
the time just so we can have the Gong go
 

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.430
the time just so we can have the Gong go
it's very important

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440
it's very important
 

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.280
it's very important
I don't think we should actually just

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.290
I don't think we should actually just
 

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.430
I don't think we should actually just
wait 22 seconds it goes off but let's

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440
wait 22 seconds it goes off but let's
 

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.590
wait 22 seconds it goes off but let's
say so so we've got the categories here

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600
say so so we've got the categories here
 

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.950
say so so we've got the categories here
we've got everything else yeah it's

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:12.960
we've got everything else yeah it's
 

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.180

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.980
so one of the big kicks that I'm on at
the moment is trying to create apps that

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:30.990
the moment is trying to create apps that
 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.410
the moment is trying to create apps that
present a magical experience so apps

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420
present a magical experience so apps
 

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.760
present a magical experience so apps
that you're not really thinking about

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:34.770
that you're not really thinking about
 

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.440

them running on a phone you're not
 

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.850
them running on a phone you're not
thinking about the internet connection

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860
thinking about the internet connection
 

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.050
thinking about the internet connection
you're not thinking about anything other

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060
you're not thinking about anything other
 

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.700
you're not thinking about anything other
than the functionality that they provide

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:40.710
than the functionality that they provide
 

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.860
than the functionality that they provide
so that's kind of the basis around which

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:42.870
so that's kind of the basis around which
 

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.000
so that's kind of the basis around which
I'm going to be providing some of this

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.010
I'm going to be providing some of this
 

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.070
I'm going to be providing some of this
feedback so if you look on the getting

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.080
feedback so if you look on the getting
 

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.200
feedback so if you look on the getting
started guide right here we're asked to

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.210
started guide right here we're asked to
 

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.300
started guide right here we're asked to
choose our primary content language we

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:50.310
choose our primary content language we
 

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.550

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.170
network associated with it and an option
 

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.780
network associated with it and an option
to send develop a usage statistics and

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:56.790
to send develop a usage statistics and
 

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.540
to send develop a usage statistics and
this is all fair enough but the problem

00:14:59.540 --> 00:14:59.550
this is all fair enough but the problem
 

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.490
this is all fair enough but the problem
with it is that straight away I open the

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500
with it is that straight away I open the
 

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.720
with it is that straight away I open the
app and I'm presented with all of these

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:02.730
app and I'm presented with all of these
 

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.360
app and I'm presented with all of these
all of this text all these choices so

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.370
all of this text all these choices so
 

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.790
all of this text all these choices so
generally speaking I find it much better

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800
generally speaking I find it much better
 

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.170
generally speaking I find it much better
if you just load up the app and it

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180
if you just load up the app and it
 

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.850
if you just load up the app and it
straightaway dumps you into whatever it

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860
straightaway dumps you into whatever it
 

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.130
straightaway dumps you into whatever it
is that the app is supposed to do so I

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.140
is that the app is supposed to do so I
 

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.410
is that the app is supposed to do so I
would suggest to the developers here too

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420
would suggest to the developers here too
 

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.510
would suggest to the developers here too
actually see if you can remove all of

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.520
actually see if you can remove all of
 

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.030
actually see if you can remove all of
this on startup so that you're just able

this on startup so that you're just able
 

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.450
this on startup so that you're just able
to so you're just able to get straight

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:23.460
to so you're just able to get straight
 

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.520
to so you're just able to get straight
into the gear a little concern but what

yeah I totally agree in fact if we

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620
yeah I totally agree in fact if we
 

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.980
yeah I totally agree in fact if we
dismiss this here we get exactly that we

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:09.990
dismiss this here we get exactly that we
 

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.530
dismiss this here we get exactly that we
get this massive pain of emptiness which

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540
get this massive pain of emptiness which

so I've added a bunch of shows and you

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:21.510
so I've added a bunch of shows and you
 

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.420
so I've added a bunch of shows and you
can see straight away that they're

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:23.430
can see straight away that they're
 

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.010
can see straight away that they're
already presenting something better here

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020
already presenting something better here
 

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.570
already presenting something better here
so once you go to the shows that you've

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580
so once you go to the shows that you've
 

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.850
so once you go to the shows that you've
already included you get the you know

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860

that grid view which Roman was talking

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:30.630
that grid view which Roman was talking
 

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.570
that grid view which Roman was talking
about but even here I'd say like there's

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580
about but even here I'd say like there's
 

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.850
about but even here I'd say like there's
an opportunity here to use that space

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860
an opportunity here to use that space
 

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.470
an opportunity here to use that space
more to use bigger assets so this

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480
more to use bigger assets so this
 

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.810
more to use bigger assets so this
becomes a really visual experience you

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820
becomes a really visual experience you
 

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.060
becomes a really visual experience you
know having the the images associated

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.070
know having the the images associated
 

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.830
know having the the images associated
with these shows is I think a really

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840
with these shows is I think a really
 

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.620
with these shows is I think a really
powerful thing and so I would you know I

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:45.630
powerful thing and so I would you know I
 

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.570
powerful thing and so I would you know I
would consider making that a much bigger

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580
would consider making that a much bigger
 

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.780
would consider making that a much bigger
part of each grid item very much along

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:50.790
part of each grid item very much along
 

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.150
part of each grid item very much along

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.240
so the point here is is that it's
telling us when or when our next episode

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.250
telling us when or when our next episode
 

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.180

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.010
least an hour so later yeah the Olympics
 

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.970
least an hour so later yeah the Olympics
yeah yeah well the Olympics it's not by

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980
yeah yeah well the Olympics it's not by
 

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.590
yeah yeah well the Olympics it's not by
choice but this is not the forum for me

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600
choice but this is not the forum for me
 

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.210
choice but this is not the forum for me
to rant because I don't have enough time

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220
to rant because I don't have enough time
 

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.160
to rant because I don't have enough time
to explain exactly how I feel about the

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:25.170
to explain exactly how I feel about the
 

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.900
to explain exactly how I feel about the
NBC coverage I'll be just pointing out

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:26.910
NBC coverage I'll be just pointing out
 

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:32.420
NBC coverage I'll be just pointing out
that similarity so yeah yeah the other

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:32.430
that similarity so yeah yeah the other
 

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.920
that similarity so yeah yeah the other
thing which I have to say about this app

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:33.930
thing which I have to say about this app
 

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.020
thing which I have to say about this app
so like I say Roman suggested this to me

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.030
so like I say Roman suggested this to me
 

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.810
so like I say Roman suggested this to me
and I you know I use it a lot now but

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820
and I you know I use it a lot now but
 

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.980
and I you know I use it a lot now but
one of the things I struggled with when

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:39.990
one of the things I struggled with when
 

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.020
one of the things I struggled with when
I first started the app is that it

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.030
I first started the app is that it
 

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.700
I first started the app is that it
wasn't immediately obvious to me how

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:43.710
wasn't immediately obvious to me how
 

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.580
wasn't immediately obvious to me how
everything worked so the plus icon being

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:46.590
everything worked so the plus icon being
 

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.460
everything worked so the plus icon being
ads show you know it wasn't immediately

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:49.470
ads show you know it wasn't immediately
 

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.930
ads show you know it wasn't immediately
obvious to me that that's what I was

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940
obvious to me that that's what I was
 

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.940
obvious to me that that's what I was
going to do you know I didn't

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:52.950
going to do you know I didn't
 

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.280
going to do you know I didn't
necessarily understand the workflow and

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:55.290
necessarily understand the workflow and
 

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.300
necessarily understand the workflow and
so I think that's something which would

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.310
so I think that's something which would
 

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.130
so I think that's something which would
be really great to be simplified and

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140
be really great to be simplified and
 

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.230
be really great to be simplified and
better explained and I think sort of

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240
better explained and I think sort of
 

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.730
better explained and I think sort of
giving me that list of suggestions right

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740
giving me that list of suggestions right
 

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.950
giving me that list of suggestions right
off the bat is going to help but sort of

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960
off the bat is going to help but sort of
 

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.690
off the bat is going to help but sort of
sure helped me through the workflow make

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700
sure helped me through the workflow make
 

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.040
sure helped me through the workflow make
it more obvious what I need to do at

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.050
it more obvious what I need to do at
 

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.690
it more obvious what I need to do at
each point and that will make it easier

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700
each point and that will make it easier
 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.460
each point and that will make it easier
for me to use all the features and in

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:10.470
for me to use all the features and in
 

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.620
for me to use all the features and in
the action body have a mix of tacks and

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:12.630
the action body have a mix of tacks and
 

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.180
the action body have a mix of tacks and
icons for any action items so maybe they

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:17.190
icons for any action items so maybe they
 

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.590
icons for any action items so maybe they
can go this so this is actually a

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600
can go this so this is actually a
 

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.740
can go this so this is actually a
combined activity with a clock icon in

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:21.750
combined activity with a clock icon in
 

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.420
combined activity with a clock icon in
this search I yeah it does have the time

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:23.430
this search I yeah it does have the time
 

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.360
this search I yeah it does have the time
in little vertical separators actually

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.370
in little vertical separators actually
 

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.730
in little vertical separators actually
this is missing there is a missing

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740
this is missing there is a missing
 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.830
this is missing there is a missing
vertical separator between plus and

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840
vertical separator between plus and
 

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.500
vertical separator between plus and
activity which is really confusing right

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:33.510
activity which is really confusing right
 

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.700
activity which is really confusing right
so it looks like it's the same thing

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:34.710
so it looks like it's the same thing
 

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.500
so it looks like it's the same thing
yeah it wasn't apparent to me that the

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:36.510
yeah it wasn't apparent to me that the
 

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.690
yeah it wasn't apparent to me that the
clock icon actually represent it's tied

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700
clock icon actually represent it's tied
 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.680
clock icon actually represent it's tied
to the activity hmmm tax search okay so

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:42.690
to the activity hmmm tax search okay so
 

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.150
to the activity hmmm tax search okay so
it's the right search icon so I mean

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:44.160
it's the right search icon so I mean
 

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.770
it's the right search icon so I mean
generally speaking they've done things

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780
generally speaking they've done things
 

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.780
generally speaking they've done things
well but I'd also be really cautious

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:47.790
well but I'd also be really cautious
 

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.280
well but I'd also be really cautious
about things like your settings menu

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:49.290
about things like your settings menu
 

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.190
about things like your settings menu
where there are a lot of things here

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200
where there are a lot of things here
 

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.630
where there are a lot of things here
you know advance and everything else you

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640
you know advance and everything else you
 

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.159
you know advance and everything else you
may consider so this is actually using

00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:55.169
may consider so this is actually using
 

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:57.110
may consider so this is actually using
the old preference activities rather

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120
the old preference activities rather
 

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.330
the old preference activities rather
than the newer preference fragments so

00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340
than the newer preference fragments so
 

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.409
than the newer preference fragments so
there are a few options that you have

00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419
there are a few options that you have
 

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.570
there are a few options that you have
here to actually separate things into

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580
here to actually separate things into
 

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.889
here to actually separate things into
categories and make it a little bit

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:03.899
categories and make it a little bit
 

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:06.350
categories and make it a little bit
easier to dissect so I'd want to have

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360
easier to dissect so I'd want to have
 

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.899
easier to dissect so I'd want to have
things like advanced and more almost

00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:08.909
things like advanced and more almost
 

00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:10.610
things like advanced and more almost
often a separate category so it's not

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620
often a separate category so it's not
 

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.289
often a separate category so it's not
sort of confusing the rest of it because

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299
sort of confusing the rest of it because
 

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:14.450
sort of confusing the rest of it because
this is a little bit intimidating you've

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460
this is a little bit intimidating you've
 

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.769
this is a little bit intimidating you've
been using a longer than I have Raymond

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:15.779
been using a longer than I have Raymond
 

00:22:15.779 --> 00:22:17.389
been using a longer than I have Raymond
do you have any particular suggestions

00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:17.399
do you have any particular suggestions
 

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:18.889
do you have any particular suggestions
that you'd like to point out about what

00:22:18.889 --> 00:22:18.899
that you'd like to point out about what
 

00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:20.509
that you'd like to point out about what
they do well or what they could do a

00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:20.519
they do well or what they could do a
 

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:22.759
they do well or what they could do a
little bit better yeah I think I mean

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:22.769
little bit better yeah I think I mean
 

00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:26.180
little bit better yeah I think I mean
then before I think when this tab just

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.190
then before I think when this tab just
 

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.980
then before I think when this tab just
came out it was using the default

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:27.990
came out it was using the default
 

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.509
came out it was using the default
payment and you know a lot of my

00:22:29.509 --> 00:22:29.519
payment and you know a lot of my
 

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:31.070
payment and you know a lot of my
comments are visual so this would be

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080
comments are visual so this would be
 

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.430
comments are visual so this would be
it's a visual feedback but before I

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440
it's a visual feedback but before I
 

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.440
it's a visual feedback but before I
guess a couple months ago this app was

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.450
guess a couple months ago this app was
 

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.509
guess a couple months ago this app was
using default stock holo theme so

00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:38.519
using default stock holo theme so
 

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:40.580
using default stock holo theme so
everything was kind of hollow blue and

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:40.590
everything was kind of hollow blue and
 

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.009
everything was kind of hollow blue and
everything and that was it was good I

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:43.019
everything and that was it was good I
 

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:45.019
everything and that was it was good I
think that you know obviously you do

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:45.029
think that you know obviously you do
 

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:47.450
think that you know obviously you do
want to modify you want to brand it a

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460
want to modify you want to brand it a
 

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.299
want to modify you want to brand it a
little bit in this case I feel like the

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:50.309
little bit in this case I feel like the
 

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:52.460
little bit in this case I feel like the
branding is you know kind of that neon

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.470
branding is you know kind of that neon
 

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.129
branding is you know kind of that neon
purple hmm it doesn't really mesh all

00:22:55.129 --> 00:22:55.139
purple hmm it doesn't really mesh all
 

00:22:55.139 --> 00:22:57.470
purple hmm it doesn't really mesh all
that well with the rest of the holo UI

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480
that well with the rest of the holo UI
 

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.230
that well with the rest of the holo UI
the holo style and so for example all

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240
the holo style and so for example all
 

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.450
the holo style and so for example all
the window backgrounds are using the

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460
the window backgrounds are using the
 

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.759
the window backgrounds are using the
default kind of hollow gradient from

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:04.769
default kind of hollow gradient from
 

00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:07.519
default kind of hollow gradient from
dark from I guess black to like a dark

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:07.529
dark from I guess black to like a dark
 

00:23:07.529 --> 00:23:11.060
dark from I guess black to like a dark
gray and then the non purple on top of

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.070
gray and then the non purple on top of
 

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.950
gray and then the non purple on top of
that doesn't seem to be in mesh well so

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960
that doesn't seem to be in mesh well so
 

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.480
that doesn't seem to be in mesh well so
what I would do is I would probably go

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:14.490
what I would do is I would probably go
 

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.730
what I would do is I would probably go
through and and clean up some of the UI

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740
through and and clean up some of the UI
 

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.889
through and and clean up some of the UI
I feel like there's some parts that are

00:23:18.889 --> 00:23:18.899
I feel like there's some parts that are
 

00:23:18.899 --> 00:23:20.629
I feel like there's some parts that are
really remnants of the default holo

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:20.639
really remnants of the default holo
 

00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:22.759
really remnants of the default holo
style I'm sorry just make sure to kind

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:22.769
style I'm sorry just make sure to kind
 

00:23:22.769 --> 00:23:25.129

of either customize more dock and

00:23:25.129 --> 00:23:25.139
of either customize more dock and
 

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:28.279
of either customize more dock and
branded kind of custom UI isn't as great

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:28.289
branded kind of custom UI isn't as great
 

00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:29.870
branded kind of custom UI isn't as great
as it could be it's definitely better

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880
as it could be it's definitely better
 

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.039
as it could be it's definitely better
than a lot of the other apps that we've

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:31.049
than a lot of the other apps that we've
 

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:33.440
than a lot of the other apps that we've
seen but that could be improved another

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:33.450
seen but that could be improved another
 

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.110
seen but that could be improved another
thing is this is very specific but when

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120
thing is this is very specific but when
 

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.360
thing is this is very specific but when
you get into an episode of a show

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:38.370
you get into an episode of a show
 

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.250
you get into an episode of a show
there's actions at the top right like

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260
there's actions at the top right like
 

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.500
there's actions at the top right like
search and favor and share and there's

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:42.510
search and favor and share and there's
 

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.480
search and favor and share and there's
actions like right in the middle of the

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:44.490
actions like right in the middle of the
 

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.100
actions like right in the middle of the
screen mm-hmm

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.110
screen mm-hmm
 

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.090
screen mm-hmm
yeah we're checking etc yeah I find that

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100
yeah we're checking etc yeah I find that
 

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.950
yeah we're checking etc yeah I find that
a little strange and I think this kind

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960
a little strange and I think this kind
 

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.509
a little strange and I think this kind
of violates one of the core rules of

00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:53.519
of violates one of the core rules of
 

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:56.029
of violates one of the core rules of
putting things near the corners near the

00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039
putting things near the corners near the
 

00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:57.769
putting things near the corners near the
edges it's a little easier to find a

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:57.779
edges it's a little easier to find a
 

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:00.620
edges it's a little easier to find a
little easier to discover unless I mean

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.630
little easier to discover unless I mean
 

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.590
little easier to discover unless I mean
unless the inline actions are really

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600
unless the inline actions are really
 

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.940
unless the inline actions are really
obvious or in this case I feel like

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:04.950
obvious or in this case I feel like
 

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.629
obvious or in this case I feel like
they're very

00:24:05.629 --> 00:24:05.639
they're very
 

00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:08.089
they're very
under the content so one thing that I do

00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:08.099
under the content so one thing that I do
 

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:09.949
under the content so one thing that I do
really often is you know Marcus shale

00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:09.959
really often is you know Marcus shale
 

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:11.629
really often is you know Marcus shale
has watched and I feel like it's kind of

00:24:11.629 --> 00:24:11.639
has watched and I feel like it's kind of
 

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:14.839
has watched and I feel like it's kind of
buried in a sea of text so that's one

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:14.849
buried in a sea of text so that's one
 

00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:16.190
buried in a sea of text so that's one
thing that I would try to do you do have

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200
thing that I would try to do you do have
 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.079
thing that I would try to do you do have
actions that are in line make sure that

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:18.089
actions that are in line make sure that
 

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.849
actions that are in line make sure that
they're more visible that they're more

00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:19.859
they're more visible that they're more
 

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:23.060
they're more visible that they're more
prominent that they stand out you know

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.070
prominent that they stand out you know
 

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.829
prominent that they stand out you know
apart from the content that surrounds it

00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:24.839
apart from the content that surrounds it
 

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.839
apart from the content that surrounds it
because otherwise you know it may not be

00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:26.849
because otherwise you know it may not be
 

00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:29.509
because otherwise you know it may not be
obvious maybe difficult to locate yeah

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:29.519
obvious maybe difficult to locate yeah
 

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:31.459
obvious maybe difficult to locate yeah
totally agree and I think for a lot of

00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:31.469
totally agree and I think for a lot of
 

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:32.810
totally agree and I think for a lot of
those would make sense to just have them

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820
those would make sense to just have them
 

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.339
those would make sense to just have them
in the action bar because as you say

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:34.349
in the action bar because as you say
 

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:36.469
in the action bar because as you say
they kind of primary actions you know

00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:36.479
they kind of primary actions you know
 

00:24:36.479 --> 00:24:38.659
they kind of primary actions you know
having Watchers show so our Gong has

00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:38.669
having Watchers show so our Gong has
 

00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:39.859
having Watchers show so our Gong has
gone off so we're gonna have to move on

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:39.869
gone off so we're gonna have to move on
 

00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:41.899
gone off so we're gonna have to move on
but I think that's some some interesting

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:41.909
but I think that's some some interesting
 

00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:43.639
but I think that's some some interesting
advice I think the key things here is

00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:43.649
advice I think the key things here is
 

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:46.069
advice I think the key things here is
that you know visual visually I think

00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:46.079
that you know visual visually I think
 

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:47.269
that you know visual visually I think
they could do a lot more with what

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279
they could do a lot more with what
 

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:49.699
they could do a lot more with what
they've got more images more grades more

00:24:49.699 --> 00:24:49.709
they've got more images more grades more
 

00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:52.969
they've got more images more grades more
density of color and imagery and and

00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:52.979
density of color and imagery and and
 

00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:54.440
density of color and imagery and and
similarly as well I think just to give a

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.450
similarly as well I think just to give a
 

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.239
similarly as well I think just to give a
couple of examples from what Roman was

00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:56.249
couple of examples from what Roman was
 

00:24:56.249 --> 00:24:58.519
couple of examples from what Roman was
saying and hopefully he'll agree I think

00:24:58.519 --> 00:24:58.529
saying and hopefully he'll agree I think
 

00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:00.440
saying and hopefully he'll agree I think
in terms of customized branding if you

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.450
in terms of customized branding if you
 

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.209
in terms of customized branding if you
have a look at an app like geekbeat does

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:02.219
have a look at an app like geekbeat does
 

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:03.440
have a look at an app like geekbeat does
a really good job of that they have

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:03.450
a really good job of that they have
 

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.039
a really good job of that they have
their own custom color schemes which is

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:07.049
their own custom color schemes which is
 

00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:08.659
their own custom color schemes which is
throughout the entire app and it's

00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:08.669
throughout the entire app and it's
 

00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:12.139
throughout the entire app and it's
consistent and tasks tasks and tasks

00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:12.149
consistent and tasks tasks and tasks
 

00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:16.329
consistent and tasks tasks and tasks
free are a good example of which you are

00:25:16.329 --> 00:25:16.339
free are a good example of which you are
 

00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:59.070
free are a good example of which you are
actually using and paradigms

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080
 

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.470
anyway with it actually something about

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480
anyway with it actually something about
 

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:13.180
anyway with it actually something about
about it turns out there will lead you

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:13.190
about it turns out there will lead you
 

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:19.510
about it turns out there will lead you
to my quest and responded really quickly

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520
to my quest and responded really quickly
 

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.180
to my quest and responded really quickly
to that that sounds like maybe it should

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.190
to that that sounds like maybe it should
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.910
to that that sounds like maybe it should
have been an option rather it sounds

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:24.920
have been an option rather it sounds
 

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.410
have been an option rather it sounds
like something that's actually brings up

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:26.420
like something that's actually brings up
 

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.270
like something that's actually brings up
a really interesting point particularly

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.280
a really interesting point particularly
 

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.740
a really interesting point particularly
if you're creating an app which is quite

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:29.750
if you're creating an app which is quite
 

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.900
if you're creating an app which is quite
popular it's going to be impossible to

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:31.910
popular it's going to be impossible to
 

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.270
popular it's going to be impossible to
satisfy all of your users and so like me

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:34.280
satisfy all of your users and so like me
 

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.770
satisfy all of your users and so like me

the opposite opinions about the same app

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:37.460
the opposite opinions about the same app
 

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.580
the opposite opinions about the same app
and certainly once you get more than a

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:39.590
and certainly once you get more than a
 

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.230
and certainly once you get more than a
couple of thousand downloads you're

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240
couple of thousand downloads you're
 

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.270
couple of thousand downloads you're
going to have the same problem so one

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:43.280
going to have the same problem so one
 

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.830
going to have the same problem so one
thing you can do there is use analytics

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840
thing you can do there is use analytics
 

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.720
thing you can do there is use analytics
a lot to figure out how people are

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:46.730
a lot to figure out how people are
 

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.430
a lot to figure out how people are
actually using your app and and so you

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440
actually using your app and and so you
 

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.050
actually using your app and and so you
can do things like Institute options

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:50.060
can do things like Institute options
 

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.240
can do things like Institute options
where you have you know show images

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:52.250
where you have you know show images
 

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.710
where you have you know show images
don't show images and then find out

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720
don't show images and then find out
 

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.230
don't show images and then find out
which people are using more and try and

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240
which people are using more and try and
 

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.810
which people are using more and try and
build your user interface around that so

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:58.820
build your user interface around that so
 

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.680
build your user interface around that so
definitely something you want to

00:26:59.680 --> 00:26:59.690
definitely something you want to
 

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.600
definitely something you want to
consider is you know before doing those

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:01.610
consider is you know before doing those
 

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.640
consider is you know before doing those
radical changes is to think about how

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:03.650
radical changes is to think about how
 

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.680
radical changes is to think about how
people are using the app and give them

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:05.690
people are using the app and give them
 

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.880
people are using the app and give them
the option to pick one or the other

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:06.890
the option to pick one or the other
 

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:08.920
the option to pick one or the other
before deciding which is the the best

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:08.930
before deciding which is the the best
 

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.870
before deciding which is the the best
approach right or if you have resources

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880
approach right or if you have resources
 

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.130
approach right or if you have resources
and you know think about doing things

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:12.140
and you know think about doing things
 

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.670
and you know think about doing things
like a bee testing epsilen users react

reacting to use a comma dentist yeah

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.130
reacting to use a comma dentist yeah

cool all right so put your your next app

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520
cool all right so put your your next app
 

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.910
cool all right so put your your next app
the next the next tab is called

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:27.920
the next the next tab is called
 

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.780
the next the next tab is called

another app that consists of a lot of

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720
magically happen as though this was some
 

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.749
magically happen as though this was some
crazy magic box with the future which

00:30:59.749 --> 00:30:59.759
crazy magic box with the future which
 

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:01.340
crazy magic box with the future which
had every recipe in the world somehow

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:01.350
had every recipe in the world somehow
 

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.149
had every recipe in the world somehow
contained within it this looks nice the

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159
contained within it this looks nice the
 

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:07.549
contained within it this looks nice the
UI here is definitely it's pretty clean

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559
UI here is definitely it's pretty clean
 

00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:10.070
UI here is definitely it's pretty clean
hmm yeah well I'd like to repeat the

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080
hmm yeah well I'd like to repeat the
 

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.810
hmm yeah well I'd like to repeat the
comment the feedback that we can have

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820
comment the feedback that we can have
 

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.029
comment the feedback that we can have
bigger text bigger 10x but I think this

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039
bigger text bigger 10x but I think this
 

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.619
bigger text bigger 10x but I think this
particular app there's an option where

00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:15.629
particular app there's an option where
 

00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:17.269
particular app there's an option where
you can increase the font size which is

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279
you can increase the font size which is
 

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:21.529
you can increase the font size which is
great and there are different tabs like

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539
great and there are different tabs like
 

00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:25.940
great and there are different tabs like
recipe reviews and photos excellent of

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:25.950
recipe reviews and photos excellent of
 

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.609
recipe reviews and photos excellent of
various yeah the latency I don't know

00:31:28.609 --> 00:31:28.619
various yeah the latency I don't know
 

00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:30.769
various yeah the latency I don't know
what's going on here we fast Network

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779
what's going on here we fast Network
 

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:32.749
what's going on here we fast Network
yeah you definitely want to be

00:31:32.749 --> 00:31:32.759
yeah you definitely want to be
 

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:34.549
yeah you definitely want to be
downloading this photos I rather suspect

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559
downloading this photos I rather suspect
 

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.139
downloading this photos I rather suspect
that the photos are bigger than they

00:31:36.139 --> 00:31:36.149
that the photos are bigger than they
 

00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:37.879
that the photos are bigger than they
need to be and so you're pulling and I

00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:37.889
need to be and so you're pulling and I
 

00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:39.200
need to be and so you're pulling and I
noticed also that they all came in at

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.210
noticed also that they all came in at
 

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.419
noticed also that they all came in at
once here so again it's the same sort of

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:41.429
once here so again it's the same sort of
 

00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:43.639
once here so again it's the same sort of
ideas of making sure you download more

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:43.649
ideas of making sure you download more
 

00:31:43.649 --> 00:31:45.979
ideas of making sure you download more
than you you know download progressively

00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:45.989
than you you know download progressively
 

00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:47.389
than you you know download progressively
and and and make sure that you're

00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399
and and and make sure that you're
 

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:49.369
and and and make sure that you're
optimizing those dollars to pull down as

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:49.379
optimizing those dollars to pull down as
 

00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:51.529
optimizing those dollars to pull down as
little as you need now if you come in

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539
little as you need now if you come in
 

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:54.289
little as you need now if you come in
here make a comment here why of course

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299
here make a comment here why of course
 

00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:56.599
here make a comment here why of course
there is one thing I wanted to mention

00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:56.609
there is one thing I wanted to mention
 

00:31:56.609 --> 00:31:58.639
there is one thing I wanted to mention
it and this is just happening over and

00:31:58.639 --> 00:31:58.649
it and this is just happening over and
 

00:31:58.649 --> 00:32:00.049
it and this is just happening over and
over again I feel like every app we look

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059
over again I feel like every app we look
 

00:32:00.059 --> 00:32:02.899
over again I feel like every app we look
at on the tablet has this issue so white

00:32:02.899 --> 00:32:02.909
at on the tablet has this issue so white
 

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:05.539
at on the tablet has this issue so white
space there there's just it's it's a

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:05.549
space there there's just it's it's a
 

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:07.340
space there there's just it's it's a
much better use of white space than

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:07.350
much better use of white space than
 

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.810
much better use of white space than
there are lots of the other apps you've

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820
there are lots of the other apps you've
 

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.399
there are lots of the other apps you've
seen but still you know could be

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:10.409
seen but still you know could be
 

00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:11.930
seen but still you know could be
improved and like you guys mentioned

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940
improved and like you guys mentioned
 

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.479
improved and like you guys mentioned
you're increasing font sizes things like

00:32:14.479 --> 00:32:14.489
you're increasing font sizes things like
 

00:32:14.489 --> 00:32:16.909
you're increasing font sizes things like
that will help one trick that I find

00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919
that will help one trick that I find
 

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:19.519
that will help one trick that I find
useful when trying to optimize my white

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:19.529
useful when trying to optimize my white
 

00:32:19.529 --> 00:32:22.039
useful when trying to optimize my white
space is to take a screenshot of my app

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:22.049
space is to take a screenshot of my app
 

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:24.109
space is to take a screenshot of my app
as it is and start shrinking it down

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:24.119
as it is and start shrinking it down
 

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:26.210
as it is and start shrinking it down
gradually shrink it down so about like

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220
gradually shrink it down so about like
 

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.149
gradually shrink it down so about like
25% even 10% of its original size and

00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159
25% even 10% of its original size and
 

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:32.930
25% even 10% of its original size and
look at that right if you can still pick

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940
look at that right if you can still pick
 

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.950
look at that right if you can still pick
out your whites

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960
out your whites
 

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.510
out your whites
H from the text and if it's but if it

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520
H from the text and if it's but if it
 

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.399
H from the text and if it's but if it
doesn't look even if it doesn't seem

00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:37.409
doesn't look even if it doesn't seem
 

00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:38.810
doesn't look even if it doesn't seem
like there's kind of a good natural

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820
like there's kind of a good natural
 

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.570
like there's kind of a good natural
balance and in the the negative space

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580
balance and in the the negative space
 

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.460
balance and in the the negative space
and the actual you know text and content

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:43.470
and the actual you know text and content
 

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.440
and the actual you know text and content
then you probably have a whitespace

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.450
then you probably have a whitespace
 

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.570
then you probably have a whitespace
problem so you know try to think of how

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580
problem so you know try to think of how
 

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.460
problem so you know try to think of how
you can better fill out the white space

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:49.470
you can better fill out the white space
 

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.799
you can better fill out the white space
but don't tack in text into the white

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:51.809
but don't tack in text into the white
 

00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:54.139
but don't tack in text into the white
space white space is still important but

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:54.149
space white space is still important but
 

00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:55.820
space white space is still important but
make sure that it's balanced right so

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:55.830
make sure that it's balanced right so
 

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.440
make sure that it's balanced right so
that's just one trick you know shrink it

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:57.450
that's just one trick you know shrink it
 

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.149
that's just one trick you know shrink it
down and see if if there's something

00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159
down and see if if there's something
 

00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:00.860
down and see if if there's something
that seems wrong in that shrunken

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:00.870
that seems wrong in that shrunken
 

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.539
that seems wrong in that shrunken
version so I had a question actually

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:02.549
version so I had a question actually
 

00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:04.789
version so I had a question actually
related to that so if you if you have a

00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799
related to that so if you if you have a
 

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.370
related to that so if you if you have a
look at this you know this main search

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380
look at this you know this main search
 

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.960
look at this you know this main search
results page where you have all of these

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:08.970
results page where you have all of these
 

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.639
results page where you have all of these
things so you know I like that there's

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:10.649
things so you know I like that there's
 

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:12.169
things so you know I like that there's
lots of images there and then we do

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179
lots of images there and then we do
 

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:14.480
lots of images there and then we do
still have those gaps between now I know

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:14.490
still have those gaps between now I know
 

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.240
still have those gaps between now I know
that one of the UI trends that I've seen

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.250
that one of the UI trends that I've seen
 

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.159
that one of the UI trends that I've seen
a lot of lately is basically removing

00:33:19.159 --> 00:33:19.169
a lot of lately is basically removing
 

00:33:19.169 --> 00:33:21.440
a lot of lately is basically removing
all of those borders and having you know

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:21.450
all of those borders and having you know
 

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.240
all of those borders and having you know
basically zero margins between images

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:23.250
basically zero margins between images
 

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.430
basically zero margins between images
and while off pictures yeah is that

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440
and while off pictures yeah is that
 

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.460
and while off pictures yeah is that
something you think would work well here

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:27.470
something you think would work well here
 

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.289
something you think would work well here
yeah I think that can definitely work

00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299
yeah I think that can definitely work
 

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:33.289
yeah I think that can definitely work
well in a lot of cases in this case

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299
well in a lot of cases in this case
 

00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:34.610
well in a lot of cases in this case
since the background is white I

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620
since the background is white I
 

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.740
since the background is white I
personally find that having this kind of

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:36.750
personally find that having this kind of
 

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.039
personally find that having this kind of
zero pixel border like text overlaid on

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:40.049
zero pixel border like text overlaid on
 

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:42.019
zero pixel border like text overlaid on
top of images works really well

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:42.029
top of images works really well
 

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:43.760
top of images works really well
if the rest of the background I guess

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:43.770
if the rest of the background I guess
 

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.460
if the rest of the background I guess
the theme of the app is hollow dark or

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:46.470
the theme of the app is hollow dark or
 

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.490
the theme of the app is hollow dark or
just a darker theme otherwise the white

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500
just a darker theme otherwise the white
 

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.899
just a darker theme otherwise the white
will really stand out

00:33:50.899 --> 00:33:50.909
will really stand out
 

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:52.610
will really stand out
I'm essentially one thing that this time

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620
I'm essentially one thing that this time
 

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.470
I'm essentially one thing that this time
I want to consider doing is trying that

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480
I want to consider doing is trying that
 

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.360
I want to consider doing is trying that
you know trying to that wall of images

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.370
you know trying to that wall of images
 

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:57.799
you know trying to that wall of images
with very little space in between and

00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:57.809
with very little space in between and
 

00:33:57.809 --> 00:34:00.289
with very little space in between and
having the text overlaid on top of the

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:00.299
having the text overlaid on top of the
 

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:02.330
having the text overlaid on top of the
images but then try to switch the themes

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340
images but then try to switch the themes
 

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.639
images but then try to switch the themes
that the lesson gain is not so bright

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:04.649
that the lesson gain is not so bright
 

00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:06.799
that the lesson gain is not so bright
the contrast will be way too high if you

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:06.809
the contrast will be way too high if you
 

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:09.829
the contrast will be way too high if you
have that kind of all of images and

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839
have that kind of all of images and
 

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:10.760
have that kind of all of images and
that's the other thing I was gonna

the typography so you're missing a lot

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.250
the typography so you're missing a lot

Roboto light when you have text that's

00:37:59.490 --> 00:37:59.500
Roboto light when you have text that's
 

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.530
Roboto light when you have text that's
larger let's say like in the 30s or the

different weights of Roboto and and
 

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.000

so overall I quite like that it's not a
 

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.290
so overall I quite like that it's not a
standard action bar because it's too

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:40.300
standard action bar because it's too
 

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.000
standard action bar because it's too
high to be a standard action bar and

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.010
high to be a standard action bar and
 

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.320
high to be a standard action bar and

things here like this overflow menu is

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.190
things here like this overflow menu is
 

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.520
things here like this overflow menu is
clearly not a default the standard

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:47.530
clearly not a default the standard
 

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.160

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:55.810
of simulate that effect and so I don't
 

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.350
of simulate that effect and so I don't
know to me it it almost works in that

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:58.360
know to me it it almost works in that
 

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.820

theme they're going throughout but the
 

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.970

shortcut and I I've definitely done it

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:22.570
shortcut and I I've definitely done it
 

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.000
shortcut and I I've definitely done it
myself I've definitely just said I would

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.010
myself I've definitely just said I would
 

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:26.190
myself I've definitely just said I would
just make it a dialog hmm but definitely

a more a more complete more a better
 

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.200
a more a more complete more a better
solution would be just a fragment

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:31.210
solution would be just a fragment
 

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.600
solution would be just a fragment
lighting in or something of that nature

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:33.610

00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:14.280
there's very few times you actually want
to toast and dialog should be the same

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.290
to toast and dialog should be the same
 

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.299
to toast and dialog should be the same
you know that's when you really want to

00:48:15.299 --> 00:48:15.309
you know that's when you really want to

someone like that if you can figure out
 

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.799
someone like that if you can figure out
how that information can be the best

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:22.809
how that information can be the best
 

00:48:22.809 --> 00:48:26.010
how that information can be the best
displayed to your users so I think that

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:26.020
displayed to your users so I think that
 

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.720
displayed to your users so I think that
