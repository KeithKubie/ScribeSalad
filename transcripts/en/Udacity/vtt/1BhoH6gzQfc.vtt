00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.010
Hey Charles.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; Hey Michael, how's it going?

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt; It's not going too badly.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.630
I'm kind of excited.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.710
because what we're going to
do in this section,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.470
is take the previous two sections and
kind of mash them up.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.460
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.
I always liked mashed sections.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.120
&gt;&gt; So, in particular, we're going to
use some of the ideas from convergence

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.280
to better understand value iteration,
linear programming, and

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.310
policy iteration,
three algorithms for solving MVPs.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.560
So I decided we could call it
Advanced Algorithmic Analysis, or AAA.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.370
And I like that you have a scarlet A.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.340
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.800
&gt;&gt; That's a nice allusion.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.259
&gt;&gt; That's another A.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.759
&gt;&gt; Yes.
