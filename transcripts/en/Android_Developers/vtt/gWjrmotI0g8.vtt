00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.810
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hello everyone.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.849
My name is Reto Meier and welcome to this
week in Android development for October 8th,

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:10.849
2012.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.500
Comments from last week's episode suggest
that my broad Australian accent becomes entirely

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.700
impenetrable at the speed at which I've been
delivering "This Week in Android" updates.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.590
Those of you who did understand me are probably
jealous of those who couldn't.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.960
Nonetheless, in Google we're all about making
information universally accessible.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.940
So this week's news is being post-processed
so that you can watch it played back at half-speed.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.290
You're welcome.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.850
You also told us that our new studio made
many of you uncomfortably aware of the emptiness

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.170
of the human condition and the transient insignificance
of our momentary human existence.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.739
We briefly considered removing the backdrop
entirely, but it was decided that revealing

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.870
the constructs within the Googleplex might
be in violation of our employee NDA.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.249
Ultimately we returned to our original projection
which makes it more readily believable that

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.039
we are projections of a ruling artificial
intelligence for whom humans represent little

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.980
more than a cheap source of energy.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.360
Rest assured, this will be the sixth time
we've rebuilt our studio simulation, and we've

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660
become exceedingly efficient at it.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.150
In other Android news, Roman Nurik made over
travel booking and planning apps Kayak and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.230
Trip Adviser on Android Design in Action.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.620
Both apps have been updated with glamorous
new tablet layouts perfect for planning your

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.860
vacation from the comfort of your couch.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.100
On Thursday the Developers of Kayak, Hipmonk,
and World Scope Webcams joined us in person

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.330
and over Hangout to inform us that they've
already thought of everything we said and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.470
will have an update coming out in the next
couple of weeks that fixes everything.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.860
L.A musician and cat-daddy Jackson Galaxy
will be dropping by our patients a little

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.910
later to see how they're doing.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.390
On Friday, dynamic duo Koh Kim and Dan Galpin
were reunited for a jaundiced episode of the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.870
Friday Games Review.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.810
Early last Friday the wheels well and truly
fell off the well-oiled machine that is the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.810
App Clinic.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.370
We spent some time trying to debug the issue
before we moved through our surveillance footage

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.060
and managed to diagnose the likely source
of the problem.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.500
We've got a fix in place, so don't worry.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.690
We'll be back this Friday to review video
player apps.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.790
And we're using the extra time to dig a little
deeper into the code that makes these apps

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.790
tick.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.350
With no App Clinic patients to rebuild in
their own image, you might be worried that

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.820
Nick and Roman won't be dispensing their own
brand of design wisdom next Tuesday.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.820
Fear not.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.200
We're declaring this Tablet Week.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.140
So tune in as we attempt to fuse Nick and
Roman into a single conjoined entity.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.879
Join the creature we've dubbed NiMan on Tuesday
as it celebrates Tablet Week by sharing some

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.799
essential tablet design tips.

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.010
Then on Thursday we're inviting some successful
tablet developers to join us over Hangout

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.049
to share their tablet development challenges
and successes.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.709
To help make every week Tablet Week, we've
also released a set of tablet quality guidelines

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.200
to help you build apps that delight and intrigue
the growing number of Android tablet users.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.060
Dan and Koh will be back next Friday for another
installment of the Friday Games Review.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.909
And of course you can tune in to our Developer
Office Hours on Wednesday, live from Downton

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.850
Abbey, Mountain View, Sidney, and Brazil.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.590
For this week's US Office Hours we're trying
something new.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.389
We're taking prerecorded video questions.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.319
So record yourself asking a question and send
the video to our Google + page at +androiddevelopers.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.709
As always, you can find all of last week's
shows in the schedule for this week at Google

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.060
Developers Live.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.159
That's developers.google.com/live/Android.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.959
You can also meet some of our developer advocates
live in the flesh when Nick Butcher presents

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.579
Modern Android UI's at DevFest Berlin, this
weekend, the 13th and 14th of October.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.409
From the fully operational SeaBase Space Station.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.930
This week in Android documentation we've expanded
the Android accessory protocol docs.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.889
Which can now be found on source.Android.com.

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.939
We've also updated the dialogs guide to include
details for using dialog fragments.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.510
And finally we have a new addition to Android
training with the new class detailing how

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.499
to save data within your apps.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.999
Remember, persisting user data isn't just
a good idea, it's best practice.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.540
In app releases and updates this week, we
saw the release of the Tomtom navigation suite.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.790
A new release from Quicken Loans, My Quicken
Loans Mobile.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.950
And Showtime Anytime now lets you watch your
favorite Showtime shows without your telebox.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.610
That includes Dexter, whose companion app
will let you stay one step ahead of our favorite

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.239
psychotic serial killer.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.760
That's all for this week in Android development.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.620
We look forward to you joining us for our
many live shows this week.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.639
And remember, no shoes, no shirt, and I still
get service.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.639
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:56.840
Thanks for watching.
