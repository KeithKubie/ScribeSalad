actually went through the math in a more
serious way if you clicked I think it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550
serious way if you clicked I think it
 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.800
serious way if you clicked I think it
was like eight seconds if you if you

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810
was like eight seconds if you if you
 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.000
was like eight seconds if you if you
tried to click for the first eight

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010
tried to click for the first eight
 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.170
tried to click for the first eight
seconds you couldn't and the button

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
seconds you couldn't and the button
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.240
seconds you couldn't and the button
would dance around from you after that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
would dance around from you after that
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.979
would dance around from you after that
if you clicked it would actually bring

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989
if you clicked it would actually bring
 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.600
if you clicked it would actually bring

the math and we looked at bounce rate we

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
the math and we looked at bounce rate we
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.860
the math and we looked at bounce rate we
looked at time on site every sort of

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870
looked at time on site every sort of
 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.960

indicator we had suggested that the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970

was sort of fun and funny and shareable
 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.530
was sort of fun and funny and shareable
and different it wasn't just taking a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
and different it wasn't just taking a
 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.940
and different it wasn't just taking a
press release and putting it online in

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950
press release and putting it online in
 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.160

the most pretty way we could it wasn't
 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.280
the most pretty way we could it wasn't
even an infographic that maybe could

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
even an infographic that maybe could
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.330
even an infographic that maybe could
have been interactive because it was

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
have been interactive because it was
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.860
have been interactive because it was
online but really could have existed in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
online but really could have existed in
 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.360
