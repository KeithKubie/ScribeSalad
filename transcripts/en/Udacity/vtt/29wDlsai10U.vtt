00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.860
So, now you've learned the layout of simple AppEngine

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.510
app that uses endpoints. You started out by getting

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.710
the project from your udacity's GitHub repository. However, there

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.950
are various other templates for you to use when

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.610
you create a Maven project. And these are called

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.860
archetypes. To create a new Maven project using an

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.880
archetype, open a console terminal window and change to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.710
a directory where you want to build your project.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.850
&gt;From the command line invoke Maven by typing

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.740
mvn archetype:generate. Hit return. If this is the first

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.380
time you're doing this, Maven needs to actually

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.960
download some things to show you the available archetypes.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.810
Now, we see all the different archetypes that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.410
you could use. It's kind of a overwhelming list

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500
and you can filter it. So let's see

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.220
what archetypes we've got for appengine. So I'll enter

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.470
appengine here. And we've got three here, three

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.750
appengine archetypes. So let's see what we've got for

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.940
endpoints. Okay, we've got two. And you can do

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.970
other filtering if you want. And the archetypes can

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.510
change over time. But I'm going to go ahead

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.350
and create a archetype using the hello-endpoints-archetype. So this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.980
is similar to the Hello World endpoints project that

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.550
you got from udacity, but it has a little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.230
more functionality and a little more pizzazz to it. So here we want

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.570
two. So I'm going to enter two and the take the default number 3. And

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.421
then the group identity is really the package name. So, I'm going to call mine

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:38.370
com.google.training, that'll do. And then, I'm going to

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.730
call mine the artifact can be training.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.830
Take the default snapshot. The package is

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.270
com.google.training. Then it's a quick summary of what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.770
we're going to do. Just press Yes and Yes. Okay, build success. So now, if I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.130
explore my directory, I have all the files for my project. So now I can

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.840
go into Eclipse and import this project that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.820
I just created from the archetype. Existing Project,and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.270
there it is. That's my project. Training's a bit

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.290
generic so I'm going to change the name. New

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.950
Hello World. Don't worry about the errors, we'll solve

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.570
those later. Finish, Continue, and you see over here I

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.930
have my new Hello World project. And I could

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.970
just go ahead and deploy that right away to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.040
local host. Let's do it. Oh no. Launching dev

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640
server has encountered a problem, can't find Maven installation embedded.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.990
All right, I forgot about that. You always have to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.650
remember this when you get a new project, say okay,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.140
then you go to run as run configurations. Then we

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.990
need to find the one that we just used and

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.160
we need to make sure that the Maven run time

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.740
is external, not embedded. Dev App server is now running.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.690
Let's go to local host. Okay, I needed to refresh

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.380
the browser. And you see I've got the new, the UI

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.460
for the new project. Could also go look

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.110
at the endpoint APIs that are available here in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.930
the API Explorer. This is also called the Hello

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.970
World API. Or a slightly different greeting. So we'll

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.570
call, let's call get greeting. Oops, don't know

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.250
what the ID is. List greetings, and here are

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.900
the greetings. So, it's up to you if you'd

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.530
like to go ahead and create that archetype and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.460
explore the project. I leave that to you, but I do want you

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.680
to know that there's lots of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.660
different templates available for creating Maven projects.
