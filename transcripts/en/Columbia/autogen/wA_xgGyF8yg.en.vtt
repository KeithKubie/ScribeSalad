before nine eleven and i would transmute

before nine eleven and i would transmute
them into paintings and it was pretty

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000
them into paintings and it was pretty
 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.140
them into paintings and it was pretty
much my sense that what i was doing with

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.150
much my sense that what i was doing with
 

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.270
much my sense that what i was doing with
painting was was a play on or a critique

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280
painting was was a play on or a critique

of how how

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.310
of how how
 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.520
of how how
media images affect us or or don't

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.530
media images affect us or or don't
 

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.700
media images affect us or or don't
affect us and I guess it's my contention

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:34.710
affect us and I guess it's my contention
 

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.160

that the medium really does determine

that the medium really does determine
 

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.760
that the medium really does determine
how how the viewer deals with the image

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:40.770
how how the viewer deals with the image
 

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:48.320
how how the viewer deals with the image
and so painting the same image that one

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.330
and so painting the same image that one
 

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:53.720
and so painting the same image that one
sees or perhaps whoops or perhaps

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:53.730

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:20.600
go because my background in the theory
of photography is is not that extensive

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:20.610
of photography is is not that extensive
 

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:24.140
of photography is is not that extensive
but when you're talking about that kind

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:24.150
but when you're talking about that kind
 

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:28.010
but when you're talking about that kind
of an authorship it's it's specific the

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020
of an authorship it's it's specific the
 

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.020
of an authorship it's it's specific the
authorship of the photograph the

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:30.030
authorship of the photograph the
 

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:33.680
authorship of the photograph the
photojournalists photograph as it exists

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:33.690
photojournalists photograph as it exists
 

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.770
photojournalists photograph as it exists
in the world and when you talk about a

01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780
in the world and when you talk about a
 

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.770
in the world and when you talk about a
painting or I mean any of these things

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780
painting or I mean any of these things
 

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.620
painting or I mean any of these things
the authorship is on the surface it's

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:42.630
the authorship is on the surface it's
 

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.350
the authorship is on the surface it's
it's obvious

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360
it's obvious
 

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.480
it's obvious
the photograph is supposed to be

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:46.490
the photograph is supposed to be
 

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.880
the photograph is supposed to be
transparent the author of a

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:48.890
transparent the author of a
 

01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:50.560
transparent the author of a
photojournalistic photograph is not

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:50.570
photojournalistic photograph is not
 

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:52.270
photojournalistic photograph is not
supposed to be present in the photograph

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280
supposed to be present in the photograph
 

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.410

it's part of this huge pile of theory

01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:56.420
it's part of this huge pile of theory
 

01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.100
it's part of this huge pile of theory
that and so there isn't there's a

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:00.110
that and so there isn't there's a
 

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:03.460
that and so there isn't there's a
hypocrisy there or there's just a that's

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:03.470
hypocrisy there or there's just a that's
 

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:04.990
hypocrisy there or there's just a that's
the wrong word there's a there's a

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000
the wrong word there's a there's a
 

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.020
the wrong word there's a there's a
conflict because the author is there and

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:08.030
conflict because the author is there and
 

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:10.960

complex it's all those things and yet it
 

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.780

is to some degree evidence and it's it's
 

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.150
is to some degree evidence and it's it's
the way the evidence is contextualized

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:52.160
the way the evidence is contextualized
 

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.190
the way the evidence is contextualized
that photo journalists are trying to

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:54.200
that photo journalists are trying to
 

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.640
that photo journalists are trying to
protect and yet what Susan Sontag is

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:57.650
protect and yet what Susan Sontag is
 

01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.830
protect and yet what Susan Sontag is
saying and what I think is true and

01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840
saying and what I think is true and
 

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.700

everything they can't they can't and and

that's why what she was saying is
 

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:10.810
that's why what she was saying is
dangerous but what I'm saying is instead

of saying oh god it's dangerous and we
 

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.980
of saying oh god it's dangerous and we
have to like protect everything and keep

it's not it's the wrong way to think
 

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.850
it's not it's the wrong way to think
about it there have to be more creative

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:21.860
about it there have to be more creative
 

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:26.650
about it there have to be more creative
ways to think about it and that's yeah

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:26.660
ways to think about it and that's yeah
 

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.680
ways to think about it and that's yeah
that's another lecture that's like there

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:29.690
that's another lecture that's like there
 

01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:33.259
that's another lecture that's like there
anymore yeah

01:18:33.259 --> 01:18:33.269

probably began in the 90s when I was

01:18:46.819 --> 01:18:46.829
probably began in the 90s when I was
 

01:18:46.829 --> 01:18:49.369
probably began in the 90s when I was
looking at science photography and i was

01:18:49.369 --> 01:18:49.379
looking at science photography and i was
 

01:18:49.379 --> 01:18:55.959
looking at science photography and i was
looking at textbooks because i was oh

01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:55.969
 
 

01:18:55.969 --> 01:18:59.539

halfway gratified that's being sued I
felt yeah oh you mean have I changed the

01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179
felt yeah oh you mean have I changed the
 

01:19:21.179 --> 01:19:27.639
felt yeah oh you mean have I changed the
way I do things since that do I feel oh

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:27.649
way I do things since that do I feel oh
 

01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:32.509

I don't have a fear yeah I'm more aware

01:19:32.509 --> 01:19:32.519
I don't have a fear yeah I'm more aware
 

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:34.069
I don't have a fear yeah I'm more aware
of it and I'm thankful for that because

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:34.079
of it and I'm thankful for that because
 

01:19:34.079 --> 01:19:37.159
of it and I'm thankful for that because
I I should have been aware of it but

01:19:37.159 --> 01:19:37.169
I I should have been aware of it but
 

01:19:37.169 --> 01:19:39.889
I I should have been aware of it but
coming as I did through kind of public

01:19:39.889 --> 01:19:39.899
coming as I did through kind of public

coming as I did through kind of public
domain declassified photography it just

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199
domain declassified photography it just
 

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:45.379
domain declassified photography it just
didn't occur to me and it never occurred

01:19:45.379 --> 01:19:45.389
didn't occur to me and it never occurred
 

01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:50.929
didn't occur to me and it never occurred
to me that that a painting wasn't a

material in other words I didn't know
 

01:19:56.639 --> 01:19:58.969

the term transformative use and I didn't

01:19:58.969 --> 01:19:58.979
the term transformative use and I didn't
 

01:19:58.979 --> 01:20:00.829
the term transformative use and I didn't
know the problem between derivative and

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:00.839
know the problem between derivative and
 

01:20:00.839 --> 01:20:03.679
know the problem between derivative and
transformative but i already had and I

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:03.689
transformative but i already had and I
 

01:20:03.689 --> 01:20:06.739
transformative but i already had and I
felt that what I debt what I did was

01:20:06.739 --> 01:20:06.749
felt that what I debt what I did was
 

01:20:06.749 --> 01:20:08.479
felt that what I debt what I did was
transformative it just seemed obvious

01:20:08.479 --> 01:20:08.489
transformative it just seemed obvious
 

01:20:08.489 --> 01:20:12.739
transformative it just seemed obvious
and I mean often what seems obvious has

01:20:12.739 --> 01:20:12.749
and I mean often what seems obvious has
 

01:20:12.749 --> 01:20:17.719
and I mean often what seems obvious has
nothing to do with the law so I think I

01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:17.729
nothing to do with the law so I think I
 

01:20:17.729 --> 01:20:19.609
nothing to do with the law so I think I
haven't changed the way I'm doing things

01:20:19.609 --> 01:20:19.619
haven't changed the way I'm doing things
 

01:20:19.619 --> 01:20:24.399
haven't changed the way I'm doing things
and but it's very good to be aware of

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:24.409
and but it's very good to be aware of
 

01:20:24.409 --> 01:20:31.750
and but it's very good to be aware of
other people's sensitive issues

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760
other people's sensitive issues
 

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.920
other people's sensitive issues
and so I more sensitive
