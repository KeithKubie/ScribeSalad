00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.389
I think it’s indivisible, freedom of speech:
I mean, either you’ve got it or you haven’t.

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:21.340
And every diminution of freedom of speech
diminishes everyone and lessens the currency

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.360
of freedom of speech.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.910
But I feel nothing but unease when it’s
done lightly.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.750
It has to be earned.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.440
The controversial statement has to be earned.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.260
It can’t just be tossed off.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.910
You have to be able to back it up.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.450
So I would urge civilized standards of moderation
on both sides.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.790
It has to be understood that freedom of speech
isn’t just a sort of decadent frippery that

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.590
we gather around us like all our other comforts
and privileges.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.340
Democracy can’t work without freedom of
speech.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.970
It’s an absolute cornerstone of democracy.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:18.010
So we have to be very responsible about this
freedom but there’s no giving it up or modifying

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.050
it, even.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.251
I would say it’s an offshoot of what’s
solidified under political correctness, and

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:31.700
I’m a fan of political correctness.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.010
No one ever says, 'Oh, I’m very politically
correct,' but, in fact, it’s good that we

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.979
are—not the outer fringe PC, but raising
of the standards about what can be said, and

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:57.310
exclusion of things you could have said and
got away with it 10 or 20 years ago and now

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.530
seems discordant.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.810
And who wants to go back to being opposed
to gay marriage?

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.870
The ease with which that became the orthodoxy
was, I thought, tremendously encouraging,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.370
and the idea that Donald Trump has cast off
these “shackles” and we can go back to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.560
being brutes again is a terrible prospect.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:41.300
PC has been an agent for certain sort of evolutionary
acceleration towards progressive ideas, and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.340
I think that’s been very good.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.650
I mean, when I look back at my very early
fiction of 40-odd years ago I’m shocked

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.260
and made uneasy by some of the liberties I
took that I certainly wouldn’t take now.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.770
It doesn’t interfere with the freedom of
writers, political correctness—it gives

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.370
you challenges every now and then, you have
to sort of work around it a bit.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.480
But I never resent that, and I think it’s
self-improvement on a general scale that we’ve

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.820
all responded to.
