00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.470
My motivation for doing this
series of three or four videos

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.800
on the fractional reserve
banking system isn't because I

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.280
expect some type of
revolutionary change or I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.080
think that the world is going
to end if we keep fractional

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.020
reserve banking.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.730
The whole reason why I want to
do it is just to kind of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.450
clarify our collective thoughts
on what it is and

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.030
what are its weaknesses.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.260
I mean, it is the system that
we're in and by the way that

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.680
it's often talked about, it's
kind of viewed as the only

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.360
system because banks around the
world now use the system.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.640
But we have to realize this is
a system, a structure, that's

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.930
been in a place and its modern
form for on the order of a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.790
hundred years.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.030
And it isn't the only way to do
banking and this has some

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.280
very obvious flaws that
I've gone over in the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.160
last couple of videos.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.450
And just to kind of highlight
them-- the first one-- and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.490
this is one that would strike
anyone as, at least it would

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.080
make them uncomfortable, is just
this disingenuous nature

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.560
of fractional reserve.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.790
Look, you tell someone you can
get your deposits anytime you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.180
want, but the reality is you can
get your deposits anytime

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.860
you want as long as no more than
10% of people want their

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.330
money at that same time.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.910
And obviously that by itself
might make you a little

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.510
uncomfortable, but that by
itself isn't a whole reason to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.710
say a system is bad, but the
more severe problem is that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.260
this kind of half-lie leads to
the notion of a bank run.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.800
Everyone has the right to get
all of their money back on--

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.580
essentially on a day's notice
or an hour's notice, but the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.680
reality is that everyone can't
get all of their money back on

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.570
an hour's notice so that leads
to an inconsistency and some

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.800
people aren't going to get what
they expected and this

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.270
leads to a panic, this leads to
a generalized panic-- which

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.660
is, of course, a very unstable
situation for your entire

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.160
financial system.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.323
You don't want an unstable
financial system.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.695
So to fix this problem of bank
runs and panics, there have

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:01.580
been kind of two fixes here.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.630
You have your lender of last
resort in the Federal reserve

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.240
and then probably more
importantly, you have the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.000
notion of FDIC insurance.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.690
And in the last video, I talk
about the idea that FDIC

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.410
insurance-- the main negative
I see-- it essentially gives

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.710
all banks the same access to
capital because they all say,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.780
hey, look give me your money.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.970
It's insured.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:44.940
So essentially it's a Federal
subsidy for all banks.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.810
By definition the fact that
the FDIC is about to be

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.380
insolvent and will have to go
back to Congress to ask for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.110
more money-- that means
that it was

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.780
undercharging for the insurance.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.590
So it was subsidizing these
banks and since all of these

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.660
banks have the same as the FDIC
insurance and they're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220
paying a slight different amount
for them, what it leads

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:10.730
to is, it encourages risk taking
to essentially get more

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.830
profits because all of the
banks' borrowing costs are the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.400
same because when they take on
more risk, people don't say,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.670
hey, you're a riskier bank.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.070
I need more money from you
to give me your deposits.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.800
They'll say, no, I might be a
riskier bank, but I'm FDIC

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.440
insured just like that
more conservative

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.400
bank down the street.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.650
So I should be able to-- I'll
just pay you a slightly higher

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.290
deposit, just for giving me your
business, but then I can

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.060
go take big risks and it's
essentially subsidized by the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.190
Federal government.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.790
But even here, you might say,
hey, look, we've been-- the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.130
U.S. runs on a fractional
reserve banking system and is

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.940
clearly kind of the financial or
the economic powerhouse of

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.810
the world and those
are both true.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.900
And obviously other modern
countries are all based on on

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.890
fractional reserve banking,
so what's wrong with it?

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.740
Maybe we have these weaknesses,
but we've

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.930
engineered away the problem.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.400
And the main-- I guess the
best way to answer that

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.200
question-- and I really don't
want to-- I guess I want to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.550
make it very clear that when I
started off thinking about

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.100
this problem-- because I've
gotten a lot of requests from

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.120
people to think about the
problem, I came at it from as

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.170
neutral a position
as possible.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.873
I said, I don't want to just
say it's bad and be kind of

00:04:18.873 --> 00:04:21.029
this reactionary radical person,
but the more you think

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.880
about it, the more that you
realize that there is

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.470
something that just doesn't
fit right here.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.920
For example, when you talk
about any financial

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.020
intermediary, what's
it's purpose?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.640
Let me draw a financial
intermediary right here.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.880
You have savers who like to put
their money in a nice big

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.390
vault someplace or maybe they
would like it invested

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.990
someplace, but they just don't
know how to invest it or they

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.250
don't have-- their money doesn't
have the scale so it

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.830
can be invested properly.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.100
And what the financial
intermediary says is, hey

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.610
savers, give me all of your
money and I'll hire some

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.700
really smart people to invest
your money properly in good

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.470
investments.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.550
So you have your savers on this
side and then you have

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.650
your projects or your
investments on this side.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.850
They might loan out the money--
I'm speaking in very

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.450
general terms.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.910
We're talking about a
commercial bank or

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.010
lending out the money.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.110
If you're talking about a
venture capital fund, they're

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.010
making direct investments in
actual startup companies, but

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.060
the idea for any financial
intermediary is the same.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.110
For them to create value,
they're taking the saver's

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.600
money and they're putting it
in investments that should

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.550
generate some positive yield.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.440
So it'll generate some positive
return if they

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.690
invested right.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.640
And they'll give some
fraction of that

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.045
return back to the savers.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.740
And they'll keep some of that
for themselves-- which you

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.050
might say is reasonable.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.930
If they're doing this work and
they're allocating this

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.933
capital, they're providing a
useful function for society.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.890
These people deserve to be
wearing their Armani suits and

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.720
and have their Rolex watches.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.920
I'll put deserve in
quotation marks.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.825
But you can say they are adding
value to our economy.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.330
Is fractional reserve banking
a requirement to have

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.160
financial intermediaries
like this?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.670
And the simple answer is, no.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.300
You don't need fractional
reserve banking to do this.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.420
In fact, many financial
intermediaries in no way

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.830
participate in a fractional
reserve lending system.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.060
I guess the most obvious one
is venture capitalists and

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.240
regardless of what you think
of them, they are not--

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.260
there's not some kind of-- they
tell their investors,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.720
which are the equivalent of the
depositors for a bank--

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.580
they tell them, look, you're
going to have your money

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.350
locked up for X years.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.110
Or they'll say, look, we'll take
your money as we need it.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.900
Once we take our money, it's
going to be locked up.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.890
That's also true of private
equity funds.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.110
Some people consider venture
capital a subset of private

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.520
equity, but private equity more
invests in companies that

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.600
already exist. They do that--
and hedge funds, maybe they

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.080
don't have a lockup
for the most part.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.900
Some of them might actually tell
you, look, we're going to

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.750
lock your money up.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.660
So they're being very upfront
with their investors.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.700
I don't want to defend them, but
the ones that don't have a

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.400
lockup, they'll invest in
liquid instruments.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.680
Hedge funds-- this is a
big group of people.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.760
Some of them are adding
some value to society.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.500
Some of them aren't.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.850
Probably the great majority of
them are just trading funds

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.660
between each other in some type
of a game, but I won't go

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.310
into that debate.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.110
I won't try to defend all of the
hedge fund world, but that

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.570
the notion is that to be a
financial intermediary, you're

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.500
not dependent on fractional
reserve banking-- even if you

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.220
wanted to run a commercial
bank.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.300
I could take deposits.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.080
So let's say you come to me.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.570
Let's say a bunch of
people come to me.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.570
Let's say this is your
deposit right here.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.890
This is your money.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.560
Let's say you have
$100 right here.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.680
I could tell you, look, if you
want money on demand, I'm not

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.210
going to pay you any
interest on that.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.870
For the service of you having
access to it on your ATM and

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.170
for it to be secure and all of
that, I'm actually going to

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.460
maybe charge you a little bit
of money for on demand money

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.250
and everything-- and if you want
interest on your money,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.429
you have to give me your money
for a certain period of time.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:41.309
So what you do is-- so you've
given me your $100-- and you

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.340
say, I would like to get some
interest on my money.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.750
I'm a sophisticated investor.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.070
I'd like to participate in the
miracles of capitalism.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.710
So let me tell you what.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.300
Out of this $100, I only need
$10 on a daily basis to run my

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.020
business or my household so
I'm going to make this a

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.140
demand account.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.210
So that would be just a checking
account-- and for

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.070
that I'll get no interest.
I might even

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.150
have to pay some money.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:13.770
Now the other part-- the longer
you're willing to lock

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.750
up your money for, I'm
going to give you

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.000
more interest in it.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.250
So this is $10 right here.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.540
Let'sw say, well, I might need
some of my money in a year.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.340
So let me put the rest of
it in for one year.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.940
We'll call that a one year
CD, which exists already.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.930
For this, the bank will pay
you 2% or maybe 3%.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.000
And then you said, the rest of
the money-- this is long term

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.480
retirement money and I'll put it
in a 10 year CD and because

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.050
I've locked it up longer, I'm
going to get more interest.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.390
Maybe I'll get 5% for that.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.250
And now me, the commercial bank
that's not participating

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.380
in fractional reserve banking,
can say, look, this guy has

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.330
this $10 that he wants access to
whenever and I'm not paying

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.090
any interest on that.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.990
I'm just allowing him to use my
financial infrastructure so

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.950
I'm just going to
put that aside.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.880
I'm just going to put it in my
vaults and he can access that

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.710
from his ATM or wherever, but
this money out here, I can

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.730
then lend this out.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.100
So if someone comes to me and
say, hey Sal-- or Sal Bank-- I

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.380
have this project and I want to
be able to borrow-- let's

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.840
say that this right
here is $45.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.270
I need to borrow $45
for eight years.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.320
You say, sure.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.900
I don't have to give this
guy his money back until

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.815
10 years from now.

00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:36.910
So what you do is you take that
$45 and you loan it out--

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.770
which is fine because you know
it's going to be back.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.300
As long as you're loaning it
out properly, it should be

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.210
back in time to pay this guy.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.440
And this guy knows that you're
loaning out this money so he

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.610
knows that there's some risk
inherentness and he should do

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.550
his homework before he buys
this 10 year CD from you.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.520
He should see where you're
loaning your money and how

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.100
risky it is and if it's really
risky, he should want more

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.630
than 5%-- he should focus on the
interest rate or he should

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.960
just not give you his money.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.140
So the natural supply and
demand and the natural

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.860
feedback forces of capitalism
would come into play.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.580
So you could completely run a
financial system with banks

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.430
and all sorts of financial
intermediaries without

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.990
fractional reserve banking.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.060
So now the next question
is, OK.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.800
You can do without factional
reserve banking, but what's

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.790
really wrong about
what fractional

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.800
reserve banking is enabling?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.000
And for that I'll have
to review the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.140
yield curve for you.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.340
So the yield curve--
it's nothing fancy.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.390
It's really just a graph showing
how much interest you

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.260
pay for different durations or
how much interest you get.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.220
So let's say this is
the yield curve.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.470
Let's say right here I
have overnight money.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.120
So let's say this is if you
give a loan for one day.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.810
This is if you give a
loan for one year.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.060
And this is-- let's say you
gave a loan for 10 years.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.590
And there could be all sorts
of-- a duration is just how

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.430
long you're giving
the loan out for.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.590
Now, if you're lending money to
the government, which you

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.590
view as safe-- maybe the safest
person to lend money

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.750
to, then you can say, look, the
government for one day--

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.080
I'm willing to lend money
to them for 1%.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.660
For one year-- I'm locking it
up-- maybe 2% and then for 10

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.890
years, I'm willing to lend
it to them for 5%.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.520
The yield curve will look
something like this.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.350
Doesn't always go upward sloping
like that, but it

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.360
tends to go upwards
sloping like that.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.395
So that's the yield curve and
this might be for treasuries.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.500
So one day, 1%, one year,
maybe-- the way I drew it--

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.800
maybe this is 3%, maybe for 10
years, this would be 5%.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.050
This isn't the current
yield curve, but

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.910
you you get the idea.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.550
This would just be for

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.950
treasuries, the safest borrower.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.130
Now for investment grade
companies-- if I'm trying to

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.710
lend money to them, maybe to a
GE or someone like that-- or a

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.760
Berkshire Hathaway, I'd want
some premium over the

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.120
treasuries because they're
not as safe as the U.S.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.190
government, but it's going to
have a curve similar to that.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.330
Maybe it looks like
that, right?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
And this premium right here is
essentially the amount of more

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.890
interest you'd want
from these still

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.120
relatively safe companies.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.700
relative to treasuries, but
you still have this upward

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.280
sloping as you go up.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.930
And then, finally, you might
have your really risky guys--

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.063
and every company will have its
own yield curve based on

00:13:24.063 --> 00:13:26.790
its borrowing costs, but you
might group a bunch of risky

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.530
guys together and say, look,
the risky guys-- the yield

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.570
curve looks like that.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.450
If there's some guy who's
looking to start some biotech

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.960
firm and he wants to borrow
money from them, I'm going to

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.080
charge a much higher premium
over treasuries because I

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.610
don't even know if he's going
to be around in five years.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.100
So this is just the yield curve
and the whole reason why

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.730
I drew this is to show how
fractional reserve banking

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.390
allows banks to essentially take
advantage of the yield

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.550
curve without really adding
any true value to society.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.270
This notion of a financial
intermediary does

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.670
add value to society.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.020
When you have fractional reserve
banking, what you're

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.590
allowing banks to do is to
take deposits and this--

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.330
fractional reserve banking isn't
the only place where

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:11.870
this happens.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.360
This happens a lot of places,
but they take deposits-- and

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.760
they're demand deposits,
right?

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.860
These are checking deposits,
which are essentially loans

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.060
from their depositors and they
are essentially overnight

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.860
loans, right?

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.110
These are on demand loans.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.680
They're essentially-- when you
give your money to a bank in a

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.520
checking deposit, that's
essentially every hour that

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.680
you don't go and take your
money back, they're

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.270
essentially just renewing
that loan.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.690
It's kind of the shortest
possible duration loan.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.700
And every day you don't do it,
it's just kind of a renewal of

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.840
that loan, right?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.460
You could imagine a
world where every

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.530
year you renew a loan.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.310
Every year that you don't
withdraw it, you just keep

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.890
rolling it over.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.320
When you do on demand, it's
every second that you don't

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.120
withdraw it, you're
renewing it.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.660
So they're able to borrow money
at this part of the

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.890
yield curve and they can do it
very safely, pay very little

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.270
interest, because people--
even though they might be

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.550
doing risky activities.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.830
Maybe they're lending to
people like this guy.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.340
Because of the FDIC insurance,
people are lending to them

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.720
like they're the government
because they're going to get

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.980
paid back if the government
can pay them back.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.930
So it really lowers their
borrowing costs, so they

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.830
borrow down here and what it
does is, it allows them to

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.430
lend money over longer
durations.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.270
So this could be
a 10 year loan.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.680
So the money doesn't get paid
back, only interest does in

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.800
the interirm, but the
money doesn't get

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.820
paid back for 10 years.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.210
Maybe this right here
is a five year loan.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.140
And they can do it to
riskier investments.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.090
I mean, one, they could just
borrow money here, which is

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.510
what they're paying the
depositors-- like 1%-- and

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.750
then they could just invest it
if they wanted to and if the

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.260
yield curve looked like this,
they could invest it in

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.200
treasuries or maybe investment
grade bonds, essentially

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.190
lending to the Berkshire
Hathaways of the world-- and

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.700
getting a lot more interest.
And what they did here-- it

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.890
doesn't take any special
genius to do this.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.630
Everyone knows that you'll get
higher interest here than over

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.390
here, but the only reason why
they can do it this way is

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.560
because they have this implicit
guarantee-- actually

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.300
it's an explicit guarantee--
from the FDIC.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.010
So this FDIC insurance
is what allows people

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.380
to lend them money.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.330
People are only willing to part
with their money at this

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.970
point of the yield curve because
of the FDIC insurance.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.420
And then the bank can then go
and invest at this point of

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.410
the yield curve and then make
the difference on the spread.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.500
They'll get 5% on the money
and then only pay 1%.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.720
And where's the value here?

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.470
Because I could do this,
but I'm not an

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.820
FDIC insured entity.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.680
Clearly these people would love
to get 5% on their money,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.690
get that money that the bank's
getting, but they don't get

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.400
that insurance from the FDIC so
it doesn't allow them to.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.780
So essentially what fractional
reserve banking and the

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.690
insurance that's come about
to make fractional reserve

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.930
lending viable-- all it does
is it allows banks to

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.880
arbitrage the yield curve-- to
borrow money at the short end

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.440
and lend it out in the long end,
and make up the spread.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.250
And this is kind of a, one, that
doesn't add any value.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.200
Anyone can do this.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.020
You don't need a a fancy
MBA to figure this out.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.704
This doesn't add any true
value to society.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.099
It actually just flattens out
the yield curve a little bit,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.490
but we can debate about
the value of that.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.690
But I want to kind of make a
bigger point here-- is that

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.710
obviously a lot of people in the
banking system are kind of

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:40.000
the champions of capitalism
and unless they're being

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.680
bailed out, they're the first
ones to be against any form of

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.400
government intervention or
government safety net.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.370
But their whole industry is
predicated on a government

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.460
safety net.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.240
This notion of a financial
intermediary that I outlined

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.430
here and venture capitalists
and private equity-- they

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.600
still operate on this
model right here.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.590
They are in no way dependent
on the Federal government.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.990
I mean, some of them might end
up being indirectly, but they

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.620
don't need a whole elaborate
system of FDIC insurance and

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.830
the Federal and the discount
window and all of these

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.720
interventions that the Federal
government does.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.520
They don't need that to operate
efficiently-- or to

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.750
operate in general.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.380
And even this banking system
here, where you just had

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.390
people get CDs instead of having
this kind of halfway

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.760
truth of fractional reserve
lending-- this could

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.610
completely operate without any
government intervention.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.830
This system, on the other
hand, fractional reserve

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.660
lending-- it could not exist
without government

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.910
intervention.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.330
And so you have to you have to
debate-- or I guess think in

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.640
your mind-- some system like
fractional reserve banking

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.650
that is dependent on the
government-- is this even

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:54.900
capitalism?

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.160
I mean, where is the
competition here?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.760
Where is the innovation here?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.610
If you're big enough, you get
your FDIC insurance and you

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.760
just keep arbitraging the yield
curve and you make money

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.610
to buy your Rolex and your fancy
trips in your private

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.120
jets, but there's no
innovation here.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.270
You're just big and you were one
of the lucky ones to get a

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.030
bank charter with the FDIC and
be insured by them-- there's

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.770
no innovation here.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.980
Where's the competition?

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.690
If anything, the person who
takes the most risk and who

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.630
does the most silly things is
going to be able to generate

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.300
the highest yield and they have
the subsidized insurance

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.940
from the Federal government and
so they're going to be the

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.750
most successful.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.670
It's all dependent
on government.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.975
It's all dependent
on a subsidy.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.180
And in the end, this money that
these people are making

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.440
by arbitraging this, this is
coming from a subsidy from the

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.970
Federal government and it's
coming from the taxpayer.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.630
So you essentially have the
taxpayers subsidizing this

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.960
world where people can just
arbitrage this yield curve--

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.130
not take on real risk and make
real investments and

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.130
efficiently allocate capital,
just arbitraging the yield

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.360
curve with cheap insurance-- and
you're essentially making

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.510
a small percentage of the
population-- being able to

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.690
extract, essentially, rents or
or some type of subsidy from

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:12.470
the rest of the population.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.440
And obviously this isn't the
part of our economic system

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.100
that is the most in need.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.240
So I'm not saying this
to kind of impugn

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.250
the financial system.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.170
I think for the most part,
people here, they're taking on

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.910
risk and they're getting return
and the savers here

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.360
know what they're getting
into, but there's no

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.620
government intervention here.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.050
There's no implicit government
subsidy.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.240
This whole thing is based
on a government subsidy.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.460
Fractional reserve banking could
not exist without the

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.040
FDIC and the FDIC could not
exist without the implicit

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.070
backing that the Congress would
make them solvent if

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.040
they ever ran out of money, like
is the case right now.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.710
Anyway, hopefully this informs
your view a little bit more.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.530
I don't want to be some kind
of crazy reactionary.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.230
I'm resigned to the fact that
fractional reserve banking

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.430
isn't going to go away, but it
does bother me a little bit

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.900
because it is completely
dependent on government

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.380
intervention.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.040
As you see right now over the
past year, you have this whole

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.370
financial system where we're
piling more and more money

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.850
into the very same entities that
took on the most risk--

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.420
and essentially they have
us at gunpoint.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.960
They're like, you better pour
more money into us or else

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.440
we're going to blow up because
of the risk I took, but I'm

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.890
going to take you
down with me.
