Remember that manager that we were talking about earlier? Maybe it was you,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.400
maybe it was somebody else. Well, that manager is still handing out assignments

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.699
manually. Let's write the program that will assign them automatically. I've got

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.192
it started for you. I wrote a class simulation. You don't need to look at it

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:20.315
too hard. There's a lot of stuff in here that you don't need to know yet.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:25.680
Mostly what it's doing is it's reading in a story. The story is a text file,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.424
inside the directory with the code. It's called story.txt. The simulation class

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.010
reads these lines of the story on a manager object. Let's look again at this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.452
story. First, the manager hires photographers. There's a photographer Danny,

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:45.337
then a photographer Leslie. Each day, there's a meeting, where the manager

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:50.322
gives out assignments. The manager's going to start with the first photographer

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:54.681
and give out the highest priority assignment available first. So in this case,

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:59.210
that would be the parrot assignment, which has priority 5. In between daily

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.312
meetings, the manager gets assignments. These assignments need to be added to

00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.790
the to-do list. Since choosing a priority is a complicated task, I just

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.410
included the priorities for you. The priorities will be Ints, and a higher

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.610
number means a higher priority assignment, so the assignment should be done

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.370
sooner. When we come to the end of the story, we'll check the portfolio and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.460
display all of the pictures. Your task will be to complete the methods inside

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.087
the manager class, using whatever other classes you need to create. So that

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:31.559
when you run the main method in the stimulation class, it will print out the

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:35.087
finished photos from left to right with no space between them and the name of

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:40.409
photographer under each picture. So when you run the main method of the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.739
finished code, you should see something like this. The first photo is of a

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.043
parrot and it was done by Danny, the second one is of the mountain done by

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:53.120
Leslie and so on. Make sure that their signature has its top left corner, right

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.616
at the bottom left corner of the photo. Now I've written one other thing for

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:01.144
you, the photographer has the complicated job of creating a photo based on a

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:05.813
description. If this were real life, a person would be taking the photo and

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:10.747
loading it into the system, but we don't have time to wait for that. So I've

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:14.780
included some photos, and a method in the photographer class, that gives the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.998
name of a file with a photo, when you give it a description. All of the

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:24.930
descriptions in the story, so all of these ones already have photos for them.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.115
And the photographer knows how to find those photos. Aside from that, you have

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:34.818
free reign. You can add whatever classes you need to make this work. Though to

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:37.014
submit your answer, you'll need to find a way to use the classes that are in

00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:42.451
the Udacity IDE. You can't make new files in the Udacity IDE. But if you use

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:46.352
BlueJ, you can create whatever classes you want. I'll give you a little tour of

00:02:46.352 --> 00:02:49.790
how I designed my solution at the end. But there are a lot of ways to do this,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.845
and many of them are good for different reasons. One last thing. I understand

00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:57.845
that this is very open ended. So if you'd like more guidance, check out the

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:01.935
hint links that will show up here. And if you can't make it work, it's not your

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:04.860
fault. And if you're satisfied with your progress and what you've learned from

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.420
the question it's okay to move on.
