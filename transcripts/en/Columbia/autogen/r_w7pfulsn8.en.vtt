certainly in the post-world War two
 

00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:41.460
certainly in the post-world War two
period we had a kind of climax of

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:41.470
 
 

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:47.760

that the entire world was destined to

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040
that the entire world was destined to
 

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.770
that the entire world was destined to
become like America in a process known

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:16.780

as modernization modernization Theory
 

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:26.810
as modernization modernization Theory
became the technique for approaching

became the technique for approaching
 

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.920
became the technique for approaching
non-european parts of the world or

would say Europe is Western civilization

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:39.940
would say Europe is Western civilization
 

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.270
would say Europe is Western civilization
when we are so far west of Europe when

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280
when we are so far west of Europe when
 

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.370
when we are so far west of Europe when
we say America's Western civilization in

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:44.380
we say America's Western civilization in
 

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.530

Europe as Eastern yeah

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:46.540
Europe as Eastern yeah
 

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:55.800
Europe as Eastern yeah

modernization theory was climaxing in
 

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.310
modernization theory was climaxing in
the decade when the European empires

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320
the decade when the European empires
 

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:09.600
the decade when the European empires
were collapsing and by the 1980s it

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:09.610
were collapsing and by the 1980s it
 

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.720
were collapsing and by the 1980s it
became clear to pretty much everyone

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:12.730
became clear to pretty much everyone
 

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.590
became clear to pretty much everyone
that somehow the model of Europe as

working out and now you have people who

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:27.460
working out and now you have people who
 

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.330
working out and now you have people who
are saying suggesting that maybe China

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:30.340
are saying suggesting that maybe China
 

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.400

will go maybe we will still reach the
 

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.700
will go maybe we will still reach the
point where we can say that Iran is the

do you look at the world as converging
and here the current word globalization

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:10.730
and here the current word globalization
 

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.280
and here the current word globalization
embodies this notion that there's a

if you focus on common denominators you
 

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:23.240
if you focus on common denominators you
cannot end up with a centrism because

one we have is called diversity and

dominance it's originally called

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:19.650
dominance it's originally called
 

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.290
dominance it's originally called
dominance and diversity and then it was

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300
dominance and diversity and then it was
 

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.460
dominance and diversity and then it was
felt that that was a little too

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.470
felt that that was a little too
 

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.290
felt that that was a little too
heavy-handed so we switched it around to

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300
heavy-handed so we switched it around to
 

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.810
heavy-handed so we switched it around to
diversity and dominance and said that

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:26.820
diversity and dominance and said that
 

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.610

again and again because I've taught
history of Technology here so to some

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940
history of Technology here so to some
 

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.240

degree the lectures will be will lean

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:26.250
degree the lectures will be will lean
 

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:31.240
degree the lectures will be will lean
toward the things that I know most about

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:31.250
 
 

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.960
 
now let me move to a substantive

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:34.970
now let me move to a substantive
 

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:38.510
now let me move to a substantive

question it has to do with where does it
 

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:44.960
question it has to do with where does it
start the you know because we have a

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:44.970
start the you know because we have a
 

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:50.270
start the you know because we have a
word prehistory we have a philosophical

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280
word prehistory we have a philosophical
 

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.980
word prehistory we have a philosophical
presumption that history starts

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:53.990

otherwise we couldn't have something

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980
otherwise we couldn't have something

otherwise we couldn't have something
that comes before it the problem with

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.010
that comes before it the problem with
 

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.310
that comes before it the problem with
this is that when the word prehistory

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:06.320
this is that when the word prehistory
 

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.360
this is that when the word prehistory
gained circulation the history

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:11.370
gained circulation the history
 

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:15.500
gained circulation the history
profession seemed to believe fairly

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:15.510
profession seemed to believe fairly
 

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.080
profession seemed to believe fairly
uniformly that history depended upon

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:18.090
uniformly that history depended upon
 

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.390
uniformly that history depended upon
written records that therefore

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400
written records that therefore
 

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.060
written records that therefore
prehistory was what happened before you

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:23.070
prehistory was what happened before you
 

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:26.990
prehistory was what happened before you
had written records there isn't anyone

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000
had written records there isn't anyone
 

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.850

that would really maintain this

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480
that would really maintain this

because of the amazing discoveries made
 

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.570
because of the amazing discoveries made
by archaeologists partly because of

increased scientific ability to analyze
material remains and partly because

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800
material remains and partly because
 

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.350

and yep you know you can't leave them

00:51:14.849 --> 00:51:14.859
and yep you know you can't leave them
 

00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:19.319
and yep you know you can't leave them
out and therefore how do you do how do

00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:19.329
out and therefore how do you do how do

you do that history so so the question

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200
you do that history so so the question
 

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.059
you do that history so so the question
of where history starts begins to be

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:27.069
of where history starts begins to be
 

00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:33.630
of where history starts begins to be
debated there let's say the the classic

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640
debated there let's say the the classic
 

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.779

valleys in the Middle East this is

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240
valleys in the Middle East this is
 

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:48.240
valleys in the Middle East this is
probably not true but this is where it

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.250
probably not true but this is where it
 

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:49.380
probably not true but this is where it
started because that's where we got the

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:49.390
started because that's where we got the
 

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:51.390
started because that's where we got the
first written materials Mesopotamia in

well maybe not but that's where it

00:51:54.509 --> 00:51:54.519
well maybe not but that's where it
 

00:51:54.519 --> 00:51:56.099
well maybe not but that's where it
appeared that we got the first written

appeared that we got the first written

materials then we move toward the idea
 

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.009

of well maybe it's the Neolithic

00:52:02.009 --> 00:52:02.019
of well maybe it's the Neolithic

Revolution and the beginning of
 

00:52:04.839 --> 00:52:07.559
Revolution and the beginning of
domesticated plants and animals that's a

00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:07.569
domesticated plants and animals that's a

starting point which in the Middle East
 

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:14.819
starting point which in the Middle East
is around 8000 BC problem is that you

00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:14.829
is around 8000 BC problem is that you
 

00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:16.620
is around 8000 BC problem is that you
can have domesticated plants without

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:16.630
can have domesticated plants without

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.039
mosquito animals investigated animals
without domesticated plants and there is

00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:22.049
without domesticated plants and there is
 

00:52:22.049 --> 00:52:25.140
without domesticated plants and there is
very very little relationship between

the Flint or other stone was set in a
 

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:07.130
the Flint or other stone was set in a
sickle so you would have a piece of wood

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140
sickle so you would have a piece of wood
 

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.400
sickle so you would have a piece of wood
shaped roughly like that and then you

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:10.410
shaped roughly like that and then you
 

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.030
shaped roughly like that and then you
would embed in it these sharp stone

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040
would embed in it these sharp stone
 

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:21.260
would embed in it these sharp stone
chips and you would use this sawtooth

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.270
chips and you would use this sawtooth
 

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:27.140

this is Neolithic we know that we can

this is Neolithic we know that we can

animals is you know is purely conjecture
 

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.450
animals is you know is purely conjecture
because there was a theory that is still

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460
because there was a theory that is still
 

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:20.210
because there was a theory that is still
hotly debated that the best Gatien of

animals depends upon sedentary life
because the animals have to be kept in a

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:26.340
because the animals have to be kept in a
 

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.730
because the animals have to be kept in a
pen and how are you going to pen up the

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740
pen and how are you going to pen up the
 

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.710
pen and how are you going to pen up the
animals if you're traveling around every

animals if you're traveling around every
 

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.040
animals if you're traveling around every
night so if you have to have sedentary

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:34.050
night so if you have to have sedentary
 

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:35.510
night so if you have to have sedentary
life then you have to have something

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520
life then you have to have something
 

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.670
life then you have to have something
you're living on therefore you have to

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680
you're living on therefore you have to
 

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.230
you're living on therefore you have to
have something like domesticated plants

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240
have something like domesticated plants
 

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.510
have something like domesticated plants

more detail on Thursday this was a
 

00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.190
more detail on Thursday this was a

the Mesolithic on they hunted horses and

00:55:16.599 --> 00:55:16.609
the Mesolithic on they hunted horses and
 

00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:19.839
the Mesolithic on they hunted horses and
ate them and then just about the time

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:19.849
ate them and then just about the time
 

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.210
ate them and then just about the time
some people somewhere else we're

planting wheat and barley they said

00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:24.019
planting wheat and barley they said
 

00:55:24.019 --> 00:55:26.410
planting wheat and barley they said
let's stop hunting the horses and let's

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:26.420
let's stop hunting the horses and let's
 

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.870
let's stop hunting the horses and let's
start hurting them instead and voila

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880
start hurting them instead and voila
 

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.890
start hurting them instead and voila
domestic horses they simply evolved and

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:32.900
domestic horses they simply evolved and
 

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.900
domestic horses they simply evolved and
then you think well why didn't they do

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:34.910
then you think well why didn't they do
 

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.160
then you think well why didn't they do
that ten thousand years earlier wasn't

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:36.170
that ten thousand years earlier wasn't
 

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.720

that a stupid thing to wait so long I

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:37.730
that a stupid thing to wait so long I
 

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:39.789
that a stupid thing to wait so long I
said well they didn't know domestication

00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799
said well they didn't know domestication
 

00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:41.259
said well they didn't know domestication
existed well of course they did because

00:55:41.259 --> 00:55:41.269
existed well of course they did because
 

00:55:41.269 --> 00:55:45.250

they had dogs well you know maybe they

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:45.260
they had dogs well you know maybe they
 

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.500
they had dogs well you know maybe they
just didn't maybe they thought about the

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:47.510
just didn't maybe they thought about the
 

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.210
just didn't maybe they thought about the
dogs differently than horses it became

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:49.220
dogs differently than horses it became
 

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.730
dogs differently than horses it became
very confusing but the Neolithic

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:51.740
very confusing but the Neolithic

starting point then you have something

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:58.250
starting point then you have something

that has arisen in the last five years
or so which is called big history and

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640
or so which is called big history and
 

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.880
or so which is called big history and
it's their books on it their debates on

it's their books on it their debates on
 

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:13.870
it's their books on it their debates on
it and big history says why is it that

why are we only writing the history of

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920
why are we only writing the history of
 

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.170
why are we only writing the history of
them for the last ten thousand years

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.180
them for the last ten thousand years
 

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.680
them for the last ten thousand years
from 8000 BC to the present what about

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:29.690
from 8000 BC to the present what about
 

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:32.769
from 8000 BC to the present what about
those other millions hundreds of

shouldn't we write that as part of our

00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:36.859
shouldn't we write that as part of our
 

00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:40.539
shouldn't we write that as part of our
history and so the big history people

00:56:40.539 --> 00:56:40.549
history and so the big history people
 

00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:46.390
history and so the big history people
say let's think of all of the hominids

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400
say let's think of all of the hominids
 

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.640
say let's think of all of the hominids
and people you know how human like

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:51.650
and people you know how human like
 

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:53.980
and people you know how human like
beings existed and think of them all

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:53.990
beings existed and think of them all
 

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.470
beings existed and think of them all
together and then you think and you

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:07.100
get anywhere so you leave the bathroom
and you go back to your office and you

and you go back to your office and you
try and do some real history but the the

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:10.770
try and do some real history but the the
 

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:14.710
try and do some real history but the the
problem with big history is that it it

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720
problem with big history is that it it
 

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.650

encourages people to really get involved

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660
encourages people to really get involved
 

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.070
encourages people to really get involved
with the science because this you know

with the science because this you know
for the pre Neolithic stuff it's really

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:26.420
for the pre Neolithic stuff it's really
 

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:31.580
for the pre Neolithic stuff it's really
complicated science to understand how to

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:31.590
complicated science to understand how to
 

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:33.800
complicated science to understand how to
interpret the things you're looking at

interpret the things you're looking at
and the science changes over time just

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040
and the science changes over time just
 

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.950

example dating with carbon-14 carbon-14

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:53.910
example dating with carbon-14 carbon-14
 

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:57.380
example dating with carbon-14 carbon-14
is a naturally occurring isotope of

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:57.390
is a naturally occurring isotope of
 

00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:04.580
is a naturally occurring isotope of
carbon that is taken in by plants and

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:04.590
carbon that is taken in by plants and
 

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:09.290
carbon that is taken in by plants and
animals and there the carbon oxygen

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300
animals and there the carbon oxygen
 

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:19.150
animals and there the carbon oxygen
cycle and so the percentage of carbon-14

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160
cycle and so the percentage of carbon-14
 

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:25.570
cycle and so the percentage of carbon-14
in your body at any one moment is

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:25.580
in your body at any one moment is
 

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.880
in your body at any one moment is
considered to be equivalent to the

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:28.890
considered to be equivalent to the
 

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.940
considered to be equivalent to the
percentage of carbon-14 that you have in

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:31.950
percentage of carbon-14 that you have in
 

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.700
percentage of carbon-14 that you have in
the atmosphere at large so you get a

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:34.710
the atmosphere at large so you get a
 

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.640
the atmosphere at large so you get a
ratio between carbon-14 which decays

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:37.650
ratio between carbon-14 which decays
 

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:42.800
ratio between carbon-14 which decays
into carbon-12 the rate of decay is

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:42.810
into carbon-12 the rate of decay is
 

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:48.640
into carbon-12 the rate of decay is
known and therefore when you look at

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:48.650
 
 

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:52.400
 
organic remains from long ago and you

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:52.410
organic remains from long ago and you
 

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.560
organic remains from long ago and you
look at the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:54.570
look at the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon
 

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:58.160
look at the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon
12 you can say there must have been so

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.170
12 you can say there must have been so
 

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.980
12 you can say there must have been so
much carbon-14 and now it is diminished

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:00.990
much carbon-14 and now it is diminished
 

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.570
much carbon-14 and now it is diminished
and therefore we can measure them out of

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:02.580
and therefore we can measure them out of
 

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.020
and therefore we can measure them out of
time so the amount of carbon-14 becomes

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:06.030
time so the amount of carbon-14 becomes
 

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.830
time so the amount of carbon-14 becomes
a dating device this was a great

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:09.840
a dating device this was a great
 

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.630
a dating device this was a great
breakthrough in archeology

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640
breakthrough in archeology
 

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.120
breakthrough in archeology
and it proved to be only partially

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.130
and it proved to be only partially
 

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:17.780
and it proved to be only partially
correct because the assumption was that

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:17.790
correct because the assumption was that
 

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:21.290
correct because the assumption was that
the percentage of the carbon in the

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:21.300
the percentage of the carbon in the
 

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.510
the percentage of the carbon in the
atmosphere that was of the isotope

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520
atmosphere that was of the isotope
 

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:27.340
atmosphere that was of the isotope
carbon-14 was not a constant but rather

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:27.350
carbon-14 was not a constant but rather
 

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.260
carbon-14 was not a constant but rather
changes over time and this was

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:30.270
changes over time and this was
 

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:33.740
changes over time and this was
determined by studying the wood

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:33.750
determined by studying the wood
 

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.830
determined by studying the wood
contained in tree rings so that every

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:38.840
contained in tree rings so that every
 

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:43.010
contained in tree rings so that every
ring in a tree the the wood stops

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020
ring in a tree the the wood stops
 

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.370
ring in a tree the the wood stops
absorbing carbon after that season and

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380
absorbing carbon after that season and
 

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.500
absorbing carbon after that season and
the next ring out the next ring out and

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:48.510
the next ring out the next ring out and
 

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:50.060
the next ring out the next ring out and
so you could look at a sequence of

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:50.070
so you could look at a sequence of
 

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:55.270
so you could look at a sequence of
carbon-14 in tree rings and by matching

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280
carbon-14 in tree rings and by matching
 

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.750
carbon-14 in tree rings and by matching
tree-ring thicknesses you could push

00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760
tree-ring thicknesses you could push
 

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.200
tree-ring thicknesses you could push
back thousands of years and so you came

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:03.210
back thousands of years and so you came
 

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:04.640
back thousands of years and so you came
up with something called corrected

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:04.650
up with something called corrected

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.890
carbon 14 dates the corrected dates tend
to be much older than the straight

could have consequences for example if

could have consequences for example if
 

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.450

you look at carbon 14 dates and you
 

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.310
you look at carbon 14 dates and you
think of Stonehenge and you say well you

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:31.320
think of Stonehenge and you say well you

and you go to Mycenae and you go to a
 

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.140
and you go to Mycenae and you go to a
tomb there where you see the stone work

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:42.150
tomb there where you see the stone work
 

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.030

that's been done or you go to Terrans

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040
that's been done or you go to Terrans
 

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.980
that's been done or you go to Terrans
and you see the stone work done there

and you see the stone work done there
 

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:50.150
and you see the stone work done there
then you look at Stonehenge you and you

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160
then you look at Stonehenge you and you
 

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.450
then you look at Stonehenge you and you
look at the carbon 14 dates you say well

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460
look at the carbon 14 dates you say well
