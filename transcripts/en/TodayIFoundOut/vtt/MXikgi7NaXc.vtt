00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:13.060
Unless you happen to 
have a specialized ice machine in your home,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.630
it is practically guaranteed that the ice
your freezer makes is of the cloudy variety.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.249
A popular and well known trick to making clear(er)
ice is to either boil the water first or use

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.539
distilled water.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.849
However, even doing this won’t guarantee
the kind of perfectly clear ice you’d find

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.970
in a high-end bar or restaurant.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.340
This is because how clear ice is, is only
partially dependent on the purity of the water

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.840
you use, meaning even if you managed to procure
the tears of a Saint and pass them through

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.220
the world’s best water filter, you’d still
likely end up with ice that was a little cloudy.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.990
So what’s going on here?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.800
For those of you have the time, go to any
nearby sink and pour yourself a glass of water.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.440
Unless you live in an area with bad plumbing
or poured the water into a dirty glass or

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.820
something, we’re going to guess that the
water is perfectly clear.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.790
Sure, you may see a few stray nondescript
particles floating in the glass, but not enough

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.399
to explain why it looks like someone crammed
half a cloud into your freezer when you try

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.450
to turn that same water into ice.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.640
The answer to this mystery lies in the temperature
of the water.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.039
You see, at room temperature there are a lot
of impurities that are dissolved in regular

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.070
old tap water.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.530
And as you may recall from high-school chemistry,
the warmer water is, the more of a given substance

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.750
it is possible to dissolve in it.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.799
For example, sugar has very weak molecular
bonds that require only a small amount of

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.799
energy to break.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.219
Thus, as you supply water with more energy
by heating it, the amount of sugar you can

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.380
dissolve within it increases and vice versa.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.979
You perhaps have noticed this phenomenon when
sweetening hot tea vs. cold, or after letting

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
a sugared cup of coffee get cold, with the
sugar dissolving fine when it’s hot, but

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.759
showing up at the bottom of your cup when
the coffee gets cold.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.429
This is essentially what happens with ice.

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.639
As you cool the water, all of the impurities
that were happily dissolved in it at room

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.359
temperature separate themselves from the liquid
and become visible.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.771
You may now be wondering why these impurities
tend to congregate towards the center of the

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.959
ice cube, rather than being evenly distributed.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.300
This is because as water freezes, it crystallizes.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.710
This crystallization process generally rejects,
or forms more efficiently, without most of

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.420
the types of impurities found in tap water.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.910
This results in the impurities getting pushed
into the unfrozen water towards the center

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.670
as the ice freezes from the outside in.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.510
Eventually, of course, the final remaining
bit of water in the center will freeze with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.730
the impurities having nowhere to go.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.500
(This fact can actually be used as something
of a way to purify water, freezing water,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.610
then melting it and keeping only the outer
bits.)

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.100
This is also why partially formed ice cubes,
where most of the center is still liquid,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.900
are usually very clear- the water containing
these still dissolved sediments and impurities

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.340
hasn’t cooled enough yet for them to show
up.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.740
So what exactly are these impurities and where
do they come from?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.900
Well the most common culprits are lime (colloquially
known as limescale) followed by fluoride,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.510
calcium and a whole host of other organic
materials that are practically unavoidable

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.680
in water (with many being good for you like
calcium and magnesium).

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.200
Heating, “softening,” or filtering the
water is one way of removing some, if not

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.950
most of these impurities and is partially
the reason that boiled and filtered water

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.200
often yields somewhat clearer ice cubes.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.680
However, as mentioned, you’re likely still
not going to get a completely clear cube even

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.560
if you filter off the impurities.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.130
So what else is going on here?

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.070
As the water crystallizes, tiny bubbles of
air form.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.070
These bubbles get trapped within the ice like
any other impurity.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.720
Specialized ice makers avoid this by freezing
water in layers to stop most air bubbles from

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.150
forming in the first place.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.910
They also tend to freeze water extremely slowly
(setting the temperature much higher than

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.420
common household freezers) in order to form
larger crystal structures and to allow time

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:23.790
for any air bubbles that do form 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.370
to escape.
