00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.640
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.320
Friends of the Library of
Congress, students, staff,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.610
everyone who is joining
us live on the Library

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.100
of Congress' YouTube channel,
I'm Colonel Karen Lloyd,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.650
I'm the Director the
Veterans' History Project here

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.460
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.350
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.720
to come see New York Times'
best-selling author, Liza Mundy,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.060
who's going to discuss her book,
Code Girls, the untold story

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.080
of American women
codebreakers of World War II.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.480
As many of you know, we were
planning to hold this event

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.670
at the beginning of the month.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.010
Mother nature intervened.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.690
So, we are here a few weeks
later and more determined

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.310
than ever to shine
a spotlight on women

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.070
who have made major
contributions to our society.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.860
We know that it's never too late
to celebrate the accomplishments

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.990
of women, and I'd like to thank
the Librarian of Congress,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.320
Dr. Carla Hayden, and her
entire leadership team

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.240
for their commitment to
helping us with this endeavor.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.800
I would also like to thank
Doug Bennett [assumed spelling]

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.210
for returning to Washington
to be with us today.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.510
Today's events will
focus, not just on women,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.250
but on women veterans, who
raised their right hand,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.870
took an oath to support
and defend our country,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.460
put on a uniform, and achieved
some amazing accomplishments

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.290
while during -- while
enduring many sacrifices.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.270
You're going to hear
their stories today,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.920
and hopefully you will learn
about others in your studies,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.910
or through the many
resources we have here

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.810
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.530
As you do, keep in mind

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.830
that there are thousands more
women veterans whose names

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.630
and stories may never be
heard unless you reach

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.570
out to the veterans in your
lives in your communities

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160
to listen, really listen to
their story, and then donate it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.500
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200
The Veterans' History
Project would also

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.100
like to thank our cosponsor, the
library's Young Reader Center.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.020
Devoted to the reading
interests of children and teens,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.000
the Young Reader Center
offers young people

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.140
and their families
the opportunity

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.260
to experience the
wonders and resources

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.170
of the nation's library
through ongoing programs

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.860
and special events.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.060
They were instrumental in
helping us reach out to schools

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.430
so that their students will
benefit from today's talk,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.010
and to develop a deeper
appreciation for primary sources

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.480
that are available to
them here at the library,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.480
but especially the
Veterans' History Project.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.310
With more than 105,000
collections in our archives,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.550
the Veterans' History Project
collects, preserves and,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.590
most importantly, makes
accessible the story

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.300
of United States military
veterans who served

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.680
in World War I through
the current conflicts

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.040
so that future generations
may hear directly

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.660
from those veterans and
better understand their

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.710
selfless service.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.420
Our collections include video

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.840
and audio oral history
interviews,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.420
along with original photographs,
letters, military documents,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.310
diaries, journals, and
two-dimensional art.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.180
We are not -- we not only
highlight our existing

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.930
collections, but we continue
to solicit volunteers like you,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.780
from across the nation, to
gather their stories of veterans

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.330
and their lives so that their
first-person reminisces,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.000
personal philosophies,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.190
and creativity are
preserved for posterity.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.950
In doing so, we all better
understand our history.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.270
Today's guest presenter
can attest to the value

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.070
of our collections,
because she used them

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.480
when conducting research
for her book.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.740
As a former longtime reporter
at the Washington Post,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.600
Liza Mundy is no
stranger to research.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.990
A senior fellow at New
America, her exploration

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.340
of issues related to women in
war, resulted in her emerging

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.840
as one of the nation's
foremost experts on the subject.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.340
She is a frequent commentator

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.770
on prominent national
television shows, radio,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.400
and online news outlets.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.320
She has contributed to
numerous publications,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.160
including The Atlantic, Time,
The New Republic, Slate,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.420
Mother Jones, and Politico.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.700
Now, there's a range.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.870
In addition to Code Girls,
Liza is also the author

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.610
of The Richer Sex,
how the new majority

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.850
of female breadwinners is
transforming sex, love,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.640
and family, and also,
Michelle, a biography.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.560
After her presentation, Liza
has graciously agreed to stay

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.890
with us for little while
to answer questions

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.480
from the audience and to
sign copies of her book,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.320
which are available for
purchase outside this room.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.800
Now, please join me in welcoming

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.510
to the podium our very
special guest, Liza Mundy.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:16.530
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.830
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Thank you so
much, Wendy [assumed spelling],

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.130
for that great introduction.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.930
Thank you everybody who came
for the rescheduled event.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.330
Thank you, Lisa Taylor.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.060
You've been incredibly
hospitable and organized

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.540
in both helping with my research
and organizing this event.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.220
It's such a thrill to speak
at the Library of Congress,

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.630
obviously, one of the
great research institutions

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.570
in the world, particularly

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.620
because the Veterans'
History Collection here was

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.180
so fundamental and
crucial to my research.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.160
When I was getting started
researching Code Girls,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.000
and when I was, in fact,
shopping the book proposal

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.620
to editors in New
York, apparently one

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.940
of the editors said
that he thought

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.420
that it was a great
story, but that he felt

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.350
that it might be thin beer,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.160
because so much time had
passed since World War II.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.030
If there were any women
codebreakers out there,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.870
they would be in their
mid-90's, you know,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.330
maybe wouldn't remember much,
maybe there wouldn't be much

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.540
of a record since it
was top secret work.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.550
So, I literally got up every day
during my research and thought,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.890
I'll show you thin beer.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.870
And, fortunately, I
had the help of allies,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.130
like the Veterans'
History collection here.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.240
I literally just e-mailed
through the website saying,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.540
I'm working on this book.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.840
Do you have anything?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.120
I instantly got a reply from
Megan Harris saying, yes,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.450
we have wonderful records.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.750
We have oral histories.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.350
We have supplementary materials.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.800
She provided me with a
list of the names of women

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.780
that they had taken their
oral histories from,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.160
incredibly well organized.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.320
I came here for, you know,
several days and listened

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.200
and read to the -- to the women
who had told their stories,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.040
many of them are no longer
with us but, fortunately,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.640
their stories have been
collected and reside here,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.660
and many of them are
available digitally.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.370
And, so, in the end, I was able
to collect almost more material

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.710
than I could cope with
in reporting this book,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.230
both from living women and from
wonderful archival resources,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.880
like this collection, and able

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.250
to substantiate the
recollections of women

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.530
who are still alive with the
paper record with oral histories

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.050
of other women and other
supplementary information.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.390
So, I'm so grateful
to this institution

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.140
for facilitating research,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.360
for making American history
accessible to researchers,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.700
to citizens, to everybody,
and then for holding events

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.510
like this where, you
know, we can continue

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.640
to get the message out,
and for supporting authors,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.020
which is very important.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.910
So, it's really thrilling
to be here.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.210
It's also very thrilling

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.220
to be here during
women's history month.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.050
Originally, I was going to
be speaking at the beginning

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.930
of women's history month, and
now we've managed to squeak

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.880
in the rescheduled event
when it's still March,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.800
and that's really very
meaningful, because I think

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.940
that we are at, really, a
watershed moment in terms

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.530
of receptivity to
women's history.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.830
Of course, every month should
be women's history month.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.870
It should be everybody's
history month.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.120
But, this month does
have a special meaning.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.830
And I do think we're
at a great moment.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.320
I think books like Hidden
Figures, that have been

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.320
so successful in opening
up the contributions

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.740
that women have made to
American military history,

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.190
to American science, have
really persuaded publishers

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.950
that there's an audience
for these books,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.260
that people are receptive
to these stories.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.640
You may know that the New York
Times has started a new series

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.960
called Overlooked, in
which they're going back

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.000
through their archival
record and they're realizing

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.890
that incredibly important
women passed from the scene

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.370
and did not get obituaries,
including Charlotte Bronte.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.160
Women of, you know, of that
stature were not recognized

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.460
during their time.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.260
And, so, the New York Times
has this great new series

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.490
in which they're going back and
they're providing the obituaries

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.090
of women who should've gotten
recognition in their time,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.320
and I feel as though the
publishing industry is doing the

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.620
same thing today.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.540
And, so, it's thrilling
to be part of it.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.550
And, so, when talking about Code
Girls, about these thousands

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.800
of women who came to Washington
to join the U.S. military

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.530
and support the war effort,
I like to start with this --

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.890
with this slide, because it
really illustrates the plight

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.730
of the educated woman in 1942.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.630
This photo shows the May
Court at Goucher College

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.650
in the spring of 1942.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.270
Some of you may know,
Goucher College, back then,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.770
was an all-girl school.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.680
The women who went there
were called Goucher girls,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.980
and located in downtown
Baltimore,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.610
D.C. It's now a coeducational
University in suburban Towson.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.870
But, at the time, it
was a city school.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.700
Many of the young women who
attended there were city girls,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.560
who grew up in Baltimore,
who walked to classes,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.930
in some cases couldn't afford
to board because, of course,

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.100
they had grown up during the
depression, and who were very,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.960
very devoted and motivated

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.220
to get a great four-year
liberal arts education.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.150
Goucher was a very
well-respected university.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.740
It's Dean, Dorothy Stimson, was
a noted expert on Copernicus.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.450
The English professor,
Ola Winslow,

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.930
was the first American woman

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.130
to win a Pulitzer Prize
for her biography.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.540
So, top-notch faculty,
very top school.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.590
And these young women
were even more unusual

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.310
than they would've known,
because at this time

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.580
in American life, only 4%

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.120
of American women attained
a four-year college degree.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.440
And the reason that percentage
was so small was, in part,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.920
because so many schools
were still closed to women.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.700
So, many campuses
did not admit women.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.530
The Ivy league, for the most
part, was closed to women.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.750
Many, many private universities,
many state universities.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.170
In my home state of
Virginia, the University

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.020
of Virginia did not
give full degrees

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.720
to women really until
the 1960's.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.130
And, so, there were --

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.780
there were not a lot of
institutions to choose from.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.610
And, of course, these wonderful
women's colleges had been

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.640
founded in the late
19th century,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.360
at a time when many
people believed

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.120
that higher education
was bad for women,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.920
that it made women sort of,
you know, uppity and obnoxious.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.060
And there was actually a belief
that education wasn't good

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.510
for women, too much learning
wasn't good for women.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.310
There was a Harvard
physician who argued

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.400
that too much education made
women infertile, that it --

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.380
that it swelled their brains
at the expense of their wombs.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.040
He literally our argued
that, and people believed it.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.760
So, these women colleges,
like Goucher, had been created

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.790
at a time when they
had something to prove.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.090
They felt that they had to prove

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.970
that women deserved
an education,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.330
that it was worth educating
women, and that it was good

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.970
for women to be educated.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.090
But, of course, another
reason that the numbers were

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.630
so small is that
families realized

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.400
that there was not
an economic payoff

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.910
to educating a daughter the
way that there was for a son,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.790
because the professional
fields open

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.060
to educated women
were so limited.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.640
If you were a woman who was
motivated to become a doctor

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.970
or a lawyer or an architect or
a businesswoman or an engineer

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.070
or a scientist, you
would be lucky

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.800
to find a spot in
a graduate school.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.150
Many, many graduate schools
were closed to women.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.550
Many fields were
virtually closed to women.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.240
And, so, the only job you
could expect graduating

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.830
from a fine college really
reliably was teaching school,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.200
and that's great if you
want to be a schoolteacher.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.450
But, if there's another field
that you're interested in,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.670
then it prevents a very narrow
field of endeavor for women.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.640
And even then, only until you
get married can you expect a

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.940
school teaching job.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.090
Back then there was something
called a marriage bar.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.820
And, so, if a woman got
married she was required

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.050
to quit teaching, you
know, and to stay home

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.740
with her husband and her family.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.000
So, there wasn't a
great economic payoff

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.730
to getting a college
degree for women.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.800
And parents, again, coming out
of the depression, you know,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.520
they made that calculation.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.700
Now, of course, the other reason
for a woman to go to college,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.420
for which there might
be an economic payoff,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.100
was to get the proverbial
MRS degree,

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.130
which was a thing back then.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.540
The idea that if you went to
college then you can date men

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.990
at neighboring men's schools.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.240
You could marry a man
from a good family

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.990
or with good prospects,
you know,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.810
and you could get
yourself situated in life.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.900
Maybe you would teach for
a couple years to put him

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.650
through law school or whatever,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.060
but that there would be an
economic payoff to marriage.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.260
And, so, these young women, who
were academically motivated,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.320
who were very challenged
by their classes,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.470
were also very pressured,
particularly

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.890
in their senior year, to
get engaged, you know,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.500
to get that ring, to have
their future assured.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.420
And, so, these schools had
ceremonies, like the May Court.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.200
Now, as far as I can tell,
the May Court was some sort

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.650
of remnant of a pagan fertility
ritual in which the young women,

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.950
you know, selectively,

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.870
presumably because of their
beauty or their personality

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.910
or their family or their --
or their academic standing,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.330
would be elected
to the May Court.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.780
You see the queen up there in
the chair and they would be sort

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.650
of symbolically ushered
into the marriage market,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.470
and all of the women's
colleges had rituals like this.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.770
Wellesley College

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.560
in Massachusetts had the
senior class Hooproll.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.870
And the -- and the
legend of the Hooproll was

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.760
that the winner would be
the class' first bride.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.730
So, that was the
great distinction.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.750
And, so, and I interviewed
many of these women,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.720
and they remember
the intense pressure

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.440
to get married at the time.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.980
And Wellesley actually had
a section of the yearbook

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.440
that listed women
and their engagements

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.970
and who they were engaged
to, as well as women

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.440
who had gotten married
even before graduating

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.790
and had left college, in many
cases, in order to get married.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.170
So, again, that gives
you a sense

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.880
of how hard these women had
worked to get their schooling,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.840
but sort of the very limited
field of life prospects

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.040
that they were looking
at upon graduation.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.240
But, what I love about this
particular photo is that,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.470
unbeknownst to anybody,
including their colleagues

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.590
on the platform,
two of these women,

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.130
this is Jacqueline Jenkins,
that was her name at the time,

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.220
later on when she married she
would be Jacqueline Jenkins Nye,

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.300
the mother of Bill
Nye the Science Guy.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.820
So, you can get a sense
of her intellectual chops,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.100
as well as her friend,
Gwyneth Geminder.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.360
These two young women had
already been secretly selected

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.210
and tapped by the U.S. Navy and
they were receiving training

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.290
in cryptanalysis,
which was a field

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.770
that they would never
have heard of,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.640
that nobody had ever heard of.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.630
They were receiving
weekly instruction

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.010
in a locked classroom at the
top of Goucher Hall taught

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.320
by Ola Winslow, the English
teacher who, doubtless,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.890
was only maybe a chapter ahead
in the correspondence course

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.960
that the U.S. Navy had compiled
to teach them this arcane field

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.700
that had been around since
the time of Julius Caesar,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.090
or probably since the time that
human beings learned to write

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.940
or communicate at all,
because, you know,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.200
it is sort of human instinct
to send secret communications

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.950
to somebody who you have
an urgent message for,

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.480
and not have anybody else
be able to listen in.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.370
And, so, this field had been
around really for centuries,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.170
but not so much in the United
States, and nobody really

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.490
in the mainstream
had heard of it.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.840
And, so, they were being
taught all of a sudden,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.040
in great secrecy, they
couldn't tell their brothers,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.300
their boyfriends,
their family members,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.010
they couldn't tell their
roommates what they were doing.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.810
They were learning how
to take frequency counts.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.480
They were learning the behavior
of letters in English language,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.780
in the French language.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.960
They were learning how
alphabets could be scrambled,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.980
tables could be constructed
in order

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.450
to disguise secret
communications.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.660
And, the reason that was
happening, of course,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.910
was because in December
of 1941, on December 7,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.630
the Pacific fleet had been
attacked at Pearl Harbor.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.550
It was a great shock
and surprise

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.010
to the nation, to the world.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.680
It was a surprise attack.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.030
We hadn't seen it coming.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:25.340
We lost thousands of
young American servicemen.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.320
And, so, we were launched
formally into World War II.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.250
World War II, of
course, had been raging

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.680
in Europe for several years.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.050
We knew that we were going to
join the fighting at some point,

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.390
but we didn't know
that it was going

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.040
to happen abruptly
after December 7.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.820
The next day, of course,
Congress declares war on Japan.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.320
Three days later Germany
declares war on us.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.540
And, all of a sudden,
the U.S. is launched

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.930
into what was called total war.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.100
All the young men
signed up to fight.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.750
Japan thought that the attack
at Pearl Harbor would bring us

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.000
to our knees, that it
would demoralize us,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.410
that we would allow them to
keep the holdings in the Pacific

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.710
that they were conquering,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.110
even as they were bombing
Pearl Harbor, and it had --

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.270
it had opposite effect
on the American public.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.030
You know, we rose up in arms.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.890
Every family was determined to
contribute to the war effort.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.420
Every young man wanted to
be in military uniform.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.630
And, all of a sudden, all
the young men were shipping

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.110
out to the Pacific,
to islands, you know,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.810
that most Americans never heard
of, to the European theater.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.410
Men were sailing on
convoys going to Europe.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.170
It was just an evacuation
of the men at the --

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.290
so, at the same time
that suddenly we're going

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.830
to be fighting these battles,
you know, strung out thousands

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.830
of miles around the world,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.290
we know that we had no
intelligence agencies.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.570
We have no way of
knowing when there's going

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.870
to be another enemy attack,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.300
where the enemy is located,
if we want to attack.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.440
It's very hard to, sort of,
believe this in a day and time

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.470
when we have 17 intelligence
agencies in Washington,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.040
D.C. We had none of those when
we were entering World War II,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.710
when we needed intelligence
more than we ever had.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.010
We didn't have a CIA.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.310
We didn't have an NSA.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.180
We didn't have a Director
of National Intelligence.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.240
You know, we have intelligence
agencies now whose job is

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.240
to oversee other
intelligence agencies.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.350
We didn't have anything
like that back then.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.500
And, of course, we would form
the OSS very quickly and begin

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.030
to build a spy network overseas.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.170
But, the one thing we
could do right away is,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.300
ramp up our ability to intercept
the radio signals, the encrypted

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.280
and encoded radio signals
that military commanders,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.730
that politicians, that
diplomats were sending

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.880
through the airwaves, you
know, thousands of messages

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.420
on a daily basis
announcing their whereabouts,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.050
announcing their plans,
discussing their strategy.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.220
All of this was traveling
through the airwaves,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.650
typically by radio, sometimes by
telegraph, sent by Morse code,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.320
and encrypted the same way that
our incessant Internet messages

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.810
that we send every day,
our texts, our e-mails,

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.040
our Instagrams, our
Tweets, are often encrypted.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.130
That was what was happening,

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.860
is all of these militaries were
strung out all over the world.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.660
So, Admiral Donitz, who was
commanding his U-boat fleet,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.120
commanding each U-boat
individually, sending messages

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.330
to those boats every
day, we want to learn how

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.580
to snatch those signals
and break them.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.750
We had very small code breaking
operations, the U.S. Army

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.520
and the U.S. Navy,
before the war.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.460
So, we need to scale
up, basically.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.220
We need to scale those
operations in a massive way

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.360
at exactly the time that
the educated young men

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.130
that the military
normally would've turned

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.690
to to do this work, were
suddenly unavailable

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.990
because they were fighting.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.150
And, so, the U.S.
military makes a decision.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.070
If the educated young men
are unavailable to us,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.120
let's give the women a chance.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.560
Let's open up some
fields of endeavor

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.990
to smart, motivated women.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.070
And, so, when I was
doing my work also

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.000
at the National Archives
in College Park,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.190
which is a wonderful research
facility, and it's the opposite

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.560
of thin beer, I can assure you.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.600
There are thousands and
thousands of records

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.930
at the National Archives.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.530
I found this one, in
which some bureaucrat

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.620
at the U.S. Navy
got the bright idea,

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.120
the Navy had a small
correspondence course going

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.600
on for years in which they
would recruit, sort of,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.050
dabblers in cryptology.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.510
They would -- they would
try to bring in hobbyists,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.900
people who might join their
civilian code breaking force

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.250
in the 1930's.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.180
So, they had a correspondence
course already,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.520
and they would periodically
produce memos saying

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.100
where they were looking for
these kinds of people, these,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.350
you know, particular kinds
of brains they wanted.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.280
And, so, you can
see this memo says,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.730
new source, women's colleges.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.920
So, it's as though the light
bulb went on in somebody's head.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.160
Let's see what the women can do
and if they can do this work.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.440
And, the result of this memo
and the decision, and the fear

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.130
in the U.S. Navy that
another attack would happen

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.430
like Pearl Harbor, this was
a great intelligence failure.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.730
The Navy knew that.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.030
Careers were ended.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.380
People felt enormous guilt.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.030
They couldn't let this happen.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.770
So, in a moment of desperation
and crisis, let's be inclusive.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.190
Let's bring in the women.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.010
So, as a result of this,
women not only at Goucher,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.710
but at the Seven Sisters
Colleges in the northeast --

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.270
on the northeastern seaboard,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.710
the sort of elite women's
colleges that were seen

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.520
by the Navy as the counterpart
to the male Ivy league,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.400
senior women, who were
identified by their --

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.150
by their deans and
their professors,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.750
often math professors
and astronomy professors,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.350
would identify young women
who were talented at math,

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.640
at science, at languages,
but who also showed grit,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.780
who showed persistence,
who showed the willingness

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.500
to overcome frustration.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.180
They would secretly tap these
women who would be called in,

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.230
to their great surprise, and
would be asked two questions.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.600
Do you like crossword
puzzles and are you engaged

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.160
to be married [laughter]?

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.310
And if I answered yes to the
first and no to the second,

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.260
they would be invited to take
this secret Naval cryptanalytic

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.420
training course,
again, in great secrecy,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.300
during the course of
their senior year.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.740
Many of the women
were, in fact, engaged,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.650
because there was enormous
pressure on women to get married

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.690
as World War II started
and men were shipping out.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.650
They wanted to have somebody
waiting for them at home

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.710
and they wanted to have
somebody to write to.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.020
So, a lot of the
women lied actually.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.590
Although they were engaged,
whatever they were being invited

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.940
to do sounded a lot more
interesting than sitting

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.940
around waiting to see if
their brothers would be okay,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.240
or their boyfriends
would be okay.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.180
They wanted to join
the war effort.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.480
So, they lied.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.780
They said they weren't engaged.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.620
They took the course and they
came to Washington, D.C. in --

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.290
to work as civilians in June
of 1942, at exactly the time

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.280
when the Battle of Midway, which
was one of the great sea battles

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.020
of all time, it was our first
payback for Pearl Harbor,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.980
showed the U.S. military,
secretly,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.490
because the public didn't
know or shouldn't know,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.470
how important code breaking was
going to be to the war effort.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.260
This was a time when
we did not know

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.700
that we were going
to win World War II.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.090
It was not a for
ordained conclusion.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.580
There was enormous concern
that we might not prevail.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.370
You know, the Atlantic Coast
was with besieged by U-boats.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.340
There was enormous fear in the
American public, but the Battle

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.530
of Midway was the beginning of
a turning point in the Pacific,

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.050
and it turned on brilliant
code breaking that warned us

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.500
that the Japanese were
en route ambush us and,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.930
basically, finish us off.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.230
And, instead, we were able

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.750
to ambush the Japanese
fleet and win that battle.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.880
And, so, that signaled to
the people who needed to know

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.930
that code breaking
was to be important.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.270
And the women started pouring in
from the Seven Sisters Colleges

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.820
at exactly the moment when we
knew how important this was

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.120
going to be.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.280
But, meanwhile, the U.S.
Army also needs to compete

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.890
for educated women, because
the setup at our entry

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.100
into the war is that the
UK has lead code breaking

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.820
responsibility for the Atlantic
Ocean and the European theater.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.890
So, if you've seen The
Imitation Game, you've heard

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.870
about the other great
code breaking success,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.030
which is our breaking
of the enigma cipher,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.480
England's breaking of the
enigma cipher and the ability

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.720
to read the German messages that
were controlling the U-boats,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.460
as well as the movements
of the --

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.090
of the Air Force and the Army.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.320
So, when we enter the war
we have a vested stake

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.600
in the Atlantic as well,
because we're sending our boys

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.260
on convoys through the Atlantic,
which is riddled with U-boats.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.890
So, we care, but
we're going to --

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.460
we're going to be
the junior partner

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.890
in that code breaking efforts.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.990
But, meanwhile, we have lead

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.150
and really sole code
breaking responsibility

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.350
in the vast, vast Pacific Ocean.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.260
So, the U.S. Navy, which
has just recruited the women

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.240
from the Seven Sisters School
and Goucher and other schools,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.400
is going to be working primarily
the Japanese naval fleet code,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400
which is the major code system

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.670
that is being used
by the Japanese Navy.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.640
But, the Japanese army has a
completely different system

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.820
and they're now spread out all
over -- all over the Pacific.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.120
They've taken the Philippines.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.370
They've taken islands around
the Pacific, landmasses.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.110
And, again, they are
communicating through signals.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.890
And our U.S. Army
has responsibility

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.750
for those signal
systems, and they need

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.050
to recruit women as well.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.200
So, they figure -- they make
a different calculation.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.230
They figure, okay,
our competitors

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.840
in the U.S. Navy have
the eastern seaboard,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.580
and so we're going to
compete for school teachers.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.770
We're going to turn
to teaching colleges,

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.110
which were the other
institutions

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.000
that existed to educate women.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.630
So, for example, Dorothy Ramale,
who I interviewed for my book,

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.370
was out was at Indiana
State Teachers College

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.670
in Indiana, Pennsylvania.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.780
She had grown up in
rural Pennsylvania.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.450
She wanted to be a math teacher.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.240
That was -- that was
an ambitious aspiration

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.400
for a woman, because women were
not encouraged to go into math.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.200
They were sometimes
not hired as teachers,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.830
but that's what she wanted
to do, that was her passion.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.040
And she was called in by the
Dean of Women and invited

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.420
to take the Army's secret
cryptanalytic training course.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.450
But, even women in teachers'
colleges weren't going

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.290
to be enough for the enormous
code breaking operations

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.710
that we were going
to have to establish.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.920
So, the Army decided they would
also go after school teachers,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.330
young women who were
actually teaching school.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.630
They were going to be young.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.930
They were going to
be hard-working.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.230
They were going to be single.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.530
They were going to
be well-educated,

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.830
and they were going
to be underpaid.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.190
And, so, they were going
to be extremely motivated

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.360
to take better paying work
with the war department.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.210
So, the Army's strategy was to,

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.210
and I literally found
oral histories

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.260
in which commanders
congratulated themselves

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.430
for their strategy, they
were thinking that --

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.590
they decided to send their
handsomest young army officers

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.620
out to lurk in hotels and post
offices, at recruiting stations,

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.600
particularly around
the American south.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.550
They were recruiting
women as civilians,

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.450
and the bureaucratic rules can
find them at first in Virginia,

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.010
North Carolina, South
Carolina, and West Virginia.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.100
The thinking was that
southern women were practically

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.530
susceptible to the charms of
a handsome man, and that all

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.120
of these hard-working, smart,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.730
young school teachers would be
motivated to come to Washington

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.190
to do secret war work, thinking
that they would marry a man

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.500
who looked like the
recruiting officer.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.990
And what I love about
that thinking,

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.010
about women's motivation, is
that my [inaudible] character,

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.950
Dot Braden, who is still
alive and going strong,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.480
represents just sort of how
wrong-headed that strategy was.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.340
Like many young American women,

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.780
she was engaged,
but unwillingly so.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.080
Her college boyfriend
had sent her a ring

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.120
from training camp
in California.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.230
Women were told not to
upset morale of the troops.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.580
She didn't want to get married.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.270
She didn't want to get
married right out of college.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.830
She didn't particularly
want to marry this guy.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.920
She liked him, but she didn't
envision spending the rest

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.220
of her life with him.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.510
Like she wanted an excuse not
to have to get married and go

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.450
to his training camp
in California.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:21.640
And, so, the prospect of war
work in Washington gave her an

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.760
out from what would've been her

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.610
for ordained sort
of life trajectory.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.400
It gave her an excuse
not to go to California.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.980
She also motivated, because
she was the oldest daughter

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.280
in a family of four.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.670
She had two younger brothers who
were already in the U.S. Army,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.130
one of them right
out of high school,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.560
literally the day he
graduated from high school.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.450
So, like all American families,
she had a very personal interest

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.970
in the outcome of the war.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.300
The Braden family was typical

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.110
in that they were volunteering
everything they could

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.410
to the war effort.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.980
People were donating
pots and pans.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.050
They were picking up rubber
bands from the street.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.390
The Braden family tried to
donate their family dog,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.640
Poochie, to train
to become a war dog.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.600
She still has the single spaced
letter that they got back

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.490
from the Army War Dog Training
Center saying thank you

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.780
for your -- for your
contribution, or for your offer,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.760
unfortunately, we have an age
camp on our -- on our war dogs,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.360
and Poochie was too old.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.100
So, Poochie had to stay home.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.750
But, that's how motivated people
were to join the war effort.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:21.530
And, so, Dot was also in
her first year of teaching

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.250
at Chatham High School, all
the male teachers had left,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.520
many of the female teachers
had left to marry the man.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.550
So, she was teaching English,
French, Latin, physics,

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.870
something called hygiene.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.950
She was incredibly burdened
by her teaching load.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.330
She was making $900 a month
teaching school in Chatham.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.980
She came home to her mom
in Lynchburg and she said,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.630
I just can't do that anymore.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.400
Her mom said, well, there
are these recruiters

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.520
at the Virginia Hotel
in Lynchburg.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.820
Go see what they want.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.670
So, when Dot walked
through the hotel door,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.430
she didn't care whether that
recruiter was good-looking.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.050
She knew that this was war
work, that it was important,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.200
that it was in Washington, D.C.
Lynchburg was three hours away

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.530
from Washington, D.C.
She had never been there.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.120
She grew up during
the depression.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.420
People didn't travel.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.060
She had never seen the big city.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.500
This was an opportunity
to join the war effort,

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.660
to try to help her brothers,
and to make $1660 working

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.960
for the war department,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.280
which was almost twice what
she would make it as a teacher.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.950
So, like thousands of other
southern school teachers,

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.760
Dot got on the train one
morning and came to Washington,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.050
D.C. and found herself in Union
Station with a little bit amount

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.200
of money in her pocketbook and
no idea what she had signed

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.910
up to do, because
this recruiting

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.120
of school teachers were
taking place in public.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.210
They couldn't even tell the
women what they had signed

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.510
up for.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.430
She took a cab to Arlington,
Virginia, and she found herself

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.660
at what had, up until
recently, been a junior college.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.990
And junior colleges
were a thing back then.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.370
They were a way to give
women some education

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.470
without giving them
too much education.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.480
So, they basically
amounted to two years

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.780
of high school and two years.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.200
The women could get
some English, some math,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.390
maybe some French,
some piano, and typing,

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.690
some horseback riding.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.990
You know, the kinds of things

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.710
that would prepare
them for adulthood.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.410
So, the Army needed
a big secure,

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.010
off the beaten path compound
for its code breaking effort.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.580
So, it kicked the girls out.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.700
It requisitioned Arlington Hall.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.720
It built enormous
temporary buildings

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.060
where the writing pads had been.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.900
And it routed these
southern school teachers

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.110
into these massive, hot,
temporary buildings.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.840
The first day in Washington, Dot
had no idea what she was signing

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.480
up to do, but she had
to sign a loyalty oath

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.420
to the U.S. government, she had
to sign a secrecy oath agreeing

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.770
that she would never
talk about it.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.070
It was wartime.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.180
The penalty for revealing
top-secret work was death,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.820
and so knew that
whatever she was going

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.140
to be doing she would be shot
if she told anybody about it.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.140
So, that was her
welcome to Washington.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.700
All of the women who came to
do this work would be told

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.500
that if anybody asked
them what they were doing

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.630
in these compounds they were to
say that they were secretaries,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.150
that they sharpened pencils,
they emptied wastebaskets,

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.790
they did unimportant work.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.210
Some said that they
sat on the laps

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.200
of their commanding officers.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.550
Everybody believed that,
because they were women.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.550
The work they were
doing had to be trivial.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.680
And, so, in that -- in that way
they were the ideal intelligence

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.280
officers of the time,
because people just assumed

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.230
that whatever they were
doing inside these top-secret

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.410
compounds it couldn't be really
important to the war effort.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:24.290
But, instead, Dot
joined classrooms

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.120
where school teachers were very
hastily instructed, in this case

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.150
in the geography of Asia.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.950
These are women who would
be receiving the messages

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.690
that we intercepted
from the Pacific.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.090
We would encrypt them
with own encryption,

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.180
send them to Arlington Hall.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.410
We would -- we would strip
out the American encryption

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.000
and then school teachers,
like Dot,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.900
would get started
on the messages.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.910
This is the room that
Dot would've worked in.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.830
You can see all of these
young women working at tables.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.670
She still has a hard
time believing

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.970
that she had joined
what would be the third

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.910
of the three most important
code breaking triumphs

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.210
of World War II.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.080
So, one of them was
the Battle of Midway.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.250
One of them was breaking
of the enigma cipher.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.390
But, the third, which
doesn't get as much attention

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.970
because it's not like a
single dramatic moment,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.990
was our relentless shipping --

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.900
sinking of the ships that were
supplying the Japanese army all

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.200
around the Pacific.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.400
The Japanese were on
islands, for the most part.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.920
they had to be regularly
supplied with water, with food,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.510
with fuel, with medicine,
with spare airplane parts,

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.970
with reinforcement troops, all
of that was brought by ship.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.280
Those ships were sending
messages every day saying

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.190
where they were coming from,
where they were going to.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.810
It was a complicated
system called an enciphered

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.110
code system.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.880
A word like [inaudible] for
supply ship would be rendered

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.810
as a four-digit code group.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.570
Another four digits
would be added to that

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.940
to change the numbers, that was
an early form of encryption,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.070
and that would be sent by Morse
code through the airwaves.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.140
We would snatch that
out of the air.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.330
The school teachers would start
stripping out that encryption,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.550
stripping out the
extraneous numbers,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.740
to get down to the code
group, and then trying

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.100
to figure out what they meant.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.840
Because they did their work
so well, because they did it

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.370
so rapidly, Dot remembers
running to get the messages

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.410
to the next stage, we were able

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.260
to sink thousands
of supply ships.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.170
The information in the
messages would be sent

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.580
to American submarine
commanders, who would be waiting

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.240
when the supply ships appeared.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.600
They were relentlessly sunk.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.900
And, the result of that,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.580
was that most Japanese
army deaths were the result

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.270
of starvation and disease.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.050
That's how well the school
teachers did their job.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.440
Dot remembers that she would
get the message along as far

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.740
as she could, and
she would take it

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.370
to a woman called
the overlapper.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.480
And she was very nervous
about speaking that word,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.780
because the women
were told never

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.360
to even utter certain words
on the streets of Washington.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.150
Overlap was a term of
art, and if they spoke it

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.910
on the street maybe somebody
from the access would overhear.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.090
So, when I did my interview
with her, or my many interviews

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.680
with her, she had never even
used the word overlapper,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.340
and she felt uneasy
about saying it even now.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.000
But, what she remembered,
and this is --

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.140
this is one my favorite
parts of the story,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.650
is that the overlapper
was a woman named Miriam,

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.380
and she was from New York
City, because there were women

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.800
who were recruited from
northern colleges as well.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.100
And Dot remembers Miriam

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.320
as being the most condescending
northerner she had ever met.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.600
And I'm from the same part
of Virginia that Dot is,

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.170
so I somewhat identified
with this part

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.520
of the story, I have to admit.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.830
And she recalled that Miriam
would make fun of her accent,

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.800
would make fun of
her southern accent.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.770
And it's true that at
Arlington Hall, you know,

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.740
even as American GI's were
going all over the world

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.730
at great peril and
risk to their lives,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.110
they were seeing the South
Pacific, they were seeing Paris,

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.600
these women were
coming together,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.390
they were seeing Washington,
and they were meeting women

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.020
from other parts of the country.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.750
So, but they were also
having to function with them

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.050
in a workplace, and it was
incredibly important work,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.950
but it was also a government
workplace, and Miriam got

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.570
on Dot's nerves because
the women clashed.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.370
They were from different
parts of the country.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.080
The northerners tended
to see the southern women

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.950
as being less well-educated.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.490
There were also men working
at the code breaking facility

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:58.120
who were too old
for the fighting,

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.850
so there were many distinguished
men from publishing circles

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.980
in New York City who
came down to work

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.900
in the code breaking
operation as well,

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.740
and one of them referred to the
southern women as the jewels.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.850
And the reason he called
them that was because he felt

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.690
so many southern
women were named Opel

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.930
or Pearl or Ruby or Emerald.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.480
And, I have to admit, when
I went through the rosters

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.640
at the National Archives, there
were a lot of women named Ruby

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.720
and Emerald and Pearl, and
there were also some Jewels.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.340
And one of the women that I
interviewed for this book,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.120
Jewel S. Mocker [assumed
spelling] in South Carolina,

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.940
she was a graduate of Winthrop
College in South Carolina.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.980
She was a high school
band director

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.700
when she was recruited
to do this work.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.780
And musical talent
is also a marker

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.080
for code breaking ability,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.380
because it involves the
ability to follow patterns.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.840
So, I have to -- I have to grant
that there were a fair amount

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.780
of southern women who
had jewel-like names.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.520
I love this photo, because the
woman that you see laughing

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.190
down at her work sitting
next to dead plant,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:54.420
she had been recruited
as an English major

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.200
out of Russell Sage
College outside of New York.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.980
And she, working with a West
Virginia school teacher named

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.990
Wilma Berryman, those two women
broke a separate code system

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.160
that appended every
Japanese army message.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.460
It was the address.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.530
It was the address of
where it was coming to

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.910
and where it was destined
for, the person sending it,

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.750
the rank of the person sending
it, the person receiving it,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.170
the rank of that
person, and a vast amount

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.310
of useful information for our
military to have because we want

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.480
to know where the Japanese
are, where they're going to,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.780
who they're communicating with.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.080
If a flurry of messages
is going to new location,

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.990
maybe something is
being planned.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.360
So, thanks to their breaking

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.880
of that particular
message system we were able

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.570
to provide the Pentagon every
day with something called order

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.980
of battle, that showed where
the Japanese army was located

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.420
and where messages, new
messages, were being sent to.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.320
So, that was incredibly
important intelligence.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.480
These women were
generating intelligence,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.280
that the Pentagon was actually
breathing down their neck to get

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.880
that order of battle
report every day.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.110
Just to give you a
sense of how many code

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.040
and cipher systems were
in play during the war,

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.180
the Japanese diplomats, who
were stationed in Europe,

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.000
in all the occupied countries,
all the access countries,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.300
they were communicating back

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.080
with Tokyo using a completely
different cipher system.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.000
It was a machine that scrambled
Romanized Japanese into,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.020
you know, unintelligible
gibberish.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.750
We had broken that machine
system before the war thanks

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.370
to a woman named
Genevieve Grotjan.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.440
We were reading all of those
diplomatic communications.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.880
One of the most important
bits of intelligence we got

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.930
from the Japanese
diplomats about Europe was

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.640
when they were invited
to tour the coast

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.680
of France before D-day.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.460
They dutifully reported back
to Tokyo on where the coast

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.930
of France was well
fortified and where it wasn't.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.580
So, we knew that when we were
planning the Allied landing

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.110
that Normandy would be
a better place to land

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.580
than other parts of
the French coast.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.890
So, that's the kind of
information that we were getting

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.690
from these code breaking
operations.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.270
Again, this just gives you a
sense of the number of women

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.710
who were doing this work.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.310
There was also an
African-American code breaking

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.420
unit at Arlington Hall.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.030
The U.S. Army was segregated
during World War II.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.540
So, the code breaking operation
was segregated as well.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.840
This was a secret unit.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.230
A lot of the white workers
didn't even know about it.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.770
But, this group of very
well-educated, very dedicated,

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.160
probably former school teachers,
who had attained their education

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.240
in a -- in a segregated
U.S. education system,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.860
were lending their talents to
breaking the codes and ciphers

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.190
of the private sector.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.370
So, just as banks and
companies today encrypt all

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.510
of their financial
communication when they send it

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.010
over the Internet, so, too,
were they doing that back then.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.640
This unit was reading the
codes and ciphers of banks

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.230
and companies to see who was
doing business with Hitler,

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.930
who was doing business
with Japanese companies

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.950
like Mitsubishi,
because, of course,

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.270
they weren't supposed
to be doing that.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.770
So, this was very
important work,

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.740
and this was a very unsung unit.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.160
They were also doing early
cipher security, looking for --

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.850
to make sure that
our encrypted traffic

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.000
that we were sending
was more secure

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.710
than the code systems
that we were reading.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.720
They were also planning
deception programs,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.600
creating something
called dummy traffic,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.010
that would persuade the enemy,

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.160
just because of the
signals we were sending,

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.400
would persuade the enemy
that we had troops stationed

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.700
where none existed.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.780
And, again, before
the D-Day landings,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.150
this dummy traffic
persuaded the Germans

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.090
that we had Allied troops
ready to invade Calais.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.670
So, they thought the
main landing was going

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.080
to come in Calais.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.440
So, meanwhile, during World War
II, this is the tipping point,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.140
this is the first really major
experiment with admitting women

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.310
into the military, and the
decision was made in 1942

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.150
to admit women into the Army,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.100
and also to admit
women into the Navy.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.680
It was a hard-fought battle.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.170
Many of the deans and professors

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.250
at the women colleges
really pressed the Navy

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.570
to admit young women.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.400
They saw this as an
opportunity, again,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.920
to expand opportunities
for their graduates.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.940
So, the women who came to
Washington, you saw them

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.710
in those frilly dresses at the
beginning, they ultimately --

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.250
the Navy wanted its female
code breakers to be --

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.020
to be subject to
military discipline

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.620
and the military hierarchy.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.280
So, they were trained to
become naval officers.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.060
So, you can see them here.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.630
Actually, they're
crossing Nebraska Avenue.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.060
The Navy also needed a lot more
space than it had downtown,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.530
so it commandeered
Mount Vernon Seminary,

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.600
which was on Nebraska
Avenue where Department

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.300
of Homeland Security is now.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.600
Kicked those girls out.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.900
The girls had to take classes

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.780
at Garfinkel's Department Store
while they were finding a place

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.530
to study, and they set up a
massive code breaking operation.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.830
The women were housed

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.130
in barracks near
American University.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.960
You can see them
crossing the street.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.700
So, this was a great moment
for women to join the military.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.500
It was also a moment when women,
who had not had the benefit

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.200
of a college education,
could enlist, you know,

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.270
could enlist as ordinary seamen.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.990
And when they took
their aptitude tests,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.970
if they tested high for ability,
you know, and for the sort

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.150
of the right kind of
intellectual skills like math

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.460
and languages, they
would be secretly routed

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.780
into the code breaking
operation.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.520
So, again, this was a great
coming together of women

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.000
from all over the country,
women from Colorado.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.310
The Navy was looking for
librarians, people who knew how

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.710
to keep great records.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.650
So, women came from Colorado,
from California, from Oklahoma.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.950
They got on troop trains.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.250
They traveled for days.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.670
They went to boot camp
and officer training camp,

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:07.970
and they came together,

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.230
thousands of women
working at these compounds.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.590
One of my favorite anecdotes
about the coming together

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.310
of these women, one of the women
I interviewed for this book,

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:17.760
Jane Case, actually came

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.170
from a very affluent
family in New York City.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.970
She grew up in Auburn, New York
and then on the upper east side

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.920
of New York City, a very --
a very sort of debutante kind

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.760
of society that she was kind of
expecting to have to be part of.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760
When the -- when the
war started she, again,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.120
wanted to do anything she could.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.390
She desperately wanted to
enlist in the U.S. Navy.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.690
Her parents didn't want her to.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:40.990
There was a lot of stigma

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.580
at first associated
with these women.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.210
They were considered
to be bad women.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.340
There were whisper
campaigns against them.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.390
The thinking was, that they
were being put into the military

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.580
to service the man sexually.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.180
And, so, some parents didn't
want their daughters joining up,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.940
but Jane was determined.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.690
So, she took the subway
down to Wall Street

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.790
where there was a naval
recruiting station.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.300
She expected that she would
go in with an officer,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.420
as an officer because she came
from such an upper-class family,

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.560
and she knew she'd have
to pass an eye exam.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.030
So, she had -- and she
was very, very nearsighted

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.350
and she had memorized the
eyechart in order to make it

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.650
through the eye exams.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.440
She slipped her spectacles
in her pocket.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.670
And she did make it through the
eye exam, but she didn't know

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.750
that there were going to be a
lot of other medical stations,

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.010
including a gynecological
exam, which was a shock

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.310
for a lot of the women.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.300
But, there was also
a physical exam.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.890
And men, at the time,

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.560
were forced to undergo a group
naked physical to join the Navy.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.990
The Navy was trying to
figure out whether, you know,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.580
it should sort of do the
same things for women

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.880
that it was doing for man.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.030
So, the women had a naked
group physical as well,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:43.180
and Jane still remembers the
shock of being told to disrobe,

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.480
and then she remembers

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.810
that a petty officer drew the
number nine between her breasts

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.350
and said, okay, go stand
between eight and 10,

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.790
and never had never seen another
woman without her clothes on,

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.200
and because she was so
nearsighted, she not only had

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.600
to look, she had to
really peer in order to --

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.980
in order to figure out where
she was supposed to stand.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.160
So, she remembers that
fondly as sort of, you know,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.480
you're in the Navy now.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.270
And this was -- this was -- this
was something quite different

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.640
than the debutante society
she had been raised to.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.830
And when she -- and she also
found that, she had gone

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.620
to music school after
graduating from high school,

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.430
the Navy didn't consider
that to be equivalent

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.730
of two years of college.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.040
So, she went in as
an ordinary seaman.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.770
She went in as an
enlisted woman,

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:26.110
and because of her ability with
math, her dad was a physicist,

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.580
and because of her
chops, she was routed

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.010
into the code breaking operation
as well, and she loved it.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.860
Her first roommate
was from the Midwest

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.110
and her dad was an undertaker

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.600
and gave his daughter a music
box in the shape of a casket.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.110
And, so, that was Jane's
introduction to sort

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.140
of other American
decorating schemes

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.800
that she had not grown up with.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.140
So, the Navy women worked
at this huge compound.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.310
I found these photographs in
the National Archives just kind

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.650
of swimming around in files.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.620
As you can see, I had to
get them declassified,

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.870
but they're wonderful
photos of the interior

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.680
of the Navy code breaking unit.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.680
The women were working the
Japanese naval fleet code.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.860
You can see on the table massive
stacks of Japanese messages.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.050
Jane remembered, we could
tell what was happening

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.480
in the Pacific because the
stack would get larger.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.160
They had to make decisions about
which messages were important.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.640
They had to push them along
as fast as they could.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.940
They, too, had to strip

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.080
out numerical encipherment
called additives in order to get

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.690
down to the code groups.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.140
They were under incredible
pressure.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.030
They knew that their
brothers were in the Pacific.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.930
They were sometimes breaking
messages that told the location

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.050
and the -- and the whereabouts
and the fate of their brothers'

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.350
and their boyfriends' ships.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.650
They knew the stakes.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.560
I found memos in the
National Archives

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.450
in which their officers
would say,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.170
you all recovered 2000
additives last month.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.560
We need more this month.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.670
You know, we're planning to
push back across the Pacific.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.620
We want to retake
the Philippines.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.080
This work is incredibly
important.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.070
We need to know where
the enemy is.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.000
And, so, we need you all
to work harder and faster.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.170
And I would see memos
congratulating them,

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.830
for not only meeting their
quota, but for exceeding it.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.890
So, this will show you, this
is one of the worksheets.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:04.240
The Japanese naval fleet code
was a five-digit enciphered

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.540
code system.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.840
I just love these worksheets.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.160
Again, they're swimming in
files at the National Archives,

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.470
but they give you a sense of the
brain work that the women had

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.950
to do in order to
recover these additives.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.610
I also love this table.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.840
Again, it shows you how
many different code systems

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.140
there were.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.280
This was a completely
different system.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.240
It was a lesser system
that the Japanese Navy,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.840
sort of an ad hoc system, they
set up, completely different.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.630
It was letters, not numbers.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:32.100
There was a group of women from
Wellesley who were assigned

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.080
to work the interisland cipher.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.980
It had a key that changed
every month, and they had

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.380
to break back into the
-- into the system.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.390
They had to determine the new
key that was being used to sort

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.230
of control the system
every month.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.030
And they got so good at that,
and I found records talking

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.930
about how good they were at
that, but they could sort

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.890
of work really hard for five
days and then go a little bit

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.790
on autopilot for the
rest of the month.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.680
And you remember, that these
women were living unchaperoned

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.720
for the first time in
their lives in Washington,

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.530
D.C. There was a lot of alcohol

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.150
in Washington during
World War II.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.240
And, if the women
were naval officers,

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.540
they could live in group houses.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.840
They didn't have to
live in barracks.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.140
So, they could have parties.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.420
And the Wellesley
women had big blowouts.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.350
And I found an oral history
of their commanding officer,

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.110
who very much admired
their intelligence,

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.570
but also admired their
partying spirits.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.650
He would remember that
one of the mathematicians

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.480
in particular, a math major
from Wellesley would come to him

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.110
and ask, when is she going
to have her next big party?

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.510
And he would look at the wall
map and he would say, okay,

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.310
the key is going to change
at X day of the month,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.070
you can have your party
two weeks before that,

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.910
because then you can
recover from your hangovers

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.800
for two weeks before you have
to really apply your intellect.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.970
But, again, to give you
a sense of the stakes,

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.950
in April of 1942 we received
messages in the Pacific saying

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.250
that Admiral Yamamoto,

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.150
who commanded the Japanese naval
fleet, and was the mastermind

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.740
of Pearl Harbor, was going to
be making an inspection tour

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.180
of the Solomon Islands.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.350
The interisland cipher was part
of this set of communications.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.500
Men in the Pacific,
American men in the Pacific,

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.760
got busy on the naval
fleet code messages.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.040
These women got busy on
the interisland cipher.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.000
They put together his exact
itinerary down to the minute

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.740
so that we were able to send
planes up and shoot his plane

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.000
out of the air and
basically make the decision

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.250
to assassinate an
enemy commander.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.070
And the women remembered
that cheering went

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.350
up in the naval code breaking
compound when they knew

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.020
that the admiral's plane
had been shot down.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.730
Of course, the American public
and the Japanese could not know

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:24.030
that it happened as a result

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.330
of code breaking,
but the women knew.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.170
And it's important, I think,

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.720
to point out that they felt
great satisfaction at the time

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.960
when they knew that their
work had actually contributed

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.030
to the sinking of a convoy
or a fleet or to the downing

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.590
of an important airplane.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.070
It was, you know, it was war.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.370
We wanted to win it.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.830
They knew that lives
were at stake, again,

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.130
of their brothers
and boyfriends.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.480
They knew that America was at
stake and freedom was at stake.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.050
So, they -- you know, they
wanted to win and they wanted

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:49.440
to do what had to be done.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.970
Later on in their
lives they would come

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:54.070
to have more complex
feelings about the, you know,

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.220
lethal work that
they were part of,

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.140
but at the time there
were no second thoughts.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.220
So, just to quickly point out,

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.100
we eventually really became the
senior partner in the breaking

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.120
of the enigma cipher that
Admiral Donitz was using

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.770
to command his U-boats.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.860
The Germans suspected that we
were reading their code system.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.620
They changed the enigma machine

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.050
that was being used
by the U-boats.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.860
They added an extra rotor that
scrambled the messages even more

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.800
than they had been
scrambled before.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.770
And, so, the American industrial
resources had to get involved

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.520
to build these giant machines

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.700
that could handle a
four-rotor enigma machine.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.530
The old one had been three
rotors, and now we needed sort

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.370
of more heavy-duty,
faster machines.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.720
And, so, the Americans designed
and built these machines

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.330
that were secretly
transported, again,

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.240
to the naval code
breaking compound.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.610
For me, one of the most
moving, and, ultimately,

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:47.430
it was really women who were
working the German enigma

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.730
cipher system.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.030
It involved a lot of math.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.970
It involved designing early
computer menus in order

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.350
to break into those messages.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.940
And one of the most moving
chapters to me of the book was

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.260
when the women join the
midnight watch on the --

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.640
on the night of June 6,
early morning June 5,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.430
and then going into June 6.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.600
They knew that the D-Day
landings were going to happen.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.240
They didn't know when
they were going to happen.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.540
It was a full moon.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.010
They assumed that was not ideal
for a secret Allied landing,

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.200
so they thought it wasn't
going to happened on the 6th.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.980
But, they remember
that at about 1:30

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.270
in the morning our time they
started getting messages.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.230
You know, the machines
started spinning.

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:22.820
The German's started chattering.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.620
And it was -- they
were experiencing --

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.540
these women were
experiencing the D-Day landings

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.840
from the point of
view of the Germans.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.250
And the first messages were
basically German, you know,

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.980
officers saying -- seeing
thousands and thousands

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.520
of Allied ships on the
horizon saying, oh my God,

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.960
the landing is happening and
it's happening in Normandy.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.630
And, so, the women remembered
all that night just working

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.090
as fast as they could to
break the German messages.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.020
So, they were in
the unique position

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.090
of experiencing the D-Day
landing from the point of view

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.950
of the Germans, who
were communicating

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.350
about what was going on.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.170
So, they knew the
landings were happening.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.590
They knew that they had brothers
and boyfriends and fiances

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.120
that were making the landing.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.070
They didn't know
how it was going.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.370
You know, they couldn't tell

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.670
from the German messages
everything

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.970
about the D-Day invasion.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.370
So, they were really
overwhelmed by the enormity

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.810
of what they were part of.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:09.110
And, at the end of their --

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:11.650
of their midnight shift
they remember taking the bus

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:15.060
to National Cathedral and then
going into Saint Albans Chapel,

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.830
which was open 24 seven
during World War II,

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.360
and praying because
they didn't know,

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.660
you know, what the outcome was.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.270
They didn't know how
many lives had been lost.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.260
And a number of them had,
in fact, lost their fiances

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.290
in the invasion and they
just didn't know that yet,

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.240
because they hadn't
got a telegraph.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.370
These are some photos
of my central character.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.610
You can see Dot Braden
behind the pole.

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:34.910
At the same time, again,

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:37.210
that they were doing this
incredibly serious, urgent,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.240
stressful work, they were having
a good time in Washington.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.000
They were writing lots of men.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.550
My central character was
actually writing half a

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.850
dozen men.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.760
She was, in some ways, more
reluctant to confess that to me

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.890
than she was to talk about
her secret code breaking work.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.260
She disentangle herself
from her engagement,

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.310
and ultimately married one of
the men that she was writing to.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:58.980
Had a very happy marriage.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.470
She became best friends with
a school teacher from Bourbon,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.760
Mississippi, Ruth Weston,
an incredible mathematician,

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.090
who would go on to work for
the NSA as a mathematician.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.660
The women remained best friends
for the rest of their lives.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.940
You can see them there
with their husbands.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.380
They remained such
close friends.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.130
After the war they could
never talk to each other

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:17.460
about their code breaking work.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.940
They didn't even know
that they were part

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.890
of the same code breaking effort
to break the supply ships.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.530
They knew they both worked
in the same compound,

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:25.320
but they were terrified
of talking

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.750
about their work either
before or after the war.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.500
All of these women were
told at the end of the war,

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.550
thanks very much
for your efforts.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.100
You saved thousands of lives.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.190
You shorten the war
by at least a year.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.910
Now, never tell anybody
what you did.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:40.080
And, so, they went into
later life never talking

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.380
about this work.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.610
Dot's brothers both
survived the war.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.310
They -- both of her
brothers would take jobs

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.410
that involved top-secret
security clearances.

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.710
They would get together and brag

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.140
about their secret
security clearances.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.460
Dot could never tell them

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.790
that she also had a
top-secret security clearance.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.910
So, that's the kind of thing
that the women had to put

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.840
up with for decades and decades
for the rest of their lives.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.250
But, they remained so close that
their children, for a long time,

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:03.550
thought they were cousins.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.990
Their children thought they
were related to each other,

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.330
because they knew that their --

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.140
that these two women
shared a great friendship,

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.910
as well as a secret, some secret

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:11.820
about what they had
done during the war.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.850
This is a group of
Naval enlisted women

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:17.470
who also remained great
friends after the war was over.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.920
Only one of them is
still alive, Ruth Mirsky,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.390
who you can see in
the striped shirt.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:23.560
And her e-mail, when
she communicates

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.450
with me, it's Ruth the Wave.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.980
So, you know, at
95 she's on e-mail

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.850
because they were code girls
then and they're code girls now.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.780
And this work, although
they couldn't talk about it

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.550
for 75 years, remained so
important to them that would,

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.840
you know, that she chose
that as her e-mail address.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.890
And I just wanted to end
with a couple of quick videos

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.800
that give you a sense of the
women talking about their work,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.660
talking about what was important
to them, and remembering,

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.970
you know, some of their
most memorable experiences.

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.270
So, this is Dot.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.100
&gt;&gt; With my two suitcases, my
umbrella, and my raincoat,

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.720
I went down to the train.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.520
Now, my uncle had to
take me down there.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:15.230
No car. And my mother and her
sister were standing there

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.560
crying when I got on the train.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.460
I was very secure

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.090
that everything was
going to be just fine.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:27.680
Washington would receive
me with open arms.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.070
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: And, of
course, the message she got

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.580
in Washington was
that she would be shot

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.360
if she told anybody
what she was doing.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.440
So, the next woman, Anne
Seeley, was recruited

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.820
out of Smith College in 1942,

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.860
and she would work the
Japanese naval fleet code.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.290
&gt;&gt; An additive is, obviously,
something that you add,

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.600
but what do you add it to.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.690
You add it to a five-digit
code group.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:04.340
And the code group has a
meaning, which is either a word

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:10.670
or a phrase or a sentence
or a Roman letter.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:11.970
Because we're dealing

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:17.160
in Japanese now [inaudible] make
much use of the Roman letters.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.670
But, they often did
to spell names.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:20.970
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Right.

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:22.320
&gt;&gt; People like [inaudible].

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.670
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: So, her
memory was so sharp.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.530
She had never talked about this
in 75 years, and she remembered

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.470
that the Japanese would have
to have a different code group

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.920
for every letter of
the name Roosevelt,

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.630
because they might not have,
you know, an actual character

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.640
that stood for Roosevelt.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.880
So, her memory was so sharp
she actually showed me the math

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.440
that she had to do in order
to recover the additives.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.740
She got a little irritated

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.560
when I seemed a little
slow on the uptake.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.290
So, because I was saying,
well, they had added it,

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.790
so did you subtract or add?

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.530
And she said, well, we would
zeroize [phonetic] and add.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:52.910
I mean, you know,
how hard is that?

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:56.440
So, I just loved how precise
her memory was of this work

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.720
that she had never
told anybody about.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.660
The next woman, Betty Bemis
Robards, worked those --

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:05.470
helped build those machines that
broke the German enigma cipher,

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:08.490
and then remembers basically
the thanks that they got

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:10.830
for the great work
that they did.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:21.120
&gt;&gt; We broke the code in August
1943, and everybody says,

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.420
what did they tell you?

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.260
I said, nothing.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.570
All that Commander Meater
[assumed spelling] announced

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.680
at supper one night,
good job, girls.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.890
You did good.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.330
And that's all he said.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.370
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: And the
last woman, Dorothy Ramale,

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:41.140
you saw her photo earlier in the
presentation, she was recruited

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.020
out of Indiana State
Teachers College,

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.700
and she remembers why it was
so important to the women

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.840
to do this work when
they were recruited.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:56:00.700
&gt;&gt; A bus came, and it was at
two o'clock in the morning

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:07.900
that the Army sent a bus to
get these, oh, I don't know,

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.330
it seemed to me it was
all the men, you know,

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:19.010
that there were no men left
in the college at that time

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:23.160
because they all had to
go, I think, to Pittsburgh.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:29.410
You see, since I was
taking mathematics,

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:34.320
[inaudible] I was one of
maybe two girls that were

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.530
in the classes, you see.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:40.290
So, I knew so many
of the fellows

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.580
that were going on that bus.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.430
I'll never forget.

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.780
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: So, Dorothy
Ramale was such a --

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.840
was such a successful
code breaker

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.690
that the U.S. Navy actually
stole her from the U.S. Army.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:56:59.990
She was that good.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.990
And what I love about her is

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:05.360
that she became a math
teacher after the war.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.320
She never told anybody
what she did.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.040
She would end up teaching
at the Public Middle School

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.130
in Arlington, Virginia, that my
own children would ultimately

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.130
attend, Swanson, and then
Yorktown High School.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:17.810
And I just love the thought

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.470
of these middle school kids
taking Miss Ramale's algebra one

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.690
class and having no idea
that this sweet woman,

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.190
who people remember as an
incredible math teacher,

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:31.530
had been such a badass code
breaker during World War II.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:34.390
And, of course, she never
talked about it, you know,

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:36.530
until I interviewed her.

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.180
And she's also an
example of the fact

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:41.910
that these women walked among
us, you know, for decades

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.560
and decades, and in many
cases, still walk among us.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.290
They never expected
credit for what they did.

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.890
In most cases, they never got
any credit for what they did.

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.790
They took the secret
to their graves.

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:53.720
I felt very fortunate,
ultimately,

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.810
to be able to find 20
women, living women,

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:57.110
who could talk about their work.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:59.130
You see how excellent
their memories were.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:02.720
And to be able to, you know,
to try and get them some credit

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.160
for the incredible
contribution that they made

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.230
to winning the war, and to
American freedom and democracy.

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:11.920
I mean, that's not
an overstatement.

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.560
And, again, never
expecting credit.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.100
One of the -- I will say that
by the time I was interviewing

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.970
them, they knew that they
had been left out of history.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.910
They knew that books
that were written

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.210
about Pacific code breaking

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.000
and Atlantic code breaking
during the '90s, you know,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.630
had pretty much not
told their story,

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:30.210
because the women had been so
good about not speaking up.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.850
And one of the women I
interviewed in an emergency room

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.850
in Atlanta, because she had
broken her wrist the night

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:37.480
before, I learned that
emergency rooms are good places

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.790
to interview, because you
have to wait a long time

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:42.350
and they can't -- the
person can't go anywhere.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:43.650
But, she said that, you know,

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:44.950
I just hope that
I live long enough

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:48.230
to see the book published, and
I am happy to say that she did.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.220
So, thank you so
much for listening.

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.310
It's been a great honor to work
with the Library of Congress

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.510
and trying to tell the story.

00:58:55.510 --> 00:59:00.300
[ Applause ]

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.760
And I think we have time
for a few questions.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.840
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: I was
going to do [inaudible].

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.140
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Oh.

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.440
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Thank
you, Liza, for bringing

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.740
to light the stories of
these incredible women

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.080
and the contributions they
made to the course of war,

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.590
technology, code breaking,
and cyber security.

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.730
Because of your work
using primary sources,

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.270
like those found at the
Veterans' History Project,

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.790
stories like these
cannot be ignored.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:27.060
They will forever be included
in the annals of history.

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.910
When we first started
planning this book talk,

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:30.870
we were thinking how great
it would be to have some

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:33.470
of those code girls
here with us today,

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:37.270
but because they are generally
in their 90's and a bit frail,

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:40.350
we thought, well, let's
do the next best thing.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:44.100
And Liza helped us reach out
to those families and get some

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.810
of those collections
that we didn't have

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.620
in our archives here.

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.430
And in February we received
a package containing an oral

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:56.840
history interview, photographs,
and a memoir that was written

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.340
by Elizabeth McClure Bennett.

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.500
And her son, George Bennett,
Junior, when he found

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.100
out what we were doing,
rallied his family

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.890
to collect these items and
send them to us right away.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:10.130
In one of the e-mails he
sent to our staff he wrote,

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.060
my mother is still alive, but
her health has been very poor

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.190
over the last several years.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.860
Our family is very
grateful to Liza Mundy

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.840
for her great book featuring
the code girls, and to you

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.050
and the Veterans' History
Project for preserving the story

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:26.180
of these remarkable women.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.590
I'm very sad to report that Mrs.
Bennett passed away on the 16th

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:32.940
of March at the ripe
old age of 96.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.490
I would suggest to you,
she lived a good life.

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:38.670
I understand that her family
is watching live on YouTube,

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:41.470
and her son, Doug, flew
in from Indianapolis

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:42.770
to be with us today.

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:44.070
So, thank you, Doug.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.870
And --

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.550
[ Applause ]

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:52.490
I want -- I want them to
understand how grateful

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:56.120
that we are to make sure that
their mom's story is going

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.980
to live on in perpetuity
here at the library.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.340
And, so, again, thank you
for that round of applause

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.190
for Doug and his family.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.140
And in closing, if you're like
the Bennetts and have a veteran

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.500
in your life, living or
deceased, no matter the gender,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.390
branch, service, or
military assignment,

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:15.960
please consider donating
their story

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.060
to the Veterans'
History Project.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.530
We've got a table set up outside
where you can get our field kit.

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.230
You can go up our
website, loc.gov/vets

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:28.980
and hear some amazing stories,
and this way you can preserve,

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.820
you can ensure that loved
one's story will be preserved

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.670
and not lost or forgotten.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.910
So, again, thank you
for joining us today.

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:39.110
And now we have some
time for questions for --

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:41.220
with you and with Liza.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.520
So, without further ado.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.580
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Sure.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.900
&gt;&gt; Did any of the
women demand proof

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.480
that it was now unclassified
and -- oh, sorry.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.980
Did any of the women
demand proof

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.440
that it was now unclassified and
that they could talk about it?

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.940
Or, did they just believe you?

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.980
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: It did, in
some cases, take persuasion.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.800
It took me about a half
an hour to persuade Dot

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.510
that she wouldn't be put in
prison if she -- if she spoke.

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:06.000
And I told her that if she was,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.890
it would probably a
nice prison at her age.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:13.480
And, so, in some cases
it did take some coaxing.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.850
And I will say, that they had
been released from their oath

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.120
of secrecy back in the 1990's,

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.300
but nobody had tracked
them down and told them.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.610
So, they were free to speak.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:29.680
&gt;&gt; Yes, your pictures of the
crossing on Wisconsin Avenue,

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.230
a number of years ago I
had an opportunity to look

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.560
at some photographs in the
[inaudible] collection.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.440
And the first walk, don't
walk pedestrian signals were

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.550
installed in the District
of Columbia at that site.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.940
So, I guess they were
concerned about the safety

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.240
of these women [laughter].

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.880
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Yes, yes,
and they were also --

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.700
yeah, there were also some
neighbors who complained

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.740
about noise and singing,
as well as necking

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.800
in the woods, so, yeah.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:02.190
&gt;&gt; But, in 1965 I was sent by
the Army to Fort Meade and NSA

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:06.420
for an eight-week training
in the cryptography,

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.070
and six of us were sent.

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.500
We walked into the
training unit that day

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.810
and we were totally
surrounded by women.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:16.970
And I'm wondering if
NSA is like that today,

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:20.030
and if there are studies
if women are better wired

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.810
for this type of work.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:24.110
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Well,
I don't know,

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:25.540
I don't know when that was.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.540
But, I should've said that
many of these women did stay

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.060
on with the work after the war.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.640
We didn't roll up our code
breaking after World War II,

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.940
because the Cold War started.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.790
So, we would be breaking East
German, Russian, Chinese,

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.380
communist code systems, and
many of the women did stay

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.230
with the work and went to
work, ultimately, for the NSA.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.380
So, you saw Ann Caracristi
laughing down at her dead plant,

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.950
she would rise to become the
first female deputy director

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.930
of NSA, and many of
the first super grades

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:54.590
at NSA were women
coming out of the war.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:56.920
So, there was an
important cohort of women

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.500
who helped establish
that agency.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.900
&gt;&gt; I was curious, how does
the Navy steal someone

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.200
from the Army?

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.470
And, also, is that
correspondence course

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.560
in code breaking now public?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.860
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Yes, so,

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.520
the correspondence
courses can be found

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.820
at the National Archives.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.620
I mean, they still
exist as paper records.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:22.270
I'm sure there is an
updated modern version of it,

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:24.310
but you can find
the ones from 1942.

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:26.720
I did study them when
I was trying to sort

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720
of understand how it worked.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.310
And, the way that the Navy
stole her from the Army was,

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:35.230
they paid a little bit more
money, because she had a --

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.810
she had a college degree, so she
knew she could go into the Navy

01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:40.520
as an officer and she could
get an officer's allowance.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.140
It wasn't that the
salary was more,

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.940
but she could get an officer's
allowance for housing,

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.370
and that bit more money, $50
a month or whatever it was,

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:49.800
enabled her to buy a car.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.240
The other -- her
other goal in life was

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.680
to see all the continents in the
-- in the world, which she did.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.570
But, she was -- with her car
she was able, after the war,

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:57.870
to drive to the west coast,

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.690
and that was really
thrilling for her.

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:01.990
So, it was money.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:08.050
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just have
a quick question.

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:12.000
When an individual was given
the code to break down,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.700
did they already -- were they
working like from a template?

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.110
So, they'd say, okay, if
this is an X it means B?

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.960
If this is a four it means a Z?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.050
Or, were they literally
breaking down the code itself?

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:24.350
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: They were
breaking the message.

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:27.270
So, they would get the message
and they would see the message,

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:28.680
but they were -- they were,
you know, some of the --

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.400
again, some of the
systems were numerical

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.830
and they had to do math.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:35.820
Some of them were, they
would be looking at letters.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.230
There was a lot of variation
and they had to understand

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:42.330
that particular system
and break it in real time.

01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:44.150
So, the training courses
that they had gotten

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.430
at their colleges often
really had nothing to do

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.200
with the actual code
systems that they --

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.500
that they had to work on.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.790
They had to really learn it
on the job, because there was

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:57.310
so much innovation and change
taking place during the war.

01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:02.040
&gt;&gt; Were there any women that
you wanted to interview,

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.570
or that you wish you
could have interviewed,

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.330
but had already passed on?

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:07.020
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Oh yes, oh yes.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.340
And that's why I was so
grateful for the oral histories

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.360
and collections at the
Library of Congress.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.120
And it was frustrating, because
sometimes the oral history

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.150
interviewer wouldn't
ask the question

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:17.450
that I would've liked
to have known.

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:21.700
And one of the women
talked about the experience

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.630
of losing her husband
in the D-Day landing.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.930
He was a glider pilot.

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.320
And it was clearly something
that she wanted to talk about,

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.130
and she couldn't even
go to his funeral

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.810
because she was working those
big machines and they had

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:35.270
to continue after
the D-Day landing,

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.570
because of course we were --

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.870
we were going to be chasing
the Germans through Europe

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.170
with the Battle of the Bulge.

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:40.470
It was very important.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:41.770
They wouldn't release the
women from their stations,

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.510
so she couldn't even go to
her own husband's funeral.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:46.450
And I felt like that interviewer
was a little bit uncomfortable

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:49.130
talking to her about that
loss, because she said really

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.890
that she loved him for
the rest of her life.

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:54.510
And, so, there were moments
when I wish that, obviously,

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.690
I could've talked to the women
in person, but I was so grateful

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:00.820
for the oral history
collections.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.520
&gt;&gt; Did you ever hear back
from the editor who said

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.470
that it was thin beer?

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.090
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: No,
but I hope he's --

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:15.410
I hope he's regretting
those words.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:17.370
I actually found
them very motivating.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:19.620
And, so, if any high school
students are listening,

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.290
or college students,
and if a teacher says

01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:22.590
to you, you can't do that.

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:25.570
Or, you know, or if there's a
young woman out there who says,

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:28.790
you know, you shouldn't go into
STEM, you know, don't listen

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.810
to them and use it
as a motivation,

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.550
because I certainly -- I got up
every morning thinking, again,

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.970
okay, I'll show you thin beer.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:45.740
So, the book has been optioned,
and I'm told that, you know,

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.610
there a lot of stages
that it has to go through.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.450
But, there is, you know, thanks,

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:53.100
Hidden Figures has really been
wonderful for women's stories,

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.100
for convincing publishers,
and also, I think, you know,

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.060
studios that there is an
appetite for women's stories.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.130
We have people like Reese
Witherspoon, you know,

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:05.000
talking about the importance
of women fronted narratives.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.300
So, I'm optimistic.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.380
I mean, it would be --
it would be great to see.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.370
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was just kind of
curious about your process.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:16.520
Like, did you find all the info
before or did you have some kind

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.900
of like narrative
that it fit into?

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.660
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: That is
such a great question.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.330
So, normally I would've
spent a lot

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.330
of time reading books
about code breaking.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.700
I would've spent a lot of
time in the paper records

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.830
to really educate myself,
and then I would've gone

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:31.940
to the women when I had a
really thorough grounding.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.120
But, because of my actuarial
deadline, because the women were

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.250
in their mid-90's, I wanted
to interview them first.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:42.920
And, so, I was -- while I
would be talking to them,

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.910
I would be wondering
if I would be able

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:47.460
to find an actual printed record

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.050
that would substantiate
their memories,

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:51.820
and I didn't know whether
it would be out there.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.030
And, again, I was amazed
at how much there was

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.330
in the National Archives
and the Library of Congress

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:57.950
that enabled me to substantiate.

01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.450
You saw Anne Seeley.

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:01.440
She remembered something
called a [inaudible] message,

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.380
which was a noon
position message.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.680
They would look for that.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.550
The Japanese naval captains
would send a message saying

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:09.400
where they were going to
be at noon the next day,

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.680
which is the best possible
piece of information

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.920
for an American submarine
commander to have.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.130
And when I finally got
to the National Archives,

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.790
I found references

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:19.130
to [inaudible] messages
all over the place.

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:21.580
It was remarkable how
accurate their memories were.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.880
So, that's a great question.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.840
I had to -- I had
to do it backwards.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.930
&gt;&gt; Are there lists of people
who worked at those groups?

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:33.500
I know a number of people
probably wonder and --

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.800
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: Yeah.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.160
&gt;&gt; And would like to look
up -- look up a name or so.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.640
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: That is
such a great question.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.700
There aren't good -- there's
not a single good roster.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.550
I wish that NSA had
the resources,

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:44.730
or The Cryptologic
Museum had the resources.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:47.150
If they had more funding,
I'm sure they would try

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:48.870
to put together a roster.

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:51.860
There are just scrambled files,
in which I might see some

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.850
of the women who
came down in 1942,

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.360
where they were living
and, but there's no

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.190
like one central place where
you could look at the names.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.060
But, if there's somebody
in your family,

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.590
or even somebody you know who
might have done this work,

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:07.260
or who said she was a
secretary during the war,

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:10.060
that information, those
personnel records are public,

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.120
and I have a website,
www.lizamundy.com.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.020
I have a tab called resources
for code breakers and families.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.740
You can request anybody's
wartime personnel record

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.040
and you can find out.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.140
If it says they were a
cryptographer or a cryptologist,

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.460
then that means they
did this work.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.760
And you can often get
their background reports,

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.060
their college transcripts.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.790
It's kind of remarkable,
actually,

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:33.090
what's available,
and it's not hard.

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.890
&gt;&gt; What was the seed or the idea

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:43.980
that drew you to
write this story?

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.530
&gt;&gt; Liza Mundy: So, all --

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.370
many of our federal agencies
have wonderful history offices

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.100
and historians that generate

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.110
and record the history
of their agency.

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:56.520
So, the NSA knew that its
origin story included these

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.990
wartime women.

01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:02.280
And, just as NASA knew that
its origins story included the

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.030
African-American
women mathematicians

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:08.130
of Hidden Figures, so I
read a declassified history

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:10.720
of a small code breaking
project during the war

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.520
that had been written
by an NSA historian.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.940
It was out on the Internet,
classified at one point

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.070
that had been declassified,
and it mentioned,

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.450
this was the Russian
code breaking,

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:23.010
our small project during the
war to break Russian messages.

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.150
And it mentioned that a
lot of the people working

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:26.710
that project were women,

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.890
a lot of them were former
school teachers from the south,

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:31.040
and that seemed really
intriguing.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.440
So, I made an appointment
to speak

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.910
with an NSA historian named
Betsy Smoot [assumed spelling],

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:37.430
who was extremely
helpful to me, and a --

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:40.640
and a curator at the Cryptologic
Museum, which is attached

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.710
to an MSA at Fort
Meade, two women,

01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.870
and it was as though they
had been waiting for somebody

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:47.870
to come along who was
interested in this story.

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.830
And they sat with me for two
hours and they explained,

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.480
you know, the larger
story that was --

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.730
that was the mostly
women breaking Japanese

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:56.610
and German codes during the war.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:00.120
And then I just had to figure
out whether I could find people

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.600
and find archival records.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.480
So, a a shout out to
federal agency historians,

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.510
because they are wonderful.

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:15.070
[ Applause ]

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:16.910
So, thank you so much.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:19.100
And I think we have some
descendants of Code Girls

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.380
in the audience as well, and I
would just like to thank them

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.070
so much for their
mothers' service

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:26.510
and their families'
contributions to our history.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:34.460
[ Applause ]

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.130
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
