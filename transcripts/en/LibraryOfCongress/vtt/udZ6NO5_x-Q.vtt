00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt;VOICEOVER: From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt;HERB: One of the most
difficult things I had to deal

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.400
with when I learned I had
impaired my vision was that I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
wouldn't be able to read. When
people alerted me to the Library

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
of Congress program, I realized
I could listen.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.900
&gt;&gt;MARY: There's all kinds of
formats that you can choose

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.300
from. You can choose from large
print or braille or audio. What

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.530
I love about the audio books is
that I could be cooking and I

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.330
could be listening to a book.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.400
&gt;&gt;MELANIE: I love audio books,
but there are times when, for

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.400
me, for a number of reasons, I
just like to be able to feel the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.470
braille under my fingers.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.630
&gt;&gt;YASMIN: The books, they come
in the mail. The mailman drops

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.130
them in my mailbox. I have a big
mailbox for that purpose.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.600
&gt;&gt;PETE: The equipment is loaned
to you by the library. And when

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.670
you finish reading a book, you
turn the mailing card over, and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.370
it goes straight back.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.770
&gt;&gt;EDDIE: The NLS has pretty much
anything you'd possibly want to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
read, from fiction to
educational materials.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.700
&gt;&gt;TERIANA: It has expanded my
horizon because I'm trying to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.970
learn some more.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.330
&gt;&gt;PETE: Everybody can read the
way they want to read using

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.830
this program.
