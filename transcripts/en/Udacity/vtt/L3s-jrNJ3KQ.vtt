00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To answer this, our variable of interest is the difference of these two things

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that has a mean of 10 pounds and its standard deviation is going to be the sum

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of this standard deviation and this standard deviation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now we need to find out the standard deviation of this. Since variances add, let's work with those.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So the variance of Treatment B is 400/10,000 and the variance of Treatment A is 100.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So if we evaluate this, this will give us the standard deviation of this number.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And it's 0.2236. So we can see the ratio of this to this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is much, much greater than the critical value of 1.645.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so in this case we reject the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And there's one particularly interesting feature of these two treatments

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
as they relate to each other.

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just consider how many people lost weight in each case, and post your thoughts to the forums.
