00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
There's 2 cases here; so let's say the graph does have a clique the size of m,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.370
then what will happen is the following.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.410
So it contains exactly 1 vertex

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.970
that corresponds to a variable in that clause,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.620
and what we also know is

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.230
because we constructed the graph this way,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.060
that we can not have 2 vertices connected here in this graph

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.620
where there's a conflict, so what we can not have in this graph, for example

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.120
is 1 vertex that represent not x2

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.500
and another vertex that represents x2,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.150
because we avoided this in the construction

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.810
but this directly shows us how we can

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.020
satisfy this Boolean formula here,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.150
so if we have a not x2 here, we just set it to 0

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.720
so we could just set this one to false,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.510
so that not x2 becomes true,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.730
then this clause here is satisfied

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.340
and also this one over here would be satisfied.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.640
And x1--that's a separate variable,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.280
so we can set it as we want,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.940
and we could set this one to false.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.020
So we have x2

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.890
and we can set that to false so not x2 becomes true.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.320
So that becomes true,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.290
that one becomes true,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.820
that one here is false.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.250
Over here, we have not x2 as well,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760
so there's no conflict here.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.660
x1--we haven't yet talked about x1,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.290
but can just do the same thing; we can set x1 to false,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.440
so the whole thing not x1 becomes true.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.700
We have set it to false,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760
and we haven't even looked at x3,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.890
but all of the clauses are already satisfied,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.130
and that's actually the cool thing to notice here.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.060
x3 is also not contained in the clique,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.590
so the vertices in the clique tell you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.700
how to set the variables

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.140
so that the Boolean formula can be satisfied.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.840
So what if this graph here does not have a clique of size m?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.740
Well in this case, it means that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.300
we have 1 clause group

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.620
which is not contained in the clique

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.240
and if we have 1 clause group that is not contained in the clique,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.550
this means that there's no vertex

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.240
in the clause group

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.650
that has connections to all of the other vertices in the smaller clique

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.400
that we're looking for,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.860
and that means, due to the way we constructed the graph,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.960
that every vertex

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.290
has a conflict with

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.920
another vertex in the clique

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.430
so if there's no large clique,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.380
this means that every assignment

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.470
of true and false of the variables will lead to a conflict

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.600
such that at least 1 of the clauses

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.140
can not be satisfied.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.120
So then the Boolean formula does not have a satisfying assignment.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.460
So now that we have this reduction,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.260
we know that clique is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.280
NP complete,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.840
which of course makes Bob a little unhappy.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.230
So now what about vertex independent set?

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080
Are those problems NP complete

00:02:42.080 --> 99:59:59.000
or are we not sure yet?
