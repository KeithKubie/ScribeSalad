00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:15.359
In the world of horse racing, the name of
a given horse is considered to be almost as

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.369
important as its ability to run.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.690
Thanks, in part, to a large number of rigid
rules put in place by the the various governing

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.690
bodies of the sport, picking a name is an
exercise in creativity as much as it is a

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.550
simple way to identify a horse.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.529
You see, to race a thoroughbred in near enough
any location on Earth it must have a name

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.329
that conforms to strict regulations laid out
by The International Federation of Horseracing

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.430
Authorities.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.350
In addition, depending on where in the world
you are, there may be further stipulations

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
a chosen name must adhere to for the horse
to race in that region.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.930
First though, let’s discuss the rules laid
out by The International Federation of Horseracing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.930
Authorities.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.090
For starters a chosen name can be no longer
than 18 characters long and to make things

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.640
just a little more difficult, spaces and punctuation
marks count towards this limit.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.280
For this reason, many owners choose to simple
forgo spaces and punctuation when picking

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.560
a name for a horse- our personal favourite
example of which being the horse Eighteencharacters,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.869
a name that is, somewhat amusingly, exactly
18 characters long.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.380
Now, although 18 characters may seem like
plenty, another rule handed down by The International

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.810
Federation of Horseracing Authorities that
makes picking a name just a tad more difficult

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.939
is that no two horses currently racing can
have the same name.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.899
To avoid confusion between horses, once a
name is registered with the relevant horseracing

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.259
authority required, similar sounding names
are also banned.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.551
On top of all this, when a horse retires,
its name cannot be used again for at least

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:43.680
another 20 years with this being extended
to 35 years if the horse goes to stud, again

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.549
to avoid confusion and out of respect for
the owner.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.249
This rule is ignored if a given horse wins
a major event, in which case its name is retired

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.249
forever.

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.409
Exceptions to this rule can be made if a given
horse is competing in another part of the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.630
world, though generally the owner is required
to add the prefix of the horse’s country

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.380
of origin to the end of its name to differentiate
it from the other horse.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.520
Reading this you can probably start to understand
why owners choose such eclectic names- but

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.789
we’re not done yet.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.450
There are still a lot more rules we need to
discuss.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.349
For example, a chosen name can’t be, to
quote, “in poor taste”, a polite way of

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.510
saying it can’t be offensive to a particular
religious, political or ethnic group.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.780
And if you’ve ever tried to say, well, anything,
online, you probably know that almost everything

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.150
is offensive to some group out there.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.819
Furthermore, a name cannot be used for advertising
purposes or contain a trademarked term or

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.370
something like that.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.290
Understandably, a name also cannot contain
any vulgarity- a rule many owners seem to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.719
take great enjoyment in trying to circumvent,
a few of which we’ll mention in the Bonus

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.719
Facts later.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.939
Finally, you cannot name a horse after a living
person without express written permission

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.549
from that person.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.630
Moving on to more region-specific rules, in
the United States, for example, The Jockey

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.769
Club requires any owner registering a horse
with a name that has “meanings that are

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.230
not self-evident” to explain what it means
before it will be approved.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.739
The reasoning being to stop names that may
circumvent any of the previously stated rules

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.549
from slipping through the net.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.379
Curiously, The Jockey Club seems to be more
lenient when it comes to allowing names that

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.170
are overtly political in nature than other
parts of the world, with horse’s like Obama’s

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.840
Promises and Palin Power being approved.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.560
In the UK, on the other hand, Weatherbys (the
administrative arm of the British Horse Racing

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.560
Authority) dictates that a name can’t be
more than 7 syllables long- a rule that rarely

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.730
comes into play given the 18 character name
limit, so isn’t a rule handed down in other

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.730
jurisdictions.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.760
UK horseracing authorities also take special
care to vet names that may have a different

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.670
meaning in other cultures- a commonsense rule
given the proximity of Great Britain to the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.719
melting pot of cultures that is Europe.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.370
The difficulty of naming a horse is only compounded
by the fact that in addition to being unique,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.730
a name – as a rule – should be fairly
memorable.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.290
The reason being that nobody is going to bet
on a horse with a lame name, unless it happens

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.799
to have a famous owner or heritage.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.720
This is a fact that probably explains why
the Queen is happy to choose fairly boring

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.760
names like Pall Mall or Sea Shanty for her
racing horses.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.940
Speaking of heritage, a common trend when
it comes to naming racehorses is to choose

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.730
a name that is a subtle hint to the individual
horse’s lineage.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.959
For example, we have the horse Inside Information,
the offspring of a stallion called Private

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.220
Account and a mare called Pure Profit.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.539
Another trend when it comes to naming racehorses
is to simply pick a name that sounds funny

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.860
or is difficult to pronounce, usually just
to annoy racing commentators.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.160
An example of this is a horse bought by one
of the writers of the film Airplane, David

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.720
Zucker named All Pink.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.500
If that doesn’t sound all that funny we
should note that Zucker specifically instructed

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.050
the jockey riding All Pink to hug the inside
of the track so the commentator would have

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.360
to keep saying the phrase “It’s all pink
on the inside”.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.819
Other examples of naming shenanigans include
horses named DoReMiFaSaLaTiDo, Ha Ha Ha and

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:03.610
simply, ARRRRRR, all of which were named,
partly, to mess with commentators.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.520
To conclude though, the reason racehorses
tend to have such weird names is largely due

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.830
to strict regulations handed down by the highest
authorities in horseracing, which necessitate

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.099
owners getting, shall we say, creative when
coming up with a unique and memorable name.

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.960
In fact, it’s noted that around a third
of all submitted horse names are rejected

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.620
outright for breaking one or more rules.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.880
For this reason, many owners submit multiple
names just to ensure one gets accepted as

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.810
invariably one or more of them will be breaking
some rule or other.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.630
Despite the best efforts of the relevant authorities
vetting names, countless names some would

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.620
consider to be vulgar or offensive have been
unwittingly accepted in the past- examples

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.690
include, Date More Minors, Pussy Galore, Bodacious
Tatas, Nutzapper and our personal favourite,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.880
Geespot.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.069
Why?

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.680
Because it was the result of a stallion called
Pursuit of Love getting it on with a mare

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.599
called My Discovery.

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.650
As for names that have been rejected for being
too offensive in the past but we feel compelled

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:17.139
to mention anyway, these include Chit Hot
and Pee Ness.
