00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.800
&gt;&gt;Hello YouTubers. This is Peter Piot from
Davos. I'm the director of the U.N. program

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.580
on fighting AIDS in the world. AIDS has become
one of the make-or-break issues of our time

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.199
and without defeating it there's no way that
for example Africa will be able reach development,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.609
and with 6000 people dying every single day
it's a major crisis, but the good news is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.769
now we've got results ,and now that many countries
infections are going down, and two and a half

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.829
million people are in treatment, compared
to basically none six years ago. So the big

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.289
challenge now is gonna be to make sure that
we prevent HIV and that nobody becomes infected

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.460
and that we have an HIV-free generation and
that depends on all of us. Use a condom every

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.070
time, you know, you're not certain that, you
know, you're having sex with someone that's

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.920
not infected and also reduce number of partners,
and postpone your first sexual intercourse

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.440
when you're very young. So we can do it and
we can all work towards a world free of AIDS.
