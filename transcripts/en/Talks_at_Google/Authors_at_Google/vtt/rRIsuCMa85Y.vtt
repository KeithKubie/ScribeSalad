[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.478 --> 00:00:09.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.630
ANN MEI CHANG:
It's so fun for me

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.920
to be here for a
number of reasons.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.820
One is I live two blocks away,
so this is the easiest speaking

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.082
gig possible.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.790
The other, as I was
telling, Jacquelline,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.780
it's like coming
back to high school.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.484
I left Google about
eight years ago,

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:24.650
and it's like all these
memories come flooding back.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.330
This building actually wasn't
a Google building when I left.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.720
But it's consistent
branding and all that,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.470
so it brings back
lots of good memories.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.320
So when I left Google
eight years ago,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.652
I decided to spend the second
half of my career working

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:41.360
towards social good,
specifically focused

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680
on Google poverty.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.470
And I had spent my whole
career in the tech world.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.060
I studied as a
software engineer,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.100
as an engineering director.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.040
I knew how to build
software, but I knew nothing

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040
about global poverty.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.410
So I knew I had a lot to learn.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.130
And I wasn't really sure
how I could contribute.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.470
At first, everyone
was trying to come

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.290
to me to help them build
an app for this or that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.510
or build a website, and
it wasn't clear to me

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.400
that that was really going
to be a highest and best use.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.600
So I set out to learn.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320
And one of the things
that really struck me,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.930
as I dug into these
issues, was that there's

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.900
these immense, complex
challenges out there.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.450
And there's incredible people
working on these issues,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.600
with such dedication, a lot
of resources going into it.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.410
But it just felt like we
were barely making a dent.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.590
And so I think my journey
over the last eight years

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.360
has really been
trying to figure out

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.170
not how I can make my own tiny
little mark on some corner

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.150
of some issue, but really
looking at the system

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.076
and saying, how can we do this
better and trying to bring some

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:46.700
the experiences that
I've had at Google

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.440
and other places to some of
these big social challenges.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.540
And so I'm assuming
people here generally

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.130
have heard of the
"Lean Startup."

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.140
Is that, yes?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.570
And so I think the
"Lean Startup" just

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.580
is one of the books that's
really captured some

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.210
of the best practices
of innovation

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600
I think we live and
breathe here at Google.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.790
And Eric talks about
the "Lean Startup"

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.940
as a methodology for building
products and services

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.680
under conditions of
extreme uncertainty,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.180
which is true for
startup companies,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.320
is true for a lot
of things we're

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.850
trying to invent
here at Google that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.750
have never been done before.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.010
And I would argue it's
equally if not more true

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.870
when it comes to
social challenges.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.130
Because we're talking about big,
complex, long-term entrenched

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.910
issues that we don't
have solutions for.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.580
And so in that case, there's
a huge amount of uncertainty,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.790
but yet what seems--

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.240
what I found to be
true is that most

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.770
of the organizations
out there who

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.840
are trying to tackle
these challenges

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.110
are really good at
predictable execution.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.350
They like to create
these grandmaster plans.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.660
Maybe they don't like
to do it, but the system

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.460
of applying for
grants and so forth,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.560
forces them to create
these grandmasters plans,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.370
and they're expected to
execute rigidly to that plan--

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.630
sort of the opposite of what we
all know innovation looks like.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.840
So when there is
such uncertainty,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.610
I think what we
need to do instead

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.440
is look at approaches
that help accelerate

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.820
the speed of learning.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.610
And this probably seems
obvious to all of you.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.839
And I know lots of
nonprofit leaders

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.880
who have picked up the
"Lean Startup," have heard

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.430
about other innovation tools,
such as human-centered design,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.210
and they say, this
makes a lot of sense.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.310
We want to do this.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.530
And then, they get stuck
because they struggle

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.070
with a number of barriers,
such as the nature of how

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.110
restrictive funding can be, the
difficulty of measuring impact,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.620
and the length of time it
can take to realize impact,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.200
and also the whole notion
of experimentation,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.440
running A/B tests sounds great
when you're building a website.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.180
It's a little harder
when you're talking

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.370
about experimenting on
really vulnerable people who

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.900
are living on the edge.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.970
And so that's really
why I wrote this book.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.090
It's not to invent
something new.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.840
I don't come up
with new methodology

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.160
here that didn't exist before--

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.650
but to really look at how
these best practices that

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.930
have come out of
places like Google

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.890
can be adapted for the
realities of the context

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.200
that organizations
work in who are trying

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.950
to deliver social good
until, in the process

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.990
of writing the
book, I spoke with--

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.930
I was lucky to interview
over 200 organizations--

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.870
big and small, domestic and
international, nonprofits

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.210
and for-profits, funders
and implementers,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.540
and really try to see,
among the most successful,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.440
what were the core
elements of their success?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.890
And I kind of boiled it
down into three principles.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.780
And what was surprising to me
is that the traditional way

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.170
of going about doing social good
is the exact opposite of this.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.710
We tend to think too
small, start too big,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.070
and get diverted by many
things on the path to impact.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.720
So let me start
with "think big."

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.750
So what I found is
that most nonprofits,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.300
the way that they
go about their work

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.970
is that they plan
based on constraints.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.150
We have this much money.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.579
We have this many people.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:05.870
We have this grant opportunity.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.410
There's this size and scope.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.985
And so what can we do
within this box we're in?

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:13.600
And they usually do some good.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.714
But it rarely moves the needle.

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:17.880
This is where it feels like
we're doing so much work

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.171
and working so hard, and yet
we're never getting ahead.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.140
I think the first shift
that needs to happen

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.170
is that we need to stop
planning based on constraints

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.529
and start planning
based on the need.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.070
What is the actual
need in the world?

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.470
What would actually move the
needle on changing, addressing

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.000
a real problem?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.690
And that's a really
different approach.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.790
You know, here in
Silicon Valley,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.400
we know everybody's-- all the
startup companies are running

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.460
around with their PowerPoint
decks that show the hockey

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.190
stick curve of how they're
going to reach a billion people.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.610
That doesn't happen
in the social sector

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.560
very often, at
least, and it needs

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.600
to because the problems
are just as big.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.510
Let me just illustrate
what that looks like.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.810
Over the last 30 years, we've
made slow but steady progress

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.960
on core social
challenges like access

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.540
to clean water,
electricity, and sanitation.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.690
This is really hard,
painstaking work because we're

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.400
trying to reach people
who are very poor,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.360
who are living in very remote
areas, and so it's slow.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.280
And yet during this
same period of time,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.100
adoption of mobile
phones skyrocketed.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.467
And what's the difference here?

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:32.050
One of the differences is that
this is something people really

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.815
want in demand.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.930
I've heard so many
stories of people

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.124
who will top up their mobile
phone before they'll buy food.

00:06:42.124 --> 00:06:44.290
And so today, there's more
people with mobile phones

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.640
than have a toilet.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.050
The other side is, on the
supply side, the companies that

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.960
manufacture mobile
phones make a profit,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.340
can plow that into making
better phones for cheaper

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.510
and distributing them.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.220
The telecom companies
that sell minutes

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.761
are able to make a profit, and
so they can build more towers,

00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:03.230
reach more rural areas,
deliver service more cheaply.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.650
And so through this
combination of strong demand

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.100
and strong supply, you
see this kind of growth.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.416
And certainly, not everything
in the social sector

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:12.790
is going to look
like this, but I

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.248
think we should
challenge ourselves

00:07:14.248 --> 00:07:17.800
to say, how do we shoot
for something that

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.610
has this kind of trajectory?

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.320
And I think it's possible
in more cases than we think.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.620
And that starts out by setting
a goal, setting higher sights.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.860
A nonprofit here in
the Bay Area called

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.250
"Earn" is focused on helping
low-income Americans develop

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.690
a habit of savings.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.970
And after 10 years
in business, they

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.430
were being lauded at being
the top of their field,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.310
having 7,000 micro
savings accounts.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.130
And the founder, Ben Mangan,
one day woke up and he thought,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.920
we're getting all
this recognition,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.580
but, really, there are an
estimated 50 to 70 million

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.650
Americans who could
benefit from this.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.810
And we're reaching
7,000 after 10 years.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.980
We're barely
scratching the surface.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.920
And so he got up
at an awards dinner

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.080
and made this grand
announcement that they

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.370
were going to reach a million
people in the next five years.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.660
That's a big stretch from 7,000.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.450
But what it did is it forced
Earn to re-look at their model.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.650
They were doing in-person
visits to each of their clients.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.392
They were doing a
financial match.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.100
And these things were
feasible if they're

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.806
going to get to the
scope of the need.

00:08:19.806 --> 00:08:22.180
And so it forced them to take
a different look at things.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.860
And they ended up
building a technology

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.151
platform that could reach a
lot more people, a lot more

00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:26.950
cheaply.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.320
And the first year after
rolling out that platform,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.060
they reached 85,000 people--

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.789
so more than 10 times as many
as in their first 10 years

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.690
combined.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.309
There's just a
illustration of what

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.704
it can look like to shift your
mindset and to shoot bigger.

00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:41.620
And that often means
that we don't necessarily

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.850
know the path there yet.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.740
But at least if
we're successful,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.180
we can really move the needle.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.870
So the second principle of
Lean Impact is to start small.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.284
We all know here that, when we
have some great product idea,

00:08:57.284 --> 00:08:58.450
that we want to start small.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.330
We dog-food things;
we run A/B tests.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.960
But this is uncommon
in the social sector.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.630
And we all know that
by starting small,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.790
we can make a bigger
impact over time,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.100
because we can learn much
more faster, iterate much

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.090
more quickly when we're
experimented with just 5,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.890
or 10, or 100
people versus trying

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.260
to carry the infrastructure
and all the logistics

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.140
related to serving
thousands of people.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.890
So the core of "Lean Startup,"
Eric talks about the Build,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.885
Measure, Learn feedback loop.

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.945
And this is the cycle of
iteration where we build an--

00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:34.720
you know we have a potential
solution, a hypothesis

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.980
about what it will do.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.320
We build an experiment,
measure, gather the data,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.070
and we learn and we
iterate through this.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.810
So this is all very familiar
to us in the tech world.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.330
It's sort of familiar
in the social sector.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.340
The only problem is,
in the social sector,

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.290
this cycle usually takes years.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.320
So in the global
development space,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.760
you're often designing a program
for one, or two, or three

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.760
years before it
even hits the field.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.140
And say it's a
five-year program,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.030
you run it for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.480
You then do your midline
evaluation, which usually

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.090
takes a year in and of itself.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.440
then, you're 3 and 1/2
years into your program,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.020
you get some data,
and then you might

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.550
plow what you learned
into your next proposal.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.540
So the whole cycle could
take like five or seven years

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.600
to get through.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.280
And so if you imagine these
great, complex challenges

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.629
and you're only learning on
the cycle of seven years,

00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:26.420
you're not going to
make a lot of progress.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.767
And the world is only
moving faster and faster.

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:30.350
So the key here is,
how do we speed up

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.500
this feedback loop
for social good so

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.540
that we can make
faster progress,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.150
and can take more risks, and
try more different things,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.220
can find much better solutions?

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.229
And so when it comes
to social impact,

00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:45.770
there's three
dimensions that I think

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.425
we need to test hypotheses
around-- value, impact,

00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:49.130
and growth.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.070
In the "Lean Startup,"
Eric talks about the value

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.200
hypothesis and the
growth hypothesis

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.520
is a two-core hypothesis to
test that we do within the tech

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.366
industry, certainly.

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:00.740
The value hypothesis
is certainly

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.484
not only do people
want your product,

00:11:02.484 --> 00:11:04.150
but they'll demand
it, come back for it,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.750
tell their friends about it.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.210
Growth is, what is
the engine for growth

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.787
that's going to drive adoption?

00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:11.120
Are people going to refer folks?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.070
Are they going to pay money
for it that you can plow back

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.880
into investment?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.150
And so forth.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.720
But then for social
impact, we need

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.270
to add a third hypothesis,
which is the impact hypothesis.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.210
It's not enough to have
something that people want

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.320
and have it be able
to get to people,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.950
then you can just be talking
about Nike shoes, maybe.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.750
But it also has to
have social impact.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.090
And too often we don't ask the
simple question, does it work?

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:38.570
Does it deliver the social
benefit that we are seeking.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.430
And so let me just
talk briefly--

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.410
give a brief example
for each of these three

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.493
and what it might look
like in the social context.

00:11:44.493 --> 00:11:48.290
So for value, this is testing--

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.720
is this something that people
will really demand, and use,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.370
and engage with?

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.200
And a MVP for value
will look very different

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.200
and can look very different
in the social sector

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.790
than when you're testing
an online service.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.960
In this case, it's a social
enterprise called Copia Global.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.460
It's in Kenya.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.800
They set out to look
at how to provide

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.050
a much wider range
of consumer goods

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.410
to people living in rural areas
that typically only have access

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.960
to the basic consumer staples.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.720
And so rather than building
out the infrastructure

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.480
to transport goods, to
build an online catalog

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.430
or ordering system,
and warehouses,

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.630
and all this kind of stuff,
they decided to run an MVP.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.910
Their MVP consisted
of the CEO Crispin,

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.940
going to the local Walmart
equivalent, the Nakumatt,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.220
and taking pictures of a
bunch of different products

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.670
off the shelves of what he
thought people might like.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.550
And he pasted these into
a handful of catalogs,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.620
distributed them
to a few villages,

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.760
and stepped back to
see what would happen.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.940
And his questions were,
would people even want

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.100
to order from a catalog?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.380
What kinds of things
would they order?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.050
Would agents sell
from the catalog?

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.867
And they learned a lot of
things, just from this process.

00:12:56.867 --> 00:12:58.700
First, they learned
that people would order.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.410
Orders started coming in.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.690
And when an order would
come in, Crispin himself

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.270
would go run to the store, buy
the product off the shelves,

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.310
and hand carry it
to the village.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.555
Now this is certainly not
something that could scale,

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.180
but it's something
that he could get up

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.305
and running within a few days.

00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:14.930
And so he validated
the fact that, yes,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.400
people wanted to order
from the catalog.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.216
This was a value to people.

00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:20.840
He also found out
what kind of products

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.490
people wanted to order.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.550
One of the surprises
was that, today,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.984
one of their most popular
products is cement.

00:13:28.984 --> 00:13:30.650
Not something they
thought of initially,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.729
but if you think
about it, going--

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.270
If you don't have a car going
and getting cement and carrying

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.664
it home is actually
kind of hard.

00:13:36.664 --> 00:13:38.330
And so it's something
that people really

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.790
value getting delivery of.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.830
And then, they had another
surprise, which is,

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.010
they originally thought that
the agents that they would use

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.350
would be the people who are
running these kind of kiosk,

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.900
the corner stores
in these villages,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.280
because they were
already selling goods.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.907
But it turned out that
these kiosk owners

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:58.490
were more interested in moving
the inventory they were already

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.041
carrying in their shops.

00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:01.790
And so they didn't
really try to encourage

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.590
people to buy from the catalog.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.470
And the people who ended up
making much better agents

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.440
were complementary
businesses, like hair salons,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.570
where people would be
waiting to get their haircut,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.070
they could flip
through the catalog,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.100
and it would be an
additional stream of income.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.924
So through this
kind of MVP, again,

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:18.590
that looks very
different than if you're

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.090
testing an online
service, they were

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.790
able to learn a ton of stuff
very quickly very cheaply that

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.080
really helped them
refine their service.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.420
On the impact front, one
of the biggest challenges

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.510
is, as I mentioned earlier,
that it can take a long time

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.100
to fully realize impact.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.970
One of the examples of where
that's true is in education.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.160
The educational attainment
can take years to realize.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.690
Summit Public Schools is another
nonprofit in the Bay Area.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.490
And they set out with this
idea of Diane Tavenner, who's

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.730
the founder, set
out with the idea

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.490
that she wanted to run the
school for a diverse student

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.570
body, where 100% of the
students would graduate college.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.665
Now they brought in all the best
practices that they could find,

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:05.570
set up a charter school,
and eight years later,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.100
when their first
cohort graduated

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.510
from college, what
they found was

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.190
they were doing significantly
better than average.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.100
And they were getting
all sorts of pressure

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.180
to scale their model.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.650
And Diane said, wait, slow down.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.860
We're doing really
good, but we're still

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.550
far short of the 100% target.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.200
We can do better.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.120
But she also said,
there is no way

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.820
I'm waiting another eight years
to try something different

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.270
and see if it works.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.820
And so what she
decided instead is

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.040
to figure out how
to build a culture

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.720
and process for
speeding up learning

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.300
within their organization.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.730
And that consisted of coming
up with a platform where

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.900
they could capture data.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.720
So they moved to a
weekly cycle where

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.400
they would do
student assessments

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.630
to see what students learned.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.950
They would have
focus groups, see

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.741
what people were engaged
with, get feedback

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.270
from teachers, and so forth--
and gather all this data

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.740
on a weekly basis.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.460
And they ended up running
57 weeks of experiments,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.680
kind of varying the
length, and duration,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.990
and nature of different
classroom elements,

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.600
to come up with this
revolutionary model

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.880
of personalized learning.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.340
And today, that model
of personalized learning

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.390
has been adopted by
over 300 public schools.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:19.160
And last year, their students
had a 99% admission rate

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.180
to college.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.310
So they haven't graduated
yet, but they're

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.200
learning much, much faster now.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.310
And so it's just an example
that, a lot of times,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.810
even though the full impact may
take a long time to realize,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.500
there's earlier
indicators that we

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.480
can capture that help us improve
and refine our interventions.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.060
The third pillar of social
innovation is growth.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.340
And I want to share the
example of VisionSpring

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.590
to illustrate what
growth might look like,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.530
because it's very different
than in the private sector.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.320
So VisionSpring set out with--

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.700
their audacious goal was
to take an invention that's

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.320
700 years old, that has been
proven to increase productivity

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.440
and learning potential,
and that's eyeglasses.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.349
We often think of innovation as
got to be some whiz bang latest

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.650
technology, but they took
something that's 700 years old,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.210
and yet two and a half billion
people who need eyeglasses

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.250
don't have them today.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.210
And so they set out to
try to figure this out.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.980
They started out by going to
two geographies, El Salvador

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.690
and India, hiring
some people they

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.910
called "vision entrepreneurs"
to do outreach to these--

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.240
to people in rural areas
and provide vision care.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.130
And they came back
with compelling stories

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.400
of kids who were able
to learn, of adults

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.797
who were able to work again.

00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:38.130
And for most nonprofits, they
would be thrilled by this.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.140
They're making a huge difference
in these people's lives.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.100
But VisionSpring thought
it wasn't enough.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.350
They were losing money with
every person they reached.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.720
They would never be
able to get to scale.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.440
So they pivoted.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.560
Their second incarnation,
they created vision centers

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.970
in more urban areas, and served
a more affluent population,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.339
and took the profits from
that to cross-subsidize,

00:17:58.339 --> 00:17:59.630
outreach some more rural areas.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.213
And so through this, they became
financially self sustainable.

00:18:02.213 --> 00:18:03.950
Again, the holy grail
for nonprofits--

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.750
I'm making a big
difference, and I'm

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.610
financially self-sustainable.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.990
But it still wasn't enough.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.970
Because it would have
taken them decades to be

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.700
able to scale their
infrastructure to reach

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.320
everyone they wanted to reach.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.400
So they pivoted again.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.380
They ended up partnering with
an organization in Bangladesh

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.260
called BRAC that has a network
of community health care

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.480
workers in every
corner of the country

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.404
and provided vision services
through this existing network.

00:18:29.404 --> 00:18:31.070
And so through this
partnership, they've

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.030
now been able to reach
over a million people.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.530
And through additional
partnerships,

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.870
they've reached over four
and a half million people.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.470
And so now, they're making
a difference, financially

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.390
self-sustainable, and
reaching millions.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.280
There's only one problem.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.100
Four and a half million
people is a tiny fraction

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.360
of 2 and 1/2 billion people.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.919
And they recognized
that this is not

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.710
something any one
organization could solve.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.990
There's a systems problem
that manufacturers

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.360
weren't incentivized to
create low cost enough classes

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.285
and get them distributed
to rural areas.

00:18:58.285 --> 00:19:00.410
Governments weren't taking
care of the basic vision

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.891
needs of their populations.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.890
And so they started a
public private partnership

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.840
called the EYElliance
that brings together

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.550
eyeglass manufacturers,
and governments,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.370
and nonprofits to look
at these systems issues.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.850
And one of their first
successes was an MOU

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.280
they signed with the
government of Liberia,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.650
where the government
agreed to integrate vision

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.350
care into their public health
system and public school

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.071
system.

00:19:22.071 --> 00:19:23.570
And so you can
imagine that, as they

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.430
look at this more
on a systemic level,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.610
and try to influence policy
and influence market dynamics,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.470
that they have a hope
of eventually getting

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.200
to that two and a
half billion number.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.250
So the last principle
of "Lean Impact"

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.470
is to relentlessly seek impact.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.050
Now this may seem like
the obvious thing to do.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.210
After all, these are
mission-driven organizations.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.100
Of course they're
going to seek impact.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.650
But it turns out that
there's so many things that

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.660
push in the opposite direction.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.970
You've all probably heard
of this phrase, fall in love

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.950
with the problem,
not the solution.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.440
And what I see with a
lot of organizations

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.200
is that people get
excited about applying

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.740
a particular technology
or the particular role

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.540
of their organization,
or they have

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.300
pride of ownership over the
design of an intervention

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.580
that they have invested
their time and energy into

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.720
and have seen make a difference.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.330
One of the indicators
of this, to me,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.890
as I talk to lots of different
international NGOs who work

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.650
in education, or health
care, or agriculture--

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.750
and a lot of them have
similar programs--

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.010
and every one of them will tell
me their program is the best.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.870
And they can't all
possibly be right.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.850
And so we're not
really being rigorous

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.420
in looking at what really is
the best solution to a problem.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.140
People are just getting
accustomed to promoting

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.920
their thing--

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.170
because it's on their website.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.920
It's what they
pitched to funders.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.800
Everybody's saying why
their thing is the best.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.050
And very few of them
can tell me basic--

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.790
answer basic
questions like, what

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.920
is the cost effectiveness
of your solution

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.090
so that we can actually
compare these things.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.300
And so part of what
I think we need to do

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.750
is start looking at
the right metrics.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.446
Eric talks about
the vanity metrics

00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:05.070
as these absolute numbers of the
number of people we've reached

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.720
or the number of
dollars we've raised.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.345
These are the things
that organizations

00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:09.510
tend to highlight if you--

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.680
as much as they talk about
mission on the outside,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.710
on the inside, if you go to
the executive team meetings,

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.360
this is what they're
talking about--

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.818
how many people did you reach,
how many dollars you raised,

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:18.930
what's our grant pipeline.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.190
None of these things have
any correlation with impact.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.940
You can reach a lot
of people, but did you

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.130
actually improve their lives?

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.860
And even if you did
improve their lives,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.740
could somebody else have done
more with the same resources?

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.850
So instead, what I think
we need to focus on

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.360
is the metrics on the
right, which are, what

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.840
I call the innovation metrics.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.860
These are the unit-level metrics
on value, growth, and impact--

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.980
things such as the adoption
rate, the unit costs,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.880
the success rate, that will
pay dividends over time

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.656
as you optimize those.

00:21:52.656 --> 00:21:54.030
And a lot of times,
we don't even

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.750
know what this data is when it
comes to social interventions.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.910
We're focusing too much
on actually just reaching

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.980
more and more people
and not on really

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.020
optimizing for the basic
unit drivers of success.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.710
So I'll just wrap up
by saying, the one--

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.050
I could sum down one
thing that I really

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.150
wanted to accomplish
with this book is

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.700
to change the minds of
the world for anybody,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.790
any organization who
cares about social good,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.460
whether you're
volunteering your time,

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.990
you're donating
your money, you're

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.140
working on a project
for social good

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.010
or otherwise, I think we
need to raise the bar.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:36.030
Companies are expected to
maximize shareholder value,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.935
maximize profits.

00:22:36.935 --> 00:22:38.310
And we have all
these regulations

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.880
that force them to do so, and
companies will relentlessly

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.770
maximize their profits.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.070
I think we need to bring that
same attitude to social good.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.930
If you're a mission-driven
organization,

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.950
or you claim to be, it's not
enough to deliver some good.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.960
We too easily let
ourselves settle

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.220
for delivering some good.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.690
We made some difference.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.640
Instead, I think we
need to hold ourselves

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.180
accountable to maximizing the
impact and scale of our work.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.910
And so, to me, that means
setting those audacious goals,

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.370
really thinking about
the size and the need,

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.740
but then starting
small, and testing,

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.490
and optimizing what we deliver
around value growth and impact

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.670
and staying relentlessly
focused on achieving

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.720
the maximum impact possible.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.424
Thank you.

00:23:23.424 --> 00:23:28.867
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:31.200
JACQUELLINE FULLER: So I'm
going to ask a few questions,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.820
but get your questions ready.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.790
We'll turn it over in a minute.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.480
This is kind of a
self-selected group,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.660
but I think you are a
hero to many at Google

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.250
because we tend to attract
technologists and people who

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.340
care very, very deeply about
using their skills to change

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:47.870
the world.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.360
And so I think a lot of folks
are asking themselves, how can

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.030
I make the most impact on the
issues I care about, especially

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.070
if I'm a technologist.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.119
So what's your advice to
all of these Googlers?

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:03.660
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, that was
a question I was asking myself.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.320
I couldn't figure out--

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.760
OK, I know how to
build software.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.560
How am I possibly going to make
an impact on Google poverty?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.360
And this may be a
little heretical,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.980
given what Google.org
org does, but I

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.960
think that the first
thing people leap to is,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.480
like, let's figure out
how to use technology.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.640
And I think that
using technology

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.370
is absolutely a powerful
tool that the social sector

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.830
generally does not know
how to use well enough.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.290
But I think, equally,
if not more so,

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.360
it's how we build
the technology.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.180
I mean, Google is
not outstanding

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.964
only because of the
technology it builds,

00:24:34.964 --> 00:24:35.880
but it's the process--

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.480
JACQUELLINE FULLER: The system.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.355
ANN MEI CHANG: --by
which we build it, right?

00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:41.130
I often give the example of,
everyone thinks of Google

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.050
as one of the most innovative
companies on the planet.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.250
And yet if you look at it,
Google didn't invent search.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.900
Like, there was Infoseek and--

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.440
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, but
Google got better at search

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.750
because it iterated and improved
the user interface, the feature

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.920
set, the algorithms and so
forth faster than anyone else.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.624
And it's that muscle of being
able to do that that I think

00:25:03.624 --> 00:25:05.790
is really missing from the
social sector in addition

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.700
to the technology.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.170
So I think what I
found is once I--

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.880
you have to start with
a lot of humility,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.510
because there's so much we don't
know not living in that world,

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.130
but there's still
much value we can add,

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.790
because we bring
a skill set that

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.430
doesn't exist, for the
most part, in the sector.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.839
And so there's huge,
huge opportunity there.

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:27.880
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.746
Little infomercial for
being a Google.org Fellow--

00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:33.120
we have some in
the room here who

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.750
have volunteered for some of our
partners, like Thorn and Center

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.620
for Policing Equity, but our
hypothesis is, basically,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.910
that we can help do the most
good as Google, Google.org,

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.850
and we're really leaning into
providing resources, but most

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.050
importantly our Googlers.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.240
And so we're sending out
teams for six months at a time

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.740
to really--

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.400
ANN MEI CHANG: Oh, that's great.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.380
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
--yeah, deeply embed.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.720
And we've got some folks
here who've done that.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.060
But you know, you raise a good
point, too, in the book about,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.740
I think sometimes we can have
some hubris in the tech world

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.250
and think that we sort of know
everything and can just go in

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.161
and solve everything.

00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:11.160
And you know, those folks
in the nonprofit world

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.290
are just not that bright
or not that ambitious.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.850
And I'm going to go
in and teach them.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.640
So what do you
think is something

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.790
that you've picked up from
being on both sides of the table

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.504
that tech can learn from
the nonprofit sector?

00:26:23.504 --> 00:26:25.670
ANN MEI CHANG: Well, there's
sort of the macro thing

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.711
and then the micro thing.

00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:29.070
On the macro level, you
talked about the value growth

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.620
and impact hypotheses.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.700
And Eric started out
with Silicon Valley

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.440
being value and growth
over the two hypotheses.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.260
I think that we're seeing
pressure now around the world

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.510
on the impact that tech has.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.160
And I think that my hope is
not only does the social sector

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.130
adopt some of these tools
from the tech sector,

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.930
but maybe some of
this will flow back,

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.990
where we can also be looking
at the impact hypothesis

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.300
as something we should
equally weigh and value

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.430
as we develop products.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.420
Because the kind of reach that
Google and other companies

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.840
have is huge, and we need
to think about the impact

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.310
we're having.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.600
At a micro level, I think that
one of the things I've seen

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.690
is tech people coming into
the social sector, especially

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.090
global development, which is
hard because you're working

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.100
with people who are very,
very different than you,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.225
who are very far away, who
have different cultures,

00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:21.270
and languages, and lives.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.950
And I think there can
be this hubris to say,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.120
hey, we can build
you an app for that,

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.190
not to mention they don't
have smartphones or let

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.650
alone a signal, right?

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.565
And so people who have
been in the social sector

00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:37.830
and global development
for a long time

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.920
have worked in and out
with the local populations

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.100
and have a much better
understanding of the realities

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.770
of what people live with.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.290
And I think we
can often be naive

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.912
and just assuming that
if we build an app

00:27:51.912 --> 00:27:53.370
or provide the
technology that it's

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.494
going to change everything.

00:27:54.494 --> 00:27:57.960
And there's so many-- you know,
that's like 2% of the problem.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.240
There are so many
other dynamics at play.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.320
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Well,
you talked, too, in the book,

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.660
and Bryan Stevenson has this
phrase, "get proximate--"

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.460
you know, how
important it is for us

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.160
to just roll up our
sleeves, and go, and listen,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.500
listen with empathy.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.940
How has that played
out in your career?

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.630
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, I think
it's so essential to get

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.182
proximate, and not just, like--

00:28:17.182 --> 00:28:19.140
I think sometimes people
think, "get proximate"

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.480
means go take a trip
to Kenya for a week,

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.160
and talk to some
people, and come home,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.267
and then you build your product.

00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:26.850
One of the examples
I give in the book

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.150
is of Proximity Designs--

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.640
incorporated that
into their name.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.390
When they decided to
work with smallholder

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.430
farmers and Myanmar,
they literally picked up

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.470
and moved there.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.920
Because what it
allowed them to do

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.310
is, every day, be living among
and talking to the farmers they

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.710
were trying to serve
and be able to design

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.460
with them in the whole
process and every day

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.190
be able to bring prototypes
and get their feedback.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.590
And so they were able to
speed up their feedback loop

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.870
by being there and getting
that kind of feedback.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.550
And I think that's
just so essential.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.312
Because we make so
many bad assumptions,

00:28:58.312 --> 00:29:00.020
especially when we're
working with people

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.228
who are so different than us.

00:29:04.674 --> 00:29:06.590
One of the things I
learned is that innovating

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.289
is so much harder in the social
sector for a number of reasons.

00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:10.580
But this is one of the reasons.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.020
Like, here, when we
build products at Google,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.394
we're generally
building products

00:29:13.394 --> 00:29:15.510
that are for people like us.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.760
And during my time at Google--

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.160
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Which is part of problem.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.618
ANN MEI CHANG:
Yeah, during my time

00:29:18.618 --> 00:29:21.230
at Google, the products
that we failed at the most

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.110
were ones for people who
were not quite like us.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.090
Because we were so used
to-- we have a system--

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.240
JACQUELLINE FULLER: And
because we're not very diverse,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.730
there's a lot of people
that aren't quite like us.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.990
ANN MEI CHANG: Yes, exactly.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.531
Yeah, I think that's
really an issue.

00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:33.670
But when you're building
products for people like,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.670
you can use the product.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.711
You dog-food the product.

00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:37.365
You get generally
pretty good feedback.

00:29:37.365 --> 00:29:38.990
And you have a pretty
good sense of how

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.157
people are going to respond.

00:29:40.157 --> 00:29:41.781
That's completely
different when you're

00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:43.320
working with
vulnerable populations,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.736
whether domestic
or international,

00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:49.310
that just don't have the same
instincts, assumptions, culture

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.880
that we do.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.964
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Mm-hm.

00:29:50.964 --> 00:29:52.463
So one more question,
then I'm going

00:29:52.463 --> 00:29:53.800
to open it up to the audience.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.070
So you talked about the
importance of nonprofits

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.960
being able to be
self-sustaining,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.960
and I think some of the problem
in the nonprofit culture,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.770
frankly, or a lot of it, is
derived to just how skewed they

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.960
are by funders, and that
funders acted more responsibly

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.030
and in line with providing
incentives around true impact.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.110
I loved your slide about
measuring true impact.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:22.220
But do you have a thought
on this social businesses,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.570
versus nonprofits,
versus governments?

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.920
You know, how do you think
about the different roles

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.350
that each of those kinds
of groups can play in this?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.891
ANN MEI CHANG: It's
a great question.

00:30:31.891 --> 00:30:35.820
And funders is probably the
biggest barrier to innovation

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.510
that I consistently hear
when I talk to nonprofits.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:43.260
And it's because of the
nature of restrictive funding.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.360
I think that both funders
and nonprofits, or donors

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.750
and nonprofits, are
trying too much to solve

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.380
the problem themselves.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.500
And if you look at just
the numbers in terms

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.630
of how much donor
dollars there are

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.120
and how much reach
nonprofits have,

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.700
they're not set up
for almost any problem

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.350
to be able to deliver at
the scale that's needed.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.910
And so what I think we need to
do is shift our thinking a bit

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.860
and think of donors
and nonprofits

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.010
more as incubators, as
the startups if you will,

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.600
to figure out the
better solutions.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.460
Because they can be
close to the problem.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.430
They can experiment, and
take risks, and figure out

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.950
how to deliver better services.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.450
And when they do,
then, I think there's

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.759
like three general paths
to scale that are possible.

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:31.800
And it depends on the type
of thing you're doing.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.550
But one path of scale is if you
can develop a private sector

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.390
business model.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.000
But that may start with a
nonprofit or social enterprise

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.720
because the upside
may not be big enough

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.570
and the risk may be too high
for a private sector company

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.660
to take it on.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.260
And so this is where donors and
nonprofits can sort of de-risk

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.630
and refine a model, and
then be able to hand it

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.240
off to private sector to
be a to take it forward.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.680
The other end of the extreme
is for basic social services.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.480
Government is really
the path to scale.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.060
Government spends
a lot of money,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.730
many more times than
philanthropy spends,

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.289
providing social services
for its citizens,

00:32:07.289 --> 00:32:08.830
whether it's education
or health care

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.670
are some of the biggest areas--

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.010
but so where we
can help government

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.640
more cost effectively spend
its money by coming up

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.670
with new and better
solutions, we

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.860
can leverage that money
that government is already

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.590
spending in a much better way
to make a bigger difference.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.350
And the third kind of
path is some variation

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.300
on replication or franchising,
that maybe it's not just

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.430
one private sector
company or one government,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.010
but it can be lots of
smaller organizations

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:40.520
in different places
who are all adapting--

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.070
microfinance is sort of a great
example of the replication

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.640
model, getting to
millions of people,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.167
people in both the private
sector and nonprofit models.

00:32:48.167 --> 00:32:49.250
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Great.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.250
Well, let's open it up
to questions in the room.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.170
And do we have any on
the Livestream as well?

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.080
Yeah, go ahead.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.600
AUDIENCE: I do have a question.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.550
And I apologize; I was
trying to figure out

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.500
how to formulate this well.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.480
I think there's a
culture in Silicon Valley

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.355
of, scale is good, right?

00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.980
Like, scale is the
thing that you want.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.896
And I think-- I agree.

00:33:06.896 --> 00:33:08.261
It'd be good to see more scale.

00:33:08.261 --> 00:33:09.760
I think a corollary
of this, though,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.301
is that organizations that are
trying to scale, then, kind of

00:33:12.301 --> 00:33:14.320
ignore the problems
that don't scale well.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.070
And you mentioned
the hockey stick

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.900
graph of mobile
phones sales going up

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.434
and latrines not really.

00:33:19.434 --> 00:33:22.100
And I think there's a reason why
Google cell phones and we don't

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.050
sell latrines.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.510
I guess my question is, what
do you think happens in, say,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.920
a decade when social
impact organizations all

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.830
start to stay that it becomes
this culture of, like, desire

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.700
to scale and kind of
a demand, and need,

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.150
and baseline as to scale,
and then, they start to say,

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.330
OK, we're going to ignore
the hard-to-scale problems

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.072
and only address the
ones that's scalable?

00:33:42.072 --> 00:33:43.530
Is that something
you think there's

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.875
a way to hedge against that?

00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:46.840
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.170
So I do think that, in
just about every case,

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.290
we should be aiming
for scale, but I

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.790
don't think that means we should
pick off the easy problems.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.090
I think that social sector
organizations should

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.535
focus on the toughest problems.

00:33:59.535 --> 00:34:01.160
The reason that we
need a social sector

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.724
is where both markets and
governments are failing.

00:34:03.724 --> 00:34:05.265
And so if markets
and the governments

00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:06.660
are already working,
like mobile phones,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.550
you don't need nonprofits
to get involved.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.260
So they, generally,
should be focused

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.570
on the problems that aren't
being taken up by others.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.800
And I think for any
kind of problem,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.290
we should think
about how to scale.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.600
I get a lot of questions
from folks about,

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.476
how about local
community organizations.

00:34:22.476 --> 00:34:23.850
And one of the
things I would say

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.406
is that, yes, local
community organizations

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:28.739
are essential-- to be close
to the community, understand

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.550
the community, and so forth.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.060
But I would ask a few questions.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.070
First, are you delivering
the most cost-effective

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.360
intervention that you could?

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.030
Whether it's you're trying
to help the homeless,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.750
or feed the hungry,
or whatever--

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.350
are you doing this as cost
effectively as possible?

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.380
If not, can you learn
from or take practices

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.659
from other organizations
that are figuring this out.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.810
And if you are, if you've gotten
to the most cost-effective way

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.270
to do this and you're also
reaching all the people that

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.455
need this, you should
absolutely tell other people

00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:01.830
how you're doing this so they
don't have to all figure it

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:02.640
out themselves.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.470
And scaling doesn't mean having
to scale your organization.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.530
It means scaling the impact.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.080
And so I think
there's very few cases

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.480
I can think of where you
wouldn't want to get the scale,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.230
but that doesn't mean--

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.670
I don't see organizations
say, oh, we're

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.530
only going to tackle
problems that get to scale.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.050
I think they really have the
problems they want to tackle.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.760
The problem is that they're
really focusing their success

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.616
on delivering to a
finite number of people

00:35:25.616 --> 00:35:27.240
instead of looking
at how to really get

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.087
to everyone that needs it.

00:35:29.087 --> 00:35:31.170
AUDIENCE: And my question
is about more tactically

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.360
around when you
think you are ready.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.560
And I think, for context,
like 10 years ago,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.240
if I finish master in
CS, and I got two offers,

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.880
one was in a nonprofit
doing consulting and doing

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.470
capacity-building
for nonprofits.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.990
And the other one was for
Google being a developer.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.880
And I wanted to
go to a nonprofit,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.090
but my mentors that said, hey,
good intentions aren't enough.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.610
Go get your skills,
money, network and stuff.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:58.050
So 10 years have gone by, and
I'm still evaluating that.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.080
And my question is
along the lines of,

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.570
when do you know you're
ready to make a transition?

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.930
And specifically, looking
back, were there muscles

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.670
that you felt you
underflexed and muscles

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.730
that you felt you
over-flexed now

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.022
that you are on the other side?

00:36:13.022 --> 00:36:14.855
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
That's a great question.

00:36:14.855 --> 00:36:16.620
ANN MEI CHANG: It
is a great question.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.507
I made a somewhat arbitrary
decision in my mid 20s;

00:36:19.507 --> 00:36:21.090
I was going to spend
half of my career

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.226
in tech Silicon Valley
and half of my career--

00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:24.600
so for me, it was
just, like, oh,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.210
now, I'm 42 or
something like that.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.255
It's time to do it.

00:36:29.255 --> 00:36:30.630
I don't think
there's one answer.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.247
I'll tell you my
experience of this.

00:36:32.247 --> 00:36:34.080
Because I think it's
different-- some people

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.780
start from the beginning in
the social sector and do great.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.730
And other people
come in very late.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.090
For me, what worked
out well about doing it

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.060
mid-career is I
think the reality is

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.450
that you can
personally learn faster

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.790
in the private sector
than social sector.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.190
There's a lot more resources.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.839
There's a lot more
talent than expertise.

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:56.130
There's a lot more competition.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.480
Things move faster.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.540
And so I felt like
I developed skills

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.254
at two or three times the rate
I would have by being in Silicon

00:37:04.254 --> 00:37:05.670
Valley then I would
have if I just

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.810
started in the social sector.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.380
And so the other
thing is I think

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.840
that because there's
a lot of dysfunction

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.420
in the sector, a
lot of us, I think,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.280
would be pretty frustrated
going into the social sector

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.640
in a junior level role,
where we're essentially

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.320
executing on those
grand master plans

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.800
that someone came up with.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.640
And so, for me, it was
more interesting going in,

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.770
where I could be in
a senior enough role

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.250
that I had some say over
the planning of things

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.770
and the strategy for things
so that I felt like I

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.240
could make a bigger difference.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.950
And exactly what point
in time there is,

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.825
I don't think there's
an exact science to it,

00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:43.140
but I think that spending enough
time in the private sector

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.250
to build up your skills--

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.790
think about what you want your
unique advantage to be when

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.570
you go to the social sector.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.800
If it's technical
capabilities, again, you'll

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.769
learn faster here
than you will there.

00:37:57.769 --> 00:38:00.060
But then, at some point, you
can bring it to government

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.590
or to a nonprofit.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.960
If it's leadership
experience, that's

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.110
a different type of thing.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.990
Or if it's innovation
experience,

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.573
those are the kinds
of things that you

00:38:09.573 --> 00:38:12.330
can develop great expertise
in at a place like Google

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.760
and then, eventually, be
able to cross-fertilize that

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.320
to other types of organizations.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.945
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I think the
other thing that I tell folks--

00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:22.641
because I get asked this
question a lot as well-- is,

00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:24.390
especially if you're
right out of college,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.000
I strongly encourage people to
go get their transferable skill

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.820
in business, whether that's
accounting, or marketing,

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.970
or coding--

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.660
get-- really do what
Ann Mei was saying,

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.630
but be careful that
you don't create

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.742
a lifestyle that's
unsustainable to work

00:38:40.742 --> 00:38:41.950
in government or non-profits.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.720
Because those same
people who I counsel,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.140
sometimes I check
in five years later,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.190
and they're like, ah,
man, I got this mortgage.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.670
And yeah, I wanted to do--

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.220
go work for Give
directly, but I can't.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.640
So there's some
practicalities to it, too,

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.710
in terms of freeing yourself
to do the kinds of things

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.110
that you want to do
at a certain season.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.970
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah,
that's a great point.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.050
And the other way to do it is
not necessarily to have it be

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.740
a one-way shift, that I
think this fellowship that

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.480
you've talked about,
which sounds new--

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.350
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Which he did.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.510
ANN MEI CHANG:
Oh, which you did.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.890
Is something that didn't
exist when I was at Google,

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.990
I made up my own
fellowship, essentially--

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.540
took a leave of absence.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.970
But the US government now
has a US digital services

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.500
and 18F where
they're taking people

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.360
in for like one or two years.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.410
And then, you can
go back to your job.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.052
And so for some people,
it doesn't necessarily

00:39:36.052 --> 00:39:37.760
make sense for it to
be a one-way street.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.176
You may want to
come back, but you

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:41.470
could take a year or
two out and do something

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.289
to contribute back.

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:44.830
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Any idea on where

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.590
to fundraise when nonprofit
needs to be agile--

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.090
try, fail, iterate--
without showing

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.340
appealing concrete
impact numbers to donor?

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.560
ANN MEI CHANG:
Yes, that is hard.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.580
Because most big
donors tend to like

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:04.390
to fund very
rigid-defined programs.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.620
The good news is that--

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.090
JACQUELLINE FULLER: And they
like the big reach numbers.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.260
ANN MEI CHANG: Yes, they do.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.009
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Speaking for a friend.

00:40:13.276 --> 00:40:16.902
ANN MEI CHANG: So it's hard to
answer this in a general sense.

00:40:16.902 --> 00:40:19.360
The good news is I think more
and more donors are waking up

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:19.859
to this.

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:22.300
I spend a lot of time going
around talking to donors.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.270
And both-- there is a lot
of more innovative, smaller

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:31.670
donors, like Google.org, Echoing
Green, Draper Richards Kaplan,

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.890
JACQUELLINE FULLER: GiveWell.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.889
ANN MEI CHANG: GiveWell.

00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:37.330
So there's a lot of these
smaller, more innovative

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.950
donors, if you will,
that specialize in--

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:46.180
Mulago Foundation here-- that
specialize in kind of helping--

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.970
allowing people to iterate
and failed an experiment

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.540
and so forth.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.990
And so finding the relevant
ones in your space is great.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.480
The other good news is that
more and more of l big donors

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.060
are also starting to do
this-- so not necessarily

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.500
in the core of
what they're doing,

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.695
but almost every donor
now has something

00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:03.820
on this side where they
have more flexible funding.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.970
So at USAID, we had the
development innovation ventures

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.980
that was modeled after
venture capital that

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.520
did tiered funding that started
at $100,000, and $1 million,

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.369
and $5 million, where we
could take a lot more risk.

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:17.410
And then, we spun out the
Global Innovation Fund.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.035
That's similar.

00:41:18.035 --> 00:41:19.420
We have the grand
challenges that

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:25.070
are similar on specific issues,
where we need better solutions.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.280
So there's a lot of
different things out there.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.070
Whoever asked this question,
I'm happy to talk to, depending

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.940
on your specific type of thing.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.140
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Irwin's
done a lot of work--

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.580
who asked the question--
has done a lot of work

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.900
internally on Google's
social impact projects.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.340
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, and I
would encourage you all that,

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.460
as you donate money,
also, as donors yourself,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.130
even if you're not a huge
mega donor like the Gates

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.620
Foundation, you can
help organizations

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.840
by giving them
unrestricted money,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.750
to allow them to do this
kind of experimentation.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.300
JACQUELLINE FULLER: If you
don't have the time or knowhow

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.490
to do the research
to find those,

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.650
you can use proxies
like GiveWell

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.840
and are groups like
Fast Forward, who

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.150
are funding tech-based
non-profits, who

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:10.220
you can use them as a proxy
for really understanding deeply

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.945
the impact.

00:42:13.741 --> 00:42:16.240
AUDIENCE: I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about how

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.060
you would make the pitch
for this type of approach

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.936
in industries where--

00:42:20.936 --> 00:42:22.810
like the government for
example, where things

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.890
tend to move a lot slower.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:24.790
Because I can
imagine if you were

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.010
to take this approach--
like, you give a couple

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.349
examples of how spots in
the federal government

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:31.390
are becoming more innovative
with their spending,

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.150
but they tend to be very niche
programs, whereas I can imagine

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.499
if you took this to a
career program officer,

00:42:36.499 --> 00:42:38.290
they might perceive of
someone from Silicon

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.030
Valley as an outsider.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.096
So how do you make a
pitch for rapid iteration

00:42:42.096 --> 00:42:44.470
in a place where the culture
is kind of like, well, we've

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.755
always done it this way.

00:42:45.755 --> 00:42:47.546
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:42:47.546 --> 00:42:50.080
I mean, government is
a huge institution,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.970
and it changes very slowly.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.060
The good news is that
there are career people.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.120
So this was, essentially,
my charter at USAID.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.860
I was the first
executive director

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.480
for the Global Development Lab.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.540
We were set up as a bureau
to really promote-- you know,

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.040
transform global development.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.830
And we're a little
corner of the agency,

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.900
but our mission
was to go reach out

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.420
to other parts of the
agency, find those advocates,

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.610
work with them to
build success stories.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:19.090
So it's just like
adoption of any new thing.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.620
You have to go step by step.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.310
And so we would start by
experimenting ourselves,

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.690
showing it could be done,
then we would partner

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.640
with the early adopters
across the agency

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.250
that we could find, the Senior
Foreign Service officers, who

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.220
were like mission directors,
but who are forward leaning,

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.680
and we'd get a handful of
them to try stuff with us

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.590
and show that they could do it,
and they had their own network

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.560
of other Senior Foreign Service
officers that trusted them,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.590
that they could then tell
and then be our advocates,

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.190
and spread the word further.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.060
And so it's step by step,
that kind of adoption

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.581
curve that takes a long time.

00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:52.330
And one of the most
exciting things for me

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.360
in writing this book is--

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.830
I left USAID and government
at the end of the Obama

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.190
administration-- when I launched
this book three months ago

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.070
at the Brookings Institute
in DC, one of the speakers

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.010
on the panel, like
Jacquelline is being here,

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.230
was Jim Richardson,
who's one of the most

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.500
senior political
appointees in USAID,

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.010
as part of the Trump
administration.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.420
He runs the Policy and
Budget Bureau for USAID.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.740
And he read the whole book.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.864
He said, this is exactly
what we're trying to do.

00:44:19.864 --> 00:44:21.530
We're trying to move
all our procurement

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.830
so that 30% of
what we're spending

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.260
is going through innovative
funding mechanisms.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.700
And so even this administration,
which has its challenges,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.320
is still moving
these things forward.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.870
And so I do think
there's movement,

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.589
but it will be slow because
government is just slow.

00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:39.130
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
We've found, too,

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.040
in working with-- as google.org
in working with USAID,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.840
for example, we've
been supporting

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.820
using direct unconditional
cash transfers as a benchmark,

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.730
as you talked about.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.063
ANN MEI CHANG: Household grants.

00:44:50.063 --> 00:44:53.080
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Yeah,
and worked with USAID

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.740
to do some A/B
testing with them.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.350
And I think sometimes,
as you were saying,

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.820
other groups can help de-risk
ideas, prove them out,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.039
but really, the government,
groups like USAID,

00:45:07.039 --> 00:45:09.080
are the ones who are going
to do things at scale.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.630
So us doing a partnership with
USAID is a way to take an idea,

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.680
test it out, see where it works,
where it doesn't, and have

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.910
government bring it to scale.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.420
ANN MEI CHANG:
Yeah, you're always

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.050
going to have people who are
going to drag their feet,

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.710
but I think you also are
always going to have people

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.120
who really are mission-driven.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.700
If they see something's going
to work better, and get better

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.780
results, and save lives--

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.560
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
In our case, it

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.530
was like the Rwandan mission
stepped forward and was like,

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.150
we want to do this.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.760
So it's finding folks within.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.780
And when you went to--

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.279
we've talked a lot
about government,

00:45:39.279 --> 00:45:41.950
but when you went into the
nonprofit sector as well,

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.540
you went into an
innovation-- was it

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.770
the innovation lab at Mercy?

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.240
ANN MEI CHANG: It wasn't
called the Innovation--

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.860
I led the Social Ventures team.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.609
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Yeah, Social Ventures.

00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:54.640
And so even with our large
multinational non-profits

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.235
as well, similarly,
there are ways to--

00:45:57.235 --> 00:45:59.110
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah,
and I think almost every

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.900
of the large international NGOs
now, almost every one of them

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.400
has some sort of
innovation lab now.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.900
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.400
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.349
I know that government often
has a strain on its budget,

00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:12.140
whether that's like
San Francisco City Hall

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.180
or maybe USAID.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.510
So I'm really interested in
public private partnerships.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.270
In your research, did
you see any good example

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.180
of a government
working with companies

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.015
to scale their impact?

00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:28.140
ANN MEI CHANG: Government
working with-- you mean--

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.639
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
like, for example, I

00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:31.970
know in San Francisco,
maybe the local government

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:39.530
will work with companies in the
area to provide jobs for people

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.600
or have an impact that
the government might not

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.874
have budget for.

00:46:42.874 --> 00:46:44.040
ANN MEI CHANG: I see, I see.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.290
Yeah.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:49.560
So it is true that government
is always crunched by budgets.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.050
But I think it's
also true that we

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.810
don't spend government
money very effectively a lot

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.740
of the time.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.377
So I think that's where
private sector can really help.

00:46:58.377 --> 00:47:00.710
I'm not sure the kind of
projects you're thinking about.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:02.780
There's such a range of
public private partnerships.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.988
That's why I was asking that.

00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:05.090
We worked on at USAID--

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.980
I was responsible for our
partnerships office as well.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.960
And so one of the
categories is what

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.370
people call "shared value."

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.310
So a classic is
Starbucks working

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:20.570
or Walmart working to source
from smallholder farmers

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.610
or from disadvantaged
populations

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.296
to try to create economic
growth for those folks

00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:27.920
but while getting the goods that
they need for their own supply

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.650
chains.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.390
So that's something where we
will cross-subsidize, where

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.840
grant money can go to do
that technical assistance,

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.537
to go find all the farmers,
build collectives, and so

00:47:38.537 --> 00:47:40.370
forth, and connect them
to the supply chains

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.078
that then companies
can kind of take over

00:47:42.078 --> 00:47:45.180
and be able to operate
on an ongoing basis.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.700
We also did things--

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.460
at the lab, for example, we
would fund for-profit entities

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.910
as well as nonprofit
entities in the early stages

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.760
to de-risk their new innovation.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.785
So we did a lot with the
off-grid energy sector, where

00:48:01.785 --> 00:48:03.740
the sort of pay-as-you
solar, where

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.300
we put in some of
the earliest money

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.540
to experiment with these
pay-as-you go solar systems,

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.140
and then over time, as
the systems were proven,

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.720
as they became financially self
sustainable, impact investors

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.600
started coming in to
be able to fund them

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.910
and at a much, much
greater degree than we

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.180
would have been able to.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.607
And so there's lots
of different ways.

00:48:22.607 --> 00:48:25.190
And I think a lot of these kind
of public private partnerships

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:28.937
like the EYElliance I
talked about earlier, where

00:48:28.937 --> 00:48:30.770
private sector and
governments come together

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.610
for collective action.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.530
I started something that Google
was involved with called,

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.300
The Alliance for
Affordable Internet that

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.840
was looking at how do we expand
access to internet around

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.890
the world by addressing market
failures and policy failures.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.249
So just a few examples,
but very important.

00:48:46.249 --> 00:48:48.290
JACQUELLINE FULLER: So we
have four minutes left,

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:51.470
so I wonder if we could
try to hit our remaining

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.192
questions quickly.

00:48:53.192 --> 00:48:55.400
ANN MEI CHANG: So one
[INAUDIBLE] implied schools are

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.590
so static is that it's hard
to test iterate on other

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:58.580
people's children's.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.537
What are ways innovative,
and even radical,

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.120
ideas can be validated
without risking

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.310
the well-being of other folks?

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:05.310
That's a great question.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.940
So I think a couple
answers to that.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.250
One is on the Summit
Public Schools thing.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.630
This was like an opt-in.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.335
People knew that their
kids were going--

00:49:13.335 --> 00:49:15.710
it wasn't like we were going
to experiment their children

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:16.880
and not tell you.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.304
It's that they saw enough
value was being provided there,

00:49:19.304 --> 00:49:20.720
and they felt like
they were still

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.095
going to get a better education
than they would otherwise

00:49:23.095 --> 00:49:24.262
that people opted into this.

00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:26.178
And I think that's
important, that people need

00:49:26.178 --> 00:49:27.446
to make have informed consent.

00:49:27.446 --> 00:49:28.820
And that can be
a little trickier

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.610
when you're working with
vulnerable populations.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.200
Two things I would say to this.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.870
One is that-- it's
one of the reasons

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.110
that we need to start small.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.220
So when you experiment with only
a very small number of people,

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.740
you can pay much more
attention to making sure

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.400
that they are made whole and
that nothing bad happens,

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.090
there's not unintended
consequences.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.250
Because you can watch what
happens with five people

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.390
much more easily than
thousands of people.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.540
The other is, I think that-- so
we need to tier up those risks,

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.780
not take too big a risk
before we're ready.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.240
The other is, I
think we also need

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.600
to ask the question of, what is
the risk of not doing anything?

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.710
So you think of
vaccines, for example.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.830
If no one was ever given
the first polio vaccine--

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.570
there was a risk to
that person's life

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.980
who got the first polio vaccine.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.380
There millions of people
would have died otherwise.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.172
But you don't
irresponsibly just randomly

00:50:14.172 --> 00:50:15.380
give someone a polio vaccine.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.466
You test in a Petri dish,
then you test it with rats,

00:50:17.466 --> 00:50:18.632
then you test it in monkeys.

00:50:18.632 --> 00:50:20.720
And then, when you get to
testing it with people,

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.532
you watch very closely, but
you still take some risks.

00:50:23.532 --> 00:50:24.740
But it's that measured risks.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.290
And you look at the upside
of, if you're successful,

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.387
the number of people's
lives you can save.

00:50:29.387 --> 00:50:30.678
JACQUELLINE FULLER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:30.678 --> 00:50:32.231
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:32.231 --> 00:50:34.730
One of the sections in your
book that really stuck out to me

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.130
was when you talk about the
different type of impact

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.520
numbers that result from
both an e-commerce business.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.910
You talk more about
the 30-day active.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:46.530
You could do sign-up
completes, et cetera,

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:50.120
more Silicon Valley numbers
that we're used to, but then how

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.170
the impact numbers for social
impact takes years to see that

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:58.310
same type of result. So I
was wondering if you had any

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.410
recommendations of
a set of numbers,

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.030
maybe three
categories of numbers,

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.840
that can sit in the middle--

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.890
so not quite 30-day
user active, but not

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.680
quite like a
four-year RCT that can

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.710
help both funders
and nonprofits guide

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:16.420
and tell the story of whether
or not a program is successful.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.052
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, I can't
give you generic metrics

00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:22.010
because they're going to
be different depending

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.740
on the type of intervention.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.350
What I would say is
that, I look at--

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.200
almost every nonprofit
has a theory of change

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.822
for what-- you know, we're
going to train these farmers,

00:51:32.822 --> 00:51:35.030
then they're going to have
better farming techniques,

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:37.140
then they're going to have
better yields for their crops,

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.431
then you're going to have
higher incomes, and whatever.

00:51:39.431 --> 00:51:40.790
You have a theory of change.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.789
And part of testing for impact
is testing those linkages

00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:44.830
and the theory of change.

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:46.700
We tend to create these
elaborate theories of change,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.320
and then put them
on the bookshelf,

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.850
and then just run through
the whole program,

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.316
then try and do
an RCT at the end.

00:51:51.316 --> 00:51:52.940
But if you test each
of those linkages,

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.590
it's like, if you
train the farmers,

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.802
did they actually do what
you trained them to do?

00:51:57.802 --> 00:52:00.260
If they didn't, you don't have
to wait four years to figure

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.510
out if their incomes increase.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.680
So what are those simpler
earlier indicators

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.310
that tell you?

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.410
And so summit public
schools did this

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.599
by measuring learning
assessments each week to say,

00:52:09.599 --> 00:52:10.640
hey, we tried this thing.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.950
Did the students learn better
than doing it some other way?

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.535
And so it really depends on the
nature of their intervention.

00:52:16.535 --> 00:52:18.410
JACQUELLINE FULLER: All
right, last question.

00:52:21.157 --> 00:52:24.620
AUDIENCE: So my sense is that
a lot of small organizations,

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.960
in particular, their thought
process is kind of, well, sure,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.720
it would be great to quantify
things and know how we're

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.670
doing, but we're just spending
all of our energy and effort

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.010
doing the real work
of the organization,

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.980
helping the target
population, whatever it is.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.770
So how do you pitch
to those groups

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.350
that reorienting
some of their efforts

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:49.880
toward coming up with metrics,
quantifying things, tracking

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.065
those metrics, is
worth the effort?

00:52:53.065 --> 00:52:55.820
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.500
One is that, I think--

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.810
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Change
funder behavior, number one.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:52:59.850
ANN MEI CHANG: Hold
them accountable.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.308
Because when your funders are
telling you, give us numbers,

00:53:02.308 --> 00:53:04.200
it's really hard to do
something different.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.870
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Give us
real numbers, give us outcomes.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:10.650
ANN MEI CHANG: Yeah, and also,
I think that in the book,

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.000
I talk about starting
with an audacious goal.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.380
So too often-- it's a short
term, long-term tradeoff,

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:16.880
right?

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.500
You can deliver more
in the short term

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.570
by just cranking out
stuff, but you're never

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.190
going to bend the
curve to accelerate

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:23.398
your growth in the long term.

00:53:23.398 --> 00:53:27.710
So you end up like the clean
water sanitation graph.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:33.360
And so it means setting
that audacious goal.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.760
Because most
nonprofits have goals

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.890
that they can meet just by
working a little bit harder.

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:42.129
And so if you have a goal that's
like 10% better than last year,

00:53:42.129 --> 00:53:43.420
there's no reason to take risk.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.670
There's no reason to innovate.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.470
There's no reason
to potentially fail.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.761
But if you have a goal that's
longer term, that's like,

00:53:48.761 --> 00:53:52.200
we've got to get to
10X, or 100X, or 1,000X,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.440
then as you're doing your
thing, you can sort of see,

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.740
are you on your
trajectory to get there?

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.930
And so I ask nonprofits, what's
your definition of success?

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.170
What does success look like
in 10 years or 20 years?

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.060
Push it out far enough
that they're not

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.310
trying to project what they're
doing today, but then look at,

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:09.820
are we on a trajectory
to get there?

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.180
And if not, and this
is your mission, what

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:16.230
do we need to do to try to shift
the curve so that we change

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:17.280
the trajectory?

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.100
JACQUELLINE FULLER: But
let's give a warm thank you

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.980
to the hero of many of us, who
is helping to not only create

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.930
a product or do one small
thing for one small group,

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:31.580
but really help an entire
sector of government

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.880
in the social sector to
understand how to be innovative

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.604
and how to really
create systems change.

00:54:38.604 --> 00:54:39.270
Thanks, Ann Mei.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.170
Thank you.

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:44.420
[APPLAUSE]
