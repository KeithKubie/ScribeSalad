00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:07.240
SIMON HOROBIN: So
this book looks

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.260
at where English has come
from, and how it's used today,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.420
and considers what it might
look like in the future.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.360
Users of English
get very anxious

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.460
about the state
of their language.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.620
Since the 15th century,
in fact, people

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.360
have feared that
English is in decline.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.000
And in an effort to halt
that downward spiral,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.370
people turn to the
authorities that they

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.800
hold dear to consider how
to maintain and preserve

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.180
these standards.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.130
But one of the questions
I raised in this book

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.710
is, where does the
authority lie when

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.115
it comes to determining the
rights and wrongs of language

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.240
use?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.084
And since we all understand
that language does change over

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:52.500
time-- after all, Shakespeare's
language is very different

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.550
to ours--

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.770
we might wonder, why are
we so reluctant to let

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.594
it change today?

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.010
Now, getting back
to that question

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.710
about where the authority
lies in determining

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.960
rights and wrongs,
the obvious place,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.480
I suppose, to turn in such
cases is a dictionary,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.600
the ultimate authority
when it comes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.570
to pronouncements over meaning.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.090
But it's not always
quite that simple.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.070
And to demonstrate
this, I thought

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.730
I'd take a recent, very
public disagreement

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.290
over the correct meaning of
a particular English word.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.580
And this concerns
the word fulsome,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760
which you might remember
it was used recently

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.440
by Priti Patel, the former
international development

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.990
secretary, in her
resignation letter

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.630
to Theresa May, where
she says at the bottom

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.900
there, "I offer a
fulsome apology to you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.630
and to the government
for what has happened

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.270
and offer my resignation."

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.400
The editor of "The Times
Literary Supplement,"

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.730
Stig Abell, responded to the
news of this announcement

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.070
by claiming that Priti
Patel had got it wrong.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.310
And that what she should have
said was "a full apology."

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.620
And he claimed "fulsome"
means insincere.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.009
She's actually said the opposite
of what she meant to say.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.410
Now, predictably, of
course, this controversy

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.780
was taken up by
"Radio 4," and there

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.280
was a debate on
the "World at One"

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.130
over the correct meaning
of the word "fulsome."

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.140
It's a nice example,
I think, of the way

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.190
in which, for users of English,
the niceties of correct usage

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.140
are often more newsworthy
than the actual news itself.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.010
So we had a debate between
Stig Abell and reformed pedant

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.800
and "Times"
columnist Oliver Kamm

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.330
about the correct
meaning of this word.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.910
But what is the answer
then to this vexed debate

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.590
over the correct
meaning of fulsome?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.820
Who got it right?

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.170
Where do we turn?

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.170
Well, if we look in the
Oxford English Dictionary,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.120
we might think of as
the ultimate authority--

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000
I know I'm slightly
biased, but it's one place

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.290
people would turn--

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.230
then we can see that the
earliest uses of the word

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.860
"fulsome," which date
back to the 14th century,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.770
mean-full, abundant,
or plentiful.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.580
It's kind of what we'd expect
from the word "fulsome."

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.120
It sort of sounds like
it's going to mean that.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.080
So if we consider that the
correct meaning of the word

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.460
is the earliest one, then
Priti Patel's fulsome apology

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.740
is simply one that is very full.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.840
But if we were to take the
view that the correct meaning

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.140
of a word is the oldest
meaning of the word,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.910
then that is problematic for
a number of different reasons.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.880
So for instance, the word silly
originally meant innocent.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.120
Nice originally meant foolish.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.857
Tall originally meant handsome.

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:43.940
If we went around trying
to insist on the earliest

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.590
historical meanings
of these words,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.820
we'd be in all
kinds of confusion.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.150
So what happened to the
word fulsome, subsequently?

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.010
Well, if we look up
the latest developments

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.140
of the word in the OED, we can
see that, by the 17th century,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.920
it had indeed developed
some different usages.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.120
And so for OED sense five
of language or behavior,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.960
sense 5A is offensive
or objectionable,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.410
owing to excess or
lack of moderation--

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.730
excessively effusive,
complimentary, too lavish,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.230
overdone.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.870
So this is obviously the
sense that Stig Abell

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.480
was taking it in.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.260
It's perhaps this
development, I suspect,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.080
that's perhaps typical of
the British uncomfortableness

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.670
with sincerity--

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.230
anyone being complimentary
simply being gushy

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.560
and overdoing it.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.190
By the early 20th century,
however, the word fulsome

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.460
began to be used in a
positive sense once again,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.310
perhaps owing to the
ambiguity in expressions

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.500
like "fulsome
praise," in which it's

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.450
difficult to
understand or determine

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.240
whether it's supposed to be
negative, positive, or neutral.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.500
And so OED sense
5B is unrestrained,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.590
exuberant, effusive,
lavish, wholehearted.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.680
So the Oxford English
Dictionary allows

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.170
us to trace this historical
overview of the world

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.590
and chart the changing
meanings of it over time,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.510
but it doesn't
actually tell us what's

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.914
the correct meaning today.

00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:11.830
And in fact, what we can
see from the evidence

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.800
is that both senses 5A and
5B are still current today.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.960
So it seems, in fact, that
there's real potential

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.620
for ambiguity here-- a word
that can be used to mean--

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.760
so when we talk about
fulsome praise, for instance,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.570
we might mean it to mean
abundant and heartfelt

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.690
or perhaps overdone
and insincere.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.780
That might seem
unhelpfully confusing,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.750
calling out for some authority
figure to come and legislate

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.760
as to which the correct
meaning of the word is.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.270
You know, the OED,
perhaps, should tell us,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.740
use it this way, not that way.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.200
But in fact, that's not
really the way language works.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.450
It's the hands of
the users rather than

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.950
of the lexicographers.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.050
And after all, many words have
a variety of different meanings,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.440
perhaps not quite as extreme
as these contradictory uses

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.790
of the word "fulsome."

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.470
But a parallel
case perhaps might

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.290
be the recent developments
in the use of the word

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.130
"literally," which of
course, etymologically,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.840
if you're one of those
literally pedants, means--

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.940
comes from Latin
littera, "letter."

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.830
So it means "to the letter,"
or "precisely," or "exactly."

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.510
But now, of course,
it's widely used

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.267
to mean precisely the opposite--
metaphorically speaking.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:26.850
And for some people,
of course, that's

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.070
a travesty of the
correct meaning,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.090
leading to all kinds of
potential for confusion.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.539
But is it really confusing?

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.080
How many times when
you hear somebody

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.430
say, I'm literally
dying for a coffee,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.880
do you actually
phone an ambulance?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.430
We can work it out
from the context.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.780
And of course, the
phrases "fulsome apology"

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.270
and "fulsome praise" are
potentially ambiguous,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.410
as we've seen.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.740
But we don't usually have to
interpret them in a vacuum.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.630
Understanding of the
word, as with all words,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.360
is guided by context.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.200
In the case we've
been looking at,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.100
it's a resignation letter
in which she expresses

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.340
clear regret for her actions.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.040
It's, of course, possible
that the use of "fulsome"

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.380
here was some kind
of covert attempt

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.720
to distance herself
from the apology.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.500
It seems unlikely.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.810
What's clear, I think, is that
Ms. Patel didn't use the word

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.670
incorrectly, rather Stig Abell
chose to deliberately misread

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.386
a potentially ambiguous usage.

00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:35.260
And interestingly, in the "Radio
4" discussion on the "World

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.100
at One," Stig Abell began
by immediately conceding

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.310
that he realized now
that the sense of full

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.435
was perfectly acceptable--

00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:46.810
made me wonder why he didn't
look it up in the dictionary

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.150
before he fired off the tweet.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.070
But nevertheless, at
least by this stage,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.640
he'd realized he was wrong.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.840
He didn't, though, however,
offer Ms. Patel an apology,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.780
fulsome or otherwise.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.910
He simply went on to
accuse her of, what

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.410
is for English speakers I
suspect, an even worse sin--

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.452
that of using a longer
word to sound more clever.

00:08:09.452 --> 00:08:11.410
So now, she's being
accused of saying "fulsome"

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.010
because it sounds better and
more intelligent than "full."

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.090
This is what HW Fowler,
in his classic usage guide

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.780
"Modern English Usage"
of 1926, memorably

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.641
encapsulated in the maxim,
the love of the long word,

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.140
came up with this
maxim-- the better

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.409
the writer, the
shorter his words.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.289
And this is an example of
many of these very nice, sort

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.960
of easily quotable
and memorable ideas

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.000
which, of course, are
useful in some cases

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.409
but not in all cases.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.650
And it's certainly not the
case that all long words

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.560
are an attempt to deliberately
obfuscate or show off.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.356
Sometimes, they're
just the right word.

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:51.730
And Stig Abell,
of course, didn't

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.010
explain how he knew
that this was an attempt

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.770
to sound intelligent, and
instead, the discussion

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.650
descended rather
predictably and depressingly

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.320
into a discussion of
rather predictable,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.450
well-worn favorites, such as
the correct meaning of decimate,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.160
disinterested, and so.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.600
What this example
shows, I think,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.220
is that questions
of correct usage

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.280
are not always as easily
resolved as we might hope.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.020
Language is more
complicated than that.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.170
Turning to a dictionary
can shed light

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.090
on the ways in which a word
like "fulsome" is used,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.150
but it doesn't
necessarily provide us

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.250
with clear right
and wrong judgments.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.020
And the reason for
that is that that's not

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.530
what lexicographers do when
they compile dictionaries.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.690
They're simply
recording how words

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.110
are used based upon
analysis of large quantities

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.870
of actual data-- actual usage.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.080
So dictionaries then
are descriptive rather

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.950
than prescriptive.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.290
They describe the
language use rather

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.562
than telling us how to use it.

00:09:50.562 --> 00:09:52.270
The authority of
traditional dictionaries

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.390
is under threat today
from online resources

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.787
like Urban Dictionary.

00:09:56.787 --> 00:09:58.620
I don't know how many
people would instead--

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.430
in an example like this--

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.520
instead of the OED,
choose Urban Dictionary.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.695
But of course, in such
cases, the authority

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:09.760
is being taken away from the
professional lexicographer

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.520
and placed in the
hands of the user.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.520
So the users are given the
power to choose the words,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.810
to define them,
and add quotations,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.730
unlike a traditional
dictionary, which

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.000
sets out to report
the facts of usage

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.780
in an impartial, neutral way.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.280
Online dictionaries-- the
partiality and bias of the user

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.330
is openly displayed, often
leading to rather contested

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.590
and contradictory entries.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.620
So as an example
of that, I've got

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.350
two definitions that
are provided in Urban

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.250
Dictionary for man-flu.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.500
See if you can work out
where the bias lies here.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.170
It's not terribly complicated.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.690
"The condition
shared by all males

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.310
where in a common illness,
usually mild cold,

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.800
is presented by the patient
as life-threatening.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.120
Man flu is more painful
than childbirth.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.310
This is irrefutable,
scientific fact."

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.620
Now, it's fairly obvious
where the bias lies here.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.660
But in other cases, they
can be more complicated.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.480
The opportunity
to redefine words

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.690
can have potentially dangerous
consequences, especially

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.070
in an era of post-truth
and fake news.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.980
For instance, when Ivanka
Trump last year was recently

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.870
accused of being complicit
in her father's agenda,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.380
she defended herself by
saying, "If being complicit

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.480
is wanting to be
a force for good

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.470
and to make a positive
impact, then I'm complicit."

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.080
Now, that might seem
reasonable enough,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.740
but is that what
complicit actually means?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.050
People turned to online
dictionaries to find out.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.960
So for instance, dictionary.com
recorded an 11,000% spike

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.610
in searches for
the word complicit

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.290
following that interview.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.485
And it led them to make it
their word of the year for 2017.

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.750
And of course, in the
dictionary, how it's defined

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.630
is "involved with others
in an activity that

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.460
is unlawful or morally wrong."

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.820
There's a subtle
distinction there.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.060
So I've been suggesting
that lexicographers

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.200
don't see themselves as arbiters
of linguistic correctness

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.130
but authors of usage
guides very frequently do.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.190
So I'm thinking of works
like Simon Heffer's "Strictly

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.240
English" or Neville
Gwynn's "Gwynn's Grammar,"

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.530
which set out to
willfully misrepresent

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.410
the complexities of
actual usage in order

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.590
to reduce them to simple
rights and wrongs.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.190
So unlike lexicographers,
authors of usage guides

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.920
issue strongly
worded prescriptions

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.190
that are based on little more
than personal preference.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.160
As an example, I've
got here Simon Heffer's

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.660
"Strictly English" definition
of the word "fulsome."

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.330
So he says, "We've all read
the phrase about someone

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.340
making a fulsome apology.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.040
Those who write it usually
believe that the adjective

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.630
means full or plentiful.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.870
It has not meant that since
the early 16th century.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.150
And after 500 years
of obsoleteness,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.200
we may legitimately consider
that use redundant."

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.730
Now, as we've just
seen, of course,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.140
that's completely not the case.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.020
In fact, since the
early 20th century,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.230
that use has been widely in use.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.720
So this is a complete
misrepresentation.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.730
But it makes for a very
straightforward kind

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.650
of distinction-- it's wrong
to use it in that way.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.790
And so it seems
to me unsurprising

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.240
that users of English in search
of guidance and certainty

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.070
turn to works like these--

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.800
the authoritative tone,
the clear-cut judgment

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.270
makes reassuring reading.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.580
I suspect Stig Abell,
editor of the "TLS,"

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.640
has a copy on his
desk that he reached

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.700
for when Priti Patel
signed off that tweet.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.300
But the problem is that
it's totally misrepresenting

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.500
this evidence, giving the
readers a misplaced confidence

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.690
in its claims.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.580
What's perhaps even more
baffling about books

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.660
like this is that not even
the authors pay attention

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.530
to many of the rules that
they themselves lay down.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.580
I've got a few examples of this
from Simon Heffer's "Strictly

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.090
English."

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.750
So for instance, here's what he
says about the word "mutual."

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.650
"Mutual does not mean 'shared,'
it means reciprocated.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.630
Dickens would have
better called his book,

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.380
'Our Common Friend.'" But then
when he comes to write his own

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.950
work, "The Victorians," he says,
"He saw Ralph Waldo Emerson

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.120
during the Americans visit to
England in the winter of 1848,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.480
and they spoke much of their
mutual friend Carlyle."

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.580
The next example
concerns the word

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.570
"involvement," where he says,
"The noun involvement is used

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.669
with equal lack of precision.

00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:55.710
There's no need to write
that Smith's involvement

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.570
in the crime is disputed
when one should say

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.622
that his part was disputed."

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:01.080
And here he is, in
"The Victorians"

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.020
again, "When the South London
Working Man's college was

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.750
established in 1868,
Huxley accepted

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.930
the role of honorary principal
in which he served until 1880,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.077
and where his involvement was
far from just ornamental."

00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:14.160
I've got one more example.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.720
I have tried to
restrain myself here.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.760
You can see I quite
enjoy doing this.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.410
I could have given
you loads more.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.870
The next one is on enormity.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.640
And here he says,
"An enormity is

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.270
something bad, a transgression,
not something big.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.580
One should speak not of
the enormity of the task

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.660
but of its enormousness, even if
one is president of the United

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.560
States."

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.810
That might seem like a
slightly bizarre thing to say,

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.268
but this is in
reference to the way

00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:41.940
that Barack Obama came under
fire from the usage police

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.150
after his presidential
acceptance speech in 2008,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.327
where he said he was humbled by
the enormity of the task ahead.

00:15:48.327 --> 00:15:50.160
And of course all the
headline writers said,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160
he's got it wrong.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.190
He should have said
"enormousness."

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.420
So even he can get it wrong, but
of course, so can Simon Heffer.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.960
"Moral Desperado," his biography
of Thomas Carlyle, where

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.000
he says, "Carlyle
was about to embark

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.070
on his first large-scale
literary project--

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.900
a life of Schiller,
was overwhelmed

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.020
by the enormity of the task."

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.810
Now, if even authors
of usage guides

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.350
don't follow the rules that
they themselves are advocating,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.990
we might wonder why they're
so concerned that everyone

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.750
else should, and why
does anybody bother

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.630
paying any attention to them?

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.170
I suspect that
part of the answer

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.840
lies in society's
tacit acceptance

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.400
that there are rights and wrongs
in all aspects of language use

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.460
and a desire to be safe
from embarrassment.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.330
So rather than question the
grounds for the prescription,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.350
we turn to the usage
pundits, just as we once

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.630
turned to our
schoolteachers in search

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.370
of guidance and certitude.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.610
Many of us, of course,
have fixed ideas

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.920
about proper language use.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.340
And we use those often
to identify people

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.920
that we deem to be, in even in
Moore's helpful formulation,

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.400
NLOs--

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.420
people who are "not like one."

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.910
Even though the rules that
we're often using are ones

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.920
that don't necessarily show any
relationship to actual usage.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.540
They've been passed down to us.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.280
We've taken them on.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.670
Although, I suspect few
of us go quite as far

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.920
as Brian Henderson, who gets
so incensed by people using

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.950
"comprised of"
that he's corrected

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.070
this supposed
misuse on Wikipedia

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.600
more than 47,000 times.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.280
Although, many
people would no doubt

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.800
consider the thousands
of hours that he admits

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.530
to having spent on this
crusade to be something

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.360
of a waste of time,
he would no doubt

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.570
win the approval of
Bill Bryson, who,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.740
in his dictionary of troublesome
words, says of "comprised of,"

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.230
"If you remember nothing
else from this book,

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.450
remember, at least,
that 'comprised of'

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.190
is always wrong."

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.590
Part of the attraction
then, I think, of statements

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.680
like these is that they
are black and white.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.830
A usage is either
right or wrong.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.710
And even better, like Brian
Henderson, once we know it,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.410
we can go around
correcting everyone

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.998
else who doesn't know it.

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:20.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.730
Now, probably the
classic feature

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.100
of English usage that's really
liable to raise the blood

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:32.510
pressure of those concerned with
correctness is the apostrophe.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.710
Yeah, I'm sensing already--

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.860
I can hear some grumbling in the
audience that already tells me

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.750
I'm on dodgy territory here.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.410
The former chief editor of the
Oxford English Dictionary, John

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.560
Simpson, in his recent
memoir, "The Word Detective,"

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.220
says of the apostrophe, "The
English are temperamentally

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.090
obsessed with the presence
or absence of apostrophes.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.450
It remains, for many people,
a divide between civilization

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.050
and chaos."

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.900
And indeed, in 2014,
when Cambridge Council

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.730
voted to abandon
apostrophes in street signs,

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.400
it prompted a rogue
grammar gorilla

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.510
to prowl the streets at night,
armed only with a black marker

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.260
pen.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.593
You probably can't even tell--
it's done so beautifully.

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.640
But these are some black
marker penned-in apostrophes

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.440
in Scholars' Walk
and Pepys' Court.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.500
And this led to
Cambridge Council

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.000
rapidly reversing the decision,
giving in to public pressure

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.170
and restoring the precious
apostrophe to the street

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.429
signs of Cambridge.

00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:39.970
Although, it's never
really explained

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.880
why if its Scholars'
Walk and Pepys' Place,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.156
it's "Fitzgerald's Place."

00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:46.780
There's not complete
consistency there.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.196
And of course, let's not even
go into whether it should be

00:19:49.196 --> 00:19:55.810
Pepys' apostrophe or
Pepy's-- apostrophe S.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.090
And in April 2017, the
media reported on the Banksy

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.510
of punctuation-- it's this
guy-- the self-styled grammar

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:09.040
vigilante who patrols the
streets of Bristol by night,

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.050
armed only with what he
calls his "apostrophizer--"

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.460
--which is basically
that long stick

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.380
with an apostrophe
on the end of it.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.580
And he goes around climbing
up ladders in pitch dark

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.210
and putting in missing
apostrophes into street signs

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.370
and shop signs.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.400
Now, for many people,
this punctuation crusader

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.940
is a hero--

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.830
bravely upholding standards in
a society that ceased to care.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.350
But for others, he
represents the unsavory side

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.340
of linguistic pedantry,
reveling in social snobbery

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.760
and one-upmanship.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.940
The apostrophe has long
been a polarizing issue

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.880
amongst otherwise
rational people.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.500
George Bernard
Shaw, for instance,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.230
who was a vocal critic
of English spelling

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.200
and left a fortune in
his will for somebody

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.220
to devise a whole new alphabet
to replace the Roman alphabet

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.200
with which English is written.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.400
He insisted on dropping all
apostrophes and so wrote

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.370
"can't" and "he's"
without apostrophes--

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.920
like that because, he
said, there is no--

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.570
"not the faintest
reason for persisting

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.450
in the ugly and silly
trick of peppering pages

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.690
with these uncouth bacilli."

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.530
Lewis Carroll, on
the other hand,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.400
was a big fan of
apostrophes and insisted

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.300
that the only correct spelling
of shan't and can't was,

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.660
as you see here, with additional
apostrophes to indicate

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.160
the proper contractions.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.120
Now, of course, many today
will happily omit apostrophes

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.680
in emails and tweets, but others
still insist on including it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.830
So for instance, the
self-appointed monitor

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:57.880
of Twitter posts, your or
you're simply retweets messages

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.440
where the two homophones
have been confused

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.510
and then adds "wrong" at
the beginning of them.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.840
When it comes to the serious
business of apostrophes,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.600
even the laid-back
lexicographers

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.170
of the Oxford English
Dictionary can lose their cool.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.870
So for instance, going back
to John Simpson's "Word

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.930
Detective," he describes
that when the Oxford English

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.540
Dictionary moved its
offices in Oxford

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.550
to a grand Georgian building on
St. Giles', considerable effort

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.060
was invested in researching
whether the headed notepaper

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.400
should read St.
Giles' apostrophe

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.290
or with no apostrophe.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.960
For all the time spent
consulting local records,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.380
newspapers, etymologists in
order to determine the correct

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.250
form was indeed St.
Giles' with an apostrophe.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.840
That's to show you that St.
Giles' Cafe knew it all along

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.570
and could have told
them for nothing.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.430
The lexicographers'
judgments, though,

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.860
have had little effect
on other businesses

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.810
on the streets and road signs--

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.290
so St. Giles-- without one.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.600
Missing apostrophes like these
are met with dismay and anger

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.330
by those concerned about
linguistic standards who

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.310
fear that such changes are
undermining our ability

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.210
to communicate.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.200
But is the apostrophe
really so crucial

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.210
to the well-being
of our society?

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.450
And would consigning it to
the dustbin really threaten

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.690
the future of our language
as a means of communication?

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:36.010
It's seldom recognized that
the apostrophe is, of course,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.770
just a feature of
the written language

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.840
with no spoken language
correspondence.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.710
So I'm talking to you now
using lots of contractions, not

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.150
apostrophes, and somehow
you're still understanding me.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.280
If we can do that
in speech, we might

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.560
wonder whether we could
do without it in writing.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.020
And in fact, the apostrophe
in the history of English

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.540
is a relatively
recent innovation.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.910
It was first introduced
into English printed books

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:08.380
in the 16th century to indicate
an elision or a contraction,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.260
as it does, of course, still
today in "she'll," and "can't,"

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.590
and "it's" for "it is."

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.320
And then, it was extended
in the 17th century

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.840
to indicate possession
in singular nouns--

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.890
like here-- the boy's,
apostrophe S, book,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.820
where the understanding
was that here, something

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.890
had been contracted or omitted.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.380
In this case, they thought
it was the third person

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.790
possessive pronoun "his."

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.310
The boy-- "his book"
had been abbreviated

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.570
to "the boy's book."

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.470
In fact, that's
completely wrong.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.040
The S ending here is
simply an inflectional

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.660
ending-- a generative ending.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.820
It goes back to an
earlier form of English

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:52.425
where it was much more heavily
used inflectional endings.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:53.800
But it sort of
made sense to them

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.620
because it was a contraction
to extend it in this way.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.840
And then, subsequently
in the 18th century,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.960
further confusion was introduced
when the apostrophe was

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.960
used for plural possessives,
putting it after to the S,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.410
where of course, nothing's
been omitted at all.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.840
And so as a consequence,
the apostrophe

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.830
has taken on two slightly
different and contradictory

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.390
roles to signal both elision
and now also possession.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.840
And of course it's that
contradiction that causes much

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.660
of today's confusion, most
notoriously, of course,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.420
in the distinction
between its and it's--

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.380
I-T- apostrophe S and I-T-S.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.880
Now, for Lynne Truss, the author
of "Eats, Shoots, and Leaves--

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.510
the Zero Tolerance Guide
to English Punctuation,"

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.360
the rules of its and it's
are extremely simple.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.410
And so the punishment
for breaking it

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.750
should be suitably brutal.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.060
And she says getting
your itses mixed up

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.730
is the greatest solecism
in the world punctuation.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.810
"No matter that you have a PhD
and read all of Henry James

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.450
twice, if you persist in writing
'good food at it's best,' you

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.320
deserve to be
struck by lightning,

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.110
hacked up on the spot, and
buried in an unmarked grave."

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.750
But since the apostrophe
can signal possession,

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.590
it is reasonable to assume that
the neuter possessive pronoun

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.150
"its" should also
have an apostrophe.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.050
And in fact, there's some
historical precedent here, too.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.210
Because the "its"
pronoun was first

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.210
introduced in English
in the 17th century

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.970
to replace the
earlier pronoun "his,"

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.130
which, rather
unhelpfully, overlapped

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.250
with the masculine possessive
pronoun, also "his."

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.840
And because it was formed by
taking the subject pronoun "it"

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:46.210
and adding the S
genitive singular ending,

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.520
the new pronoun was
indeed initially written

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.520
I-T- apostrophe S
for the possessive,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.447
just as it is here in the
first folio of Shakespeare

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:56.155
in "The Tempest."

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.990
Insecurity about where to
place the apostrophe increasing

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.230
leads to its omission.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.500
So we frequently find examples
where it's been left out,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.590
and then of course also
contexts in which it's

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.364
been added in unnecessarily.

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:14.030
And the most common
of these, of course,

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.970
is what's known as the
greengrocer's apostrophe, where

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:22.370
it's added before a plural S--

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.440
so-called the
greengrocer's apostrophe

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.300
because it's,
apparently, most commonly

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.930
used by greengrocers
advertising apples, and oranges,

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.770
and so on with
apostrophe S. There's

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.940
some historical justification
for this, however, also.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.810
So for instance,
here you can see

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.180
when foreign words were
borrowed into English

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.980
in the 18th century
ending in vowels,

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.167
it was very common to write
apostrophe S for the plural,

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.750
as you can see in
that example there--

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.940
"Handel's Opera's."

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.980
So these have some
historical justification

00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.260
and aren't necessarily just
straightforwardly errors.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.770
And of course, we still use the
apostrophe S when we're writing

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:08.210
plurals of things like P's
and Q's and do's and don'ts.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.890
But despite this, Lynne
Truss's zero-tolerance message

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.110
struck a chord with
a huge audience--

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.440
this is a massive bestseller,
"Easts, Shoots, and

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.400
Leaves," an audience who
saw her as the champion

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.670
of good English.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.900
The success of "Eats,
Shoots, and Leaves"

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.600
helps to highlight a
more cynical reason

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.880
for the constant stream
of books peddling

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.070
extreme prescriptivism,
and that is that it sells.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.270
The huge demand for
books of this kind

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.460
can be traced back
to the beginnings

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.822
of the prescriptive tradition
in the 18th century.

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.280
So up until that
point, it was just

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.220
a trickle of handbooks about
English grammar, spelling,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.980
and punctuation.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.000
But after the 18th century,
that was hugely increased.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.270
And in the 19th century,
there was a publication

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.850
of many of these kinds of
prescriptive usage guides

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.270
and grammars, including
ones with alluring titles

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.580
like these, "Poor letter H--

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.150
Its Use and Abuse Addressed
to its Little Vowels."

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.210
This is all about H dropping,
if you're aware of that concept.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.050
You know, where you say
"ow" instead of "how,"

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.460
"and" instead of "hand."

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.820
Again, a hugely sort
of divisive feature

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.190
of English pronunciation,
which we can trace back

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.230
to the 18th century,
where dropping your H's

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.450
is seen as being slovenly--

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.890
you don't care very much.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.100
You can't be bothered.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.120
You're lazy.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.640
You know, it's very
closely related

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:40.000
in the 19th century, the idea
of poor English and poor social

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.240
skills, being vulgar, and so on.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.820
And this one-- "Don't--

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.290
A Manual of Mistakes
and Improprieties More

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.500
or Less Prevalent in
Conduct and Speech."

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.650
There's a close association
here between good English

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.990
and good breeding
and the assumption

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.746
that making mistakes shows that
you're vulgar and slovenly.

00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:02.620
To give you a sort of
flavor of "Don't," I've

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.970
included a few examples here.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.770
You quite quickly pick
up the style of the book.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.930
It makes rather sort
of slow reading.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.720
"Don't speak ungrammatically.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.250
Study books of grammar and the
writings of the best authors.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.960
Don't pronounce incorrectly.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.600
Listen to the conversation
of cultivated people.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.330
And if in doubt, consult
the dictionaries.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.240
Don't notice in others
a slip in grammar

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.440
or a mispronunciation in a way
to cause blush or to offend.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.360
If you refer to
anything of the kind,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.722
do it courteously and not in
the hearing of other persons."

00:30:37.722 --> 00:30:39.430
That's one that I
think we probably still

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.510
could learn a bit from.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.200
Where electronic
usage today is often

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.480
seen as a forum in which
standards of grammar, spelling,

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.760
and punctuation are relaxed,
and where nonstandard usage

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.420
is tolerated or even encouraged,
sites like Twitter, Facebook,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.980
and Instagram are also used
as a means for sticklers

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.520
to find a wider audience for
the linguistic blunders they

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.480
find around them.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.510
So for instance, Twitter
accounts like this one--

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.130
Grammar Nazi.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.580
How many of you
follow Grammar Nazi?

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.650
Incidentally,
Grammar Nazi must be

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.380
one of the few areas
left in society where

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.500
it's socially acceptable
to self-identify as a Nazi.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.860
Many people use that
in their Twitter bios.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.732
But these kinds of
sites, of course,

00:31:27.732 --> 00:31:29.940
seldom take account of the
fact that the perpetrators

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.340
of the errors that
they are shaming

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.030
are often non-native speakers
of English or people with access

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.610
to fewer educational
standards and opportunities

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.260
than themselves.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.650
Donald Trump's
notorious misspellings,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.510
as are sort of heralded
here-- so these

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.120
are examples like-- my next
slide has a few of these.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.330
You probably see many more--

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:54.360
"payed," "tapp," "honered,"
"dummer," "unpresidented--"

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.440
that's quite a nice one--

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.930
--hearby-- sort of Freudian.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.270
Now, these, of course,
might seem like fair game.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.060
But here, we run
the risk, I think,

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.030
of falling into the same trap
as the "Radio 4" discussion

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.070
over the correct
meaning of fulsome.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.920
Does it matter that the most
powerful man in the world

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.040
can't spell or can't be
bothered to use a dictionary?

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.102
Well, maybe, but
surely not as much

00:32:24.102 --> 00:32:25.560
as his attitude to
the Middle East,

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.270
or North Korea, or global
warming, or human rights,

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.320
and so on.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.300
Our love for correcting others
is epitomized in the success

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.760
of T-shirts like this one--

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.600
"I'm silently correcting
your grammar."

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.550
Now, of course,
since many people--

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.370
speakers of English
use regional dialects,

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.200
this is often simply
a way of engaging

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.050
in regional and social snobbery.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.960
While the term
"dialect" is popularly

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.620
employed to refer to
a nonstandard or even

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.720
substandard form of the
language, for linguists,

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.410
the term is actually neutral.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.690
So standard English
is simply just one

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.970
of the dialects of
English, albeit one

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.210
that's been accorded greater
social status, whereas we tend

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.790
to think very often
as standard English

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.390
being above all the other
dialects of English.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.440
It's that recognition that all
dialects are linguistically

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.890
important that prompted an
American linguist to produce

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.550
a rival T-shirt.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:32.720
And this says, "Not judging your
grammar, just analysing it."

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.520
But this has provoked unease,
even amongst its supporters.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.780
So one US tweeter found herself
in support of the sentiment

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.390
but unable to wear
the T-shirt because it

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.390
uses the British English
spelling of analyzing--

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:54.650
that's with the S rather than a
Z. You see how difficult it is?

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.390
Comments like these,
I think, remind us

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.130
that however tolerant
we might like

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.580
to think we are about
linguistic variation,

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.000
we all have our own pet peeves
and linguistic bugbears.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.820
So even professional linguists
could be guilty of this.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.790
So Deborah Cameron, the
author of an important study

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:16.050
of linguistic prescriptivism
called "Verbal Hygiene,"

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.489
says that when--

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.389
while she has learned to
overcome knee-jerk judgments

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.610
that are inappropriate
in her field,

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.380
she still finds
herself sensitive

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.989
to particular solecisms.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.469
"I can choose to suppress the
irritation I feel when I see,

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.837
for example, a sign
that reads potatoe's"--

00:34:33.837 --> 00:34:35.670
there's the greengrocer's
apostrophe again--

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.080
"I cannot choose
not to feel it."

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.960
See how sort of ingrained
these ideas are?

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.280
And you can see
from the next slide

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.100
not everyone feels
the same restraint.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.090
Are you that person that always
has that marker pen on you

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:51.900
just in case?

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.300
Part of the reason
for our unwillingness

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:02.520
to accept the changing meanings
of words like "fulsome"

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.560
and the demise of
the apostrophe is

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.740
that we've taken the trouble
to learn the rules surrounding

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.160
their use and so have
considerable investment

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.330
in ensuring that other people
are obliged to observe them.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.330
And that applies also
to the complexities

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.290
of English spelling.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.950
So we might tacitly acknowledge,
with its silent letters

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.029
and erratic relationship
to pronunciation,

00:35:26.029 --> 00:35:27.570
the English spelling
isn't a terribly

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.590
efficient and effective way of
conveying the English language.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.400
But because we have
spent and invested

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.690
so much time in learning it, we
feel rather judgmental of those

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.660
who make spelling mistakes.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.840
And here, I'm going to give
you a quick spelling test, OK?

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.550
And how do you spell
the word supersede?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.310
I'll give you a moment to
think about that-- supersede--

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:57.780
S-U-P-E-R-- and then I want to
know whether you'd say S-E-D-E

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.750
or C-E-D-E?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.050
[MIXED CROWD RESPONSE]

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:06.460
So let's say hands
up for the C. OK.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.270
Most people.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.290
Hands up for the S?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.430
OK, it's actually S.
Interesting, isn't it?

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.750
Interesting.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.850
The reason for this is that
it comes back to etymology.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.400
And the word "supersede"
goes back to the Latin,

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.440
supersedere--

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.690
to sit on top of, literally--
superseding something--

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.220
sits on top of it.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.410
Whereas those of you
who thought it was a C

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.879
probably were thinking of
words like recede, intercede,

00:36:34.879 --> 00:36:37.420
and precede, which actually have
a different Latin etymology.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.030
They come from the
verb cedere, to go.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.460
Now, the reason I
used this example

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.612
is because so many people
get it wrong, in fact.

00:36:46.612 --> 00:36:49.070
If you got it wrong, you were
in the majority in this room,

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.440
but also in all the times
I've asked this question.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.590
And what it makes me
wonder is, does that

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.440
mean that many people don't
know how to spell and need

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.360
to go back to school and learn?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.880
Or does it mean that
the spelling of the word

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.950
"supersede" is
actually changing?

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.830
More people are spelling it
with a C rather than an S.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.484
Now, you might
also argue that it

00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:14.900
would be better
if we did spell it

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.485
that way because it fits
more with recede, intercede,

00:37:19.485 --> 00:37:19.985
and precede.

00:37:19.985 --> 00:37:22.400
It's a more logical
spelling of the language.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.200
Do we need to preserve those
etymological distinctions,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.650
which, after all, don't
really mean very much

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.345
for modern uses of English?

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:33.310
I know, from
personal experience,

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.620
people are very
hostile to the idea

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.960
that spelling should be
allowed to change over time.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.550
It's probably the
area of the language

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.940
that people feel most invested
in the ideas of correctness.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.310
There's only one correct
way to spell a word.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.500
But in fact, evidence
that this word might

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.030
be changing its meaning--

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.280
in the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.060
"supercede" with a C is
a variant of "supersede."

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.101
Seems as if it's
becoming more acceptable.

00:37:58.101 --> 00:38:00.100
For those of you who did
get it right and think,

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.030
that's just wrong, you'll be
glad to see that the Oxford

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.610
Dictionary online says it's
generally regarded as an error.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.740
Although, notice, generally
regarded as an error--

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.110
is that sort of opening
the door to the possibility

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.090
that that might change in time?

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.580
Well, as I said, people are
very hostile to this idea.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.520
I suggested this when I did a
test of the audience at the Hay

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.875
Festival a few years
ago on this exact word,

00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:25.750
and then suggested that
perhaps this word was

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.860
changing its spelling.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.140
I found myself the next
day front page news

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.140
all over the world bizarrely.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:37.000
Here's a particular headline
I enjoyed in Oxford--

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.260
accused of single-handedly
lowering literacy expectations

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.000
amongst primary school children
all over the country and so on.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.810
We might wonder whether the
increasing development of

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.670
and adoption of
emojis, though, which

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.790
allow speakers to communicate
without the need for language,

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.500
means that we'll no
longer need to learn

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.670
to spell and cease to
communicate in English at all.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.090
I put the winky face emoji there
to tell you I'm just joking.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.430
Don't worry.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:07.960
But am I, actually?

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.020
Because there are, after all,
a billion users of English

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.180
in the world today, but
that number is positively

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.730
dwarfed by the number of
people who have a smartphone

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.090
and who use emojis.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.390
And in fact, emoji use
has expanded to the extent

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.610
now that it's common
for entire messages

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.010
to be conveyed
using these symbols,

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.890
enabling them to be understood
by speakers of any language.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.750
So here's an example from Andy
Murray's wedding day tweet,

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.690
where he describes what happened
to him on his wedding day

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.760
using emojis.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.530
Now, it's relatively easy
to decode this message,

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.450
given the typical
wedding day involves

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.400
a number of conventional,
formulaic activities.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.700
It's harder when the message
is written entirely in emoji

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.892
and completely decontextualized.

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:55.350
And to give you an
example of that,

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:59.410
here are two opening sentences
from famous novels written

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.640
in emoji.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.310
Any ideas what the first one is?

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.310
AUDIENCE: Best of times.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.820
SIMON HOROBIN: Best of
times, the worst of times.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.190
Yeah, loses a little bit
in translation, doesn't it?

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.770
But I'll go down
to the second one.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:11.970
AUDIENCE: "Pride and Prejudice."

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.970
SIMON HOROBIN: "Pride
and Prejudice."

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:13.710
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.480
That's right.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.190
There's a truth
universally acknowledged

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.170
that a man in possession
of a good fortune

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.360
must be in need of a wife.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.380
But where the use of emoji has
grown out of a radical move

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.500
to shake off the constraints
of written language,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.500
users remain restricted by
the numbers and types of emoji

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.550
available.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.690
And release of new
emoji, of course,

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:38.340
subject to the approval
of the Unicode Consortium,

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.980
which is a kind of linguistic
Academy, I suppose.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.120
And decisions like these are
typically rather contentious,

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.170
given the lack of representation
of certain ethnic groups,

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.190
their cultures, and religions.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.410
And it only recently has
been possible to choose

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.470
from a range of skin tones
and the official uses--

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.620
a kind of dictionary
of etymology

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.320
set out in the
emoji PDF database.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.360
While recent updates
have enabled greater

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.630
cultural diversity, the
representation of foods,

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.670
and clothes, and
places of worship

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.950
still remain highly westernized.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.750
However representative
emoji become,

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.810
it's not possible to legislate
for the cultural sensitivity

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.370
of the user, either.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.350
So for instance, the
pine decoration emoji,

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.040
which represents
kadomatsu, placed

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.040
at the front of Japanese
homes at New Year

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.430
to welcome the spirits in the
hope of a plentiful harvest,

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.210
is regularly used in the
West as an offensive gesture.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.490
There's not much you
can do about that.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.000
The creativity with which
users repurpose emojis

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.550
is further apparent from
the surprising success

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.520
of the aubergine
or eggplant emoji

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.570
amongst sexting teenagers, which
prompted Instagram to ban it

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.090
from their searching facility.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.050
And the success of the
suggestive connotations

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.010
of the aubergine
emoji has even led

00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:00.300
to the establishment
of eggplantmale.com,

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.790
a company that allows you
to send a personalized

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:07.710
message on an aubergine
anywhere in the world.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.260
But I don't think there's
any danger of emoji replacing

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.960
English as the global language.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.590
It would need a vastly
increased number of characters.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.860
Most significantly, it
lacks the grammatical rules

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.020
that are necessary for
the formation of more

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.070
complex constructions.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.240
And that claim might
seem to be undermined

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.780
by the appearance, recently,
of the entirety of Herman

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.730
Melville's novel
"Moby Dick" in emoji--

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.970
"Emogi Dick," as it's known.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.304
The entire novel has been
translated for you into emoji.

00:42:38.304 --> 00:42:39.970
And you might think,
well, in that case,

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.880
if you can do "Moby
Dick," then surely we

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.380
can do basic conversation.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.930
But it seems to me that a glance
at the resulting translation

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.844
highlights the
limitations of the format.

00:42:50.844 --> 00:42:53.010
So for instance, you can
see here the famous opening

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.830
sentence, "Call me
Ishmael" represented

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:59.230
by a telephone, a man with
a mustache, a boat, a whale,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.960
and an OK sign.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.690
Doesn't quite do it for me.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.230
So in conclusion, then, the
future of the English language

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.510
seems assured, but
it's likely to be

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.350
a future of multiple Englishes,
as new technologies emerge

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.605
and as new users continue
to adopt it and adapt

00:43:16.605 --> 00:43:18.900
it to suit a wide
range of functions

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.550
across the English
speaking globe.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.642
Thank you.

00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:24.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.170
SPEAKER: Thank you, Simon.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.727
We've got time for
a few questions.

00:43:33.727 --> 00:43:36.393
So if you put your hand up, I'll
try to get to you with the mic.

00:43:41.323 --> 00:43:46.330
AUDIENCE: Hey, so we've got
all the options with operating

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.040
systems and in our
phones and whatnot

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.250
to add misspelled
words to dictionary

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.170
so that it won't
constantly remind us

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.630
that we're misspelling things.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.910
Do you get any data
from any of that

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:02.120
to see trends of what's
changing in what you do?

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.740
SIMON HOROBIN: Oxford
Dictionary collects all of that,

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.190
but they collect it from the
perspective of what people

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.660
type into the online
dictionary searching capacity--

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.630
so the number of times that
people search for a word

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.710
and misspell it.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.680
So for instance, they've
put data on how many times

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.950
people are entering "supersede"
with the supposed incorrect

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:24.820
spelling.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.790
So that kind of data
I've seen, but not

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.160
precisely what you are asking.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.327
But that's very interesting.

00:44:30.327 --> 00:44:31.993
That's the sort of
thing-- you're right.

00:44:31.993 --> 00:44:34.270
That would be interesting
to capture more of

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.740
and see the total.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.920
Because of course,
a lot of what--

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.410
the reason why people think
of spelling as being so fixed

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.940
is that what we're
mostly used to seeing

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.070
and what dictionaries are used
to seeing is published texts,

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.486
which has rather
artificially gone

00:44:46.486 --> 00:44:49.690
through a whole process of
auto correcting, proofreading,

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.706
copyediting, and so on,
where people are spending

00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:55.330
laborious amounts of time trying
to ensure that the spelling is

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:55.984
all correct.

00:44:55.984 --> 00:44:57.900
And where, of course,
when people are actually

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.780
writing by hand or typing
things in without checking it,

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.765
very often, of course,
we get things wrong.

00:45:03.765 --> 00:45:05.440
AUDIENCE: How many
of these challenges

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.750
are unique to English, and how
many apply to all languages?

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.220
SIMON HOROBIN:
Interesting question.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.886
I mean, all languages change.

00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:16.010
All languages that are
spoken and used are changed.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.426
Of course, the
ones that don't are

00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:19.780
sort of fixed, dead languages
like Latin, for instance.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.240
So all languages are
changing that are being used.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.450
But of course, English,
what it has particularly is

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.220
the way that English
is growing today,

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.400
in terms of new speakers,
are people using it

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.300
as a second language.

00:45:34.204 --> 00:45:35.620
I mean, it's not
unique to English

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.161
because that's true
of, say, Spanish,

00:45:37.161 --> 00:45:40.240
too, but the large percentage
of people that are requiring it

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.610
as second language--
and therefore it's

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.810
being sort of learned
in different ways.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.930
And it is then
coming into contact

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.920
with a much wider range of
different languages spoken

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.060
by different people.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.310
That's causing all kinds of
new forms of English to emerge.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.340
So for instance,
English in South Asia,

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.910
where it's a big growth area--

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.870
we've got things like
Singlish, where it's English,

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.850
but it's spoken
by people who also

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.351
speak Mandarin, who
also use a variety

00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:08.350
of different languages--

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.099
Malay and so on-- that
are borrowing words

00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:11.650
from those other
language they speak.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.600
And so what we're seeing is
new forms of English emerging.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.220
Is that a form of English,
or is it a form of Singlish,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.440
or is it something
else in between?

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.220
Sometimes they're
called interlanguages.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.790
And so I think that's sort of
unique to English in the sense

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:28.134
that it's such a
global language.

00:46:28.134 --> 00:46:29.550
AUDIENCE: You
touched a little bit

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.400
on how you might
correct somebody

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.860
if you hear something wrong.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.610
If I was to say to you, can
I lend that pen off you?

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.778
What would you say, and
how would you handle it?

00:46:41.778 --> 00:46:44.730
SIMON HOROBIN: Yeah,
that's an interesting one.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:50.160
So again, that, to me,
is a dialect usage.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.860
So it's quite common in
some dialects of English

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.780
to use the word
"lend" to mean borrow.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.380
There are other languages
where the same word-- sorry?

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.410
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.350
Yeah, in Wales that's
certainly fine.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.870
SIMON HOROBIN: Yeah, so I
would take the perspective

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.950
that that's a dialect usage.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.050
And therefore,
it's wrong in terms

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.810
of if I take the standard
English as the correct form

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.630
of the language.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.322
But if you spoke it, you
are speaking a dialect,

00:47:19.322 --> 00:47:20.780
and there's no
compulsion on people

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.440
to speak standard English.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.210
Often that is what
people are saying--

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.920
is that what you're
saying is wrong

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.300
because it's not standard.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.008
But actually, we're
only really compelled

00:47:31.008 --> 00:47:32.150
to write standard English.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.910
If you wrote that, then that
might be more problematic.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.300
So if a student put that in
an essay to me for instance,

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.890
I would have to correct
it on the grounds

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.120
that I'm trying to
make sure that they're

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.290
writing in standard English.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.840
But if they said
it to me, then I'd

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.423
be inclined to just let it go,
because it's just their dialect

00:47:46.423 --> 00:47:47.040
form.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:48.340
I'll let my mother know.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.418
SIMON HOROBIN: Right.

00:47:49.418 --> 00:47:52.694
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:52.694 --> 00:47:53.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.800
I could perhaps ask--

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:59.630
from the Polish language,
sometimes the word

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.304
is written in one
way, and it's supposed

00:48:01.304 --> 00:48:02.720
to be read in that
way, but people

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.240
start using a letter that
actually doesn't exist

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.650
or a sound that
actually doesn't exist.

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:09.350
Why do people do this?

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.680
I can give an example.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.950
We have a word [NON-ENGLISH],,
which means to turn something

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:14.450
on.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:18.750
And people say, [NON-ENGLISH]
and such letter doesn't exist.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.530
How does it happen?

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.980
Can you stop this?

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.880
SIMON HOROBIN: I'm not sure
whether that's something

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.720
that's particular to Polish.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.410
But I mean, changes
in pronunciation

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.950
happen all the time.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.610
They're often driven
by people assuming

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.690
that what you're doing when
you're pronouncing a word

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.290
is you are following the
spelling quite closely.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.000
And so the history of
English quite often

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.780
is the emergence of
spelling pronunciations,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.820
partly because,
particularly in English,

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.200
literacy is seen as
such an important thing.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.666
So that's why H dropping, for
instance, is so frowned upon.

00:49:00.666 --> 00:49:02.290
Because if the word
is spelt with an H,

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.894
you have to pronounce
the H. That's

00:49:04.894 --> 00:49:06.060
getting it wrong way around.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.590
Because speech comes
way before writing.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.820
And there's no reason why speech
should be based upon writing.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.480
But in a literate
society, it's often

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.256
seen as that's the correct--

00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:16.630
so it might be
that that's what's

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.810
happening is people are sort
of going back to the spelling

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.330
and then producing
a new pronunciation.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:26.146
Because they're trying to
closely represent what's there.

00:49:29.055 --> 00:49:30.430
No, I can't do
anything about it.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.850
I should just add that.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.762
SPEAKER: I'll take two
more questions, quickly.

00:49:37.762 --> 00:49:40.510
AUDIENCE: In the
beginning of your book,

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.610
you show how the language
changed over, I think,

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:46.000
the past four, five, six years.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.480
And some words are totally--

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.200
you can't understand them, and
you write in current English

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.830
how it is.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.430
I know you don't have a crystal
ball, but what do you think--

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.330
how many 100 years
will take for people

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.450
in the future looking
back how we speak today--

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.740
that that will be totally
understandable like

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:10.990
in the beginning of your book?

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.900
SIMON HOROBIN: Yeah.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.970
You know, that's an
interesting question.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.594
Because it's certainly true that
if you go back to Old English,

00:50:15.594 --> 00:50:17.440
the earliest recorded
form of English,

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.400
which is going back
to seventh century,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.360
is that some of the
earliest written records--

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.800
but anything between then
and about the year 1000.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.860
The language that-- how it
looked at that point cannot be

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.110
understood by a modern English
speaker without the aid

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.310
of special study
and a dictionary.

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.520
So the language has
changed that radically.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.890
But in fact, if you go to the
period from, say, about 1500--

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:46.360
so if you've ever read the
works of Chaucer, for instance,

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.010
that's much closer
to modern English.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.010
And probably looking
up a few words,

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.610
you could make some sense of it.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.840
So I think that there was a
particularly radical change

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.550
that happened around
about the year 1000

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.130
to English, which has meant
that it's now completely

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.774
unrecognizable to us.

00:51:01.774 --> 00:51:03.190
And part of the
reason for that is

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.490
to do with the Norman
Conquest, which--

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.675
the influx of French
speakers and so on.

00:51:08.675 --> 00:51:10.050
So the language
has changed less.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.176
It's sort of slowed down.

00:51:11.176 --> 00:51:12.550
So I don't think
it's going to be

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.350
quite as radical in the future.

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:16.390
But the other factor
is, of course,

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.390
standardization, which is
an artificial process that

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.600
stops the language changing.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.960
It's a break, as it were.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.110
Naturally, English would
change much more in speech.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:27.736
But of course, we
often say to children

00:51:27.736 --> 00:51:29.735
when they're learning the
language, no, no, it's

00:51:29.735 --> 00:51:30.370
not foots.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.210
It's feet.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.480
You know, we've artificially
constrained that.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.780
You'd naturally produce
that form first,

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.220
but we tell them it's incorrect.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:44.110
And that slowed it down and made
the changes much less radical.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.090
So that partly is
an answer to say,

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.160
I don't think it will
change as radically as

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.402
if we look back 1,000 years.

00:51:49.402 --> 00:51:51.610
The other thing is, though,
that technology is what's

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.200
driving language change today.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.740
And you know better
than I do what

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.680
the future is for technology.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.830
In the 15th century,
the printing press

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.540
was introduced, which
slowed everything

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.030
down and standardized-- made
standardization possible.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:11.770
Now, you could say
that technology

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.980
is driving a destandardization,
promoting variation

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.920
so that, in fact--
that could sort of mean

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.350
that standard English will
start to be threatened

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:23.015
and language will change
much more obviously.

00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:24.640
AUDIENCE: Your talk
was so interesting.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.160
Thank you.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.550
I'm just wondering, OK,
clearly you're telling us to be

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.008
a little bit more relaxed-- or
me to be more relaxed than I

00:52:30.008 --> 00:52:30.520
have been--

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.780
SIMON HOROBIN: It
wasn't you, personally--

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:31.930
AUDIENCE: Apostrophes--

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:34.240
SIMON HOROBIN: If you
felt it was for you--

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:34.950
AUDIENCE: --spelling
and things like that.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.400
But at what point
do you think we

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.790
do need to be worried
about sort of descending

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.040
into kind of "1984,"
a doublespeak world

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.290
where we no longer--

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.120
we lose the concept
of what is true,

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.762
because language becomes so--

00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:48.970
completely kind of falsified?

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:52.550
It's the Ivanka Trump complicit
means blah, blah, blah.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.875
At what point do your sort
of alarm bells go off?

00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:57.250
And do you think,
actually, we do

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.440
need to object to
this because we are

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.726
at risk of sliding into "1984"?

00:53:02.726 --> 00:53:05.440
SIMON HOROBIN: I think in
terms of the idea that--

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.557
it's often said that's
all fine, but what

00:53:08.557 --> 00:53:11.140
about when we cease to be able
to communicate with each other?

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.150
When things have gone
down to that stage?

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.010
But of course
language is primarily

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:16.960
a system of
communication, so it has

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.630
its own methods of
controlling that and stopping

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.680
that happening.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.250
So when you know confusion
genuinely sets in,

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.650
then there are ways in which
language will self-regulate.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:29.110
So I don't think it needs that
kind of external regulation

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:31.690
to stop it, because
the speakers themselves

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.760
tend to work that out--

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.660
so where there is like two
words that really conflict

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.710
with each other, what happens
is one usually falls out of use

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.540
or becomes very specialized.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.630
So in that sense, I don't think
we need to interfere with it.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.720
But having said
that, there's also

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.050
the fact that, for instance,
with me, when my students turn

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.500
in essays, I'm still obliged
to tell them, this is right;

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.790
this is wrong.

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.130
And it certainly would be a
dereliction of duty to say,

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:01.990
don't worry about it.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.502
Don't get so hung up
on apostrophes, guys.

00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:05.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.510
Because ultimately,
they're going out

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:10.060
into the world of work where
they will be judged on that.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.680
That is right or wrong.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.135
People do judge you
in your language use.

00:54:14.135 --> 00:54:15.510
That's just the
way of the world.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.310
So in that sense, those
two things are in conflict,

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:19.275
I would say.

00:54:19.275 --> 00:54:20.950
And as long as there
are dictionaries

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:23.860
producing authoritative
statements about correct usage,

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.320
I think that helps, in a
sense-- but I mean, that bigger

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.300
question about
redefining words--

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.980
and that's a very
live one, I think.

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.480
SPEAKER: Thank you
very much, Simon.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.420
That was very fascinating
and great fun.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.770
